Almost ten months have passed since the euro was successfully introduced and the European Central Bank took over full operational responsibility for the single monetary policy. Many of us feel that, with the launch of the single currency, the process of European integration has gained a new quality. Indeed, the transfer of a core competency of the modern state, namely monetary policy, to a truly European and independent organisation such as the ECB must be regarded as a historic event which marks an unprecedented degree of economic and political integration within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The smooth transition to this new era of European integration and the successful operational start of the ECB was the outcome of several years of intense and thorough preparation. The Annual Report of the ECB gives a detailed account both of the final preparatory work conducted by the Eurosystem in the run-up to the introduction of the single currency and of the main economic and monetary developments within the European Union in 1998 and in the first few weeks of 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the information contained in the annual report is of a self-explanatory nature, it might be more useful if I concentrate my remarks here and now on some of the issues addressed by the draft resolution prepared by your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. After that I shall be happy to answer any questions you might have.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start by commenting on the discharge of the ECB’s accountability <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the European Parliament. The Treaty establishing the European Community contains various provisions to ensure the democratic accountability of the ECB, one of the cornerstones of which is certainly the presentation of the Annual Report to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. However, apart from this annual exercise, the ECB and the European Parliament have established several other contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">First and possibly most importantly, I should like to mention the regular hearings held by the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Within the scope of these hearings, which – in line with the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure – take place on a quarterly basis, I provide detailed explanations regarding both our assessment of current economic and monetary developments and the decisions taken by the ECB. Transcripts of these hearings are published on the websites of both the European Parliament and the ECB. Moreover, the European Parliament has invited members of the Executive Board of the ECB and of the staff to participate in additional hearings on a number of specific issues, including the external representation of the Eurosystem, the preparation of euro banknotes and statistical matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the ECB also had the opportunity to welcome delegations of members of the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to its premises in Frankfurt. We attach great importance to these visits and will be pleased to continue to host such events. However, since these visits to the ECB are of a more informal nature, it goes without saying that they have to be considered as an additional tool for communication between the two institutions and cannot be seen as a substitute for regular public hearings at the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In setting up its communication policy, the Central Bank decided to go beyond the transparency requirements of the Treaty. Thus, while the Treaty requires the ECB to publish a quarterly report on its activities, the ECB has decided to publish such a report on a monthly basis, the Monthly Bulletin, which gives a detailed presentation of economic and monetary developments.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are a number of other communication tools that the ECB regularly uses. First, let me mention the extended press conferences that the Vice-President and I hold immediately after the first meeting of the Governing Council every month, transcripts of which – including transcripts of the questions and answer session are also accessible via the ECB’s website. You, of course, are aware of the broad range of publications that the ECB has issued on specific subjects related to its fields of responsibility. Our communication policy gives clear priority to maintaining and enhancing the credibility of the Eurosystem and confidence in the euro, both of which – credibility and confidence – are crucial elements in the successful conduct of monetary policy. In this context, one should always bear in mind the fact that the Governing Council acts as a collegial body, and that all decisions have to be communicated to the public in a clear and consistent way. Speaking a common language is particularly important for a central bank operating in a monetary union comprising several countries. Contradictory indications about the decisions taken by the ECB and the underlying reasons might trigger unwarranted market expectations and increase uncertainty, thereby running counter to the very objective of being transparent with regard to the conduct of monetary policy. I should like to stress that the information provided at the press conferences held after the meetings of the Governing Council, together with the analysis contained both in the ECB Monthly Bulletin and in the other channels of communication comes very close, in substance, to the publication of “summary minutes”. In view of the broad variety of publicly available information issued by the ECB, it is my firm belief and conviction that the ECB can stand comparison with other central banks in the field of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should also like to comment briefly on the request to publish the ECB’s internal forecasts. First, it would, at this moment, clearly be premature to consider such a step since the Eurosystem – that is, the ECB and the eleven national central banks – has yet to gain experience with its forecasts. More time will be needed before we can assume that all the technical issues have been addressed properly, and the publication of forecasts can be considered without endangering the ECB’s credibility. I am confident, however, that we can achieve this in the course of next year. Let me also emphasise that the role of the ECB’s internal forecasts in the decision-making process should not be overestimated. Such forecasts constitute one piece of information made available to the Governing Council, but certainly not the only one. The role of our internal forecasts within the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem therefore differs from the role of inflation forecasts in a strategy of direct inflation targeting. Finally, I should like to recall that the Monthly Bulletin – especially in its extended quarterly version – provides a forward-looking analysis, including reviews of the outlook for price developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB has also been asked to publish reports featuring national data relating to countries participating in the euro area. The publication of such data, however, would, in our view, be misleading since the single monetary policy cannot be directed at country-specific situations. On the contrary, the Eurosystem must take a euro area-wide perspective in its assessment of the economic situation in general and the outlook for price stability in particular. Publication by the ECB of detailed reports for each country participating in the euro area would run counter to the necessary creation of an area-wide perspective in the conduct, discussion and thinking of monetary policy. However, it should be recognised that the national central banks of the Eurosystem continue to produce their own regular reports that address national economic and financial developments in some detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like briefly to expand upon another issue which I know is of fundamental concern to the European Parliament, namely the contribution of monetary policy to the general economic policies in the Community. The Treaty provides for a fundamentally sound allocation of objectives and policy instruments between the monetary and governmental authorities in Europe. The Eurosystem is responsible for maintaining price stability. To this end, the Eurosystem has adopted a monetary policy strategy that is forward-looking and acts promptly to address threats to price stability. The Treaty also states that, without prejudice to its primary objective of price stability, the Eurosystem shall support the general economic policies in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">By maintaining price stability, it is our firm belief monetary policy makes the best contribution it can to achieving a high level of output and employment in the medium-term. Price stability has beneficial effects on general economic performance – including growth and employment prospects – through many channels, of which I should like to mention the following.</p>
<p class="contents">First, in an environment of price stability, the market mechanism will allocate resources more efficiently to their most productive uses. Markets function most effectively when relative price signals are not distorted by fluctuations in the general price level.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, a climate of price stability reduces the inflation risk premia in interest rates, particularly in longer-term rates, and thereby improves the conditions for financing investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, lasting price stability serves the interests of social justice and helps to protect the weakest members of our society, such as pensioners and the unemployed, who depend on fixed incomes and who cannot protect themselves against the costs of inflation with other assets, such as property or shares.</p>
<p class="contents">Broad agreement exists that there is no long-term trade-off between price stability and economic growth. Attempting to use monetary policy to raise real economic activity above its sustainable level will, in the long run, simply lead to ever higher inflation, but not to faster economic growth. Such an attempt would simply forfeit the benefits of stable prices, which I have just outlined, and would therefore prejudice growth and employment prospects over the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">While the contribution it makes through maintaining price stability must not be overlooked, monetary policy clearly cannot solve the serious structural unemployment problem in the euro area. Other policy areas have the instruments needed and are thus responsible for solving the structural problems. Decisive action in this field is certainly required to improve growth and employment prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">Safeguarding sound government finances is a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and achieving strong sustainable growth which is conducive to employment creation. In this context, the Stability and Growth Pact sets the right incentives for the conduct of sound and disciplined fiscal policies across all participating Member States. In addition, structural reforms in labour and goods markets, as well as a moderate development of wage costs, can best address the root causes of currently high unemployment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The clear division of policy responsibilities I have just described enhances the credibility of monetary and economic policies in Europe, increases transparency and facilitates accountability. It provides the proper incentives for the policy-makers in individual policy areas. If all parties concerned respect the fundamental allocation of these responsibilities and act accordingly, the achievement of the objectives of all policy areas will be the natural outcome of their individual policy choices.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard the Eurosystem supports the idea of a dialogue between monetary policy and other policy areas in the form of an open exchange of information. However, such a dialogue should be clearly distinguished from any attempts to coordinate policies <span class="italic">ex ante</span>, so as to achieve a certain “policy mix”, which would blur the fundamental responsibilities I described. Such coordination would tend to decrease accountability, reduce the transparency of the policy framework for the public and increase uncertainty about policy actions, potentially threatening to destabilise the economy. Finally, the debate on a “balanced and appropriate policy mix” should not be used to deflect attention from the structural reforms that are so urgently needed to address the euro area’s serious structural unemployment problem.</p>
<p class="contents">One other matter, which is addressed by your committee is the ECB’s contribution to financial stability, and in particular the question of the provision of emergency liquidity to financial institutions in distress. Allow me to explain some of our main considerations in this regard. The main guiding principle within the Eurosystem with reference to the provision of emergency liquidity to individual financial institutions is that the competent national central bank would be responsible for providing such assistance to those institutions operating within its jurisdiction. The ECB does, however, have to be informed of this in a timely manner. In addition, in operations of relevance to the single monetary policy, the decision-making bodies of the Eurosystem will be involved in assessing the compatibility of the envisaged operations with the pursuit of monetary stability. In the case of a general liquidity crisis resulting from a gridlock in the payment system, for instance, the direct involvement of the Eurosystem could be expected.</p>
<p class="contents">For the markets it would be sufficient to know that there is a clearly articulated capability and willingness to act if really necessary. It is not common practice amongst central banks to disclose the conditions and practicalities of emergency liquidity assistance arrangements. In particular, there are typically no official documents describing the conditions under which emergency liquidity would be extended or what procedures would be followed. Indeed, ex ante commitments would be counter-productive in this field, since they would restrict the ability of the central bank to act to contain systemic disturbances with unforeseen features. Moreover, this policy of “constructive ambiguity” can limit the associated problem of moral hazard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to turn to a different issue which has also been raised by the European Parliament on several occasions, namely the question of cross-border retail payment services in the euro area. The ECB is aware of the criticism that has been expressed with reference to the low level of efficiency and high costs involved in the processing of such payments and it fully shares the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in this regard. The current situation is particularly unsatisfactory in the area of cross-border credit transfers, whereas the situation in the area of cross-border card-based payments raises fewer concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, one of the basic tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem by the Treaty is the promotion of the smooth functioning of payment systems. However, the involvement of central banks in retail payment systems is, in general, less pronounced than in large-value payment systems, mainly because retail payment systems entail significantly lower systemic risks. Nevertheless, the Eurosystem is concerned with efficiency issues related to cross-border retail payments.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the performance of cross-border retail payment systems is clearly lagging behind the policy objectives of Economic and Monetary Union and, indeed, behind the expectations of many European citizens and small enterprises. After the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002, these differences in service levels for national and cross-border payments within the single currency area will become even more apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the ECB strongly advocates the creation of a single payment area in order fully to reap the benefits of the single currency. In order to give a clear signal to the banking industry and the public, the ECB published a number of objectives in September which it expects the industry to fulfil and which should contribute towards substantial improvements. The current inadequacies are linked, in part, to the still predominant recourse to correspondent banking and the lack of adequate interbank infrastructures. More efficient funds transfer arrangements have been set up in recent years, but they are too fragmented and economies of scale are very limited. One pre-condition, therefore, for achieving a substantial enhancement in the processing of cross-border retail payments is undoubtedly the fact that the banking industry must implement common technical features in the processing of funds between banks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is unlikely to be sufficient. The banking industry must also improve substantially its internal procedures for processing cross-border payments, as well as its communication with the customer. This, in turn, requires a more extensive use of automation and standardisation. In this respect, I should like to draw attention to the standards agreed within the framework of the European Committee for Banking Standards, which I consider to be of particular importance. The ECB is organising meetings with all parties involved in order to bring the implementation of the standards forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the conditions related to interbank processing and internal procedures have been met, it should be possible for the banking industry to decrease substantially the price of cross-border credit transfers and to reduce the execution time to that needed for domestic payments plus one day.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB expects the banks in the euro area to achieve substantial improvements by 1 January 2002 at the latest. The ECB will act as a catalyst for change and will, together with the national central banks of the Eurosystem, discuss these issues with the euro area banking industry in order to play a supportive and coordinating role in this regard. At present, an operational involvement of the ECB does not appear to be justified since there are already some indications that the general appreciation of the problem by the private sector is now increasing. The ECB will, however, closely monitor further developments in this area and will inform the European Parliament and the general public about the progress achieved.</p>

This is the first occasion on which the European Parliament has given its views on the progress of the European Central Bank and in this context it is my pleasant duty to congratulate the ECB and Mr Duisenberg, as President, on its success so far.</p>
<p class="contents">The launch of the euro itself is a truly historic moment in the life of an extraordinary undertaking. It represents a substantial technical achievement and the many officials involved deserve our thanks and our appreciation.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly it is still early days in terms of judgement on the results of the ECB’s mandate but here, too, we can already point to many positive signs, not least that investors are prepared to lend euro area governments their money at very low rates of interest. This is a real vote of confidence that the ECB will continue to deliver price stability and will not allow an inflationary erosion of people’s savings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very much in this context of overwhelming support for the objectives of the ECB and of praise for its achievements so far that my remaining remarks should be seen. Only if the ECB is open about the way it reaches its decisions will it be able to retain support in bad times as well as in good. It may achieve its objective of price stability but without openness it will not be clear whether that objective has been attained by design and can therefore be repeated in future or by lucky accident which may therefore require some improvement in its methods of working.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee was also struck by the fact that other central banks have moved more rapidly in recent years towards greater openness. The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Sweden’s Riksbank, the Bank of England all publish the individual votes of the committee that decides interest rates. They all publish forecasts, they all give information about the nature of the debate within their governing councils. In all of these respects – objective measures of transparency – the ECB lags behind normal international practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee therefore proposes, firstly that the ECB should publish a summary minute giving both sides of the argument, for and against monetary actions. Secondly, the ECB should publish a six-monthly forecast of economic developments in the euro area. Mr Duisenberg’s remarks to us today are particularly welcome in that respect because he has promised that he that will do just that within the next year. Thirdly, the ECB should discuss on a regular basis developments in each of the Member States of the euro area in order to have a positive influence on price and wage developments which must, as Mr Duisenberg rightly pointed out, differ from Member State to Member State. Finally, the committee may request that the President appears following each significant monetary action. These measures would do much to foster a culture of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee was unable to support a call now for the publication of votes as is in the Liberal group amendment today. It was felt that a young institution should have time to find its feet. Most members felt that publication might intensify the public pressures on governing council members to vote in line with their national interest. Similarly, the committee did not support the Liberal position that it would be useful to publish the ECB’s econometric models of the euro area, partly for fear that they may be abused.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also rejected the Greens’ view as expressed in their amendment today, that the price stability mandate should be altered to take account of the difficulties faced by manufacturers alone if their prices fall. The amendment from the EPP, however, clarifies the paragraph and should, in our view, be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to highlight briefly some other points that we make. The first is to thank Mr Duisenberg again for his assurance to this House that the process of cooperation between the ECB and the national central banks is now adequate, even in the case of a serious crisis in which a euro area financial institution may need to be supported. I would also like to stress the committee’s view that the ECB should bring pressure to bear on those Member States which rely excessively on short-term debt, as this can present dangers, particularly during a financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we encourage the ECB to fulfil its role on the international stage as one of the three main pillars of the international monetary system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I very much welcome, too, Mr Duisenberg’s taking up of a point in the report about the need to reduce the costs of cross-border payments, particularly for smaller payments which affect individual members.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if the euro is as great a success as I hope and expect, it will play its part in revolutionising the European economy. By completing the single European market it will give Europe’s consumers more choice of goods and services, of higher quality and at lower prices and will, therefore, spur greater increases in living standards. It will provide jobs in expanding industries which is the only sure guarantee of future prosperity. Although I have no doubt that the ECB will face many difficult challenges in the years ahead, I am pleased to report that so far it has risen to the challenges it has faced with considerable <span class="italic">élan</span>. We can look forward to a future which builds on its recent success.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, we have heard that this is the first report of the ECB and first position that we have been called upon to express on it. It can be discerned immediately that the report describes the status quo of a year that has now passed and does not definitively clarify the work of the ECB and our relationship to the ECB. Cooperation between the European Parliament and the ECB, as well as the operating methods of the European Central Bank, are in a process of evolution. Much of our criticism or our requirements today will seem self-evident in a while. I would, however, like to say on behalf of our group that we consider the fundamental conditions to be sacrosanct. The Group of the European People’s Party/European Democrats sees itself as the political group which says yes to the independence of the ECB, to reinforcement of the stability policy, regarding both price stability and currency stability, and which also says yes to further reduction of the public debt, to new growth and employment and to the credibility of monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">These fundamental positions of ours, in addition to the tension between autonomy, confidence, a transparent public record and the essential intensification of monetary dialogue with the European Parliament, are crucial for us to be able to assess the work of the ECB, but also for the preparation of our own report and the operating methods of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard briefly today that the main theme of the report is the year 1998, a year in which it was announced which countries had met the convergence criteria – eleven of them, the location of the ECB was decided, the EMI was taken on, the third phase of economic and monetary union was introduced and the ECB Governing Council decided on the stability strategy, based on the two recognised pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, a lot happened in the course of this year. In spite of some currency turbulence on other continents, the euro has already demonstrated that it can earn confidence, and the conversion of existing currencies to the new currency on 1 January 1999 was achieved smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, therefore, I would like above all to offer congratulations and thanks. Congratulations and thanks to the European Monetary Institute, the national banks, the European Central Bank, represented here today by President Duisenberg, but also to all the Member States who, by means of many politically necessary reforms, drove forward further structural and institutional reforms and fulfilled the convergence criteria, and not forgetting the citizens who support this necessary step towards European integration with increasing approval.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to say in conclusion that fulfilment of the convergence criteria has led to price stability, exchange rate stability and to improved public finances. These three successes are the prerequisite for economic growth, on the one hand, essential investment in the future, on the other hand, and creating jobs and making them secure. Considering that the report contains all our fundamental conditions, my hope is that it will meet with wide approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, our primary objective is to establish the euro, after a successful start at the beginning of this year, as a stable currency in the long term, to make it an international reserve currency and to ensure that it is accepted by the citizens. I am particularly pleased that the President stressed again today that the European Central Bank also regards consumer protection as an important task within monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">The independence of the European Central Bank is important for the objectives I mentioned, but its credibility and the degree to which the public can have confidence in it are important too. In a democratic legal system, the institutional and political independence of an institution is only possible if democratic legitimisation is guaranteed at the same time, and that includes transparency of decisions and indeed the possibility of understanding these decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, a central role falls to the European Parliament, and I think that the dialogue on monetary policy, in the form established between this Parliament and the European Central Bank, is a good start for future years in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">I know how difficult it was, and this is shown in the annual report, to set up the European Central Bank, and indeed the whole system, and to get Monetary Union underway without problems. I also consider it very positive that the European Central Bank has improved its information policy. I do think, on the other hand, that it is not sufficient to allocate only an ancillary role in this communication policy to the European Parliament, as the open forum for European policy. It is important to see the special role of the European Parliament here too and I also think therefore that ECB information services and transparency could be significantly improved with regard to the European Parliament. By that I do not mean that we necessarily need to have verbatim reports of meetings published now, but it would be useful to have outline minutes of meetings giving the arguments for and against, making it possible to understand the way in which the European Central Bank actually makes its evaluation in the assessment of the risk of inflation or of deflation.</p>
<p class="contents">It has not been clear to us to date how an assessment can be made or is made in this area regarding the development of prices over and above goods and services, with reference, for example, also to property markets or share markets. There is therefore some uncertainty in this area as to the basis for decision making and the intelligibility of decisions, just as there still is with reference to the forecasts and models. The European Central Bank must be allowed some time. It is only 10 months since the child came of age and became responsible in the monetary arena, but it must continue in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced of the fact that trusting collaboration between the ECB and Parliament will also contribute towards achieving greater certainty and confidence among the public. At the moment there is great speculation on the subject of the ECB’s decisions in matters of interest rate policy. In this context within the euro area, I expressly welcome the ECB decision last Thursday to leave interest rates unchanged. This shows that the ECB is taking its responsibility in supporting other national economic objectives, particularly employment, seriously, and we know that the economic “spring” in the European Union, in spite of the varied developments within the euro area of the 11, certainly needs even further support. I think that the drop in oil prices, together with the fall in consumer prices which has already been experienced and which is expected to continue in the telecommunications, electricity and financial service sectors as a result of competition and the liberalisation of the market also certainly played a part in the decisions of last Thursday. This should continue to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I am filled with consternation regarding the ECB’s attack upon the Employment Pact. I would ask the ECB to make a constructive contribution towards achieving the Growth and Employment Pact and to say very clearly what part it intends to play in the macroeconomic dialogue in order to contribute to a balanced policy mix. It is no longer possible for monetary policy just to be responsible for price stability. It is no longer possible for budgetary policy just to be responsible for state finance, and social partners for moderate wage policy. There must be real liaison here in the interests of the further development of European Economic and Monetary Union, and also a shared position in this area in the interests of increasing employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, we must congratulate ourselves on the process of introducing the euro. It is now a complete reality which is operating with total normality on all the economic levels envisaged – in the Member States, in the European Union, on an international level. The good leadership and management of the European Central Bank has undoubtedly contributed to this normality and we should congratulate it and its President since, during the early months of the establishment of the euro, when the initial approaches were adopted, they had to overcome – and they did it skilfully – certain adverse circumstances at moments which were clearly delicate at an internal as well as an international level. At that time – and I must insist on this – the European Central Bank displayed skill, good leadership and management and the ability to maintain the principles of independence.</p>
<p class="contents">This very solidity, which has been demonstrated in so few months, should allow us to be braver, more decisive in some areas which have already been mentioned, which are in Mr Huhne’s report and which I would like to insist on. One of them is clearly the issue of transparency in some areas that the President of the Central Bank himself has already mentioned. The publication of the forecasts, the possibility of having access to the minutes of meetings and a global report on the economic progress of the Member States are elements which will contribute – as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by means of the intervention of its President, Mrs Randzio-Plath, has demonstrated, and as mentioned in Mr Huhne’s report – to the consolidation of the level of internal and international acceptance and, of course, transparency, not only with regard to public opinion but also with regard to the experts in monetary affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end by insisting on the specific position of the Liberal Group which calls for, after the transitional period of two years, the publication of votes, the various positions taken in the meetings of the Executive Board and the macroeconomic models, which I believe would allow more convincing and accurate forecasts to be made by those whose operations relate to the European Central Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance heartily supports the Huhne report, not only for its professional quality but also for its general attitude of mind. It is effectively a response to the fundamental problem which faces us today, that of accountability in managing monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the nature of this problem? The Central Bank is not a fourth estate. It is not, for example, in a position to challenge the social rights gained by Europeans. These rights are enshrined either in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in national bodies of legislation and in conventions between management and unions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Central Bank, on the other hand, has been assigned a specific function by Europeans, that of ensuring price stability. The Maastricht Treaty is not very specific on the manner in which it must actually be accountable for the fulfilment of its mission with regard to national representatives. All central or international banks of major countries are bound, in one form or another, by this democratic accountability with regard to the socio-economic community – in the Anglo-Saxon countries through Parliament and in Germany through the federate banks of the <span class="italic">Länder</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have to invent the forms of democratic responsibility of the European Central Bank. The Huhne report already provides many possible routes. We support the two amendments tabled by the rapporteur himself, for publication of votes in the Council of the European Central Bank and the econometric models on which these votes are based. Only the most complete transparency of the relationship between the objectives set by the Treaty and the actions of the members of the Council will make it possible for Europeans to actually measure whether the members of the Council are fulfilling their mission properly, not that we doubt it.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the Huhne report is justifiably very pleased with the reduction in interest rates which occurred in April. Apart from the positive effect of this decision on employment, it is in line with the objective of ecological sustainability, which is to say the rejection of a policy of excessively favouring immediate prospects at the expense of long- term future prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our group is concerned about the rumours of a forthcoming increase in interest rates. Such a decision would compromise both the upturn in employment in Europe and ecological investment, especially that related to saving energy and combating the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a decision could only be taken in the event that price stability was threatened. Well, price stability applies in both directions. For many months, the consumer price index has been increasing at a rate of 1%, while the industrial price index<span class="underline"> </span>on the other hand has been decreasing, at a rate of 1%. This deflation in industrial prices prompts giving preference to short-term prospects. It would become dangerous if real interest rates were to increase.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent such situations arising, our Group is proposing an amendment drawing the attention of the European Central Bank to its mandate to ensure price stability in both directions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, in my view, the content and the drafting of the report do not make it sufficiently clear that the European Central Bank is willing to subject itself to democratic control by the European Parliament. This is demonstrated by the fact that dialogue on monetary matters between Parliament and the ECB is assessed on page 95/96 on just the same terms as cooperation with other institutions. In my opinion, this is in contradiction to Article 113 of the Treaty on European Union, which makes it mandatory for the ECB to present an annual report of its activities and its monetary policy to Parliament. This is precisely what you get as a result of the fact that the European Central Bank’s accountability towards Parliament is described in such vague terms in this Article. I therefore support the request made in the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to wit, that the ECB should take immediate action in order in future to at least take into account fully the special relationship with the European Parliament established by the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second comment. It is not acceptable that the European Central Bank should give no details of the background and reasons for its decisions on monetary policy. Indeed, this Parliament is the forum where the ECB must present its monetary decisions, justify them and, if necessary, let them be criticised. If this does not take place, then Parliament cannot fulfil its own task of supervising the activity of the Bank. Monetary policy is, as is known, a highly political matter, and it is precisely for that reason that the Bank must demand a high degree of transparency with regard to decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what for me is a central question, there is clear dissent in this House, President Duisenberg, as to the views you have just expressed. I am of the opinion that the European Central Bank must make a contribution to economic growth and employment by means of its monetary policy. It is not right for full employment to be <span class="italic">de facto</span> abandoned as a political objective and for everything, literally everything, to be subordinated to monetary stability. I still consider this to be the crucial foundation for establishing…</p>

<p class="contents">Thus, Mr Duisenberg, even though today’s poor attendance does not seem to back up my statement, you are nonetheless the successor to the emperors and popes who, since the time of Charlemagne, have dreamt of unifying our continent by faith or by force. No doubt you will even have more power or influence, in the final analysis, than they ever did, even if it is to be a less flamboyant form of power, since at the end of this millennium which seems to set money up as the ultimate universal value, you are poised to hold both temporal power and spiritual power within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Confronted with this – I do not know how to describe it exactly – this “Bank State” or this “Holy Bank”, the Vice-President of which, Mr Noyer, recently explained to us ingratiatingly, but in English, how responsible it felt for the long term whilst governments, on the other hand, gave in to short term whims because they were subject to the vagaries of universal suffrage. Confronted, then, with the omnipotence of this Bank, the excellent report by our fellow Member, Mr Huhne, calls for greater transparency, without however daring to go as far as demanding of you what might pass for exhibitionism, that is to say, ceasing to maintain anonymity regarding decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only approve these excellent resolutions, while being aware that there is even more talk of transparency when democracy is being relinquished or sidelined. Let us recall, for that matter, that transparency comes from the Russian <span class="italic">glasnost</span>. That is why, Mr Duisenberg, I believe that today’s meeting, and particularly the ridiculous opposition force which Parliament is attempting to exert in relation to the considerable power which has been entrusted to you, can only worry anyone who attaches importance to national sovereignty, which is just one way for nations to keep control of their own fate. I only hope that, aware of the power which has been granted you, you will be able to exercise this power with all the wisdom one could hope for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The transition to the third stage of EMU proceeded fairly uneventfully. We can justifiably be pleased about that. But it has since become apparent that bringing about the monetary union of eleven Member States also has its drawbacks. These negative effects could, in the main, have been foreseen, but this Parliament never gave them serious attention during the run-up to EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that is now receiving people’s undivided attention is that of the divergent rate of inflation in the euro countries. Currency depreciation is significantly higher in Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands in particular. There will be no change here in the foreseeable future. According to the estimates published by the IMF yesterday, the Netherlands can expect inflation to be at 2.3% next year. The constant rise in consumer spending is prompting the Dutch Government to make concerned and admonishing comments, but it is doing the wrong things in policy terms: tax reductions instead of debt reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Following an inquiry into the situation, the ECB concluded that the differing rates of inflation ought not to be a major cause for concern. Regional differences in the rate of inflation are in fact greater still in the United States. However, federal states in the US benefit from automatic stabilisers coming into play via the federal budget. The mobility of labour is also much greater in the United States. I tend to feel that the ECB wants to play fast and loose and I would like its President to clarify his position. </p>
<p class="contents">I also want to ask him if the banking supervision system needs to be adapted. As things stand it is decentralised and that is fine, but is the supervisory process not rendered more difficult by transnational mergers with banks outside the euro area? I would be pleased to hear what you intend to do about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, this first report by the European Central Bank is compensating for the launch of the euro and you and the Governing Council of the bank are taking on a great responsibility. The Huhne report certainly contains positive elements, especially as regards the request to the European Central Bank for more information regarding the grounds for the decisions it adopted through the publication of concise Minutes including dissenting opinions as well. However, there is a point in the report which, Mr President, in my opinion is completely unacceptable. I am referring to point 11, which states that Parliament regards ‘the reduction of 50 basis points in interest rates on 8 April 1999 as appropriate, and welcomes in particular the reasons given for it’, which tells us that the cut in rates supported the general economic policies in the Community. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the method, I wonder why on earth Parliament, in discussing the 1998 report of the European Central Bank, feels the need to include its approbation of a specific measure which the European Central Bank will give an account of in its next report – the 1999 report. Moreover, how can we consider judging the effects of the manoeuvre on taxes after only a few weeks? And what sense is there in Parliament giving an opinion of one single act of the Central Bank? </p>
<p class="contents">Considering this matter further, I find this approbation totally out of place. Yesterday, both the head economist of the Central Bank, Mr Issing, and Vice-President Noyer implied that a fresh increase in taxation is imminent. Does this not maybe prove that the decision taken in April was wrong, given that in the meantime there has been no unexpected shock? And was the long-term tax increase not due to the loss of credibility owing to that very cut? We have the suspicion, actually more than a suspicion, that that decision was made following political pressure – for example, Oscar Lafontaine – and that Parliament, with today’s approval, wishes to confirm the move towards a Central Bank which is subordinate to political requirements or even electoral interests. I believe that the Central Bank’s strategy must focus exclusively on currency and prices. It would be suicide, as today others have repeatedly advocated, to think that European leaders can put pressure on the Central Bank so that it will make up for their inability to relaunch the economy through structural reforms, liberalisation of the markets – the job market first and foremost – and tight budgetary policy which must be coupled with a reduction of the tax burden on people and firms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why is the debate we are having today so important? The European Central Bank is autonomous, and my group is surely the one which always stressed this most. But, at the same time, the European Central Bank must make decisions which concern every individual citizen of Europe. It is therefore particularly important that the bank should not exist in an ivory tower but that it should continue to justify itself to the public. There are a variety of ways in which it can achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the European Parliament has a particularly privileged role here. The European Parliament is explicitly mentioned in the Treaties as the partner of the European Central Bank in dialogue, and this is not the case in the same way with other institutions. The European Parliament is a forum where all of Europe can in fact take part in the debate; though I would have liked to see a rather larger participation in this debate today, for I am of the opinion that this debate is of great significance.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank is autonomous. It is committed in the first instance to ensuring price stability. At this point, I would like to remind Mrs Randzio-Plath that the Treaty plainly stipulates that the prime objective of the European Central Bank is to ensure price stability and that any other objectives may be pursued only if they can be achieved without any risk to price stability, and that price stability itself, as the President has already stated, can have positive social and economic effects.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I should like to say that the European Central Bank has achieved some outstanding work in the course of this last year, since it was founded. It has taken some very important decisions, for example, its decision on the definition of price stability. That is of very great significance for the long-term development of our debate on this question. Even in its decision regarding the minimum reserves, which were rather controversial, the European Central Bank, i.e. the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, has demonstrated great perceptiveness. It has, at least, passed its period of probation as far as that goes. I would however like to specify that throughout this probationary period the Bank experienced fair weather, economically speaking. Perhaps occasionally things were rather hazy, but, on the whole, we are going through a period of positive economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be much more difficult for the European Central Bank to take uncomfortable decisions, such as, for example, raising interest rates rather than lowering them, if the economic situation becomes more difficult and if actual risks to price stability arise. In the first months of its existence, the European Central Bank has earned our confidence, but if it is to be able in the future to withstand such situations, then this confidence must be systematically consolidated in the years to come and, Mr President, in that endeavour you may count on the support of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">We are called upon to vote on a draft amendment which demands that the votes of the individual members of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank should be made public. I would like to make it perfectly clear that my own group will never agree to such an amendment. Why not? Individuals sit on the Governing Council of the Bank, who are personally responsible for monetary stability and who make decisions as individuals within this Governing Council. There is not, therefore, any weighting of votes, such as there is in the Council of Ministers, since it has been determined that these are people who have to vote here as individuals. Publishing the votes could lead to a situation where there would then be national debates on the behaviour of individual members. That would be extraordinarily negative both for the European Central Bank and also for all of us. The European Central Bank has achieved some excellent work, it has earned the confidence of the citizens by dint of its work in the last few months, and this is what we are going to reflect in this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Central Bank has managed to fulfil its primary mission of maintaining price stability. The general economic policies of the Union have been accompanied by an opportune reduction in key interest rates. The countries participating in the euro area have been in a position to continue their structural improvement. Growth has returned in the majority of European countries. Following the doubling of petroleum prices, a slight upsurge has been observed in inflation. The ECB has a duty to remain vigilant, but as the mean rate of inflation of the euro-11 is still well under the 2% mark, I dare to hope that the Governing Council will give growth and, consequently, further reduction in unemployment, a chance. According to ECB estimates, some four fifths of unemployment is structural in nature. More recent studies show that in fact less than one fifth of unemployment is structural. This type of unemployment linked to the current economic climate could be absorbed only by more vigorous growth.</p>
<p class="contents">While emphasising the need to continue the policy of stability, I would like to ask President Duisenberg the following question: can Europe’s only ambition be to pursue a macroeconomic policy focused on stability alone? In my view, the fight against inflation must go hand in hand with the improved coordination of budgetary policies and the establishment of a macroeconomic framework favourable to growth and to employment. When assessing the work of the ECB and the positive effect of the euro area, one must consider the internationalisation of financial markets. One is bound to observe that Europe has come to terms with the crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil rather well. Without the euro, some more vulnerable Member States would probably have experienced monetary difficulties along with, who knows, some cases of competitive devaluation. The euro is also a victory of Community regulation over the disordered interaction of individual financial markets. People will bring up the objection that, since its successful launch, the value of the euro has depreciated in comparison with the dollar. This is to forget that, within a floating exchange rate system, the main currencies are always going to evolve in relation to each other. In the last twenty years, the yearly slide in the volatile Mark/Dollar exchange rate has, on several occasions, exceeded 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">The only criticism I have of the ECB is that it should be a bit less reticent about international exposure in all the various for a. The ECB is one of the most important central banks in the world. It is its duty to take a particularly close interest in the vulnerability of the international banking system and the fragility of the financial sector throughout the world. The crisis in Asia was not triggered by traditional macroeconomic imbalances, but by the financial excesses of the private sector. The irrational exuberance which characterises some stock exchanges, the excessive indebtedness of American households and of some economic sectors in important countries cause a definite threat to hang over worldwide economic stability. The ECB should make a firm commitment in all the appropriate fora to create a new regulatory framework for the structure of international finance. The essential complement …</p>

It is my understanding that we Swedes still have a lot to learn within the field of European cooperation. At the same time, it is my conviction that there is also a great deal for the EU to learn from how we handle some things in Sweden, for example the issues of openness and public access to official records. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the report on the European Central Bank, there is every reason to wonder whether we should not be able to do more to increase openness within the European Central Bank and public control of its affairs, to strengthen the Bank’s legitimacy and to increase democratic support for it. We Liberals believe that this is needed, and without, moreover, encroaching upon the Bank’s independence or reducing its efficiency. </p>
<p class="contents">The Bank of Sweden now reports, with two weeks’ delay, upon the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors. Monetary considerations, together with the positions adopted by the various Board Members, are reported on at this time. Last week, Swedes learned that the Deputy Chief Executive of the Bank of Sweden, together with a further Member of the Board, did not back the Bank’s latest report on inflation. They advocated a rise in interest rates but were voted down. </p>
<p class="contents">Similar openness would be to the advantage of the European Central Bank too. Why? Well, openness leads to clarity, which reduces uneasiness in the market and makes for stability. However, Mr Duisenberg and I are clearly not properly in agreement about this argument. Openness would increase our citizens’ support for the Bank and make it easier for everyone to understand the goal of monetary policy: that price stability, just as Mr Duisenberg said, should lead to growth and employment. In my opinion, being open about strategies and prognoses, internal discussions and methods of voting will also actually increase Board Members’ accountability, not reduce it. It is actually a good thing to be open to public scrutiny. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to say too that we have today been able to see that support for EMU in Sweden has increased, which I am glad about. I should like to tell Mr Duisenberg that support for EMU and the likelihood of taking Sweden into EMU will increase if he and the European Central Bank display greater openness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the current phase of European construction we are seeing significant economic and monetary integration processes, which have been speeded up since the adoption of the single currency. In the real economy we are witnessing great mergers and concentrations which must be carried out in accordance with good practice and respect for consumer rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At an institutional level the Central Bank plays a key role and we would also like this role to be counterbalanced with the transparency demanded of those institutions which result from the votes of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Somebody said that one should not grow fond of banks because they will never grow fond of you. We do not intend to present you with a rosy picture or a wonderful idyll, but we do not believe that it is too much to ask that at least they are transparent with the citizens of Europe who are affected by their policies and measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms we agree with the Huhne report, which emphasises the quality of the annual report of the ECB and the progress made in the communication of the Bank’s policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the measures proposed with regard to the increase in transparency and the need to clarify what the European Central Bank understands monetary policy to be, beyond price stability – which is evidently its main function – because this will undoubtedly contribute to an appropriate and balanced policy mix which is aimed at promoting sustainable development and lasting employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I must insist once again on transparency: do not apply a bandage until you are injured. Mr Solbes said in an appearance before this Parliament that he would try to cooperate with the Members without prejudice to the quality of his work. Transparency does not have to be incompatible with the protection of aims of monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not asking for miracles nor that a great song and dance be made about what is going to be done, but simply that its management model be more transparent. If you take note of what other Central Banks have done and if you trust in this Parliament, have no doubt that we will make progress with transparency without endangering the objectives of the European Central Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this point of view, when Parliament considers that progress is being made because regular press conferences are held following any Governing Council meetings and because, in addition to annual reports, the ECB also publishes monthly reports, this invokes a false sense of true democracy among the peoples of Europe. This ‘progress’ has, in fact, been run-of-the-mill practice at the central banks since the 1930s! </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, European citizens are, first and foremost, interested in and, at the same time, concerned by the content of the policies of the European Central Bank, the European Union and the Member States – policies which give absolute priority to so-called monetary stability and the interests of major credit capital, at the cost of dramatic job losses and the total disintegration of the so-called European social model. Workers are concerned by the fact that the European Central Bank considers a growth rate of over 2.5% to be dangerous for the notorious monetary stability, thereby deferring indefinitely efforts to address the issue of unemployment. The average inflation rate of the 11 countries within the euro area is below 1%. Some countries have already entered an anti-inflationary phase, but there are growing signs of a rise in interest rates in order to maintain monetary stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with growth rates below 2%, with a new rise in interest rates, with deflation and the rigorous implementation of the Stability Pact, growing pressure is being brought to bear on the security and social rights of workers, and this will indirectly bring about a dramatic deterioration in their living standards and working conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we have all noticed the greater role played recently by this institution – and indirectly, at the same time, the whole Union – in terms of economic policy and, especially, employment policy. On the other hand, this was not sufficient to ensure that the euro was not affected by speculation or weakened in the face of our competitors – which, of course, we must definitely not ignore – which are the United States and NAFTA. In fact the euro, which started with a strong position in the money markets, after a few months was exposed to attacks which were, to say the least, speculative. We must take note of this signal and always ensure that the focus behind major political, budgetary and monetary strategies is not the new single currency but a long-term view taking into account the need to give the euro and the Member States stability, and above all, to relaunch the Union’s economy and the employment situation which concerns each of us in this Parliament so greatly. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we must continue along the path which President Duisenberg is establishing within his role and the institution itself. However, at the same time, we must monitor price stability so that we can control the greater evil with which we are all familiar – inflation – and at the same time keep interest rates low to stimulate investments and relaunch the European industrial sector, making it more competitive with regard to the other States. In doing this, we would bring prestige to a new institution like the ECB and we would gain political credibility internationally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can talk about what is apparent, that is to say the surface details; or one can talk about what is real. The European Central Bank’s mode of functioning is to stay on the surface. It is a question of regulations and rules of procedure. We are conducting a rather shadowy debate here, and it is also interesting what the rapporteur has written in the explanatory statement, namely that the European Parliament “is responsible both for receiving and debating the annual report of the ECB and for monitoring the ECB”. There is no basis for this. Neither Article 113 of the Treaty nor Article 15 of the Statute give Parliament any powers other than the power to talk. So we can talk, then, and come up with comments about openness, as my excellent Swedish colleague has done, and I concur fully with the criticism of the culture of secrecy. But the reality is the European Central Bank as a political tool, and this House believes that the question of the euro and its establishment as an important institution is a matter which is over and done with. It is not! It is a success, writes the rapporteur at the start of the report. Success according to what criteria? Is it a criterion of success that the exchange rate has fallen since the euro was established? And, if one considers social criteria such as unemployment, it hits you right in the eye that the three North European countries which are outside the single currency (namely Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain) have significantly lower unemployment than certain areas in the EU, where it is catastrophically high. Is this success?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tannock (PPE).</span></span>   – Mr President, nine months after the euro’s launch and with enthusiasm for its future role as the major international reserve currency dimmed as the result of exchange rate weakness, it cannot be heralded as an unqualified success. It remains to be seen if the “one-size-fits-all” model of interest rates will work in countries like Ireland, without causing large tax rises and damaging the popularity of the Euro-project.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless I applaud the aims and coherence of the Huhne report as a basis for defining accountability of the Central Bank, on which I should like to say a few words, particularly on the issue of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Some may question why I, as a British Member, should like to speak on this issue. I would like to point out that Britain and the British Conservative Party – to which I belong – have never been hostile to the euro as a currency for those Member States which genuinely wish to join, as we are all bound together through our membership of the single market so that a collapse in confidence for the euro would affect us all, whether we are in or outside the EMU. For this reason it is vital that the Central Bank enjoys the confidence of the financial markets. We live in an era of massive capital flows and foreign exchange markets. Some £300 billion is traded every day in the City of London. A collapse in the credibility of or belief that the Bank would not be prepared to pursue an anti-inflationary policy at all costs could have severe repercussions economically throughout the whole Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that only the Central Bank, for instance, should pronounce when necessary on foreign exchange target zones for the euro, to avoid conflicting messages being given to the financial markets. It is also vital, in my opinion, that the Bank be encouraged to follow the example of other leading central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in America, and make transparency a central feature of all its activities. I regret, therefore, that attempts to require the Bank to publish the names of those present, the voting on monetary actions, after a grace period of some two years and the publication of the ECB’s econometric models were defeated at committee stage and have not been put before this House today.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also confusing yesterday to hear that Mr Issing, the ECB’s chief economist, reportedly stated in London that the Bank would not publish economic forecasts for Euro-land, perpetuating a culture of secrecy. I welcome Mr Duisenberg’s clarification on this issue today. I believe that any confident central bank would welcome the opportunity for its members to be challenged on the fundamental assumptions underlying their decisions. But particularly in the ECB’s case, as it does not have the track record of the mighty Bundesbank and could quickly lose the confidence of the financial markets if it is reluctant to protect itself through greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Openness to criticism is not a weakness but a strength. As a doctor I know that advances in medicine are often achieved only after rigorous scrutiny and challenge in peer review journals. The Bank has to learn to operate within the same spirit. I also believe that the financial markets and the people of Europe will expect no less of this new Central Bank and that this Parliament should be relentless in the pursuit of an open and accountable European Central Bank for the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the first time that you have presented your annual report to this House as President of the Central Bank. Indeed, if I am interpreting the Treaty on European Union correctly, this is an essential element in the balance designed by the people who set up Economic and Monetary Union, with the success we have seen, taking into account the conditions of the transition to the euro on 1 January this year. This balance, in fact, involves both the independence of your institution and the annual report which you must present to our own institution. This is the meeting we are witnessing today.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike some of my fellow citizens, I believe that today we are here reaching the very core of your democratic responsibility. As you know, this institution has clearly shown its will to exercise fully the competences accorded under the Treaty. Parliament set the condition of having a hearing with each of the members of your Executive Board; it meets you on a regular basis, and considers today’s meeting to be the high point of this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only to be expected that our debate today should be more concerned with the methods rather than the basis of the monetary policy. You are still just about in your initial running-in period, as are we. We must take advantage of this period to strengthen the resources that we, the European Parliament, have. But for your part, you too, Mr President, must perhaps take advantage of it to review again your idea of the relationship between your institution and ours.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as regards transparency – many people before me have said it, but let me repeat it once again – if we want to be able to really act as an intermediary in monetary policy, which you implement and which we discuss, then we need you to present the decisions you are taking, and give your reasons and justifications for them.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards monetary policy itself, you said, Mr President, that it cannot solve the structural problems of the labour market. Very well. But it can make a contribution, and this is what the Treaty invites you to do, and what we invite you to do. Sustained growth in Europe is essential if we wish to solve the problem of employment. There will be no structural reform without growth. Certainly, positive signs are appearing. We know that more gradual growth today is already enabling the creation of jobs in some of our countries. But if we want sustainable growth for a high level of employment, we need monetary policy to accompany this movement. This is what the treaty invites you to do, and this is the matter on which we expect positive signs from you. In this sense, the policy which you are pursuing in the area of interest rate policy is clearly essential, and we are awaiting very clear commitments from you in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that President Duisenberg is present serves to underline the special relationship that the ECB has with our Parliament. The Liberals are satisfied with the ECB’s report and with the four proposals put forward by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for there to be more transparency in the bank’s dealings. But we are disappointed that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has shown itself unwilling to take one step more towards achieving still greater openness, hence my group has submitted a number of amendments to this end. I refer in particular to the publication of votes and the voting behaviour of each individual member of the Governing Council. We believe that this could only strengthen, not weaken the independence of the members. After all, the <span class="italic">ex officio </span>attendance of the Council of Ministers and the European Commission means that<span class="italic"> </span>the national governments too are now in a position to know how the members vote and are able to bring pressure to bear at will, but then this is done completely unverifiably and behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not doubt the integrity of the members of the Governing Council and openness is, we think, the best way in which to guarantee greater integrity. We have no time for the argument that members could not then change their minds. Of course they can if, for example, circumstances changed or new arguments were put forward. It may well be that their voting behaviour would initiate debate, but we are sufficiently reassured that the members of the Council have the fortitude to deal with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater openness is a sign of strength and inspires confidence. We consider this to weigh more heavily than any possible risks. What is more, publication would bring the Bank more into line with the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States and the Bank of Japan. Why should we Europeans act as if we have something to hide? Surely that is only going to weaken confidence in the euro?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as liberals we are very much in favour of the ECB’s being independent and we value the part the President has to play in upholding this. But we believe that greater openness would reinforce the independence and authority of the ECB and request that Parliament supports moves to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among other things, he points out that the European Central Bank is altogether too secretive, that the meetings are held in camera and also that the current President, Mr Duisenberg is against the minutes from the Bank’s discussions being published. There are a lot of people who have taken up this point, so that Parliament is expressing a strong opinion on the matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Huhne complains in his report that the European Central Bank does not display the same openness as the central banks in the USA, Japan and England. Olle Schmidt talks about the Bank of Sweden’s publishing the minutes as soon as two weeks after the meetings concerned. Why should not the European Central Bank be able to do the same? </p>
<p class="contents">There are various arguments in favour of this culture of secrecy. One of these which has been put forward is quite startling, I think. This is an argument to the effect that the Bank’s leading personnel will be better able to withstand pressure from lobbyists and individual governments if they have a duty of confidentiality imposed upon them. I think that, in this way, an amazing lack of confidence in these people’s strength of character, integrity and independence is being expressed. They are mistrusted, which shows that it is not only ourselves, who are among those critical of the EU, who are mistrustful. Instead, I would maintain that distrust of the Bank’s leading personnel is written into the Bank’s own statute. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also want to associate myself with Mr Huhne’s understanding of the goal and significance of monetary policy. I want to go a step further and say that the ideology concerning stability is just that: an ideology. If we look at what has happened in Europe in recent years, it appears, rather, that the policy of stabilisation merely stabilises unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will simply highlight some of the points with which I agree or disagree.</p>
<p class="contents">The vice-chairman of my committee said, referring to the history of the euro, that we would have to go back as far as Charlemagne and probably Diocletian, who is the grandfather of the euro. And as a Spaniard I must mention Charles I, who wanted to unify the European currencies on the basis of the Cologne mark.</p>
<p class="contents">And this leads me to the speech made by an English Conservative Member, who explained what the single currency required in order for the financial markets to have faith in it. What they probably need most is for the United Kingdom to join the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this and to get to the point, the Treaty of Maastricht enshrined the principle of price stability and put in place a fully independent European Central Bank to uphold this principle. But the Treaty of Maastricht did not deal with the institutional consequences of this decision, and for this reason we are talking today about the independence of the Central Bank, the relationship between the Central Bank and other institutions and the unresolved problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amsterdam, the decision was taken not to amend the Treaty of Maastricht in any way, and therefore the problems which were pending are still pending. We are now on the eve of an Intergovernmental Conference which has to deal with the consequences of the decisions which we have taken before.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said here about independence and it is true that, with the Treaty of Maastricht, those of us who believed that price stability was an essential condition for sustained development and that a Central Bank was necessary to control inflation have been vindicated, while those who believed that it was possible to implement any economic or monetary policy provided it produced short-term artificial growth, have been proved wrong. The spokesman of my group has expressed this very well and I will not repeat it.</p>
<p class="contents">But because we believe in this model, we also believe that we should adopt decisions so that this model does not fall apart. Firstly, we have the problem of transparency, a topic the rapporteur handled with humour and skill. We believe in the independence of the Central Bank, but this Central Bank is much more independent than the Bundesbank or the United States Federal Reserve, because it was not created by an act of Parliament and cannot be modified by one, because it does not exist side by side with a government that has its own economic policy. And this has led some people to talk of a type of platonic aristocracy composed of a series of independent experts to whom decisions regarding monetary policy are entrusted in the belief – probably correct – that money is too serious an issue for politicians to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, if we do not want this model to fall apart, it is necessary to prioritise transparency measures, and I whole-heartedly subscribe to each and every one of the measures which the rapporteur has mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have the problem of the relationship of the Central Bank with the other European institutions. It has been said here that the priority objective is dealing with inflation, but it is not the only one: we have to think in terms of, amongst other things, an economic focus, responsibility, the international representation of the euro and the monitoring of the banking institutions at a time of significant mergers amongst the financial institutions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that much of this success is undoubtedly due to the Central Bank, we must communicate our congratulations to its President, and we hereby do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, we must stress two or three points: firstly – and this has been mentioned this afternoon and Mr Duisenberg knows perfectly well that it is a concern of this Parliament – we have the question of transparency. Given that this has been discussed here this afternoon, I will not pursue this argument, particularly as I know that Mr Duisenberg is perfectly aware of the Socialist Group’s position in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I want to address, which for me is more important, is that of growth and employment, specifically the relationship between monetary policy and growth and employment. We agree with you, Mr President of the ECB, when you say that price stability is necessary for growth, and that growth and the creation of employment cannot happen without guaranteed price stability. Likewise we agree with you when you say that monetary policy alone cannot resolve the problem of unemployment. But we must also warn – and you understand this perfectly – that bad decisions regarding monetary policy may harm growth and prevent the economic recuperation which has started. There is no lack of historical examples in this respect and the warning is worthwhile at a time when economic recuperation in Europe is far from being confirmed and when, at the same time, there is speculation about the imminence of a stricter monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity, given that the Commission is present in this debate, to remind you of something which has also been repeated many times by this Parliament and which, in any case, is very important to our group: economic policy does not end with currency and does not end with monetary policy. The third phase of Economic and Monetary Union raises the issue, even more than in the past, of the need for a more robust and articulate coordination of economic policies. In this case, it is the responsibility – I would say the main responsibility in this area – of the Commission. You know this, Mr Solbes, and we call on you to face this responsibility, and in this you will surely be able to rely on the support of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As for presenting the purely formal actions of the managers of the European Central Bank to involve the European Parliament as if it were the expression of democratic control, that is just a feeble joke.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I feel bound to object in particular to the virtual declaration of war against the workers and the unemployed of the European Union in the form of the objective declared by Mr Noyer, the Vice-President of the ECB, when he speaks, and I quote, of the need to “reduce rigidities in labour markets” or even for “a break with often deeply rooted habits and allegedly acquired rights”. Well, we know that the rights he is talking about are simply the rights to a job and to a wage which affords a person a decent living.</p>
<p class="contents">These gentlemen of the Central Bank act like the spokesmen for the employers who are effectively in the process of reducing “rigidities in labour markets” by axing thousands of jobs, such as Michelin, Renault-Nissan, Alsthom, Rhône-Poulenc, and Hoest Marion Roussel and many others even now, or by propagating the precariousness of jobs by means of wages which cast an increasing proportion of the population into ever greater poverty while the fortunes of major shareholders continue to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">Gentlemen, beware, their attitude will ultimately trigger the reactions they deserve among workers and the unemployed. I hope that in all the countries of the European Union these reactions will unite the victims of the policy of employers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not shy away from addressing the difficult issues which surround Europe’s single currency, because if we do so we will be letting down those people who elected us to this Chamber so recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duisenberg, in my view, you have a more or less impossible task because you have to set a rate that is suitable not only for the booming economies of Ireland and Spain but will also suit the faltering economy of Germany. Still less would it be possible to fix a rate which would also suit the persistently divergent economy of the UK. But none of us here doubt the importance of your role because a domestic Euroland government faced with reviving a faltering economy has very few weapons at its disposal. It has no power to set interest rates, no power over exchange rates, little power over government spending restricted by the Stability Pact and, if many people in this Parliament had their way, it would have no power over its own tax rates.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments have very few cards left to play with and not for nothing has it been said that the euro could lead to a recipe for stagnation. But we should not be surprised at the limitations on the powers that are left to the domestic governments in Euroland because it has never been a secret of those founding fathers of the single currency that what they had in mind was the creation of political union and a united states of Europe. I welcome your frankness, Mr Duisenberg, in making clear the very big political leap which has been made by those countries which have already entered Euroland.</p>
<p class="contents">But anyone who denies the existence of this political agenda – which subsumes the single currency – in my view is either deluded or dishonest, because it is a very real agenda. We saw that very recently, articulately presented to us by President Prodi when he said that we now face the best opportunity to unite Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire. Clearly, Mr Prodi had in mind the replacement of an ancient hegemony with a new economic one. But political union may not just be the idle dream of a few federalists. When you share a joint bank account with your neighbour you are affected by the actions and the spending decisions of your neighbour. You legitimately need some control over their actions. There is a very strong argument for saying that the single currency cannot function properly unless there is increased political integration and political union. That is one of the many reasons why the British Conservatives are campaigning vigorously to persuade the UK to keep its own currency and to keep the pound and to stay out of the single currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EL)</span> Our meeting today is certainly a landmark. We have had so little to rejoice about as regards the building of Europe, so the fact that we are coming to the end of a successful year as regards the euro is something we should applaud. I believe that both Mr Duisenberg and Mr Lamfalussy and their colleagues deserve all our gratitude for everything they have achieved in this matter. Of course, in all democratically-held debates such as this, we are bound to hear at least some critical remarks – but that does not, in any way, suggest that we do not acknowledge the tremendous contribution the European Central Bank has made to European affairs.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, since we are discussing the annual report, it would be a good idea to focus our attention on a number of long-term issues. The first is the ECB’s insistence on the two-pillar strategy for ensuring monetary stability. While using a “broad-based assessment of the outlook for price developments”, as the Bank calls it, which is basically an “inflation forecast”, seems perfectly logical, using the M3 money supply has neither practical nor theoretical support. From what I have seen, I believe Mr Titmeier has also criticised this. It is an important issue since there may be some disparity between the two criteria and it would be tragic to curb the development of Europe for the sake of an indicator of somewhat dubious quality. Even if monetary policy is as advantageous as you say it is, Mr Duisenberg, and we have no proof of this yet, monetary ‘over-stability’ could prove to be extremely detrimental.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the independence of the Central Bank, which the political leaders of Europe have given their assurances of – and rightly so. However, independence from the political leadership is not enough; the European Central Bank must convince us that it can guarantee its independence from the capital markets. The central banks are often tempted to keep up with the markets; to wit, they are often tempted to adhere to the interest rates which the markets fix indirectly when they set the prices of securities. But the markets have short-term horizons, the markets have a mass mentality and are exceptionally prone to speculative bubbles which can be particularly disastrous at times. The European Central Bank has not yet said anything to us about that. We only hear a deafening silence from your report. And so, you will have to make a concerted effort to convince us that, in additional to political independence, you have also gained independence from the capital markets so that we can support you in absolute confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kauppi (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, the annual report from the European Central Bank shows that the bank has got off to a brisk start, and the steps taken so far have been on the right track. The transition to the third stage of EMU has taken place without problems. During its first months of operation, the bank has been able to adapt its working methods to the demands of the present day. Nevertheless, much has still to be done to raise the European Central Bank to the position to which it is entitled, though not automatically so. In the future we wish to see a strong and independent European Central Bank and not just one alongside our global competitors, Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, but, preferably, edging ahead of them. Building up its status and obtaining the confidence of markets will, however, take time, and we here in the European Parliament cannot presume that everything will happen in an instant.</p>
<p class="contents">In discussing the annual report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we had lively discussions on <span class="italic">inter alia </span>the issue of transparency and how it can be gradually increased. Although transparency has undeniably increased and, for example, press conferences with the President, held after board meetings, have meant a clear improvement in the bank’s approach, the aim must be to increase transparency further, once the work of the bank becomes established and the teething problems disappear. The European Parliament must, as the representative of the European people, have the right to demand that in future, the ECB, like other central banks, should also publicise the arguments both in favour of, and against, its monetary policy decisions. Furthermore, the publication of abstracts of board meetings is justifiable, and the justifications for decisions taken must be clearly evident from these abstracts, so that market players can make their own decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">For my own part, I seriously considered my position regarding whether the individual opinions of the members of the board and possible decisions taken by a vote should be made public in the future. However, I ended by adopting the majority position of our group, justifying my decision by reflecting how this sort of approach might reduce rather than increase market confidence in the work of the bank in the early stages. It could also be just too big a step to take so early on. In the long term, however, I hope that transparency is fully realised at every stage, in this regard also. Information is power, and the dissemination of information in an open market economy is democracy. Market viability can be enhanced through the spread of information. The more evenly information is disseminated in a society, the more effectively individual choices steer the economy’s development and guide the invisible hand of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that I thoroughly support the publication of the reports on the economic situation of the countries in the euro area and the various indicators that go with it. The ECB may also comment on this information, but their analysis must, however, be left to national decision-makers. We have to remember that, although the euro area has just one monetary policy, we still have eleven different economic policies, for whose coordination the Member States are responsible, within the frameworks determined in the Growth and Stability Pact.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would very much like to hear Mr Duisenberg answer a number of questions that have been raised. I hope there will still be enough time for this. I wanted to remind him of his role in the Dutch consultation system in a former life. In particular I also want to raise the question that other speakers have raised too, as to what he would think to developing a consultation system of this kind on the European scene. I hope that he will take a little time to address this issue before we close.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as his former life in the Netherlands is concerned; the Central Bank of the Netherlands, of which he was President for many years, was at the centre of the field of influence in society in which socio-economic policy was developed, and I believe that we should take our example from this and involve the European Central Bank in a European macroeconomic dialogue. As you know, there are plans afoot for dialogue of this kind to take place and there is also due to be a meeting on 8 November.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also established practice in the Netherlands for there to be structured ways in which the Dutch Central Bank participates in the consultation system, for example there is a banking council in which advice is given to the bank and in which both sides of industry also take part. This participation in the consultation system economy is also afforded by the Dutch Central Bank having a seat on the socio-economic council, which is the most important advisory body in the socio-economic field. I hope that the macroeconomic consultation between both sides of industry that is soon to take place will be given a far more prominent role. The comments that Mr Duisenberg made in his introduction, to the effect that this dialogue ought only to confine itself to the exchange of information, fell rather short of the mark in this respect to my mind. I think that in view of his experiences in the Netherlands he ought not to be so wary of taking such responsibilities, and also feel that coordinating and harmonising policy could be of great benefit to further developments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with a quote that he himself used when he recently attended the opening of new banking premises in the Netherlands. The quote was as follows: “ I believe that the future is also the past, only it comes in through a different door”. He might like to relate this quote to his own circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The annual report goes into great detail about the seamless way in which the crucial transition to 1999 was effected, a very important moment. Another such crucial point in time is on its way, that is to say the day on which Europe’s general public will literally have the new coin in hand. I have had several discussions with you, Mr Duisenberg, on how the Member States want to handle the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The closer the first of January gets, the more everyone becomes aware of the difficulties that consumers, particularly the elderly, and the retail trade are to face. An ever increasing number of studies state that there are going to be very considerable problems and these are being shouldered by the weakest parties: the consumer and the retail trade. It recently became apparent that the Central Bank will not oppose frontloading the general public with coins. It is true that the Member States are in agreement about the distribution of coins. However, the Central Bank has always maintained to date that regulations and/or laws preclude the frontloading of the general public with banknotes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Noyer came to Parliament recently and when I asked him what the main objection was to frontloading coins or banknotes he actually gave the vaguest answer I have ever heard. If he ever finds himself penniless then he will have no trouble at all getting into politics.</p>
<p class="contents">But I want a clear answer today. I know just how clear you can make yourself. What is the main objection? And do not tell me that it would be difficult to explain to people that they could not spend their euros for the first fortnight. Any citizen assumed to have an understanding of the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam could not possibly have difficulty comprehending that. It is downright insulting to suggest otherwise. The Economic Institute of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in the Netherlands, which I am sure you are familiar with, carried out a study and concluded that the retail trade needs to have 100% of its daily turnover available in change, as opposed to the 7% available to it now. The situation is so bad because the cash machines, the banknote dispensers will not dispense any of the small five and ten euro notes. I hardly need to tell you what kind of an impact that will have on cash flows, the security of check-out operators and shops, bank charges, etc. Every evening proprietors are going to have to convert their whole day’s takings into change again, doing the same for every shop they own. The banks will have to face up to their responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duisenberg, the Central Bank needs to come down from its ivory tower and really get to grips with the difficulties facing those ordinary people who are soon going to have to work with the euro. Have trial runs carried out if you do not believe me or the studies. But consider that the success of the euro will depend on its introduction running smoothly precisely where ordinary people are concerned. The discussion continues to focus on how much it will cost the banks. But the discussion ought in fact to focus on whether there is going to be chaos or whether things will run smoothly. The banks are equipped to deal with large flows of money and security but the corner shop and the local baker are not. You too will be assessed not in terms of greater or lesser increases or reductions in the rate of interest but in terms of how the euro will be brought into circulation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also seems essential to comment on the success of the euro and to congratulate the Bank on its excellent performance during the last year.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duisenberg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the European Central Bank</span>. – Mr President, in my introductory statement I already approached many of the issues which have been again brought forward in Parliament this afternoon. So if you allow me, I will try to formulate my answer by grouping together many of the issues that have been raised in Parliament and produce a comprehensive answer, or at least some remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all the issue of transparency. Although I realise and I am grateful that the desire to have the votes or minutes published by the Governing Council does not appear in the motion for a resolution which will be voted on tomorrow by your Parliament, in this discussion a lot of attention, much more than I expected, was paid to the phenomenon of transparency, culminating in publishing the vote. I would like to emphasise that when you talk about and require transparency you have to indicate precisely what that means. What does transparency mean? I would warn against what I might call mixing up transparency with publishing the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as transparency is concerned, which I define as giving to the public or Parliament as much information as possible about developments in the economy, about monetary developments, about the outcome of the deliberations of the Governing Council, I believe – and I said so in my introductory statement – that the European Central Bank can look squarely in the eyes of any central bank in the world. For example, there is our publication immediately after the meetings of the Governing Council of the considerations which have played a role in the Governing Council’s ultimate decision whether or not to change interest rates. That is done about one hour after the decision has been taken. We give the arguments for and against certain decisions there. I believe that you will find no central bank in the world which is more transparent than we are.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing we do not do is we do not publish votes. Apart from the fact – and this may be somewhat embarrassing – that we virtually never vote in the Governing Council, so there is nothing to be published, I will not repeat all the arguments against this which I have brought before this Parliament on earlier occasions, but one has to remember that the decisions of the Governing Council of the Eurosystem are made in a collegial way and there is one decision only which emerges.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments for and against it are published in the press conferences and in the Monthly Bulletin after the meetings have taken place but there is one decision. One always has to bear in mind that every word that is spoken by me or any other member of the Governing Council about economic developments and about the decisions which are taken and in what direction sets in motion immediately billions of euros across the world. It is always a signal to the market and it takes effect almost simultaneously with the utterance of the opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">On forecasts, Mr President, I do not need to say more than I have already said in my introductory statement. There will come a time when we will publish forecasts, either bi-annually or tri-annually. I do not yet know the precise form. We are actively investigating this question but we simply are not ready yet and we do not have enough data or know the models which ultimately we will use. We have not yet reached a degree of stability which would make it responsible for them to be published now but, as I said in my introduction, I am confident that in the course of next year we will publish forecasts.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid one misunderstanding, it has been asked repeatedly here “why do you not take an example from the Federal Reserve system which publishes forecasts” and I believe it is also a consideration behind the motion for a resolution. That must be a misunderstanding because what the Federal Reserve system publishes twice a year in its Humphrey-Hawkins testimony for the Senate is a range of figures for a few indicators, the range being the range of the individual forecasts of members of the Federal Open Market Committee coming from the regional Federal Reserve banks. That range, the forecast with which they come once every six weeks to Washington, is published. Forecasts are also prepared for the FOMC meeting and in particular for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system, forecasts prepared by the staff of the Board of Governors. They are the forecasts which are used to underpin the decisions that the FOMC takes at any particular moment in time. Those forecasts are not published. And I already made some remarks in my introduction on the relativity of forecasts, even if they are published, for the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Various Members of this Parliament have questioned whether the ECB places too much emphasis on prices and too little on growth and employment. At least that is how I have understood the question; that was the signal that was given to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Treaty of the ECB makes it literally mandatory for the ECB to give primary attention to their primary objective, which is to maintain price stability. The Treaty says “without prejudice to price stability”, that is only when price stability, I should say, is guaranteed, should the ECB in its policies support the general economic policies of the Community. There is another small remark I would like to make, Mr President, but it is important in the context of the motion for a resolution. I believe the Treaty language is a little misrepresented. In the resolution it says “providing that this price stability is attained”. The Treaty says, and not without reason, “without prejudice to the objective of price stability” – and that is of great importance in economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording of the resolution may be interpreted as suggesting that when the current rate of inflation is below 2% then the Eurosystem would be under an obligation to support the general economic policies of the Communities. In contrast the wording “without prejudice” clarifies, and it is intended to do so, that the Eurosystem is under no obligation to act in this mechanical fashion if it believes that doing so might jeopardise price stability in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask Parliament to take that into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the suggestion that there is too much emphasis on price stability, the formal answer is that it is our mandate. Also, I would like to repeat that we do not overestimate the impact that monetary policy can have – what it can and cannot do. It is my firm belief that monetary policy can and will influence the movement of prices over the medium-term but not in the short-term. That is why we have a forward-looking strategy. The direct impact of monetary policy measures on employment and growth is very limited indeed. That is borne out by research which we did at the institution where, as Mrs van den Berg indicated, I previously worked.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the current situation, I should like to repeat that the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, which has been made very clear to Parliament, is based on two pillars, both designed to be forward-looking over the medium-term. The two pillars are: the reference value for monetary growth, M3, and a broadly-based assessment of a wide range of indicators and their impact on the primary aim of price stability. That broadly-based assessment is one that encompasses a wide range of indicators, of course including developments in the real economy, movements in employment and unemployment, an assessment of movement of the exchange rate in so far as it has an impact on price levels in the euro area. That is our strategy. It is forward-looking. Of course we look at the current developments in inflation also as one of the indicators of what we think is going to happen in the future, but it is certainly not true that we only look at the current inflation rate, as implied in the draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand that I will not join Parliament in the debate on what decisions might be taken in the short-term on interest rates, although that decision has been alluded to by various Members of Parliament. In Parliament it has been said by various Members that if interest rates were to be raised that would choke economic growth and the growth of employment. But please remember that when you are driving a car very fast and you want it to go forward, but maybe a little slower, you can either step on the brakes or you can lift your foot a little bit from the accelerator. There is a difference. Raising interest rates in a certain situation might be more akin or related to lifting your foot from the peddle as opposed to braking the momentum of the economy and in that way going slower. We all want to go forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Peijs wanted a very clear answer on frontloading. I hope to be as clear as I can on banknotes. The Eurosystem, early on, made it clear to the public at large that frontloading over a short period would not be a problem provided it could be ensured that the money frontloaded to banks, for instance, or other organisations is not brought into circulation before 1 January 2000 – into general circulation that is. We formulated that by saying that banknotes may be frontloaded provided there are legal or contractual guarantees at the receiving end which ensure they will not be brought into circulation before 1 January. There would have to be contracts or legal provisions or contracts with retail organisations or banks. Then it would be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">On coins – you will be aware I do not have responsibility for coins, this is a matter for the finance ministers – the big difference is that it is virtually impossible to get that same guarantee as far as coins are concerned because coins are generally put into circulation by the retail sector rather than by the banks. To have such a guarantee would be impossible. Another large difference is that it is very easy to try to make a counterfeit banknote with modern photocopying techniques which is the reason why the precise features of the banknotes to come will be widely published but only very briefly in advance of their introduction, so as to reduce the danger of counterfeiting and confusing a public which is not yet familiar with the notes. It is much more difficult to counterfeit coins.</p>
<p class="contents">I have touched upon all the major issues that have been raised today on banking supervision. It is well known that the Treaty gives very little responsibility to the European Central Bank in the area of banking supervision. Our task is to promote financial stability and the stability of the financial markets. We monitor banking supervision, but this is not one of the tasks of the Central Bank. We are fully involved in the further development of rules. Mr Goebbels said that the ECB should be: “a bit less reticent about international exposure in all the various fora”. The ECB is now fully involved in all discussions in all international fora on the future of what is now called the “financial architecture” in the world. The ECB is fully involved in all discussions of the G-7, of the G-10, of the OECD. We have a permanent representative who is very actively engaged in discussions at the IMF. In December there will be the first meeting of this new Group of 20 at the initiative of the G-7 countries, consisting of the G-7 countries and a few emerging market representatives. The ECB will be there. We will also participate in that dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs van den Berg has asked, we do participate in the macroeconomic dialogue but just as in the Netherlands, the Central Bank participates in the dialogue but does not agree to a compromise on its policy in order to get a concession in another policy area. There will be no <span class="italic">ex ante</span> policy coordination but there will be an extensive and, I hope, critical exchange of information of all the partners involved, including the ECB. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
