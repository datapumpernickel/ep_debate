<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, as far as Turkey as a candidate Member State is concerned, the door is open, but the road is hard. That is the message of my report. For the other candidate Member States that was really self-evident. They and their citizens have had a lot of trouble in reaching the finishing line and up to the last committee meetings comments were still being made about them in clear tones urging completion of the work. Turkey is no exception. There is no reason therefore to give this country special treatment on account of its size or its strategic position.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey does of course have quite different problems from the other candidates. These problems are mainly in the area of the Copenhagen political criteria. More than ever perhaps the emphasis in this report is placed on the background to or deeper causes of the political shortcomings which usually manifest themselves in violations of classical freedom rights and of fundamental human rights. It is also to do with the fact that the Turkish State is based on a philosophy that was developed in the 1920s, a period in which Europe did not provide many pleasant examples from which to draw your ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticism of Turkey concerns the structures of the State, the dominant political position of the army, the National Security Council, which is dominated by the military, the nationalism that leads to suppression of ethnic, religious and cultural minorities and the priority for collective security and collective interests over individual human rights, which again and again gives cause for complaint. The army also has a very strong influence in education, broadcasting and the business community and it is very important that this is also recognised in part in Turkey’s latest reform packages.</p>
<p class="contents">In the contact with Turkey it is always a question of who are we talking to? Are we talking to the government and the majority in the parliament or are we in fact talking to the representatives of what people call the ‘deep State’, the high generals and the high established bureaucracy?</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these problems we also mention those on the borders, with both Cyprus and Armenia and possibly with Iraq. The lack of a functioning social midfield is also apparent. There is little room for the trade union movement. Religious communities, even the Islamic, are under strict state control or are having a hard time. Other candidates had leeway to make up here too.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of candidate membership is that the country concerned develops into a Member State like the others. It must not for example make any difference in legal position whether you live in Diyarbakir or in Rotterdam. If that is the case, then it is impossible to sell membership to our citizens. A directly elected parliament may see this more readily and with greater concern than a council of ministers. We therefore invite the Council to be just as clear in its policy towards Turkey as this Parliament and not to cling to symbols and symbolic dates.</p>
<p class="contents">Clarity has been the express concern of this report. It is not honest out of a need for appreciation to remain silent about a series of objections only to conjure them up again at a later date. Turkey has to know where it stands now. That means radical changes, as other candidates have also experienced. Which is why we warmly applaud the plan to draw up a new Constitution, while expressing the wish that the political values that are supported in other Member States will be taken as a starting point. Furthermore, the army must relinquish its present dominant position and be brought back to a form and function that is usual in other Member States. This has consequences for the National Security Council and for the state security courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments to the law that have in mind the conversion from a military nation, as people write to me, into a civil nation, must prove that their objectives are being achieved in practice. This is a question of mentality and culture. The Union must therefore focus its support on actual fulfilment of the political criteria, that is, on retraining and exchange programmes for government officials, especially those in the police, and of lawyers who are involved in courts of justice, and so on. Torture, for example, must now really be over and the return of the expelled and refugees to their villages must not be obstructed by the so-called village guards. Freedom of religion must not be a dead letter.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous frustrating government measures can in fact be abolished in a short time and it is a constant source of amazement that this does not happen. Cultural rights must not be recognised in dribs and drabs, but convincingly and generously. For a while it seemed that the government would indeed be able to establish its authority and we had also hoped that it would, for example, be able to make good its intention to resolve the Cyprus issue on the basis of the UN plan. That unfortunately proved not to be the case. A renewed successful attempt will show whether the army is indeed finding its normal role.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am pleased with the broad support for the report that exists in this Parliament. I have also cast a generous eye over the amendments and where possible given them a plus. We have agreed with Mr Swoboda that we can accept an amendment from the radical and green corner, concerning the willingness of Turkey to fulfil its tasks under the reforms, as an addition, not as a replacement. If it is not wanted as an addition, we shall vote against. But if it is presented as an addition, then we can say, ‘yes’ to it. I otherwise hope that the open talk of the debate about religion, culture and politics is not smothered by deletions in paragraph 3, as that is a paragraph that could simply bring this discussion to a tremendously good end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, Turkey is an important partner of the Union, with which we have maintained contractual relations for a very long time. You can go back as far as 1963. However, the turning point in this 30-year period was the European Council in Helsinki, when Turkey was acknowledged as a candidate country for accession to the Union on the basis of the same criteria that apply to the other candidate countries. In Helsinki, the aim of the accession strategy adopted was to help Turkey on its course towards integration and included reinforced political dialogue, pre-accession aid and a procedure for analytical examination of the application of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. The cornerstone of this pre-accession strategy was the partnership of March 2001, with principles, priorities and interim objectives which would allow Turkey to meet the Copenhagen criteria. Within this framework, it is necessary to emphasise that important elements are not only the adaptation of legislation in relation to the Copenhagen criteria, but also its material application. And the Commission has clearly underlined this point, mainly in the annual progress reports.</p>
<p class="contents">We have recently monitored certain important internal developments in Turkey. A new government has taken over power, with strong support from the people. The new prime minister, Mr Erdogan, has clearly stated that he intends to continue and strengthen the reform process, so that Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria. Recent surveys have also shown that this objective is shared by an important majority of public opinion in Turkey. And I think that this political will is, you might say, reflected in actions and not just words.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Copenhagen Council, the Union itself recognised that the new Turkish Government was resolved to proceed with further reform and it urged it in particular to deal quickly with all the weaknesses which continue to exist in the field of political criteria, in relation both to legislation and to the application of legislation. Within this framework, the Union encouraged Turkey to actively continue the reform process. If the European Council in December 2004, based on the Commission's report and recommendation, decides that Turkey meets the political criteria of Copenhagen, the Union will renew accession negotiations with Turkey without delay. That was, as you all know, a very weighty decision for the future of relations between the European Union and Turkey. We hope that this prospect will act as a catalyst and encourage Turkey to adopt and apply the necessary reforms. However, I should like at this point for us to see what the situation looks likes six months after Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, during the Greek Presidency, we have worked systematically to implement the elements of the accession strategy in accordance with the decisions taken in Copenhagen. The revised partnership adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council in April 2003 is of particular importance in helping Turkey to deal with the main issues in its attempt to meet the political criteria. A revised national programme for the adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, with clearly defined targets, is expected to constitute Turkey's planned response to the new partnership. Similarly, we have held three political dialogue meetings, one of which at ministerial level, when we had an opportunity to see exactly what is expected of Turkey up to the end of 2004. The Presidency and the Commission have planned another two meetings in the more specific aim of examining progress in meeting the political criteria. The Association Council was convened in April at ministerial level and evaluated the progress both of the pre-accession strategy and the status of the partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like, guided by the recently adopted revised partnership, to refer with greater clarity to the main issues that we expect Turkey to deal with up to its evaluation in 2004. Of course, this is not intended either to discount the Commission evaluation within the framework of this year's, and more importantly, next year's progress report, nor does it have to do with any other criteria over and above the Copenhagen criteria. The partnership was the product of valuable experience from two years of helping Turkey to adopt political reforms. This means that efficient account was taken of lessons from recent years, following discussion, both by the Commission and by the Council, which adopted it with slight changes.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to say is that, as we see it, there are two basic issues for promoting Turkey's essential candidature status. First, democracy has to operate in this country without the obstacles of the past and, secondly, the institutional changes voted through by parliament need to be translated into real administrative and judicial practice. Political control by the parliament and via a democratically controlled government of all the institutions and bodies of state is, therefore, a basic issue which Turkey will need to address effectively. This also involves the simple legal adaptation of the rules and raises telling and very material issues in connection with relations between the elected government and the army. The Union has also publicly referred to this issue and emphasised that there cannot be practices that result in deviations from the Copenhagen criteria and we have noticed that there have recently also been corresponding examples with reference to internal and/or external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of human rights and the rule of law, there has undoubtedly been progress, even in sectors which a short time ago were considered prohibited. We must not forget that the abolition of the death penalty and the introduction of the right to use and teach minority languages are a big step forward. And Turkey itself appears to wish to proceed at a fast pace and to achieve the start of accession negotiations by set deadlines. It is important that we know this ambition, for the realisation of which quite a lot still needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Association Council last April, the Union clarified the fact that basic outstanding issues in the field of political criteria require Turkey's immediate attention. These issues mainly include, by way of example, numerous accusations of torture chambers in the country, references to arbitrary arrests and practices of detaining people without judicial proceedings in south-eastern Turkey, contradictory judgments in relation to the punishment of those guilty of torture, court cases which demonstrate that there is still no uniform interpretation and application of provisions relating to the freedom of expression, and the regime concerning religious foundations and communities, which remains particularly restrictive. We have already expressed our concern about the way in which religious foundations are treated and we continue to hope that the Turkish side will keep its promises, so that, with the necessary additional reforms, the problems that have arisen can be dealt with in accordance with international norms.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has the right been safeguarded for all Turkish citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin, to enjoy full cultural rights. The restrictive nature of the recent regulations in the field of radio and television broadcasting and teaching in languages other than Turkish appears to be hampering the application of the August 2002 reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also additional elements in relation to the human rights situation. These are the recent attack by the security forces on the Turkish Human Rights Association, continuing deaths from hunger strikes in high security gaols and the uncertain outcome of the case pending against Leila Zana, which we have also discussed here in Parliament. All these issues are elements in an imperfect reform process in which reforms formally adopted have not always resulted in practice in the improvement to the situation which had been hoped for. I could also refer to the report by Amnesty International on Turkey, which paints a picture of a human rights situation with numerous problems, but there is no reason now to go into that in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, however, I wish to mention that there are important priorities which are reflected in the text of the revised partnership and which we expect Turkey to take into serious account. They cover important sectors of the economic criteria and I think that they also correspond to the stated intention of the Turkish Government to improve the economic situation in the country. They also cover the important chapter of justice and internal affairs, in which we are looking forward to improved cooperation from the Turkish side and are promoting the conclusion of a Community readmission agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out that there are another two basic priorities which also have an important position in the partnership. They relate to Cyprus and Greek-Turkish relations. Despite the fact that efforts by the United Nations Secretary-General to resolve the Cyprus problem ended in an impasse in the Hague, his plan is still on the table. The Secretary-General has pointed out that, if a solution is to be found, there must be genuine political commitment to his proposals and a clear timetable for completing negotiations. The spring Council expressed its regret that efforts by the Secretary-General had failed. The Union vigorously supports the continuation of the good offices of the Secretary-General and of the negotiations on the basis of his proposals. We have called on all the interested parties to spare no effort in finding a fair, operational and viable solution and, more specifically, we have called on the Turkish Cypriot leadership to re-examine its position.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, the priority of the Turkish partnership to support efforts to find an overall solution to the Cyprus question through the good offices of the Secretary-General and negotiations based on his proposals continues to be of decisive importance. The President of the European Council also referred to this matter in recent public statements. The government of the Republic of Cyprus has demonstrated in practice its will to facilitate such a solution. The protocol on Cyprus attached to the Association Agreement also allows a margin for this development. But our common will is to achieve something along these lines by 1 May 2004. The recent opening of the green line constitutes material proof that the two communities on the island can and will live and progress together. However, practical changes imposed from below, by society, are no substitute for institutional solutions. These must come about and only thus will Cyprus safeguard the new horizon to which it is entitled after so many years. The Union and we, as the Presidency and as a Member State, support the need to find a solution on the basis of the Annan plan.</p>
<p class="contents">As far, then, as the question of a peaceful solution to the differences is concerned, a change in the atmosphere of Greek-Turkish relations has already been noted in various sectors. Exploratory contacts between the two ministries of foreign affairs started in March 2002. Discussions are continuing between senior officials. The improved climate has resulted in increased bilateral exchanges and a series of agreements. However, on the other side, the Turkish side, certain practices are being observed, such as by the Turkish air force, which are out of keeping with the aim of deeper relations between Turkey and the Union. We are looking forward to further progress in this sector on the basis of the principle of a peaceful solution to the differences in accordance with the Helsinki conclusions and the relative priority of the partnership. As decided in Helsinki, the Council will examine the situation in relation to the outstanding differences and, more importantly, their repercussions on the integration process, with a view to promoting their settlement through the International Court in the Hague by the end of 2004 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, allow me to welcome once again Parliament's acute interest in the integration strategy for Turkey. We shall continue to cooperate with a view to repeating here the clear success which accompanied the political message of enlargement: extension of the area of peace, stability and prosperity and the abolition of the dividing lines of the past. We especially welcome the fact that the policy for the enlargement of the Union is continuing and is a basic incentive for countries, especially candidate countries such as Turkey, prompting them to further reforms in order to safeguard the values and principles I referred to earlier. We also welcome the fact that this objective is also the stated wish of the Turkish people and the policy of its elected government. We are looking forward to the necessary progress being achieved by the deadlines set, so that we can safeguard a positive and auspicious future for relations between the Union and Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent weeks and months Turkey has often been in the limelight, and the most recent international developments have once again highlighted Turkey's importance for peace and stability in a region directly bordering the European Union and which is simultaneously one of the most crisis-prone regions of the world. At the same time the advantages for the European Union of having a Muslim country standing firmly by its side are becoming ever clearer, providing living proof that it is perfectly possible for such a country to share our values. One of the great questions of the twenty-first century will be how we shape the relationship between the West and the Islamic world. Turkey has a key role to play here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen European Council gave Turkey a clear political road map. Turkey now has less than 18 months to implement an intensive programme of reforms before the Commission delivers an opinion on whether Turkey meets the Copenhagen political criteria. In order to support Turkey on the road to EU membership, the Commission has started to implement an enhanced pre-accession strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, cooperation will be strengthened in a whole raft of areas, such as political and economic dialogue, justice and home affairs, and safety at sea. The screening of legislation will be intensified, the scope of the customs union will be extended, and trade relations will be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has proposed a substantial increase in financial support. It is proposing allocating resources of EUR 1.05 billion for the period 2004-2006. Part of this support is to be used to foster initiatives aimed at consolidating and developing democratic practices, constitutionality, human rights, equal rights for men and women, and the protection of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a revised Accession Partnership for Turkey was adopted on 14 April. Its aim is to support Turkey in meeting the accession criteria. This of course involves very close attention being paid to the political criteria. The Accession Partnership provides a framework for assessing Turkey's compliance with the political criteria, and thus for the next steps in dealing with its membership application.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Turkish Government to react to the Accession Partnership by rapidly adopting a new version of the National Programme for the Adoption of the <span class="italic">Acquis</span>, including a clear and timetabled legislative programme. The reforms adopted in Turkey over the last 18 months are extremely impressive. Turkey has tackled many of the as yet unsolved problems identified in the Regular Reports. It is clear that the decision taken in Helsinki to grant Turkey the status of a candidate country has acted as an effective incentive for Turkey to set a series of reforms in train. We support Turkey's firm intention to make all the remaining legislative changes required in the course of this year. This will enable Turkey to focus completely on implementation next year. We have carefully noted the announcement by Prime Minister Erdogan's government that it intends to draw up a new constitution. Furthermore, we are aware of Turkey's intention to adopt a further package of political reforms in the very new future. I am delighted to note that just in the last few days leading representatives of Turkey's armed forces have declared their full support for Turkey's European orientation and the associated reforms. We have clearly identified the remaining shortcomings in relation to these issues in the Accession Partnership. These concern the abolition of the practice of torture, the elimination of human rights limitations such as restrictions on the freedom of opinion, freedom of association and religious freedom; they also relate to problems with the political role of the military and to respect for cultural rights and compliance with rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned in the 2002 Regular Report, if they are to be effective these reports must also be implemented by Turkey's executive and judiciary. I would like to stress very firmly that our assessment will not only be based on what legislation has come into force, but also on compliance in practice with the Copenhagen political criteria.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to respect for human rights and basic freedoms, the picture is rather uneven. Despite the political reforms it seems that the behaviour of at least some parts of the judiciary, security forces and prison staff has not changed in practice. There are still many examples of repressive behaviour. It is evident that concerns about security and the alleged threats to secularisation and to the indivisibility of the state are continuing to play a key role in the behaviour of implementing bodies and of the judiciary. Most recently, the closure of the HADEP party and the initiation of proceedings against the DEHAP party are examples of this kind of behaviour. This is why, despite the reforms that have been adopted, it is not yet possible to make a definitive judgment. Nor do I wish to conceal my concern about certain very recent events that are not in the spirit of the reforms introduced. That featured in our debate in the last plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on the basis of the most recent changes in legislation that Leyla Zana’s retrial has been initiated. It is now extremely important that the new verdict should reflect the spirit of the democratic and constitutional reforms that Turkey has introduced in recent months. If Turkey wishes to enhance the credibility of its reform process, it must bridge the gap between the spirit of the political reforms and their practical implementation. I know that because of resistance in some camps this is not easy, but I am sure that Turkey has the strength and the ability to achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Cyprus question, it remains our top priority to find a comprehensive solution on the basis of the UN plan, so that a united Cyprus can join the EU on 1 May 2004. So it is now a question of maintaining the political momentum of the Cyprus process. Against this background, Turkey's support is more important than ever, for two reasons: firstly to allow the Turkish Cypriots, like their Greek Cypriot compatriots, to become fully integrated into the EU, and secondly so as to settle a question which otherwise could act as a brake on achieving Turkey's own aims once the accession negotiations start.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, as a sign of good will and with a view to maintaining political momentum, the Commission adopted a package of measures for the Turkish Cypriot community, comprising extensive financial support for economic development and further strengthening links with the European Union, combined with measures to promote trade. In the area of trade, we are proposing to give goods from the northern part of Cyprus access to the European Union. I very much hope that all the parties involved will be able to act with sufficient flexibility to allow this to become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has only limited time left in which to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria. The Turkish Government is aware of that and I know that the Turkish Government is determined to make this goal a reality, and I am convinced that it is capable of achieving that. To this end, the Commission will continue to offer Turkey further encouragement and all the support it needs. Turkey's reformers need clear and reliable signals from us too, whereas mixed messages will hinder the acceptance of reforms in Turkish society.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to stress once again that the Heads of State and Government of the 15 Member States – all 15 – have in recent years repeatedly and firmly committed themselves to the fundamental principle that Turkey should become a member of the European Union. No one has said ‘no’ on principle to possible Turkish membership on strategic, geographical, cultural or religious grounds. Turkey is a candidate for accession, and it has the right to expect its application for membership to be dealt with honestly, fairly and objectively. This will be a guiding principle for the Commission in its cooperation with Turkey and in its ultimate assessment of Turkey's readiness for membership. We would all benefit from a democratic, constitutional, tolerant and internally peaceful Turkey.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, we all recognise that many reforms need to take place in Turkey in order that its candidacy for the European Union can be taken forward as rapidly as possible. Turkey does not expect to be treated any more or any less favourably than any other candidate country, but it does expect to be treated fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">I have long argued for the need to send a strong, positive signal to Turkey that will sustain the commitment to modernisation and westernisation that has been a feature of that country for 80 years or more. With the threat to us all from international terrorism and the continuing instability in the Middle East, it is vitally important that Turkey should remain firmly anchored within the alliance of the democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's report should therefore be upbeat and encouraging, recognising the enormous progress that has been made and the willingness of the Turkish authorities to carry out radical change, while emphasising the steps that still need to be taken to overcome difficulties and obstacles. Instead, the Oostlander report, even improved as it has been by amendment, is unsympathetic. It emphasises the negative, places undue weight on the often unverified allegations and views of extremists and minorities, and there is no warmth or friendship. It rather implies that Turkey is not very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the most ardent campaigner for respect for human rights, but not where this is a cover for subversion or where extremists masquerade under a human rights placard. Of course we condemn torture – it is inexcusable wherever it takes place – but we should also recognise the political exploitation of torture allegations by opponents of the Turkish regime. I do not believe it is helpful for any country to institutionalise minorities. Every effort should be made to integrate minorities into the mainstream of a nation's life without denying them the right to express their own language or culture.</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of democracy and human rights the report calls for measures that, without care, would merely serve to empower essentially undemocratic elements, giving greater influence and visibility to fundamental Islamists and extremists who wish to unravel any attachment to western values.</p>
<p class="contents">On Cyprus there is a one-sided interpretation of events with no recognition of the positive steps taken by the Turkish Cypriot authorities, no call for generosity by both sides. I welcome the measures taken by the Commission in the last few days to help lift the embargo. It is most important that in December 2004 the European Union gives an early date for the opening of negotiations on Turkey's membership. I am afraid this report quite deliberately sends the opposite signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly congratulate Mr Oostlander on producing this very balanced report. I can offer him some words of consolation: even if the official spokesperson of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not support his report, the official spokesperson of the Social Democrats is genuinely 99% behind him. This can sometimes be comforting in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Oostlander rightly says, the report shows that the door is open, but the path is arduous. Now there are some people who tend to emphasise the open door, while others stress the arduous path. I personally, and the majority of my group, believe that both aspects should be supported equally. The starting point was the state philosophy of Kemalism, which Mr Oostlander criticised, and we no longer use this term in the report. I also think that Kemalism has two sides, a positive side, which supports a republican, secular state and rejects religious domination, in this case that of Islam over the civil authorities. Over the years, however, in the shadow of Kemalism – though not as a result of Kemalism itself – the army has risen to dominance. Now the new government, as the Commissioner already mentioned, has a somewhat different philosophy. For this reason, the army is keeping a watchful eye on it, although – and here too I am behind Commissioner Verheugen – there are, thank goodness, some members of the military who recognise the path to democracy, because they know that is also the path to Europe. I also consider the initiatives of the Turkish Government gradually to remove the military from areas not directly connected to security, such as the media and education, to be the right way forward. The road ahead is still a long and arduous one, and there will continue to be some resistance, but I believe that the path Turkey has chosen is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">This includes the question of minorities too. Now, on the subject of minorities, Mr Van Orden, we are not talking about a small minority of 2 to 3 per cent here. We are talking in some instances about very large minorities, especially if we are referring to the Kurdish minority. But there are of course other minorities, Greek, Armenian, and Syrian minorities, which must likewise be given due consideration. May I remind you that Turkey until recently disputed that it had any minorities at all. It no longer spoke of minorities at all, other than religious minorities. It was precisely due to the insistence of this Parliament, together with the Commission, but probably especially this Parliament, that we have managed to change these things. If we had always been as soft in our demands as Mr Van Orden wants, then we would not be where we are now. I know, too, that Commissioner Verheugen has often been criticised in Turkey for his tough but clear words. Only in this way can we also help Turkey to continue on this path of change and progress with reform, which is the right path.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My final remarks concern the issue of Cyprus. I visited Cyprus recently – the Greek part of the island, I hasten to add. I saw how delighted people were to be able to visit their old villages and homes. I also heard many Greek Cypriots say that they were given a very warm welcome by the Turkish Cypriots, which cannot be easy when you suddenly invite someone to your home, knowing that you were actually the person who occupied the house. And yet these friendly contacts have resulted. I do not know how long this will last. Messrs Denktash senior and junior probably even conceived this measure of opening the border as a way of forcing the international community to recognise the Republic of Northern Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">I only recall what it was like with the GDR, although of course the two things are not entirely comparable. What one side wants is one thing, but the reality is quite another. And the reality is that, sooner or later, Cyprus will be a united Cyprus, because this unnatural border, this last border of walls and barbed wire, can no longer be sustained. If we can help – and Cyprus’ accession and our positive, critical stance towards Turkey will help – then it would be a great success for this Europe to see this last barbed-wire border disappear from Europe.</p>

Our Turkish friends have undeniably made progress on very many fronts in recent years. If the country meets the Copenhagen criteria, the European Union will have to keep to the promises it has made. I am pleased that, in his well thought-out and sympathetic report, the Christian Democrat Mr Oostlander recognises that the universal values of democracy, constitutional state and human rights can very well be accepted and defended in a country with a clear Muslim majority.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucially important for us that Turkey develops quickly into a fully-fledged democracy, in which the armed forces are subordinate to elected politicians. It is for this reason that the Turkish National Security Council with its present powers and in its present form must be dissolved. Many quarters point to the important role of the military in guarding the secular State. It is said to act as a bulwark against rising Muslim fundamentalism. I should like to point out however that it is not only the task of the military to keep Muslim radicalism at bay, but of all responsible leaders. As far as necessary the structure of the State must be adapted to anchor all the democratic requirements. We therefore support the reforms of the political and legal system the Erdogan government has in mind. We are naturally very curious about the precise details of the new Constitution. This is not a matter of more or less Kemalism, but simply of the compatibility with universal standards and the demands of EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad that the Erdogan government has now tabled legislative proposals to strengthen freedom of speech and to permit the use of Kurdish in audiovisual resources and election campaigns. Nonetheless I would, with Mr Oostlander, point to the fact that a successful legislative process is not sufficient in itself. It comes down above all to its application in practice. While the police remain free to torture prisoners and human rights continue to be violated, there is no way, as far as I am concerned, that the negotiations can begin. A drastic softening of Turkey’s attitude to the Cyprus problem is also needed. The failure of the Hague conference was attributable in no small part to the rigidity of the Turkish position. Ankara should allow itself to be led more by the positive attitude of the Turks who live in Cyprus than by the negative pronouncements of their leader there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Turkey will have to develop a policy of good neighbourliness with Armenia, which can then in due course lead to a political gesture of which the Armenians have such incredibly great need. In December 2004 we are going to take stock, but there cannot yet be any question of accession in the near future. There is still a very long way to go before the whole of Europe, away from the song festival, votes for Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The many amendments have clearly improved the report. The problem areas have now been stated in more concrete terms and the criticism has generally been couched in more objective language than before.</p>
<p class="contents">There nevertheless remains one anomaly that cannot be overlooked. Although religious minorities are discussed at quite some length, it is somewhat surprising that the concerns of the Kurdish population – some 20 million people – are dealt with rather briefly. In view of the multifarious harassments and threats they have been exposed to, it is an intolerable trivialisation of the issue to call upon the Turkish Government to create a more relaxed and constructive relationship with its own citizens of Kurdish origin. I would certainly have preferred to see clear words of criticism here.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, the problems are many and varied. The precarious situation of the human rights organisation EHD, for example, is given no mention at all. Its premises were searched only recently. Threats are commonplace, and some reference to the difficult position of human rights activists in Turkey would have been appropriate. Criticism regarding the case of Leyla Zana and the other DEP party MPs could have been expressed more clearly. Three days of negotiations have already taken place, but they are still in prison. The negotiations process resembles a farce, and seems far from likely that the court will lift its sentence violating human rights and set them free.</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes absolutely no mention of the case of Öçalan. His trial, too, was classified as unfair by the European Court of Human Rights. It would therefore also be appropriate to reopen his case. It is evidently too delicate an issue, however, for the name of Öçalan to bear mention in a report of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly condemns the banning of HADEP and the threat of court action to ban DEHAP. There is no mention, however, of the order prohibiting leading members of HADEP from engaging in political activity. Why not? A clear stand should have been taken on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, in other places the report would have benefited from being less arrogant. I find it unspeakable that the report refers to the humanist and Judeo-Christian culture of Europe, making out that Europe has always been a stronghold of democracy, the rule of law, human and minority rights, and freedom of religion and conscience. It patronisingly adds that an Islamic country too can accept and defend these values. Completely aside from the fact that Islam too has always played a part in Europe, I would like to recall, as a German especially, that the values that are allegedly so typically European are not quite so deeply rooted in Europe. European history ranges across the Christian Crusades to the crimes of the colonial era – not to mention the horrors of fascism.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the reference to religion is utterly superfluous. The EU is a political and economic union. For a country to accede to it, there are clear criteria that must be fulfilled. Whether they are fulfilled against a Christian, Muslim, Jewish or atheist background is irrelevant. The main thing is that they are fulfilled. In Turkey at the moment, this is unfortunately not the case. The report, despite all its shortcomings, demonstrates this and makes it clear that there are no plans to open accession negotiations at the present time. It is to the report’s credit, however, that it also clearly states that accession in general for Turkey remains a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the report will contribute to changing the policy of the Turkish Government in such a way that enables Turkey to accede to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was in fact done in committee. Here what was – I have to say – an unbalanced report, whose tone was not always exactly upbeat, was transformed by radical amendments into one that is critical yet balanced, one in which a clear distinction is made between on the one hand what has been achieved and on the other the undoubtedly long, but concrete list of points that have still to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Just three brief remarks about the text. Mrs Uca, I am afraid that – if you listen – you have still not understood the precise implications of paragraph 3. In it the rapporteur in my view rightly makes a distinction between the Judaeo-Christian and humanist roots on the one hand, the universal values to which they have led on the other hand, and the fact that this is no barrier to the accession of an Islamic majority country – a formulation that I can share with all my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark is directed towards the Members from the GUE/NGL Group, whom I urge to stop doing the dirty work of the Armenia lobby. In my eyes there is a carefully considered compromise on this question in the text and I honestly find the constant attempts to tighten the thumbscrews on this point increasingly irritating.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a third remark in response to the rapporteur’s proposal. On behalf of my group I can agree to the addition to the text of Amendment No 11 instead of an improvement of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Fellow Members, it is crucial in the debate to keep an eye on the background against which we are doing this now, the background against which this debate about the EU-Turkey relationship is taking place. It is in fact one of a constant struggle between, on the one hand, the reformers – strong in the government and in Parliament – and on the other, the conservatives – strong in the army, the police and the judiciary. In this struggle it is the task of the European Union, but also of the European Parliament, to – naturally – criticise the conservatives. We are very good at this and we must carry on with it above all. For example, if it is a question of banning the HADEP – unacceptable. For example, if it is a question of descending on human rights organisations – indefensible. For example, if it is a question of the refusal to give Layla Zana and her colleagues a really fair new trial.</p>
<p class="contents">An inseparable part of this criticism as far as I am concerned however is the support for the reformers and this we are occasionally inclined to forget. For example, if it is a question of the new package of reform proposals that is now before the Turkish Parliament and in which, after long urging by the European Parliament, for example Article 8 of the Anti-Terrorism Act is actually deleted and in which Kurdish private media are actually being given the opportunity to broadcast.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take care to retain this balance and what I very much wish to avoid is to create the impression that in Turkey it was nothing, is nothing and never will be anything. I believe that Turkey can implement the reforms, I think that they deserve our support. Finally, Mr President, we will all have to answer the question of whether we want it to be successful. Do we want the reformers to succeed? My answer is a heartfelt ‘yes’, because that is good for Turkey and for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political clarity is something from which, ultimately, all parties involved benefit. I share the rapporteur's view – and I would refer to paragraph 52 – that, at present, Turkey does not fulfil the conditions for the opening of accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The report underpins this frank conclusion in a convincing manner. Three fundamental inconsistencies with the political criteria of Copenhagen – which are, after all, essential accession conditions – are all-important in this connection: firstly, the army's dominant position in the Turkish state and society, for which, see paragraphs 7, 8 and 9; secondly, the constant discrimination against religious minorities, particularly that of Christian denominations (paragraph 39); and thirdly, the disturbing Kurdish issue, mentioned in paragraphs 34, 35 and 43.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few weeks, the dominant role of the Turkish armed forces was abundantly clear from the domestic media campaign about possible tensions within the army’s most senior ranks between those in favour of reform and critics of this necessary EU route. The rumour machine says a great deal about the true relationship between civilian and military authorities. The authority relationships in the EU Member States are completely different. In summary, Brussels is outside Ankara's military-political range for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the governing AKP does claim freedom of religion for Muslims in its own country, but, according to Western Turkey experts, does not breathe a word about the self-same constitutional right for non-Muslims. The urgent call on the Commission in paragraph 40 to draw up a comparative study between religious freedom in Turkey and the EU Member States is therefore opportune.</p>
<p class="contents">I would join the rapporteur in calling on the Turkish authorities to take the Kurdish South-East under their wing in earnest. The Council and the Commission ought to give their 100% backing to a comprehensive development plan for this seriously underdeveloped region. A helping hand of this kind to Turkey would do the Kurdish citizens a world of good, both internally and externally, and I would add this for the sake of Mr Oostlander, even independently of EU relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can a state which bears great resemblance to a police state, like the Turkish state, which is so effective at controlling political opponents and minorities, display such weakness and inefficiency when it comes to the traffickers of the highly powerful Turkish mafia? This is a point which warrants close attention on our part as we now prepare to assess the conditions for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, which I consider to be very well-balanced, and I endorse the firm statement contained in paragraph 52, makes no mention of the genocide of the Armenian people: this may be the result of intense lobbying, of pressure put on the Members of Parliament by the Turkish Government. We must not forget the rights of the Diaspora – of the children of the victims of that holocaust – who are spread throughout Europe and are European citizens, just like us. The situation, as described by the Human Rights Association, is certainly not encouraging: a political police which interrogates, tortures and rapes women, especially Kurdish women, and ongoing persecution of ethnic and religious minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Oostlander report, however, over and above its more general objective and balanced formulations, is mainly characterised by the clarity and frankness with which it notes and brands Turkey's permanent weaknesses, shortcomings and imperfections in the fields of the rule of law, democratic governance, human and minority rights and its lawful international conduct. In other words, something that should have been done a long time ago, instead of the practice to date of avoiding any candid description of reality for various reasons which serve political and other interests, by demonstrating a poorly conceived tolerance, by having two sets of weights and measures and by citing misleadingly labelled arguments, such as the strategic importance of Turkey, the beloved pretext of its trans-Atlantic protectors, or the alleged need to send positive messages to Ankara – as we heard for the umpteenth time just now – and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The unproductive results of this essential beautification of what is a wholly reprehensible and censurable situation are now obvious and, with all due respect Mr President-in-Office, even the most dreamy apologists of the lenient treatment of and attempts at rapprochement with Turkey must be disappointed, because not even the positive messages which have been sent out for years have resulted in a correspondingly positive response from Turkey, nor has European tolerance been duly appreciated by the Turkish establishment which, on the contrary, has taken it – and perhaps rightly so – as encouragement and acceptance of its policy, whereas if the European position had been expressed earlier with the same courageous honesty of the Oostlander report, perhaps the prospects of the so-called European orientation of Turkey would be more auspicious and there would be fewer reasonable reservations and doubts as to the extent to which this country is legally entitled to be even a candidate for integration into the European family.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is better late than never, however, and with the even faint hope that Ankara will finally understand the real message of the European Parliament and will proceed accordingly in its choices, I unreservedly support the Oostlander report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This position on my part is based on the following reasons:</p>
<p class="contents">First, as a Greek I should like this neighbouring country of Greece's to grow and develop the creative ability of its people within the democratic frameworks which the European Union safeguards all its members. I believe that the Greek people and the Turkish people will have a unique opportunity to cooperate in the joint effort for a peaceful and prosperous Europe and mutually supportive, deeper bilateral relations between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as a socialist, I should like to see a democratic Turkey safeguard institutional guarantees for all the freedoms of its citizens so that they can intervene creatively and unimpeded in the development of their society in accordance with the desires, expectations, inspirations and output of their work. I believe that the economic and cultural development of Turkey as the consequence of the freedom of action of its citizens under the rule of law will have exponential benefits for Turkey itself to start with, for the European Union certainly and, without any shadow of a doubt, for rapprochement, understanding and cooperation on the part of the countries and peoples neighbouring Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a personal reason why I champion the accession of Turkey to the European Union. I am convinced that the interventions of the military in the political life of a country, either directly or indirectly, do not solve any problems. On the contrary, they cause problems and impasses to accumulate in their country. I have no particular regard for or trust in nation-saving soldiers the world over, who see any free expression or action as a military target to be neutralised using every means, not excluding, of course, bans, imprisonment, torture and natural extermination. Turkey's European prospects therefore depend on the soldiers returning to their barracks and being supervised by the political leadership democratically elected by the people to govern them. Thirty years ago, when a military junta took it upon itself to bring the Greek people to their senses from the excesses of their democratic excitement, the EEC, as it was then, froze the association agreement with Greece and that helped us considerably in restoring democratic normalcy to my country. The personal reason I referred to earlier has to do with the fights and experiences of that era.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an opportunity for the Turkish people to enjoy a smooth transition, without sacrifice and tragic consequences, to a fully operational parliamentary democracy, a democracy with all its accompanying parameters. The European challenge, therefore, also serves Turkey's democratic prospects. Turkey must interpret this challenge as a unique opportunity on its course towards Europe. It is in its hands, its political leadership wants it and the Oostlander report lays down the preconditions for avoiding misunderstandings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now more balanced, and this is undoubtedly an improvement. It is to be expected that a report like this one should make mention of a certain number of deficiencies and lapses, especially relating to issues of human rights and public freedoms. On all these points, I believe one can only agree with the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I cannot agree as fully with one of the rapporteur’s personal preferences, which, though concealed for the most part by the amendments, is nevertheless latent and sometimes explicit. I am referring to what I would term Mr Oostlander’s pathological aversion to secularism and the secular ideal. This aversion also made an appearance in the brief oral presentation during which he mentioned what he called Turkey’s political philosophy. Through a consideration of the historical context, he likened this philosophy to totalitarianism, one of the most monstrous forms of political oppression Europe has ever spawned. In point of fact, Mr Oostlander, Kemalism was by no means a totalitarian system, and did not follow totalitarian models. Kemalism, which was unquestionably a form of enlightened despotism, set out to modernise Turkey rapidly, drawing its inspiration to a not inconsiderable degree from Western European democratic models, most notably those of the separation of Church and State and secular republicanism.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, Mr Oostlander, as Turkey applies to join the European Union (and it is natural for that application to give rise to discussion and even argument), any pride it can take today in its positive historical legacy is attributable to that very attempt to introduce our European secularism into a Muslim society. For that, as some of the honourable Members have said, is the challenge, or one of the challenges, of the twenty-first century. I do not think there is any justification for adopting the disgruntled attitude you have shown towards the secular ideal in recital G of your report. Today’s Europe is rooted in that ideal, which stands out with great clarity, to my mind, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have accepted. You ought to adopt the opposite stance, welcoming the secular ideal more warmly and valuing it more highly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Turkey had the right to apply for membership. I believe that it will have the right to remain at the application stage for some time, for its progress is slow and must be monitored closely by us. That does not give us licence simply to parrot the phrase ‘some progress, but could do better if he tried’, so beloved of schoolteachers. We must not forget that application for membership of the European Union is akin, for Turkey, to the United States’ experience of the concept of the frontier at the end of the nineteenth century. That kind of stirring, pioneering front provides the impetus to move further on. From that perspective, we must encourage Turkey’s application.</p>

On the one hand there is the secular state, on the other the strong position of the Turkish army reflected in the power of the National Security Council, which implies military power over civilians. In a real democracy, this should actually be the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the secular state in Turkey be maintained and democracy established? The army cannot be the ultimate guarantee for democracy, so far-reaching reforms are called for here. As is abundantly clear from the Oostlander report, the country is not yet a democracy as long as human rights are violated and as long as the rights of minorities are not absolutely guaranteed. Torture is a matter of daily practice. The position of the Kurdish language, the exclusion of the Kurds from political life, or at least the attempt to exclude them, is evidence of the fact that they do not want a political solution to this important conflict of nationalities. The threat of fundamentalism remains, although the AKP has adopted a reformist policy. We recognise that major progress has been made in legislation, such as the abolition of capital punishment, but far-reaching reforms have not yet been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 11 of the Oostlander report, it is suggested that serious work be done on constitutional matters. Needless to say, this cannot be a condition, but it is still worthwhile to suggest that a new constitution be put in place, one that makes room for human rights, but also for the autonomous Kurdish community, and one in which the position of minorities is safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a splendid report, which lists all the critical points without offending Turkey. It is fair and open, and I believe that anyone applying for accession has the right to be treated fairly and openly.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I would like to contradict both of the previous speakers. It is not – as is written in the minority opinion – about precepts of an almost parareligious nature; clause 3 states specifically that fundamental European values, although based on the Judeo-Christian legacy, but also encompassing the values of the Enlightenment, do not stand in the way of the accession of a Muslim state in principle. In view of what you, Mr Nordmann and Mrs Maes, have just said with regard to secularism in Turkey, I can only call upon you to inform yourselves! There is no freedom of religion, and there is no secularism along French lines. Secularism in Turkey means 130 000 state employees monitoring and harassing the non-Muslim minority. There are no rights for Christian religions in Turkey. Separation of state and religion is one thing, but guaranteeing freedom of religion is another. It is an inalienable part of the European system of values that every individual should be allowed to live according to his or her religion and practise it. In Turkey, this is not guaranteed. Until 1954, it was a punishable offence to provide religious instruction. I therefore really entreat you to inform yourselves on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The other points mentioned were the role of the army, minority rights for the Kurds, the right to vote, in other words the fact that the 10% hurdle is still in place, the imprisonment of persons motivated by political or moral conviction such as Leyla Zana, who will soon have spent ten years in prison for speaking freely, or the issue of the heritage of the Armenians and Syrians, which is not protected at present in Turkey. It is a long list, and one that Turkey must work through. That is its obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">I especially welcome the point made in clause 52 of the report that, in the light of the Copenhagen decision, this is not the start of negotiations. For this to happen, the conditions must be met. This will be reviewed at the end of 2004. I also agree with the fact that the review is not to take place now, but at the end of 2004. Furthermore, as an interim report, this report can in no way signify that Parliament has committed itself one way or another with regard to a later decision to approve or reject Turkey’s application for accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It struck me how simple it is to cross the Bosphorus, even simpler than crossing the Öresund between Sweden and Denmark. The Bosphorus Bridge took me from the more ancient Istanbul to the more modern Üsküdar. There is no sense of passing from one part of the world to another. Helsinki, in Finland, is still further to the east than Üsküdar on the shore of Anatolia.</p>
<p class="contents">The assertion that the Bosphorus divides two parts of the world and that the EU must stop there is both inane and vacuous. We should instead be delighted to take on board the interest shown by Turkey in becoming a member of the EU. We should give the country the help it needs in order to reform itself and become a perfectly satisfactory future candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is a worthy European cooperation partner. Having been a member of NATO for many years and being adjacent to more troubled and conflict-ridden areas, Turkey would remain a key country as a future cooperation partner. To try to set up religious obstacles to Turkish membership of the EU would be not only deeply unfortunate but also downright unchristian.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us makes demands of Turkey, demands that must be met if EU membership is to be possible. The report, which is very constructive, nonetheless holds the door clearly open in order to facilitate the future accession of Turkey.

<p class="contents">There is a whiff of hypocrisy when this House turns to look at Turkey: I do not see the same approach and the same attitude to the other accession and candidate countries. I would put to the honourable Members here today that if the same criteria had been applied, the histories of some of the current Member States would have disbarred them from membership of the European Union. What we have to send today is a message that we are consistent in the application of our principle. We have to support the reformers, we have to encourage change; or we do the reverse, we discourage the reformers, bring about the growth of fundamentalism and shut the door on Turkey forever.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased at the comments from the Commissioner. A lot has been achieved, the reforms are impressive and it is right that we should acknowledge that. The President-in-Office of the Council said there are two priority areas. My priority areas are these: to encourage reform and to accelerate the process of reform. The perception in Turkey (I was there ten days ago), amongst politicians and ordinary men and women, is that the European Union does not want Turkey to join. Sadly, in this debate that prejudice, I feel, has been reinforced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dell'Alba (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nordmann expressed himself in the most eloquent terms. Following the example of Mr Cashman just now, I would also like to declare my support for Mr Nordmann and, taking up his arguments, join him in expressing the conviction that there are many unspoken prejudices in this report. Such prejudices should not figure in an objective account of the state of a nation. Naturally, the political beliefs of all interested parties should be respected. I subscribe, however, to what the honourable Member said about secularism and about a consideration of the very essence of the Kemalist state. Such a consideration was entirely absent from the report, as was, by all appearances, any mention of the efforts of the current Prime Minister of Turkey to bind his country securely to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, Mr Oostlander, if this Parliament had been given the possibility of producing a report as detailed as this one not only on the countries applying for accession, but also on the current Member States of the Union (I am thinking here of my own country), the fact is that it would have taken not 56 paragraphs, but perhaps twice that, to deal with conditions in Italian prisons, the state of the Italian legal system, and many other areas besides, in which things are going badly. In our countries too, ladies and gentlemen, or in some of our countries at least, there was a time not so long ago when people went to prison because they were Jehovah’s Witnesses and did not want to do their military service. They were compelled to do it by force, or thrown into prison. Our countries have experienced all of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey must, of course, make significant progress. We cannot have it both ways, however: either we offer Turkey a landfall on the coast of Europe, or else we refuse it. If we opt for the latter, we not only make a catastrophic political and strategic error: we also point Turkey, push it, in a way, towards other coasts, other shores, which would be much more dangerous not only for stability but also, I believe, for the welfare of the Turks and their progress towards democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, my radical colleagues in this Parliament and myself, together with Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank, have tabled an amendment designed precisely to avoid closing the door on Turkey, as the Oostlander report does. The first draft of this report, whose tone brought to my mind the Battle of Lepanto more than anything else, has, of course, been improved in the meantime. We have therefore tabled an amendment in which we declare ourselves convinced that the conditions for Turkey to be admitted to the accession negotiations will be fulfilled as long as the Turkish Government pursues its current programme of essential reform with steadfastness and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has suggested that the amendment be included as an addition, showing a desire to compromise which I applaud. It is in a similar spirit of compromise that I accept the rapporteur’s offer, following the example of the Verts/ALE Group. In doing so, I hope that we can also come to an agreement on a message to Turkey whose dominant theme is not that the door is closed, but that we are waiting for real progress. Obviously, when the moment comes, everyone will be able to take their own decisions. Let us at least leave that door open, however. With this in mind, I hope that the House will approve this amendment unanimously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result is a resolution which is acceptable as a compromise but which we might have liked to be marked and inspired by greater optimism so as to send Turkey a more positive message, as Commissioner Verheugen advocated too, despite the fact that this country still has a great deal to do and many changes and innovations to make before it can hope to join the European Union, as the resolution rightly states.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to establish whether geography and religion are criteria which restrict the possibility of accession or whether Europe is conceived as a set of values and principles with the result that countries that share those values and principles of democracy and freedom have the right to apply for membership. It is in this spirit that, to Article 52 of the report, which notes that the conditions for opening negotiations are not yet in place – which is undoubtedly true at present – we prefer the version contained in Amendment No 11, to which Mr Dell’Alba referred just now, which expresses the positive view, the confidence that the requirements can be met if Turkey carries out the necessary reforms. I too am grateful to Mr Oostlander, who appears to be willing to accept this amendment, if not as a replacement for point 52, at least as an addition to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Certain extreme formulations, which would have compromised political relations between Parliament and Turkey, have been eliminated. Although the report rightly points, however, down the road towards respect for human rights, along which the country still has to travel, it is nevertheless still a partial and ideologically charged report in my book. It attempts to stamp Turkey with its own view of European values.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 3 invokes a set of European values rooted essentially in Judaeo-Christian culture. If this paragraph is not amended, it will be a slap in the face for an essentially secular country under Muslim government. It will also be unacceptable to us Europeans, as it will mean the return of old scourges and the renewed influence of religion in political affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">If we must mention Judaeo-Christian values, why do we not also mention Judaeo-Christian crimes? A re-reading of <span class="italic">The Gospel according to Jesus Christ</span>, by the Portuguese Nobel Prize Laureate José Saramago, is necessary to remind us how many crimes have been committed in the name of our gods. Well, let us take the gods out of the running. Let us acknowledge once and for all that Europe is secular and contains many different religions. Let us also deal firmly but fairly with Turkey’s application to join the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, treating them honestly and openly also includes the right to be critical and to point out deficiencies. We want to help Turkey on its path to true democracy and the rule of law. Turkey deserves fair treatment, and Mr Oostlander’s report is fair. It describes the remarkable progress that is being made, but also states in all honesty where reform is still badly needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, what is important is that Turkey itself must want to make progress in terms of meeting the Copenhagen criteria. It must not work on these reforms primarily to appease the critics in the EU, to do us a favour, so to speak. Turkey must embed the necessary reforms deep within its own society, and the reforms must have an impact in real life. Constitutional amendments on paper, or new laws on paper, will not be enough on their own. Paper is patient! What is crucial is to implement reforms in people’s daily lives. So far, however, it is precisely this that we have yet to see. Mr Oostlander’s report describes the many shortcomings that exist in all areas. It notes that the conditions for opening accession negotiations have not yet been met at the present time, and calls upon the Council to take a clear and consistent position at last. The Copenhagen criteria – and this must be stressed over and over again – are not negotiable. This applies equally to all candidate countries, and so it also applies to Turkey. Turkey must also be fair here for once towards the EU and acknowledge this fact. Turkey must stop passing the buck to the EU and trying to exert pressure. It was not us who promised the Turkish people rapid accession within a few years; Turkish politics itself bears sole responsibility for this. If Turkish politics now finds itself having to provide explanations and the population is becoming impatient, it is a problem of Turkey’s own making that must be resolved in Turkey and not by the EU by softening the accession criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">What Turkey can expect from us – and it really can – is honesty, openness, seriousness and fairness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel that the Oostlander report is very well-balanced and frank. The European Union is a Union of shared values. Thus, all the countries which have become Members in the past and those which are joining the Union now share these values and, in order to join the Union, have brought their institutional, political and economic systems into line. This is the bottom line. It is not the European Union which wants to become part of Turkey but Turkey which wants to subscribe to these shared values. We must respect the diversities which make up the rich heritage of the European Union, but the limits are defined by respect for the Copenhagen criteria, for the principles of democracy and the rule of law, and these criteria and principles must not just be proclaimed but enforced and lived. I would venture to say that the countries which intend to share our European culture may become part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is applying to join. We are not opposed to this in principle. We are waiting for the country to complete the process of adopting our cultural values. The Erdogan government must be encouraged in the process of moving Turkey closer to the values of the European Union. The ideological NATOists believe that Turkey’s role in NATO could be its trump card when it comes to joining the European Union. That might have been so in the past, but we now believe that NATO, with the participation of Russia, will gradually have to assume, with a slightly more effective contribution from the European Union, an international policing role, serving a United Nations which has been reformed to safeguard human rights and democracy in the countries of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Turkey will be able to act on these proposals, to resolve the Cyprus issue and to establish good neighbourly relations with all the countries on its borders, resolving longstanding conflicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
