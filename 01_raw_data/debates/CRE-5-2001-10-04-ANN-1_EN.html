<p>Of some 2000 Kosovars who were kidnapped and held hostage by the military and paramilitary forces belonging to the regime then in place in Belgrade in the days leading up to the international police operation in Kosovo more than 28 months ago, 229 are still being held in Serb prisons. One hundred of them are being held for common law offences, while the remaining 129, including the student leader Arbin Kurti, are being held for their convictions or for 'political' offences. In February 2001 the Serb and Yugoslav parliaments passed an amnesty law allowing the release of 30 000 Serbs and some 400 Kosovars. At the end of April 2001, 143 prisoners were released from Jakova prison. The Serb judicial authorities had stated that the cases of the remaining Kosovar prisoners would be the subject of a rapid judicial review followed by release. Despite these commitments given by the Belgrade authorities, however, and despite the Council and Commission's repeated promises to intervene forcefully in order to put an end to this intolerable situation, the matter has still not been resolved.</p>
<p>Has the Council decided no longer to consider it a priority to resolve this issue? If not, what initiatives will it take in order finally to bring about the immediate release of Arbin Kurti and the 129 Kosovar hostages and the transfer of the 100 Kosovar prisoners still being held in Serbia for common law offences to the UNMIK, which is the only competent body in this connection?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council is continuing to monitor the issue of Kosovar prisoners in Serbia very closely and has stated on several occasions that it is in favour of the swift release of all those imprisoned for purely political reasons under the regime led by Mr Milosevic. Furthermore, the amnesty adopted this year by the Belgrade Parliament is a direct result of pressure from the European Union on the new democratic government of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The Council would like to remind the Honourable Member of the progress that has been made in this area. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which, following an agreement reached with Belgrade, monitors the health and conditions of detention of these prisoners, has informed us that there were approximately 2 000 Kosovar prisoners in September 1999. Since then, their number has decreased with each passing day, in line with the commitments given by the Belgrade government to the international community and the European Union. At the end of August 2001, there were 226 Kosovars still detained in Serbian prisons, approximately 50 of whom were being detained for political reasons.</p>
<p>The Presidency of the European Union and the Commission, in the course of their regular contacts with Belgrade, particularly as part of the Stabilisation and Association Process and the consultative Task Force which was set up in order to monitor the implementation of the commitments given in this area by Belgrade, have stressed that the swift release of all political prisoners is a matter of urgency, is one of the conditions for opening up real prospects for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to join the European Union and is a significant measure of confidence for resolving the Kosovo problem.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member mentioned Mr Albin Kurti, one of the political prisoners who are due to be released very shortly by Belgrade. Nevertheless, according to our information, the Serbian legal authorities have not yet completed the evaluation of his case. The ICRC has visited him on a regular basis and the last visit took place during the summer. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0732"></a>

<p>The mobility of labour in Europe is extremely sluggish owing to red tape and legal obstacles, but also to language problems and cultural differences, which hamper progress towards the objectives for development set in Lisbon. Studying and gaining a qualification at a university in a country other than a student's country of origin provides a more solid foundation than the ERASMUS and SOCRATES programmes for creating a European employment market and cultivating a European outlook. Despite this situation, relations between the education systems suffer through lack of information and mutual recognition, and the failure to treat local applicants for places and applicants from other Member States on an equal basis.</p>
<p>Does the Council have details of the Member States' policies on accepting European students and, if so, what are its views on those policies? Will it take initiatives to promote the approximation of the secondary education systems and the adoption of common policies by the Member States, and encourage young Europeans to study in a Member State other than their own country?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to the question of conditions for accepting European students in other European countries, the Council must emphasise that it does not have any national data on this and recommends that the Honourable Member contact the relevant national bodies for information.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to reiterate that Article 149(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community defines the competencies of the Community, particularly with regard to education, and states that the Community shall contribute to the development of highquality education by encouraging cooperation between Member States, and, if necessary, by supporting and supplementing their action, while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member States for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems, and their cultural and linguistic diversity. From this perspective, as the law stands, the Council has to give a negative answer to the second question by the Honourable Member, while pointing out that the Council is, in any case, unable to act on its own initiative.</p>
<p>However, promoting mobility, which is quoted by the Treaty as one of the Community’s spheres of action (Article 149(2), second indent, ex Article 126), is one of the key aims of the Socrates, Leonardo and Youth programmes. The Council is aware of the obstacles to this mobility and, on 14 December 2000, it adopted a resolution for a plan of action in this area.</p>
<p>The Council also reminds the Honourable Member of the recommendation of 10 July 2001, which was adopted under the co-decision procedure with the European Parliament, on mobility within the Community of students, persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and trainers.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to point out that it is closely following developments in the Bologna process, launched by the joint declaration signed by the higher education ministers of 29 European countries on 19 June 1999 and which was confirmed by 32 European countries in Prague on 19 May 2001. This is, more specifically, an initiative based on transnational cooperation, which aims, amongst other things, to facilitate mobility and mutual recognition in higher education in Europe. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0735"></a>

<p>The Council recalls to the Honourable Member the answer it gave to an identical question raised by Mr Gerard Caudron (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0462_EN.html">H-462/01</a>) on the occasion of the Plenary session last June.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Council is not competent to supervise the implementation of legislation, and therefore is not competent to comment on events and developments in individual enterprises. The Community legislation to be respected in this area regards in particular the following instruments:</p>
<p>- Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies (OJ L 225, 12.8.1998, p. 16);</p>
<p>- Council Directive 94/45/EC of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purpose of informing and consulting employees (OJ L 254, 30.9.1994, p. 4); and</p>
<p>- Council Directive 97/74/EC of 15 December 1997 extending, to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Directive 94/45/EC on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purpose of informing and consulting employees (OJ L 10, 16.1.1998, p. 22).</p>
<p>The Council is well aware of the difficult situation faced by employees of companies having decided the closure of unprofitable parts of their businesses in situations where as a whole they are profitable. Regarding the specific question of large-scale redundancies, the Council in June reached political agreement on a common position on a new directive on informing and consulting employees within undertakings. It is to apply, inter alia, in cases of business restructuring and other substantial changes with consequences for the employees, including the level of employment. Thus a fundamental objective of the directive is to improve the position of the workforce in situations described in the question.

<p>Nevertheless, the Council recalls that it can only act on the basis of proposals from the Commission. If the Commission were to submit such proposals for its consideration, which is not the case at this stage, the Council would be ready to act quickly.

<p>The Council is implementing the Action Plan against drugs that was endorsed by the European Council at its meeting in Feira in June 2000. A special section of this Plan is devoted to supply reduction. In order to reduce substantially over five years the availability of illicit drugs, adoption of measures was agreed in the fields of operational border control, maritime drug trafficking, combining forensic and law enforcement information, training of law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>The last three presidencies have actively started to implement the action plan. Under the last presidency a formal agreement was reached on forensic profiling and on 14 March 2001 a public Council debate took place on law enforcement action in the drugs field. The Presidency has listed as a priority the Council Framework Decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in co-operation with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, the Presidency has scheduled a high-level conference on the problem of synthetic drugs, which will take place in Brussels on November 19<span class="sup">th</span>. The conference will focus equally on the demand and supply reduction, and intends to provide a platform for discussion of measures aimed at policy lessons and future challenges for both European and international drug control agendas.A progress report on the implementation of the Action Plan has to be presented before the end of 2002.</p>
<p>The Council stresses that Europol is a major instrument in the fight against illicit supply of drugs.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>As regards prevention the Council has adopted in December 2000, the Council conclusions on networking information on emerging trends and patterns in drug abuse and poly-drug use and the associated risks. Moreover, at its meeting of June 2001 the Council has agreed on a programme of Community action in the field of public health that covers also drugs.</p>
<p>Money laundering</p>
<p>The Council has adopted a Framework Decision of 26 June 2001 on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime. According to this Framework Decision, an approximation of criminal law and procedure on money laundering, in particular confiscation funds, is contemplated. Moreover, the scope of criminal activities which constitute principal offences for money laundering should be uniform and sufficiently broad in all Member States. Therefore the Member States shall take necessary steps not to make or uphold reservations in respect of the Strasbourg Convention of 8 November 1990 on Money Laundering. The Member States shall also take necessary steps to ensure that money laundering offences are punishable by deprivation of liberty for a maximum of not less than 4 years and that they can enforce a value confiscation, both domestically and at the request of another Member State. Furthermore, the Member States shall take necessary steps to ensure that requests from other Member States for mutual assistance is given the same priority as such measures in domestic proceedings. The Member States shall implement this Decision by 31 December 2002.</p>
<p>The Council is currently working on a draft Framework Decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing assets or evidence. This draft Framework Decision is applicable to i.a. illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs. The aim of this draft Framework Decision is that a freezing order in one Member State shall be recognised in another Member State without any formalities involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0744"></a>

<p>The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, informed the House this morning about the conclusions of the extraordinary meeting of the European Council held on 21 September 2001. At that meeting, the Council analysed the international situation in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States and imparted the necessary impetus to the actions of the European Union.</p>
<p>Let me then simply reiterate the broad outlines of the action plan adopted at that meeting.</p>
<p>The European Council decided that the fight against terrorism would henceforth constitute a priority objective of the European Union.</p>
<p>That commitment involved the adoption of a five-point action plan:</p>
<p>The first point covers the requisite enhancement of police and judicial cooperation, which involves the introduction of a European arrest warrant and a common definition of terrorism.</p>
<p>In practical terms, measures will be taken to identify the terrorists and the organisations which support them and to strengthen the role of Europol and its cooperation with the USA.</p>
<p>The second point in the action plan involves the development of international legal instruments. Some such instruments already exist and need to be implemented. Consideration should also be given to the idea of framing a general convention against international terrorism under the aegis of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The third aspect on which the European Union wants to concentrate is the funding of terrorism which must be ended. Accordingly, it would be useful if the extension of the Money-Laundering Directive and the framework decision on freezing assets were adopted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The fourth point concerns air transport security. The Union intends to work rapidly on a raft of technical and specific measures seeking to improve air transport security. Such measures would cover, for example, the checking of luggage, technical training for aircrews, and quality control of security measures applied by the Member States</p>
<p>The fifth point concerns the coordination of the European Union’s global action. The common foreign and security policy will have to be strengthened so that the fight against terrorism may be further integrated therein. The Union’s relations with third countries will have to be systematically reviewed in the light of the support which those countries might give to terrorism.</p>
<p>Finally, the fight against terrorism requires the Union to give its all in the efforts being made by the international community to prevent and stabilise regional conflicts. The Union will act most effectively if it develops a genuine common foreign and security policy and makes operational the European security and defence policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0766"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the following statement made by the Council in its conclusions of 20 September 2001.</p>
<p>The Council would reiterate how important it is for the quality of Europol analyses that the police authorities and also the intelligence services of the Member States should quickly pass on any relevant information on terrorism, in accordance with the terms of the Europol Convention. On this point, the Council is instructing the Director of Europol to report back at its meeting on 6 and 7 December 2001 on the input provided by the Member States into the analytical work files opened on terrorism, together with an analysis of any problems.</p>
<p>That was backed up by the call made by the European Council meeting in extraordinary session on 21 September 2001 in Brussels for the Council to undertake identification of presumed terrorists in Europe and of organisations supporting them in order to draw up a common list of terrorist organisations. In that connection, it reaffirmed that improved cooperation and exchange of information between all intelligence services of the Union would be required. With more direct reference to the Honourable Member’s question, the European Council reached agreement that it would ask the Member States to share with Europol, systematically and without delay, all useful data regarding terrorism. In addition, a specialist anti-terrorist team would be set up within Europol as soon as possible and would cooperate closely with its US counterparts.</p>

<p>1) The prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is laid down not only in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also in Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The institutions of the European Union have already transposed this Article by enacting, in 2000, Directive 2000/78/EC, which abolishes discrimination in employment, including on grounds of sexual orientation. The Directive must be transposed into national legislation by 2003 and is part of the acquis communautaire which the candidate countries must also apply.</p>
<p>2) This prohibition also forms part of the Copenhagen political accession criteria which see ‘stability of institutions’ as ‘guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of minorities’. The Commission's commitment to this has been shown with respect to the Romanian laws which it has been considering from the outset because of the significantly discriminatory elements they contain. The Commission therefore welcomes the emergency regulation decriminalising homosexuality, which Romania passed in June 2001.</p>
<p>The Commission has also raised this problem in connection with Cypriot legislation.</p>

<p>The Commission shares Mrs Theorin's view that the transposition and implementation of the acquis in the area of equal treatment must be acknowledged as a matter of high priority and great importance, and regards it as a precondition for accession.</p>
<p>No exceptions were made on equality of treatment, nor were any transitional periods granted. The Commission will guarantee that the new components of the acquis communautaire in this area will also be fully transposed before accession.</p>
<p>In June 2000, the Commission adopted Directive 76/207/EEC on equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions. A proposal has been made for a directive to amend this. A common position was established at Council level on 23 July 2000. The Commission hopes that this directive will be adopted before the end of 2001, as was proposed at the European Council meeting in Stockholm.</p>
<p>The draft directive was presented to the candidate countries in the context of the latest sessions of the subcommittees set up by the European Treaty. Once the directive is adopted, the candidate countries will have to formally accept it as a new component part of the acquis communautaire and transpose it by the time of their accession.</p>
<p>The candidate countries are participating in the Community's Equal Opportunity Programme, the aim of which is to make the public more aware of equal treatment issues, to collect data and produce statistics on the subject.</p>
<p>The Commission concedes that some legislative measures on equal treatment are still needed in several candidate countries, principally with regard to their ability to enforce them.</p>
<p>The current year in particular has seen great progress in this field, which, for most of the candidate countries, has contributed to the provisional conclusion of negotiations on the 'social policy and employment' chapter.</p>
<p>Careful monitoring will, however, be needed even after negotiations on this chapter have been concluded, and the Commission will guarantee it by means of expert missions, frequent contact with the responsible authorities in the candidate countries, through subcommittees, monitoring tables and Regular Reports.</p>
<p>The candidate countries were called upon to produce precise timetables for the adoption and implementation of all equal treatment measures and also to submit more precise information on enforcement and practical transposition, in particular with regard to appeal procedures and the roles of the various control agencies . This request was generally complied with.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0755"></a>

<p>Would the Commission consider it acceptable under EU law if applicant countries in central and eastern Europe exempted certain groups of EU citizens, for instance expellees and their descendants, from transitional arrangements before expiry of the transition periods and granted them full freedom of establishment and an unrestricted right to purchase real estate, e.g. from the date of accession?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU has successfully negotiated transitional arrangements with the candidate countries in respect of investments in real estate. It has been possible to provisionally conclude negotiations on this issue with nine candidate countries and to find a solution for several countries which grants a transitional period in respect of farmland and forests, and also for the purchase of second homes.</p>
<p>It should, however, be the general rule that EU citizens resident in the candidate countries enjoy the same rights after accession as do the countries' citizens. Several candidate countries did not request any transitional period and will therefore be applying the acquis from the date of their accession.</p>
<p>On completion of accession, EU citizens who were expelled from their homelands will be able to settle in the candidate countries and buy property there in the same way as other EU citizens.</p>
<p>It must be recalled in this context that the return of property does not feature in the negotiations on the free movement of capital. It is therefore not included in the acquis, but falls within the remit of the Member States alone.</p>
<p>On the question of what practical effects the transitional periods will have on the right to buy property in the candidate countries that negotiated them, I would like to say that the solution differs from country to country, depending on what transitional period was agreed on, and on current law in the country in question on the acquisition of property by nationals of foreign States.</p>
<p>There are no transitional periods for the three Baltic States and Slovenia, which means that, with effect from the date of accession, EU citizens can invest there without restriction.</p>
<p>EU citizens or independent farmers wanting to settle in the Czech Republic or Bulgaria can, on accession, purchase land and property in the same way as the citizens of these countries.</p>
<p>In Hungary and Slovakia, an independent farmer must have been resident in the country for three years before entering into the enjoyment of the same rights as the citizens of these countries.</p>
<p>A four-year residence period is required for the purchase of a second home in Hungary. Negotiations on this point are still proceeding with Poland and Romania.</p>
<p>It must furthermore be emphasised that no transitional periods were accorded with respect to first homes, that is to say, an EU citizen wanting to move to one of these countries after its accession can always buy the house which he wants to make his permanent abode. Moreover, with the exception of the agricultural and forestry sector, unrestricted entrepreneurial investment may be engaged in from the date of accession onwards.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0756"></a>

<p>The Commission considers the Pyrenees, like the Alps, to be a sensitive mountain area, although it believes that we have to differentiate between these two mountain regions. The Alps are an almost saturated bottleneck while the Pyrenees present an obstacle to interconnection that should be breached whilst respecting environmental requirements. The Commission is concerned about the increase in the number of lorries crossing these mountain ranges (+10% per year) and the negative effects of this situation on quality of life and ecology.</p>
<p>The Commission’s strategy in this field is clearly explained in the White Paper on Transport. Modal transfer will take place by means of more efficient rail and sea services and by means of a considerable improvement in the infrastructure of this region. To this end, the Commission has co-funded improvement measures for the border terminals between Irún and Hendaye and between Portbou and Cervera. Furthermore, thanks to the PACT programme, regular coastal services have been implemented between Bilbao and Rotterdam and between Valencia, Livorno and Salerno in Italy.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes, within the framework of the review of the guidelines on the trans-European transport network, to add a new rail project crossing the centre of the Pyrenees. This project will be classified as a ‘specific’ project (the so-called Essen list) under the same conditions as the major projects for crossing the Alps, such as Lyon-Turin and the Brenner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0723"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware that distortions of competition can arise from subsidies to market operators.</p>
<p>However, it has to be clarified that the future “Marco Polo” programme will not only subsidise specific short sea operations, but also rail and inland waterway services. The aim of the Marco Polo is to transfer goods from road to other modes, in order to reduce road congestion in Europe and to improve the environmental balance of transport. To force this modal shift, incentives to industry are necessary.</p>
<p>Marco Polo, like its predecessor programme PACT, will insist on well-proven mechanisms to avoid distortions of competition in the market.</p>
<p>The honourable Member can be assured that the Commission, in the selection and monitoring of subsidised projects, will assess possible distortive effects of subsidies with the utmost care. The Commission will also have at its disposal mechanisms to react swiftly, if unacceptable distortions of competition should result from any grant.</p>
<p>The Commission has gained quite an extensive experience in managing such subsidies since 1992, when the Pilot Actions for Combined Transport were set up. I am thus confident that it will also in the future manage such programmes successfully.</p>
<p>It cannot just sit and watch as the problem increases every day.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>In the wake of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York, many sectors of the European economy are facing a crisis, particularly the aviation and tourist sector.</p>
<p>Will the Commission bring forward a package of measures to assist these sectors, and would it also consider relaxing its guidelines on state aid to the aviation sector?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The terrorist attacks in the United States will have an adverse economic and financial impact which is not limited to the airline industry, but to which the airlines are very much exposed.</p>
<p>The immediate signs are that demand has decreased significantly, that some costs are rising – notably insurance – and that uncertainty about future developments is weighing on the industry.</p>
<p>On September 20<span class="sup">th</span> the Commission met the Committee of the Presidents of the European Airlines Association, in order to analyse the difficulties and to assess possible responses by the Community.</p>
<p>Following the conclusions of the meeting of ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance held in Liege on September 21<span class="sup">st</span>-22<span class="sup">nd</span>, the Commission has taken note of the wish of several Member States to support their air companies by providing special guarantee mechanisms to cover the increased insurance costs they have to bear.</p>
<p>Since any action conferring financial advantages to transport operators is likely to fall under article 87 of the EC Treaty, by letter of September 24<span class="sup">th</span> the Commission has reminded all Member States their duty to notify in advance this type of measure, as well as any other possible State interventions. It has in particular stressed that, according to Article 87.2.b of the EC Treaty, Member States may be authorised by the Commission to "grant aids to make good the damage caused by exceptional occurrences", if those aids are clearly limited in amount and duration, so that any overcompensation threatening intra-Community competition is avoided as well as any abusive exploitation of the American tragic events to cover losses which some European air companies might have faced already before the crisis.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently elaborating a methodology to analyse any support measure to the air industry in the light of the above-mentioned article 87.2.b as well as of other Community rules on State aids. It intends to submit its proposals on the subject to the Council and the Parliament by mid October.</p>
<p>As far as the tourism sector is concerned, the Commission does not intend to provide specific assistance. Existing Community financial instruments, in particular the Structural Funds, already make it possible to co-finance measures regarding the sector that would help to tackle a crisis. Since these instruments are managed by the authorities in the Member States, it is up to them to decide what use to make of them.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing a communication in which it will propose a strategic and contextual framework for tourism policies and activities taking place in the Union.</p>
<p>This will identify a pragmatically defined and limited set of coherent measures and activities to be put in place by the various stakeholders. In this context, the Commission will also take into account the actual and likely consequences of the terrorist attacks of 11 September on the sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member’s question refers to the measures to be taken to protect nuclear installations against attempted terrorist attacks. The question focuses on nuclear installations other than those for electricity generation.</p>
<p>The attack carried out on 11 September 2001 does indeed raise the issue of the implications of a similar attack against a nuclear installation. In that connection, it should be pointed out that, not least in the light of concerns relating to non-proliferation and protection against radiation, the nuclear sector has some of the strictest safety and security standards of any industry.</p>
<p>The Member States, which have, unfortunately, already been the target of terrorist attacks, have long-standing arrangements designed to provide protection against such attacks. The Member State authorities immediately stepped up the physical measures to protect nuclear installations, for example checks on persons entering such installations.</p>
<p>The press has reported details of a study claiming to show the particularly dangerous effects of an attack on the reprocessing plants in The Hague and Sellafield. Since it is not in possession of a copy of that study, the Commission cannot comment, but takes the view that a sensible, methodical approach is required.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to point out that the design and construction of nuclear power stations is solely a matter for the Member States. The events in New York have highlighted the need to consider the factors, which make nuclear installations vulnerable. In close cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, the Commission will thus carry out such a study, focusing on the security of nuclear installations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0692"></a>

<p>The Commission is supporting research and studies into Alpine and Arctic regions as part of the activities of the 5th Framework Programme for Technological Research and Development, in particular, and also with other activities.</p>
<p>For example, therefore, with regard to the Alpine region:</p>
<p>- the EMERGE project is studying the effects of pollution, climate change and anthropic pressures on high-altitude lakes;</p>
<p>- the GLORIA project is setting up a network for observations and measures, which aims to detect signs of climate change and, in particular, changes in biodiversity and distribution of vegetation;</p>
<p>- the ECOMONT project is investigating the effects of changes in land use on mountainous ecosystems;</p>
<p>- the SUSALP project is assessing the impact of Community instruments on the mountain environment and agriculture and is proposing guidelines for sustainable development;</p>
<p>- the ALP-NET project is a network for exchanges of information between local authorities and scientists on trans-alpine transport in order to set up harmonised methods for data analysis with the view to influencing future political decisions. This network has been in operation since April 2001 and will continue until October 2003. There are plans to set up working groups, such as ‘A regional problem with European consequences or a European Problem with regional consequences’, which will be held on 27 and 28 May 2002 in Italy.</p>
<p>Several other projects are tackling the problem of natural risks (land slides, risks of avalanches, reduction in the permafrost), or those relating to biodiversity or agriculture.</p>
<p>A study was also carried out in order to assess the environmental impact of transporting goods by road, particularly the specific problems relating to the effects of traffic in mountainous areas. The report, published in December 2000, also contains a number of case studies in the Alpine region and in the Pyrenees. The report can be found on the European Environment Agency web site: </p>
<p>With regard to the Arctic, several projects are underway to detect signs of climate change by monitoring changes to glaciers or by evaluating CO2 and CH4 emissions in the tundra and the taiga. Furthermore, a large-scale project, THESEO, is investigating the shrinking of the ozone layer over the Arctic.</p>
<p>In addition to these scientific research projects, the Commission is currently calling for tenders to carry out a study into mountainous regions (including Arctic regions). The aim of this study is to clarify or update a definition of the criteria for defining mountainous zones, to collate statistical information, to carry out geo-referencing and create a database that is compatible with the geographical information contained in the Eurostat-Gisco reference database, and to analyse the situation of the Community’s mountainous regions. The initial results of this study are expected to be available during the second half of 2002.</p>
<p>Lastly, in 2002, International Year of Mountains, the Commission intends to organise a seminar to explain how to best apply Community policies in mountainous regions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0693"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member makes reference in the question to the progress report adopted by the Commission on 25 July last and transmitted to the Parliament and the Council the following day<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>. The report described progress in evaluating the active substances used in plant protection products in the Community as governed by Council Directive 91/414/EEC on the placing of plant protection products on the market<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>. Complementing the report is a detailed technical annex, available on the Commission Internet site<a href="#defann_22_3" name="refann_22_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">3</span>. Without going into details and avoiding repeating what is in the report itself, the following key points need to be made:</p>
<p>- The directive entered into force in 1993 and the early years were devoted to building the foundations of the evaluation process such as fixing data requirements and agreeing on guidelines. The testing requirements are so comprehensive that an industry dossier takes a minimum of four and a half years to prepare.</p>
<p>- All dossiers (about 50,000 pages each) are then evaluated very carefully by the Commission and the Member States and it can take a couple of years before everybody is sufficiently satisfied with a dossier to enable a decision to be taken.</p>
<p>- It is only recently, as the first substances came out of the process, that decision-making has accelerated from one or two decisions per year to about 30 per year at the moment. With new measures put in place recently, this rate should increase in the future.</p>
<p>- To minimise the duration of market distortions, substances have been prioritised to enable evaluations and decisions on the major ones to precede those of minor ones.</p>
<p>- It was recognised already in 1991 in the directive that the target of 2003 was ambitious and the directive explicitly provides for the eventuality that the final date could be postponed by the Commission for specific substances to allow their evaluations to be finalised. The need for such a postponement was recognised in Commission Regulation 451/2000<a href="#defann_22_4" name="refann_22_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup">4</span> setting up the second and third phases of the evaluation programme.</p>
<p>- The major obstacle to the completion of the programme in 2003 is that dossiers are not yet available for substances in the later phases of the programme. Considering the time required to complete testing and build up a dossier, compounded by the finite number of testing facilities in the world and the fact that pesticides have to compete not only with each other for testing, but also with biocides, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, it will not be possible to complete the testing of substances and to build dossiers for all substances in good time to complete all evaluations by 2003. The original deadline cannot reasonably be respected.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under the current circumstances, the Commission does not believe it is necessary or appropriate to extend the facility of using leguminous plants produced on set-aside land under Regulation (EC) No 1251/1991 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to all producers.</p>
<p>Restrictions concerning the use of vegetation do not apply to the cultivation of leguminous plants on set-aside land. This cultivation is perfectly integrated into the appropriate environmental measures for set-aside land, to be applied by Member States.

<p>The Commission can inform the Honourable Member that it has recently adopted a Communication to the Council, the Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on certain legal aspects relating to cinematographic and other audiovisual works, in which it considered the issue of ratings. Audiovisual works are generally subject to rating of their content, indicating for which age ranges they are considered suitable.</p>
<p>In the public consultation on the issues contained with the Communication, a certain number of commentators considered that differences were the result of cultural differences and did not affect circulation significantly and therefore should be dealt with at a national level. Others were in favour of action to address this issue.</p>
<p>In its Report on the Recommendation on the protection of minors and human dignity the Commission has stressed the need to have a coherent approach across all media. The Commission intends to continue this work and to evaluate which systems could be put in place, which would address this problem, whilst taking account of the cultural differences existing between the Member States. The Commission recognises the important cultural aspects of ratings, to be decided in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and governance as set out in its recent White Paper, but considers that further analysis should be carried out of the role played by self-regulatory schemes such as NICAM in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to launch a Study on the rating of films, for cinema, television, DVD and videocassette in the European economic area (EEA). The study will evaluate the reasons for, and the impact of differences between the different national laws or self-regulatory measures for rating of films on their subsequent marketing.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that these initiatives will address the issue raised by the Honourable Member, and provide a sound basis for future decisions on this important subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0702"></a>

<p>The Commission has already had the opportunity, in the spring of 2001, to explain how its proposals to the Council concerning olive oil (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0855">COM(2000)855</a>), and the accompanying measures that it has taken (Regulation (EC) No 648/2001), provided a response to the criticism made by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p>The difficulties highlighted by the Court of Auditors are dated prior to 1999 and those relating to the statistical estimates have been alleviated by new methods introduced in 1999 and 2000.</p>
<p>As far as the insufficient checks on mills and national sanctions are concerned, the Commission introduced a number of measures at the end of 1998 (Regulation (EC) No 2366/98) and after analysing the initial results, these measures were amended and strengthened again in March 2001 in order to increase their deterrent effect.</p>
<p>Regarding the absence of the Geographical Information System (GIS), which was criticised by the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the Council have made this a key point of the future aid system. The GIS could enable us to limit the potential for abuse within the current system, or could enable us to envisage a different system.</p>
<p>The implementation of national GISs depends on the Member States. The Council decided, however, that following two campaigns, as of 1 November 2003, aid would in one way or another be linked to the existence of a GIS.</p>
<p>There is no ban on blending Community olive oils with olive oils from third countries, or with other vegetable oils. The problem is not, therefore, how to prevent this blending, but how to directly and clearly label blended oils for consumers. A Community regulation already exists in this area. Following Parliament’s resolutions and the Council’s debates, this regulation will be strengthened and changed. The Management Committee for Oils and Fats has already carried out work on this issue.</p>
<p>Allegations regarding inflated declarations by olive oil producers are constantly being made, but of course, no one is able to assess the extent of this problem. The system of checks put in place, which in some respects is one of the most stringent in the common agricultural policy (CAP), is entirely geared towards preventing these inflated declarations.</p>
<p>Inflated declarations have had very limited consequences on the budget since Guaranteed National Quantities were introduced in 1998.

<p>Overall, the policy of dialogue and engagement with Iran has proven constructive and helpful. The 7<span class="sup">th</span> meeting in this context was held in Tehran on 3 September. The Commission believes that this is one of several fora in which concerns relating to the status of women can be discussed.</p>
<p>The Iranian Foreign Minister Mr Kamal Kharrazi met with the member of the Commission in charge of External Relations on 10 September. The human rights situation, including women’s rights, was indeed raised on that occasion as well.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to raise these issues and would suggest that the rights of women be mentioned in the envisaged Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The Commission expects to be able to submit recommendations for a negotiating mandate to the Council in November.</p>
<p>Should severe setbacks in Iran’s human rights situation occur, it would naturally affect the possibility of reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission has noted with satisfaction the efforts by the Iranian Parliament (Majlis) to raise the status of women and girls. It welcomes – as stated in Resolution 2001/17 on Iran by the Commission on Human Rights – recent improvements in the field of women’s education, health and democratic participation. The Commission, however, is concerned that some suggested measures have yet to be promulgated into law and to be implemented in practice (raising the age of marriage is one such example). It will continue to monitor these developments closely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0725"></a>

<p>Responding to the question of the honourable Member, no, the Commission cannot guarantee that demonstrators who were arrested and identified during the meetings in Goteborg and Genoa, but are not suspected of any criminal offence, will not be registered in the Schengen Information System(SIS).</p>
<p>The Commission would like to recall that the issue of maintenance of public order and security during European Council meetings is the competence of Member States, as established in article 33 TEU. In line with article 36 TEU, the Commission is fully associated with the work in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and actively supports the efforts of Member States in the prevention of serious disturbances at high-level meetings. In doing so, it always keeps in mind the need to guarantee the freedom of people in the Union to express their opinions and assemble, peacefully and without threat to their integrity or that of their property, as fundamental rights enshrined in the Union Charter.</p>
<p>As regards the registration of people in the SIS, however, it must be recalled that such registration is the exclusive competence of the national authorities of the Member States. (Art. 105, 106 Schengen Convention).They must ensure that the data that they enter are lawful, accurate and up-to-date. The persons who can be registered in the SIS are restricted to specific categories and subject to a corresponding action to be taken by the authority that eventually finds them. The categories are regulated in Art. 95-100 of the Schengen Convention : persons to be arrested for extradition purposes; third-country nationals to be refused entry; missing persons; witnesses to appear before judicial authorities. Among these categories, there is the possibility to insert alerts on persons for the purpose of discreet surveillance and specific checks where there is clear evidence that the person intends to commit or is committing "numerous and extremely serious criminal offences" or when on the basis of past criminal offences there is reason to suspect that the person will also commit extremely serious criminal offences in the future (Art. 99).</p>
<p>It is important to remind that any person has the right to obtain the deletion of her/his data when unlawfully registered in the SIS and can ask to the National Supervisory Authority of the State concerned to check whether the processing or use of the data does violate her/his rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0731"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the existence of specific cases, reported in the Spanish and international press, regarding the situation of a number of teachers in Spain.</p>
<p>Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, adopted on 7 December 2000 by the Nice European Council<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> prohibits any type of discrimination based on a non-exhaustive list of criteria including religion or belief. Nonetheless, the Charter is addressed to Member States only when they are acting within the scope of European Union law. The Charter does not apply to activities that fall outside the scope of European Union law and concern areas that fall within the remit of national governments, as is the case under current Community law for the events mentioned by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>On 27 November 2000, on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the EC, the Council unanimously adopted Directive 2000/78/EC<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and aims to combat various forms of discrimination. As a general principle, this Directive prohibits any form of direct or indirect discrimination based on, amongst others, religion or belief.</p>
<p>The Directive must be transposed, however, into the national law of each Member State before 2 December 2003 and, until then, the Commission has no power to monitor whether it is being applied.</p>
<p>In any event, Article 4(2) of the Directive specifically concerns the case of a difference in treatment that may be justified due to certain occupational requirements, in organisations that have religious affinities. In these organisations, a number of tasks or activities may have to be carried out by employees who share their religious views or have appropriate beliefs. Article 4(2) therefore enables churches and other public or private organisations, the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, to justify a difference in treatment based on the religion or belief of a person when this religion constitutes ‘a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement’ by reason of the nature of these activities, or of the context in which they are carried out. Article 4(2) therefore allows these organisations to require that those working for them show honesty and loyalty towards the organisation’s ethic. These differences in treatment must be considered individually and the Commission is unable to provide general guidelines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Council adopted a ‘mobility action plan’ in December 2000. This year, the Commission set up a Skills and Mobility Task Force in order to obtain more in-depth information about this issue and to propose strategic areas for consideration.</p>
<p>More specifically, with regard to Member States’ policy on accepting European students, the Commission only has limited information. This information has come about from organising studies at national level and from internal provisions taken by each establishment.</p>
<p>The Commission does not plan to make formal proposals to approximate secondary education systems, although shared challenges may call for shared solutions which may lead to a certain degree of approximation.</p>
<p>The Commission is already offering incentives at higher education level to help students who wish to pursue part of their studies abroad, via the Erasmus programme.

<p>The Commission recognises the environmental and health hazards of cadmium. Cadmium is persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic and has no known useful biological function. It is acknowledged that cadmium which has been released in the environment cannot be taken out again and might finally find its way in the food chain. Because it poses real health problems, it should not enter into the environment.</p>
<p>While the substitutes are sometimes at different stages of technical maturity, cadmium batteries can be substituted in a number of applications (such as mobile phones, computers, camcorders, power tools, emergency lighting). In some other applications, in particular industrial applications, alternatives are either not yet available, or they have technical disadvantages.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining the feasibility of a phase-out of NiCd batteries by the year 2008. At the same time, the Commission is also looking into the respective merits of other options, amongst which a deposit scheme, to ensure that cadmium does not enter the environment through its application in batteries.</p>
<p>The outcome of a general risk assessment on cadmium has been promised by the responsible authorities for some time and is now scheduled to be available within a few months. The ongoing targeted risk assessment examines in detail whether the use of cadmium in batteries causes risks to health and the environment, and if so, at which stages in the life cycle of these products. According to the work plan of the Technical Meetings on substances assessed under the Existing Substances Regulation (793/93), an in-depth discussion on major parts of the draft targeted risk assessment is foreseen at the next meeting in December 2001. A further discussion on the targeted risk assessment on cadmium oxide in batteries is envisaged for the meeting in March 2002. Subject to a positive outcome of these discussions, the agreed draft risk assessment report will be finalised by June 2002.</p>
<p>In the light of this work, the Commission will also consider whether, in the absence of available and/or conclusive information, it is appropriate to apply the precautionary principle in line with the Commission’s Communication on the Precautionary Principle (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0001">COM (2000) 1</a>) in this case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

It is composed of senior United Nations military and professional civilian staff (in co-operation with UNICEF) to investigate and report on all allegations concerning incidents involving serious misconduct by members of UNMEE.</p>
<p>UNMEE has declared that the Mission has zero tolerance towards such acts, and that it will do its utmost to quickly and thoroughly establish the facts. Once the information has been gathered and assessed, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, will determine the scope and depth of appropriate measures to be taken, bearing in mind that the Italian units allegedly involved in these acts have already been rotated and replaced by new Italian peacekeepers.</p>

<p>The EU’s competition rules call for the opening up of competition, but the borderline defining which services are covered by the scope of competition law seems from the local authorities’ point of view to be ill-defined. Borderline cases occur, for example, in the areas of water management and energy, in which the local authorities have responsibilities for providing a service of general interest.</p>
<p>The proposal currently before the European Parliament does not in my opinion resolve this issue.</p>

<p>On 20 September 2000, the Commission adopted a Communication on Services of General Interest in Europe (published in the Official Journal of the EC No C 17/4 of 19.1.2001). In its Annex II, the Communication defines services of general interest as market and non-market services which the public authorities class as being of general interest and subject to specific public service obligations. The case law of the Court of Justice (ECJ) has clarified that the Community competition rules can only apply to those services of general interest which are of an economic nature. Moreover, Community competition law does not apply where it can be excluded that the case in question involves effect on trade between at least two Member States. The Communication gives a comprehensive overview of the principles for assessing effect on inter-State trade and of cases in which the Court of Justice or the Commission have considered activities to be of non-economic nature, notably intrinsic prerogatives of the State, State-organised education and the management of State-imposed social security schemes which are based on the solidarity principle. The fact that certain services are provided without the intention of profit-making is according to the Court of Justice only an indication but not a sufficient element to consider them as non-economic in nature. With regard to the provision of energy, the treatment of cases under Community competition law as well as Community legislation for the liberalisation of this sector have made clear that this is economic activity. The same is true for the sector of water management in which the Commission has scrutinised various mergers in recent times.</p>
<p>Beyond these principles and their implementation in the cases already decided by the Court of Justice and the Commission it would be difficult to draw up an abstract list of services which should not be covered by the scope of Community competition law. This is because of the particularities of each individual case. The determination whether a certain service is subject to Community competition law should therefore in principle be left to the assessment in the case at hand. This will lead to further guidance through a growing body of decided cases.</p>
<p>Moreover, with regard to services which are covered by Community law, the Communication of 20 September 2000 illustrates the various ways in which Member States can ensure the safe and reliable functioning of services of general economic interest without running into conflict with the Community competition rules or other provisions of Community law. The most important means are (a) general interest obligations, e.g. relating to quality, regularity and territorial coverage, which the State may impose non-discriminately on every undertaking operating in the market, or (b) the attainment of the same objectives through the entrustment of a specific undertaking with the provision of a services of general economic interest. Moreover, the Community rules on the control of State aid in principle allow Member States to compensate undertakings which have been entrusted with a service of general economic interest for the extra costs incurred in providing this service.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0751"></a>

<p>The United Nations Drugs Control Programme (UNDCP) organised donor assessment mission to which the honourable Member refers took place from 23 April to 3 May 2001. The purpose of the mission was to look at the effectiveness and consequences on the Taliban ban on the cultivation of opium poppy in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The report indicated that the poppy ban was effectively implemented. This information was later confirmed by Europol and the department of State.</p>
<p>The Commission’s expert who took part in the mission is a Technical Assistant who is currently the Programme Co-ordinator for aid to uprooted people in Afghanistan and Pakistan and is based in Peshawar. The Programme Co-ordinator has had a number of years of experience working for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) inside Afghanistan and therefore knows the country and its problems well.</p>
<p>The mission produced a joint report, to which the Commission’s expert gave a technical input. The principal recommendations concerned the need for immediate food assistance through World Food programme (WFP) to those populations most seriously affected by the poppy ban and the subsidised delivery of basic components for substitution crops – essentially seeds and fertiliser.</p>
<p>The mission also proposed that UNDCP should oversee the continuing enforcement of the poppy cultivation ban; facilitate missions by other concerned international organisations and NGOs; endeavour to obtain commitments from the Taliban concerning stockpiles of opium/heroin; approach the Northern Alliance to request that they also ban opium cultivation, stockpiling and trafficking in areas under their control.</p>
<p>Other recommendations concern seeking with the Taliban a suitable methodology for the repayment of debt by highly indebted small farmers; the study of policies for sustainable non-drug related development and an evaluation mission to look at judicial and law enforcement aspects of the drug trade in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The mission was to the principal opium producing provinces of Afghanistan, namely Helmand and Nangarhar.

With regard to poverty levels, the Commission states (on page xiii) that 20-25% of the population in Greece and in Portugal has an income below the poverty threshold, while long-term or chronic poverty affects 10% of the Greek population. On page 48 of the same publication we learn that Greece ranks last but one in the Union for total investment in learning, while it comes a clear last in terms of public education’s share of this investment, in contrast to that of private education (including the voluntary and religious sectors) where the amounts are – in relative terms – fairly satisfactory. Finally, with regard to the relation between technological capacity and development the Commission says (on page 134) that southern Macedonia, central Greece, the Peloponnese, the northern Aegean and the Ionian islands fall into a category eloquently dubbed ‘technological deserts’.

<p>The selection of priorities for publicly financed investment in Greece – for example, for education or for research – is largely a matter for the national government. Since 1989, the European Union has supported economic development programmes under the Structural Funds which seek to reduce socio-economic disparities between Greece and the rest of the Fifteen. As the report referred to by the Honourable Member confirms, these programmes have helped Greece to reduce the gaps with the rest of the Union in many key fields.</p>
<p>For example, 'with regard to research and development, it is worth emphasising that past investments have produced results: Attica, Central Macedonia and Crete have recorded growth rates above the European average as a result of increasing their technological potential and of the effects of training provided in locally produced materials. As the Honourable Member points out, some regions are indeed considered to be ‘technological deserts’ due to their lack of investment in research and development. Nevertheless, it must be emphasised that this type of investment must be undertaken selectively and in line with the potential and the needs of the regions concerned.'</p>
<p>For the current programming period, 2000-2006, the Greek authorities, in partnership with the Commission, have decided to increase financial allocations in favour of human resources development by 20,6 %, as part of an overall increase in investment in human capital of around 42,5 %. Further increases are foreseen in the context of the mid-term review. These decisions reflect the results of the ex-ante evaluations carried out by the Greek authorities which revealed the need to improve the quality of human resources in the country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0760"></a>

The Commission will, at the appropriate time, present proposals on the use of these appropriations when it knows how many and when the new Member States will join.</p>
<p>With regard to the period after 2006, the Commission adopted, as the Honourable Member mentioned, the second report on economic and social cohesion in January 2001. The Commission used this report to open a wide-ranging debate on the future cohesion policy, its aims and how it is to be implemented. The Commission will present its proposals in the third cohesion report, which is scheduled for publication at the beginning of 2004.</p>
<p>We must stress that the questions on the financial impact of the cohesion policy in the Community budget cannot be tackled in an isolated manner. The proposal on the new financial perspectives will also include amounts for other Community policies and will be presented in 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0762"></a>

<p>Given the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB in developing countries, no efforts must be spared in combating those diseases. The joint declaration of the Development Council and the Commission (2352<span class="sup">nd</span> Council meeting, on 31 May 2001), which welcomed the proposal for a Global Health Fund to fight these diseases and stating that contributions to the Fund should be additional to existing resources, was therefore very welcome, as was President Prodi's commitment in Genoa of a EUR 120 million EU contribution to this Fund in 2001. Regretfully, however, there seem to be difficulties in terms of living up to the promise of financing this through additional resources. It is thus crucial to look to the future immediately, if we are to avoid reoccurence of such a situation. Given the fact that the Fund, in order to have a real impact, will need substantial annual contributions from donors such as the EU, what specific plan does the Commission have in terms of proposing the necessary legal basis for such contributions, and what options does it foresee in terms of financing them without encroaching on already scarce resources for development cooperation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s view that no effort should be spared in combating diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries. The Global AIDS and Health Fund constitutes an innovative and important mechanism to this end, and the Community contribution of €m announced by the President of the Commission thus responded to a very urgent and immediate need. With regard to the funding sources to be drawn on for this contribution, it should be stressed that the possibilities for sourcing and allocating additional resources at very short notice are limited. The sum pledged by the Commission will thus be committed out of a combination of unspent 2001 funds and 2002 EDF funds (European development fund). However, the Commission appreciates the need, underlined by the Honourable Member, to avoid encroaching on other important priorities for development cooperation. Therefore, the Commission is at present actively exploring options to ensure that any future contribution to the Global Health Funds represents additional development funding.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0767"></a>

<p>In the interests of protecting people and the environment it is of decisive importance to take account of the effect a product has on the environment throughout its life cycle. In view of this, will the Commission, at the WTO meeting in Qatar, pursue the issue of the right to prohibit imports of a product on the grounds that it was processed using a process with a significant negative impact on the environment, or that it contains substances which are prohibited in the EU, and which leak out into the environment either when the product is used or when it is treated as waste?</p>

<p>The World Trade Organisation (WTO) regulations do not in any way prevent WTO members from banning imports of products that are harmful to the environment or products that are banned in their country.</p>
<p>With regard to manufacturing processes which are not directly linked to the product itself, the Commission believe that instead of banning imports, it would be more appropriate to use eco-labelling to provide consumers with clear information, so that they themselves can decide whether or not they want to buy the product. This approach gives developing countries the possibility of responding to the market and of exploiting the market for environmentally friendly products.</p>
<p>In this respect, again well in advance of the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle, the Community has called for eco-labelling systems to be recognised in a positive light. These systems, similar to its own, are based on the analysis of the product throughout its life cycle. This objective remains on the Community’s agenda for the forthcoming WTO ministerial conference in Doha.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0769"></a>

<p>1. The Commission states that, pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Charter’s provisions ‘are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union […] and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law.’</p>
<p>Consequently, and subject to the legal effects attached to the Charter as proclaimed at Nice last December<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, citizens of the European Union may invoke the Charter in their dealings with the institutions of the European Union as well as with Member States when they are implementing European Union law.</p>

<p>2. The Commission believes that, as part of their respective competences, the case laws of the Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights are developing along similar lines. Any conflict of competences between the two courts would therefore serve no real purpose. The Commission also acknowledges, however, that simply becoming a member of the European Convention on Human Rights and including the Charter in the Treaties would enable the risks of conflict predicted by the Honourable Member to be avoided.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It is still too soon to give a full assessment of the budgetary consequences of the events of 11 September 2001. At this stage, we can point out the following details:</p>
<p>The Extraordinary European Council of 21 September asked the Commission ‘to set up urgently an aid programme particularly for Afghan refugees’. The Commission is in the process of analysing the situation of the chapters concerned within the 2001 budget, with a view to taking action as quickly as possible, at the invitation of the Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the light of the conclusions of the European Council to develop the Common, Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and to make the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) operational at the earliest opportunity, the Commission considers it a priority to set up a mechanism for secure communications in order to ensure contact is maintained between the headquarters and delegations in third countries that are at risk.
