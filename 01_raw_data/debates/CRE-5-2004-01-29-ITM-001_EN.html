<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Laschet (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what do the European Union and the United Nations have in common? Why has Parliament produced a report on the subject? Is there nothing more pressing? Does a parliament really have to look at every single subject, even at those that are not particularly high on the agenda? That was what people said in 2002, when it was first suggested that Parliament should produce a report on the relationship between the European Union and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We had hardly had any political debates about the relationship between the two institutions – there were seven lines in reports of European Council meetings when at some point in the text there was a passing reference to the United Nations; and the only active institution was the Commission which, in the quiet, calm, effective manner familiar to all of us, paid 60% of the budget for development programmes for humanitarian aid. Of course, there were no major political implications or demands involved: it was very effective, but not related to any political message.</p>
<p class="contents">Then came the Iraq crisis, during which the US President described the UN as irrelevant. That was when Parliament began to say that this was perhaps an interesting subject after all, that we wanted to make relations between the European Union and the United Nations more political in nature, and that we wanted to produce a report in order to ask the other institutions to consider introducing more politics in our relations with the United Nations. Today, nearly one year after Parliament made that decision, we can now say that the United Nations is not irrelevant. Even the most powerful country in the world has realised that the legitimacy of the United Nations is needed in order to rebuild a state, to establish democracy and to create a nation. Here in Europe, the Commission issued a very significant communication in September – a political communication first and foremost – which defined relations between the European institutions, and also their future, in terms of a European Constitution. The Council is also much more active nowadays in seeking agreement with the United Nations, and I believe that today’s visit to this House by the Secretary-General of the United Nations marks the start of greater political cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, are the main subjects we need to discuss? One should be today’s message: the fact that the European Parliament is speaking out in favour of multilateralism. Not because, as Robert Kagan once claimed, the European Union favours multilateralism only because it is incapable of acting unilaterally. No, that is not the reason. Our reason is that the European Union is multilateral in structure and in nature. The horrific wars in the twentieth century taught us that multilateral cooperation is the right way to build a peaceful and just future, and the lesson we have learnt in the European Union holds true for the United Nations too – that is why we favour a multilateral approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the message that Parliament should send out today, and if we do so, if we want to play our part in the world, then we have to start by doing our homework. The Heads of State and Government did not do that in December, because the tasks included creating a legal status for the European Union to put an end to the situation whereby the Commission can go over the Community’s head because it is a member of the FAO, with a seat and vote, and whereby in political matters, we have no legal personality in Nairobi, Geneva or Vienna and so cannot act. The European Union needs a legal personality. We also need a European Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will have to bring together our policies with those of the Council and the Commission and represent us all internationally. That means we need a European Union representative at the UN offices, not a Commission office, a Council office and an office for the Presidency. No, we need a representative for foreign affairs, and that is what Parliament is proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also continue discussions after Kofi Annan’s visit. We need the Commission to produce an annual report that will get Parliament discussing the political priorities in order to establish how to proceed, what we have achieved and what we have not achieved. We need clarity in the budget, so that we know which institutions, agencies, and funds receive money from us, and which do not. I think, too, that Jean Monnet’s comment – that Europe should help make a better world – ties in very well with Kofi Annan’s message at the last General Assembly, where he said that the United Nations makes the world a better place. That we are combining the two today is ideal, and means that today is very significant both for Europe and for the United Nations.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to discuss relations between the European Union and the United Nations, and I want to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the quality of his report. Nobody who knows the honourable Member will be surprised that it is really an outstanding and sensible piece of work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress at the outset that the Commission is obviously ready to enter into a more regular dialogue with the Parliament on relations between us and the United Nations. It is important for both the Commission and the Parliament to have such an exchange of views on such an important subject. It is only when Parliament, Council and Commission – and indeed the Member States – work well together that the European Union collectively can deliver the support that is needed for the UN system.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member said, the timing of the report is extremely appropriate. The Iraq crisis has, in many ways, served as a wake-up call for us all on the essential role of the UN in questions of peace and security. The Union is an important partner of the UN and we should stand by our commitment to effective multilateralism. The full support of the House for this endeavour is important and I welcome it, especially on the day that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan will address the Parliament. The full Commission had the great privilege and pleasure of spending two-and-a-half hours talking to him yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission set out its views on the subject in a communication of 10 September 2003, entitled 'The Choice of Multilateralism'. The purpose of the communication was threefold. First and foremost, it was to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and the UN. Second, it was to demonstrate the manner in which we implement this commitment in our daily work. The paper provides an impressive inventory of the extensive cooperation between the EU and the UN that is already taking place, and of our support for UN activities on a wide number of issues, ranging from conflict prevention to development aid and from crisis management to poverty reduction. Whilst the issues of peace and security that are dealt with by the Security Council attract most of the media attention, it would be a mistake to focus our attention and support only on those questions. Third, we identify a large number of practical actions to improve our internal coordination on UN questions in the UN bodies themselves, in Brussels and also in the Member States, with the overall aim of enhancing our influence in the UN, and in an attempt to assist it more effectively. In response to this communication, the Council recently agreed on a set of comprehensive conclusions on EU-UN relations that provides a good platform for our future work.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate takes place at a time when the Union is looking for an enhanced role on the international stage. Witness to this are not only the proposals of the Convention to streamline the CFSP and the EU’s external action more generally – and here I note in particular the proposal to let the proposed foreign minister speak on behalf of the Union in the Security Council whenever there is a common EU position – but also the European security strategy with its leading theme of effective multilateralism. The European Union should be ready to stand up for its belief in the importance of the United Nations. I think that Parliament’s report represents an additional strong signal of support from the European Union at this challenging moment for the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Iraq crisis many in the international community have made great efforts to find our way back towards collective action, including renewed UN engagement in Iraq. Of course, it is not enough to keep referring to multilateralism over and over again as though it was some mantra. We need to think seriously and creatively about the kinds of results we want to obtain from multilateral organisations and instruments. How can we improve their effectiveness in dealing with the threats and challenges that the world is facing? These include poverty reduction, weapons of mass destruction, failed states, international crime, terrorism, climate change. And how best can we contribute to that endeavour? All these goals are addressed by the Parliament’s report and there is a broad meeting of minds with the Commission’s own communication on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that our common starting point is the belief that the UN system is the key to safeguarding international security in the largest sense of that term. Whether we are looking at the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in checking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or whether we are looking at global targets for poverty reduction and sustainable development, I hardly need to underline the importance of the so-called soft issues for the wider security agenda. Development and security are inextricably linked and mutually dependent. It is in this perspective that we should support the work of the high-level panel on UN reform established by the Secretary-General last year. The European Union should provide an input to this process and I welcome the intention of the Council presidency to work on the submission of an EU contribution. The Commission will participate actively in this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the European Union’s own internal coordination and operations of the UN, I am pleased to see that the Commission’s analysis and recommendations are very much in line with those that are presented in the honourable Member’s admirable report. As for the creation and subsequent implementation of multilateral instruments, the Commission shares the report’s opinion that the European Union should play a leading role and assist third countries in fulfilling their obligations, as we have done, for example, in relation to counter-terrorism. Parliament could in this context use its cooperation with third countries to address these kinds of issues and in that way help to build bridges between North and South.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by commending the report to the House and by underlining as well the Commission’s determination to work closely with the Parliament, with the Council and with the UN to implement the recommendations that are contained in it.</p>

We want to strengthen the European Union and also the United Nations, both of which have been weakened by the debate over whether and how to intervene in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the European Union is preparing to create its own Minister for Foreign Affairs, it should ensure that the role has plenty of substance to it. The road to a common foreign and security policy will also undoubtedly lead to greater cooperation between the EU and the UN. We are currently a global player, providing over half of all contributions to the United Nations and over 60% of total international development aid, but we should move on to become a global player capable of taking a leading role in this critical phase of the United Nations’ development and helping to shape the UN of the future. Strengthening cooperation between the EU and the UN should and can have a positive effect in developing multilateralism. It can and should also affect all activities undertaken by the two organisations: the fight against terrorism, conflict prevention, human rights, crisis management, environmental protection and weapons of mass destruction. This would clearly demonstrate the reality of cooperation, and in practical terms, would lead to the implementation of the EU’s Millennium Objectives, which were established in 2000. If we are to do this, the EU must have more influence within the United Nations. UN-specific elements can be included at all levels of the European Union, and it seems appropriate for the European Parliament to be included in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because the idea of the EU speaking with one voice in the United Nations Security Council still seems somewhat idealistic, multilateral instruments and commitments should be used to boost the EU’s role and profile within the United Nations. Perhaps one way to move ahead would be to produce a concrete proposal on compliance with the treaty on weapons of mass destruction and the UN Security Council’s role in ensuring it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Subsequent developments, in Iraq in particular, have demonstrated that things are never simple, and the current situation can be described by means of the lyrics of a Spanish song which say ‘neither with you nor without you is there any relief for my pain’. There is no such relief either <span class="italic">with</span> the United Nations – which demonstrated, not in Iraq, but in relation to previous terrible crises, in Rwanda for example, its powerlessness to prevent tragic outcomes – or <span class="italic">without</span> the United Nations, as demonstrated at the moment by this ridiculous impasse of an intervention which has no political solution in a country such as Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group's position on the Laschet report has been one of broad agreement, with the emphasis on certain fundamental aspects. The first is a strong commitment to principles and values. In response to the idiotic criticism of those people who believe this to be idealism, we could reply that values are interests. In our societies and in the whole world, the application of principles and values is our principal interest. While, moreover, we are talking about lesser interests, we can state that the material contribution of the European Union and its countries is so great and so disproportionate to its political weight within the UN system that the European Union is obliged to commit itself to making progress towards a modification of the current state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two ways of doing this: one is the establishment of a common and strong European Union foreign and defence policy; the other is to make progress towards a European Union presence on the Security Council in a positive way and on the basis of speeding up the current constitution-building process, which ensures that the voice of its peoples, by means of their representatives, are respected by governments and that we establish as soon as possible a European Constitution which allows us to implement a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than ever, major world problems require a global approach, which entails effective decision-making and implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN should undergo a thorough overhaul in order to reflect the new relationships and to carry out the many tasks in an adequate manner. Everyone here is agreed on this, yet nothing is being done because everyone has a different opinion on how it should be. It is hypocritical to embrace the UN millennium declaration if we are subsequently not prepared to act on it and stick our necks out for it. UN reforms are not only technical, but often involve a redistribution of power, and that is where things are going continually wrong. For example, the reform of the Security Council has been the subject of squabbles for more than ten years, with no results so far.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States is by far the most powerful player on the world stage and has little need of multilateralism, which it regards as a restriction of its power. Other countries, including France and the United Kingdom, refuse to relinquish the privileges they have inherited from the old world order. Potential permanent members do not grant each other favoured positions. Permanent seats for continents only work if the regional powers can agree on a rotation mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed double veto system is better than what we have at the moment, but offers no real solution, especially not if the number of permanent seats is being increased still further. Instead of this, it would be preferable to use a European model of differential vote weighting, and hence to abolish the veto system. I do not believe that the European Union's political coordination in the UN is as bad as Mr Laschet suggests in his excellent report. Generally, there is most definitely EU consensus in the General Assembly. Despite this, Europe appears hopelessly divided in major crises, such as over Iraq. In my opinion, this is mainly attributable to the increased rivalry between France, the United Kingdom and Germany. A legal entity, or even an EU minister, will be unable to create common foreign policy as long as the big European states continue to fight for EU leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laschet report contains many interesting recommendations for building up relations between the European Union and the UN. Some are very valuable, but there are perhaps too many for the short term. We have to be careful not to create another UN-EU bureaucracy. In my opinion, the main role of our Parliament is in the area of monitoring and not so much in the diplomatic arena.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlarged European Union can, and must, make a substantial contribution to the desperately needed reforms of the United Nations. Political necessity is beyond dispute; what is still lacking is the political courage to give shape to the new world order within the UN in a decisive manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our group does not have an homogeneous opinion on the report by Mr Laschet – although I recognise that the contributions made have been accepted – since our positions range from favourable to sceptical, as befits a pluralist group.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to point out that we attach great importance to this report, as well as to the contributions made by the Commission to improving the international panorama, and we are clearly in favour of multilateralism – as I have said previously – although we believe that the situation puts excessive emphasis on anti-terrorist aspects and does not give sufficient emphasis to better international cooperation aimed at eliminating the causes of inequality and injustice, such as the democratic control by the UN of agencies such as the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank which, at the end of the day, are the bodies which can create greater justice in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in view of the need to improve relations between the European Union and the UN, which is key to creating a panorama in which there is respect for human rights and international legislation, we believe we should have gone a little further in terms of improving the conditions for greater justice in the world. That is why our position on Mr Laschet’s report is going to be divided into several different positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The weakness of the European Union lies in the fact that it has been incapable of integrating the sovereignties of its Member States in a way that would have led to consistent respect for human rights and a foreign and security policy which is genuinely based on global multilateralism. Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union has often proved very unsatisfactory in this regard. Of course there are exceptions, as exemplified by the support for the UN International Criminal Court. The 2001 action programme against torture, on the other hand, has been very much a case of empty rhetoric. The EU in this way is still a creation of the Cold War, merely searching for its identity and role in the world. In the absence of a strategy, tactics become the strategy, and action is taken on an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> basis. It is partly for that reason that the EU has less muscle in the UN than its importance and contribution might warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s UN communication from the autumn and the recently published document ‘The Enlarging EU at the UN’, as well as the report now before us contain a lot of useful information and many interesting proposals. It is not enough, however. Our historic duty is now to take responsibility for creating a more sustainable world order which would cover everything from a cooperation-based security model to the prevention of climate change. Cooperation within the UN and its many special bodies is vitally important. I might mention, for example, the social norms in respect of human rights and the environment for multinational and other companies adopted by the UN’s Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights and similar minimum guarantees for loans for development projects drawn up by the World Bank’s International Financial Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we can correct the worst distortions of globalisation our Community of values too will prove to be nothing more than a façade. We will all then be the losers.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the very day on which we are discussing this report and when we will be receiving Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General and Sakharov Prize-winner in 2003, Parliament has received depressing news from the Jurassic Park of dictatorships: we are being prevented from receiving Oswaldo Payá, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">This authoritarian ban by Fidel Castro’s communist regime in Cuba, which brings to mind the worst excesses of the Nazis and the Stalinists in the twentieth century, draws attention to an important part of this report, which states that, as regards the United Nations and its reform, the European Union and others must succeed in placing human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms at the top of the world agenda, with all the consequences suggested in paragraph 19.</p>
<p class="contents">Oswaldo Payá’s situation is a scandal, as is the hostile gesture the Cuban regime has directed at this Parliament. It would be even more scandalous if nothing were said publicly about these scandals. We are sure that, through Kofi Annan, Parliament will send a powerful message to Cuba and that, in the form of a permanent open invitation to Oswaldo Payá, we will continue to express our active solidarity with the winner of the Sakharov Prize 2002 and with all Cuban democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish lastly to express my appreciation of some of the rapporteur’s amendments, namely Amendment No 8, which draws attention to the importance of the Convention on human cloning and to the Costa Rican initiative, which we must support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only in this way does it appear possible to create peace, welfare and justice with the UN as central, vital and decisive pivot.</p>
<p class="contents">Multilateralism is being embraced as the new political gospel. Is this pipe dream not based on a huge overestimation of the human race? After all, people like you and I are prone to evil of all kinds. True peace and justice do not ensue from people. They can only be obtained by a true belief in God, by an unconditional surrender to His will, and, by His grace, obeying His healing Commandments enshrined in the Bible, God's Word. Jesus Christ underwent the punishment that brings us true peace. It is because that point is all too readily forgotten that I should like to start by bringing it to your attention.</p>
<p class="contents">In keeping with his eminent introduction, the rapporteur considers cooperation between the European Union and the UN a cornerstone of EU foreign policy. In the institutionally reformed UN of the future, he more or less already assumes that the EU would be a future legal entity. The EU's future Foreign Affairs Minister will, on the basis of the future European Constitution, need to fulfil the future mandate on behalf of the EU. In addition, the Security Council will need to be extended to include permanent members, one for each continent, except for Australia, which is odd. Why is this enormous continent being excluded? For fear of double vetoes, no doubt? Instead of Great Britain and France, it is the EU that is to represent Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To describe the situation in this manner is extremely premature, to say the least. The EU has no constitution, is not a legal entity in the UN and there is no mandated European Foreign Affairs Minister. Moreover, the recent past has acutely demonstrated that both in the IGC and in the Security Council, European unity seems to be further away than ever. That is why it will not work, and so I would urge Members to support Amendments Nos 1 and 10 and, in doing so, to come back down to earth.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off by making two remarks. First of all, only once – in paragraph 17, second indent <span class="italic">and</span> in brackets – is there any reference to NATO, which has been proven to be the most effective transatlantic organisation for security. You know as well as I do that when the chips are down, we prefer to see our guarantee of security in the hands of a reliable and determined NATO and will never hand it over to an ever-doubting, often indecisive and divided, UN Security Council. NATO is a better cornerstone for the EU's foreign and security policy than the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, multilateralism is good but never unconditional. Too often have we seen it used as a cloak under which national states look only after their own interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has to be recognised, however, that the proposed method runs counter to these two objectives. Articles 10 and 12, the core of the resolution, propose to expand the Security Council and to weaken the current veto system by replacing it with a requirement for a double veto, when the subject is the fundamental issue of threats to peace, chapter 7. This challenges the two fundamental rules governing the effectiveness of the system: the limited number of members and the veto incentive available to each permanent member.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Europe’s influence, it is difficult to see how halving the number of permanent members in the Security Council could strengthen it. This, however, is what is implied by the proposal to make the European Union a permanent member, ‘as soon as its legal personality is recognised’. This seat, of which there could only ever be one, would be occupied by the infamous European Minister for Foreign Affairs who would, incidentally, no longer have, on his own, the right of veto.</p>
<p class="contents">Complicating and weakening the current system seem, therefore, to be the dual characteristics of the proposal put to us. It is the Community method applied to the United Nations. We cannot, therefore, support it. We will instead vote in favour of Amendment No 1, a common sense amendment proposed by our British friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is no exaggeration whatsoever to state that, today, history is blending with the present, and that in this historic present which we are living in, the European Union and United Nations are two principal actors.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten told us clearly that the European Union is seeking to confirm its presence on the international stage and become a factor for stability, moderation and normalisation within a world order under shared leadership. The United Nations must, moreover, operate better and become more efficient in order to adapt to the new circumstances. From the founding spirit of the San Francisco Charter to the twenty-first century, from 60 nations to 190, from colonial regimes to independence and from the fall of the system of blocs to today’s globalised world.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, following the lessons of 11 September, it is clear that notions of security, defence policy, trade, conflict prevention, crisis management, humanitarian aid, culture and even civilisation are notions which are mixed up with each other and that it must accepted in the common conscience that, in view of the dangers and threats which affect us all equally, our response must also be equal amongst all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">This response, the European Union's response, must not, however, be a fragmented, contradictory or ineffective response: it must be a unified response. Therefore, Mr President, moving beyond the Parliamentary dimension of relations between the European Union and the United Nations – which is necessary and correct – it is important that we act in an agreed manner, in a complementary manner, and that the European Union demonstrate clearly that its strength lies in its unity and its weakness in its fragmentation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore moving towards spheres of shared sovereignty between the Member States, otherwise we will be forced to concede them to other powers which are fully aware of the advantages of unity and size. Moreover, either we stop voting in the United Nations differently 60 times out of every 100, or we will have to abandon once and for all the European Union's aspirations to be on the path to shared world leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying that I agree with the indignation expressed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro at the enforced absence from this Parliament of Sakharov Prize winner, Oswaldo Payá. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that many in this House share my group’s feeling – and my own – that the United Nations is the one global political institution that needs to be strengthened, that represents the rule of international law, and should not be pushed aside, as it was over Iraq. All this is reflected both in the spirit and the letter of Mr Laschet’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, an honest and objective observer has to acknowledge that the United Nations has proved weak on a number of occasions. There has been a whole series of wrongdoing, genocide and crimes against humanity where the United Nations has been ineffective. Some people see this as a justification for pushing the United Nations to one side – and often these are the very people who have used their veto to prevent the United Nations from taking rapid action, as in the case of the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that the United Nations needs to be strengthened, to become more efficient, and to be given the opportunity to intervene promptly. Let me make it clear that I believe this includes the possibility of taking preventative action where necessary, because if anyone is able and suited to act as the world’s policeman, then it is undoubtedly the United Nations. I am very pleased that Mr Laschet has taken up one of my ideas, which was drafted in conjunction with my group, namely that we need to create a regulatory framework that allows the United Nations to intervene promptly in cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should not be left to the discretion of individual countries, states or governments to identify such cases and then intervene. It should be international institutions that identify impending danger. In that way, the United Nations ought to be able to intervene promptly and, if necessary, to take preventative action. The United Nations would not need its own army for this. Reference has been made to NATO, and, although I do not want to overestimate its capacities, NATO could become involved if the United Nations gave the green light, taking action to uphold law and order and seeking to prevent crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforming the Security Council along these lines is certainly essential. The changes would need to include a seat for the European Union, but at the same time we must ensure that we do not end up multiplying vetoes and blocking tactics. Let me say once more: we have had enough of this world where individuals, individual governments and individual states think they can police the world. If there is one role the United Nations was made for, it is the role of upholding law and order throughout the world, and doing so with the full support of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue is whether this is at all necessary. Looking at the statistics, it emerges that the Member States are in agreement. In the UN, there is consensus on well over 90% of matters, so I wonder if the issue right now is not so much a shortage of new institutions but, rather, our feeling unable to use the power we do in actual fact have.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it is also necessary to consider how we use the UN. For one thing, we expect things from the UN and anticipate its being able to carry out tasks successfully. Are we too, however, in a position to comply with our obligations, namely to support the UN system when required: as when, for example, the weapons inspectorate told us that there was probably no imminent threat from Iraq in the form of weapons of mass destruction; or when Hans Blix told us that there was probably no threat and that, if these weapons of mass destruction were in fact there, he was certain that he and his colleagues would be in a position to find them. If, on that occasion, we had paid attention to the UN system, we should perhaps have avoided a situation in which the international terrorism expert, Gareth Evans, in Davos was obliged to say that the terrorist threat is greater now than it was before the war against Iraq. Perhaps the weaknesses and problems of the UN also have to do, then, with our inability to rely upon the system’s in actual fact being able to undertake anything sensible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to recommend that we be very sincere in our support of the UN and that we also be more active in the battle to reform it. We need to reform the Security Council. We need to have a system that operates as an alternative to anarchy so that we can safeguard international law through, for example, the UN. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of these lost causes is respect for international law, in defence of which Mr Annan has, despite the American bulldozer, brought all his personal qualities and the full dignity of his position to bear. The war took place, admittedly, but, from the outset, it was tainted with illegitimacy and discredited by its motives. The subsequent, after-the-event revelations as to the bogus and false nature of the charges against Iraq must give solace to those who more readily denounce the environmental dangers to our planet than arms stocks conspicuous by their apparent absence.</p>
<p class="contents">Another voice that has been continually hushed and drowned out is that of indigenous peoples who, although being the last survivors of ancient civilisations attach fundamental importance to environmental values and have a better understanding than ourselves of interdependency. In this world of ours that has become materialistic and superficial, people who have nothing left to defend but their fundamental rights are virtuous and authentic out of all proportion.<span class="bold"> </span>Let us refute this marginalisation of indigenous peoples’ rights and let us make the Union and the UN promise to maintain the working group on indigenous peoples in the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that, in the report we have before us, it is important to stress the significance, and the role, that we want to see accorded to the United Nations. So that the exit from Iraq does not turn into a nightmare of the kind we have sometimes seen in the past, everyone is now calling upon the UN to intervene in Iraq by launching an initiative and by playing an active role there of the kind that, for months, has been blocked by two countries which, to some extent, had a lot to fear from a UN role and which thought that this was in danger of being less effective that it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly pleased that the report mentions an important initiative that could be headed by the EU. I am referring to the idea of democratic countries in the UN being able to assemble and meet within the organisation to draw up joint measures to promote democracy. That is an initiative in connection with which the European Union could play an important role within the United Nations, whose difficulties and inertia we took note of when, last year, someone from a country like Libya, which is certainly not at the forefront of human rights, was elected as head of the Human Rights Commission. This initiative is, in any case, what the Italian radical Members are advocating. They are urging Commissioner Patten and the Member States to make it possible for there to be a specific and symbolic initial meeting of the Community of Democracies before the next Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report also looks at the role that the EU should play within the UN. Clearly, the UN was designed for the Cold War period in which permanent membership status and veto rights were necessary for the nuclear powers to ensure global security. Not enough has changed yet in the world to justify changing that.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility of security often conflicts with the additional mandate of the UN to protect human rights, as many of the UN Member States are undemocratic dictatorships – resulting in the perverse decision to appoint Libya as Chair of its Human Rights Committee. Furthermore, in the past, the UN was powerless to stop the brutal invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan as a result of the Soviet veto. China is still not a democracy or a respecter of human rights, making security the main responsibility of the UN and it has a vital role to play in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is a case to be made for India and Japan to be given permanent membership status as a result of their size and democratic status. Similarly, Nigeria or Brazil could be candidates. Unfortunately, this report conflicts with a number of stated positions of my party, the British Conservatives, as it attempts to dilute UK veto powers with a double veto and suggests an EU seat on the Security Council, which would undermine British and French membership. We are also opposed to an EU foreign minister and to a legal personality for the EU, and therefore, no matter how well intentioned the report is, I cannot support it as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">With my party, however, I will of course be monitoring closely any attempt to reform the UN. We welcome very warmly today the presence in the Chamber of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, the resolution that we are going to vote on in a short while also shows in a clear and detailed manner the direction that relations between the Union and the UN should take. A very large number of proposals, which I support, have been tabled, both as regards reinforcing the role of the European Union within a stronger United Nations through, for example, a seat on the Security Council, and as regards reinforcing cooperation between the Union institutions and the United Nations system. These are ambitious proposals for reform, since the European Union would eventually see itself as having the roles of secular arm of the UN or of the UN’s elder daughter, in the same way that a country that I know well was once spoken of as the Church’s elder daughter. It is even envisaged, in Article 17, that the European Union must play a pioneering role in defining UN policy. Excellent!</p>
<p class="contents">In the background to these encouraging and dynamic projects, however, some issues remain, which are worrying while they remain unresolved, in particular the issue of the position and role of the UN’s most important member, the United States. What can the UN/European Union alliance do faced with the US’s unilateralism, its opposition to the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto Protocol and its desire to use, on its own and quite freely, its military force, as soon as it considers its security threatened? The UN and the European Union must, together, continue to make a huge effort to ensure that the UN really can exercise this credible multilateral international authority that the whole world really needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If only there were not such a great gulf between theory and practice, between the words and reality, we could vote to approve it. The report refers to a European Constitution that does not yet exist, and unfortunately the draft Constitution text is more focused on increased defence activities and greater ability to intervene in situations around the world than on disarmament and civil conflict resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The report takes up the cause of multilateralism and strengthening the role of the UN, which is right and good. It refrains, though, from criticising the aggressive unilateralism of the US, which opens the door to violence and arbitrary action. As the war on Iraq has shown, no lie is too risky for use in justifying a preventative war. Those who support the war are called yes-men; those who do not are called obstructive. This is how people seek to divide what will soon be a Union of 25 Member States. The United States’ high-handed decision to override the UN has proven a miscalculation for which the national economy is having to pay, as we are now seeing. With its calls for reform, the EU is the only constant in an ever-changing world. The EU would be well-advised to develop its relationship with the UN rather than to strengthen its ties with NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights the importance of development and cooperation, but should be even more specific. Instead of spending huge sums on the arms race and military operations, money should be spent on education, healthcare, economic development and the fight to eradicate poverty. If we are to weed out violence and terrorism, we need as much money as possible and more effort.</p>

Many speakers have emphasised how important it is that the global community should take joint action, failing which many problems will remain insuperable. I would like to remind you of the importance of environmental pollution and the fight to eradicate poverty in particular. These are subjects that can only be tackled together, and Amendment No 7, which has been submitted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, stresses the importance of the water supply.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to mention one subject that has not, so far, been discussed in very great detail, and one to which I urge Commissioner Patten to give his particular attention. This subject is a common approach to human rights in the field of modern medicine and biotechnology. A few months ago, Parliament approved a very good report produced by Robert Evans of the Socialist Group, on combating illegal trade in human organs. Yet when we look at developing countries and newly industrialising countries, there is a great deal to be done in this area, and I think this is another task on which the EU and the UN must cooperate. What is more, Parliament has often underlined its opposition to human cloning and its desire that the UN should intervene in this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">We are following the debate in the UN Committees with great interest – and let me emphasise once again, Commissioner Patten, that the European Parliament supports the Costa Rican initiative, which also has the backing of over 60 other members of the UN. This is expressly stated once again in Amendment No 8. While Kofi Annan is with us, I think we should reiterate the importance of this new task for the UN, for new developments demand new responses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Seventy-three per cent of those questioned in the 15 Member States of the Union come down in favour of a European Union foreign policy independent of that of the United States. Sixty-four per cent of those questioned believe that the European Union should have its own seat in the UN Security Council. In light of this encouraging result, one of the main issues for the European political parties in the next electoral campaign must be to argue in favour of multilateralism, reform of the United Nations and a visible European presence in the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Laschet’s report is quite right to remind us that respect for the system of the United Nations is the best way to bring about security and peace in the world. The United Nations’ authority was seriously flouted, in spring 2003, by the unilateral decision by the US and Britain to launch a pre-emptive war on the basis, as we now know, of false pretexts. The European Union was divided and the US Government was happy to see them battling it out amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">There is currently no provision in the Treaty to force the Member States of the European Union to adopt a common position before entering into debate and seeking the decisive votes in the Security Council. This is a flaw in and, I would even say, a disgraceful aspect of, the current institutional system, a system that the Convention’s draft constitution hardly remedies. On the other hand, the proposal for a draft resolution to give the EU a permanent seat on the Security Council would naturally put things back on an even keel. This seat would not overshadow those seats held by the two European permanent members and their sacrosanct right of veto, but it would force the governments of Member States to try to see the main points and to compromise. This would be a small step towards a coherent foreign and security policy. I stress that it would be but a small step whilst the absurd system of unanimity persists that allows a single country to block the expression of European political will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN and the European Union emerged from the ashes of the devastation of the Second World War. At the time, it was said ‘never again’, and so rejecting war and eradicating poverty should be the cornerstones of the European Union and the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten is right that what we need is not just peace, but peace combined with justice. I am sorry to say, however, that peace and justice are not such key issues. The European Constitution talks about promoting peace but it does not accept that rejecting war and negotiating solutions to conflicts are fundamental. In recent years, the UN has been devalued, partly at least by the military policy of a fundamentalist president of a country that still practices the death penalty in many of its states and that rejects international organisations, not least the International Criminal Court. War has become legitimate again; militarism is permeating hearts and minds. I do not underestimate the important commitment made by Mr Laschet and all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. Together with the message sent out by awarding the Sakharov prize to Kofi Annan, it is a clear message designed to restore value to the European Union and the United Nations and to once again give them a role. It is, however, essential that security for everyone, the reduction of poverty and the promotion of justice and peace are genuine practices and not just empty promises. The UN and the European Union, together with other countries, must re-establish trust and, above all, respect for international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having left behind the rationale of Yalta and power blocs, we must make the case for increasing multilateralism. We must make new nations responsible at world level, without removing time-honoured instruments through which world peace has been promoted; and the right of veto is one such time-honoured instrument. The Security Council must, in any case, be enlarged, and we then need to consider new permanent members, without the right of veto. These could include the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, Japan, India, Italy and South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we also need to expand the number of members elected to the Security Council and then reform the Agencies to make them more operational on the ground. We need to speed up the promotion of human rights and the affirmation of the principles of democracy. We need to assume that the United Nations intends to protect people, since it invokes the concept of the nation and not that of the state, and the concept of the nation presupposes the protection of the person. This process of protecting people needs to start as a matter of urgency because terrorism is hot on our heels: today it is in the guise of Al-Qaeda<span class="italic"> </span>and Bin Laden, tomorrow it could have a different name. Of course, a reformed NATO could be the international police force that the UN might need. Division and exclusion certainly give rise to war; union and the philosophical concept of union instead promote important goals of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was privileged to address the UN working group in Geneva on indigenous peoples and thus witnessed how it forms a world parliament for some of the most oppressed minorities anywhere in our world. I was privileged also to represent Parliament in East Timor, where I witnessed at first hand Sergio Vieira de Mello’s successful efforts in rebuilding a whole country – a talent so tragically lost to us. This is why I attend meetings of United Nations associations in my East of England constituency, where the role and ideals of the UN are cherished at a very local level.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations inspires me and all of us here in Europe. It is why Europe rightly champions UN policies: the 0.7% target in the Millennium Goals within EU development policy, and Europe providing over half of all support to the UN High Commission for Refugees, which stands up for fundamental rights as a bulwark against the racism and xenophobia now sweeping our continent. This is why we back UN reform that will secure greater efficiency and also inject new vision. Other policies championed by the EU are the UN convention on disability, the move beyond the Global Compact towards a binding treaty on corporate accountability and the idea of an economic security council to oversee the Bretton Woods institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am concerned that some of the proposals for changes in the veto system, the composition of the Security Council, or suggestions for an EU mandate prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and may not carry support in all of our countries. Despite these concerns, where we have differences in Europe, most notably recently over Iraq, these concern how best to uphold the authority of the UN. That authority is once again reaffirmed in Mr Laschet’s report and in our vote here this morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These hopes were, however, dashed by the fact that the great powers often used their vetoes to block the UN’s work. All too many member countries completely ignored the principles of the state governed by law.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of most of the Communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe, the UN’s prospects of achieving its aims have clearly improved. In spite of this, the UN has not been especially successful in getting its member countries to comply with the human freedoms and rights laid down in its Charter. In this area, the UN has been too passive.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the UN’s inability to get its member countries to observe the principles concerning freedoms and rights and the state governed by law has undermined civic commitment to UN matters. There were many of us who were very surprised to note that even a representative of a dictatorship can be the Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights. In such circumstances, it is only natural that civic commitment is instead channelled through, for example, organisations such as Amnesty International.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN now needs greater civic commitment, which would strengthen it as a worldwide organisation. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted my proposal that it must be possible for countries that seriously and systematically violate human freedoms and rights to lose their voting rights in the UN Commission on Human Rights. This proposal must be seen as a step in this direction, that is to say an attempt to increase people’s confidence in the UN in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report we are debating is in essence a single proposal on relations between the European Union and the UN, but it is a strategic proposal for the UN itself at the dawn of the twenty-first century. The UN, despite generally expressing the need for a peaceful world at its inception, reflecting the balances at the end of the Second World War, is in need of some adjustment. Today circumstances are different and must be expressed. However, until they are expressed effectively, the UN is irreplaceable.</p>
<p class="contents">Many consider that the UN is the refuge of small countries which have no other way of expressing their opinions. However, the Iraqi crisis and its impasses show that the superpowers have equal need of it. Attempts at new international balances such as the enlarged G8 or the messianic crusading perception of the various superpowers of their role lead nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Proposing a strategy for the UN and the European Union, however, we note that we ourselves have serious gaps which we need to plug. We recently experienced the lack of agreement in the UN Security Council. The enlarged European Union, with the 25 members, will have the possibility to be expressed by many more members of the Security Council, in that it will have the possibility to be expressed by three different geographical areas of the UN. This possibility, in conjunction with the presence, which I hope will come about, of a minister of foreign affairs at the UN, will provide many more possibilities. If the new distribution does in fact result in the European Union's gaining a place on the Security Council, without other countries losing their place, this will allow it, from that position, to support policies for peace, cooperation, security, democracy and all the claims of mankind, which are objectives which we must attain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It comes at a sensitive time for both the European Union and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to refer in particular to the UN Development Programme. The report made in 2002 on the subject of Arab human development was described by <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine as the most important publication of the year, and more than a million people downloaded it from the UNDP website. It had particular relevance for the EU since it was the impetus for the recent Commission communication – for which I am currently rapporteur – on reinvigorating human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners. Last year’s UNDP Arab human development report stated that – subject to fieldwork surveys – the appetite for democracy in the Arab world was, at 60%, the highest of any region in the world. Compare that, for example, with Eastern Europe, where the figure was 30%. The Arab world also logged the highest rejection of authoritarian rule – the figure in this regard was 80% – and was indeed the third highest in favour of gender equality in higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">So the perception that many have that the Arab world is not ready for democracy is undermined by the United Nations’ own reports. I hope, therefore, that the Council and Commission can, as it were, put our money where our mouth is, and redirect some of the enormous funds available for good governance, the development of civil society, democracy and the rule of law, which, in the external field – the responsibility of Commissioners Patten and Nielson – amounts to EUR 1.9 billion a year. By contrast, the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights – a rather smaller fund aimed at the ex-Soviet Bloc – which I had the honour to set up a few years ago, amounts to only EUR 106 million. That is an indication of the distortion in spending which we need to address, and in particular the priorities with which I hope the European Parliament will play some part in helping the Commission in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall concentrate on four points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns Amendment No 6 by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and myself. It has also been supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. The European Parliament ‘[c]onsiders that the elaboration of the common foreign and security policy towards the UN should be characterised by the participation and joint influence of all the European Union’s Member States’. If we have a common foreign and security policy, it cannot be devised solely by the major powers: Germany, France and perhaps also Great Britain. All the Member States must feel they are participating in this area. The smaller Member States must not be confronted by a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, with a common foreign and security policy having come about because the larger countries have already adopted positions. Otherwise, there is no common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding paragraph 19, I would, secondly, emphasise the value of depriving countries that systematically infringe human rights of their right to vote in the UN Commission on Human Rights until such breaches cease. This must be pursued in a UN context.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I wish to emphasise concerns the UN Security Council. The EU should make better use of the two votes that EU Member States, namely Great Britain and France, now already, in actual fact, possess in the Security Council. We must not therefore weaken the EU’s current 40% representation in the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to address Mr Patten regarding Amendment No 8, also supported by the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group. We support Costa Rica’s initiative and the UN General Assembly’s decision to work on a corresponding convention in 2004 on banning human cloning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would of course like to take this moment to recall that there have already been three UN Secretaries-General who hailed from Europe: Trygve Lie, Dag Hammarskjöld<span class="bold"> </span>and Kurt Waldheim, and that Europe is home to two permanent UN offices, in Geneva and Vienna. This means that we share responsibility to a large extent. Not only do we have claims upon each other, but we also have to take joint action and support each other. The most recent UN Secretary-General to come from Europe, Kurt Waldheim, wrote this in his book ‘Die Antwort’: ‘I have to concede that the UN, notwithstanding all our efforts and our unquestionable sincerity, has not yet managed to break with the political habits and attitudes of past centuries and to come to terms with the new realities with which we have to live. Its capacity for effective action is limited by its own faults. The charge is laid against us that it produces more rhetoric than action, that it is ineffective and is often ignored, and that the system under which every state has a vote allows the developing world to dominate the decision-making process, in that the number of votes bears no relation to the capacity to act.’ The same could also be said of the European Union; both of us are in need of reform. The two of us have a great deal in common. Success is dependent on political will and the determination of the Member States. It depends on acceptance and implementation – of Community law in one case, and of the United Nations Charter in the other. It is dependent upon multilateral cooperation, global responsibility and upon our thinking along Community-oriented lines rather than nationalistically. We can make our contribution if France and England leave the Security Council and the EU joins it; we would thereby be reforming the EU and our own Common Foreign and Security Policy, and forcing through a reform of the UN Security Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support this, although we would like to underline a number of specific aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, and certainly not in contravention of the report, we should like to emphasise the institutional reforms that are necessary. We must be able to reform the Security Council. It must be possible for Africa, Asia and Latin America to be permanent members. After all, it is not acceptable that only the rich and the rich countries in the world should have the final word, while two thirds of the world population live in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the veto system must be reviewed and may only be used when peace is under threat – under real threat – and in the event of aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union must acquire full membership in the Security Council and in the General Assembly. It is because we would like to see effective multilateralism that we believe it necessary that the United Nations be effectively organised and enabled to take decisions effectively. This has not always been the case in the past, and the global repercussions are tragic. I would remind you of the ineffective mandates that are sometimes given to soldiers who have to act on behalf of the United Nations in peace operations. Their mandate is so inflexible that it renders them non-operational. I would remind you of the tragedy in Rwanda, of which Kofi Annan recently reminded us. Fortunately, things went more smoothly in Congo, but we hope that the United Nations will, in future, work more transparently and, above all, more democratically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cowen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, this morning’s debate has made clear the Parliament’s strong interest in enhancing the European Union’s engagement with the United Nations. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, are to be commended on the production of this report. I fully subscribe to the statement in the report that 'the success of global governance, in the face of the challenges posed by growing globalisation and interdependence, can only be based on an effective and fair multilateral system unequivocally anchored in the United Nations'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is firmly and formally committed to effective multilateralism in its external action. A rules-based international order with the United Nations at its heart is a central element of the European Security Strategy, which the European Council adopted in December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that Council, under the Irish presidency, is determined to work towards a more effective collective response to today’s threats. We are all keenly aware that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction are threats that present serious challenges, but global stability is also threatened by endemic poverty and lack of development, as well as the scourge of HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases. These are hugely destabilising factors that will literally destroy the prospects of many countries if they are not effectively remedied.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday I told Secretary-General Annan that, in implementing the European Security Strategy, the European Union will work particularly closely with the UN to enhance mutual cooperation on conflict prevention and crisis management. We agreed that we would work closely on devising better planning and best-practice models for conflict prevention and post-conflict peace building. We will base this on both our organisations' experiences in these policy areas. This will involve working together on the practical implementation of the Joint Declaration on EU-UN Cooperation in Crisis Management signed late in 2003. We also discussed how best to build on the successful deployment in 2003 of Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Before this presidency ends we are aiming to have up to 1500 military personnel available to be deployed as an EU rapid reaction capability at the disposal of the Secretary-General for crisis management operations. Mr Annan is very supportive of this valuable resource becoming available as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I assured the Secretary-General that the European Union was fully behind his efforts to find – to use his words – a credible and convincing collective answer to the challenges of our time. The Union will therefore support the work of the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. I believe that the European Union can make an important contribution to this highly relevant debate. The presidency appreciates the enthusiastic support of the Commission in this endeavour and the work presently under way. The Secretary-General has made clear his view that any changes must be a means to an end, not an end in themselves. The United Nations must show, in practical and concrete ways, that it is capable of fulfilling the first purpose laid down in the Charter, which is to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace. Developing our rapid reaction capability in the coming months will be a demonstration of this Union's willingness to contribute and to assist the UN in this important area of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate is timely. Given the challenges to the multilateral system that Secretary-General Annan has placed in the spotlight in such a determined way – including last Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos – the central thrust of this report, which reaffirms support for a strong, reformed UN at the centre of the multilateral system, is very welcome. This confirms that the Secretary-General, the Council, and the Commission have the support of the people’s representatives in Parliament in this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">The report clearly articulates the need for the European Union to 'punch its weight' at the United Nations. European Union Member States are, collectively, major financial contributors to the United Nations, contributing almost 40% of its budget. The European Union will, as the report notes, represent some 450 million people from 1 May 2004. The Council agrees fully that the EU needs to develop a commensurate political profile.</p>
<p class="contents">The general thrust of the report strengthens the Council in its engagement with the United Nations. I wish to assure you that one of the aims of the Irish presidency is to make the EU more focused, more flexible and more responsive at the United Nations. I am determined that we will devote more effort to engaging with our international partners on these important questions, in the interests of both the UN and the EU. Effective multilateralism will be a subject of discussion at all our summits with strategic partners during this presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s discussion has highlighted a number of varied and interesting points which reflect the scope, detail and ambition of the report. We have read and heard many proposals, some of which can be endorsed immediately. Some others, it would be fair to say, will need to be discussed over time.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that the presidency inform the Parliament of the content of the EU Priorities for each UN General Assembly session seems an excellent idea, and the Council will act on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for exchanges of views between high-level UN officials and the committees of the Parliament is also to be commended.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of EU representation at the United Nations will certainly need to be addressed in the light of the final outcome of the negotiations on the Constitution, which will confer a legal personality on the European Union. Some of the issues raised are much more complex, and merit careful consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to commend the ambition of the report for the range of proposals that it contains concerning the activity of the Parliament in relation to the various funds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations. No doubt this is work that the committee concerned and the Parliament will advance over time.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also noted carefully what was said regarding the representation of the EU in the Security Council. Clearly, this is not an issue that can be easily resolved at the moment. It must be kept under review as our common policies develop over time. Likewise, the issue of the reform of the Security Council is not one that can be easily resolved. The High-Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-General will address this question, among others. We are all aware of the difficulties and problems encountered by advocates of institutional reform in the UN. The necessary consensus remains difficult to develop. This, however, must not deflect us from the essential task of making the Security Council, and the multilateral system as a whole, more effective in meeting the challenges of today’s world.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, let me reiterate my appreciation of this initiative. It has provided a stimulus for the ongoing discussion of the EU’s support for the UN and the Parliament’s role in that regard.

It actually seeks to establish a ‘Stateless diplomacy’ supported by a network of organisations over which national democracies have little control. The declared intentions (in essence, a commitment to multilateralism, respect for human rights, peacekeeping and nature conservation) appear to be excellent. But how is democratic control to be exerted?</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the Laschet report seeks primarily to limit the Member States’ scope for action at the UN and to replace them with the European Union, controlled by the European Parliament, which is taking advantage of this to raise its status. This is tantamount to saying, however, that we prefer ‘democracies that are low on substance’, like the European democracy, to really meaningful national democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Laschet report welcomes the reforms that the European Constitution would bring if it were adopted, including specifically legal personality for the Union and a European minister for foreign affairs, which would enable this programme to become a reality. That is one further reason to reject both the Constitution and the Laschet report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the objectives that are set out disregard reality and current dangers. Declarations of intent are no longer enough: poverty eradication, human development, conflict prevention and peacekeeping all require a degree of financial and political investment that is equal to these challenges. Following the armed intervention and occupation of Iraq by the United States and the suppression – to the point of extinction? – of the Palestinian people, the spirit that prevailed when the United Nations was created and the principles underlying the Charter are more than ever being ridden over roughshod and even trampled underfoot by certain countries. Now more than ever we need to defend international law and champion the right of nations to self-determination with renewed vigour and that means taking action. The United Nations peace plan for Western Sahara, for example, including holding a referendum on self-determination, must be implemented, regardless of any further shilly-shallying by the Moroccan Government. Proper sanctions must also be applied in cases where human rights are violated or the environment is damaged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore join Kofi Annan in his call for a radical reform of the UN. At present, this organisation is far too bureaucratic and not in tune with the geopolitical realities of the 21st century. The EU which, together with its Member States, accounts for nearly 50% of the UN budget, should take the lead in this reform. It is essential in this respect that the EU should be able to speak with one voice in the Security Council. All credit to the EU for continuing to encourage the UN to face up to its responsibilities with regard to conflict prevention and maintaining the peace. It should not, however, be mere lip service. For hazardous operations in Africa, we are forced to call upon badly equipped and unmotivated troops from Bangladesh, Pakistan or India. Sometimes, this creates more problems than it solves. Why can the EU as such not deploy more troops under the UN flag with a UN mandate? I therefore call for a European Union which decisively takes the lead in the reform of the United Nations, not only with fine declarations and symbolic contributions, but, above all, with concrete commitments and actual solidarity at the coalface.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
