<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bayona de Perogordo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to warmly thank everyone present for taking part in this debate. The report presented for debate is intended to be the European Parliament’s response to the Commission’s Communication of 2 July 2002 on an information and communication strategy for the European Union. In order to briefly present the report I will point out that its main characteristic is that it makes information a condition of citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">My hope is that, in the future, following the recognition of the legal personality of the European Union, this citizens’ right will combine with the European Union’s right to express itself, in what we could call the European Union’s right to an image, the European Union’s right to explain what it is and what it does, and the combination of these two rights provides a firm legal basis on which to create a genuine information and communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report opts decisively for the consolidation of interinstitutionality in the three phases of the process, that is to say, in the production of messages within the Interinstitutional Information Group, in application, using for this purpose the representations of the Commission and the offices of the European Parliament, as well national, regional and local authorities and interinstitutionality, and also in the assessment both within the Interinstitutional Information Group and by means of an annual debate on the information and communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the conditions for information, I will simply comment on the analysis of the languages in which information is provided and the accessible style of language. Languages should not just be the official languages, but also the co-official languages and all those languages by means of which the message can reach the citizens in the most direct manner, with the participation, of course, of local, regional, national and Community authorities, in accordance with the scope of their competences.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content, I will focus on just two points. On the one hand, the content should indicate the European Union's influence on the daily actions of the citizens, rejecting the European Union’s frequent image as an arena for confrontation, with opposing interests on the part of the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we should consolidate a permanent flow of basic information for the citizen. It will be difficult for the citizens to become involved in the priorities which I am about to mention if they are not conversant with the fundamental and basic operation of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the current priorities, those already included in the Prince programme are taken up, that is to say, enlargement, the future of Europe, the area of freedom, security and justice, the establishment of the euro and the role of the European Union in the world. And attention is drawn to the imminence of the 2004 elections, which are of symbolic significance because this will be the first time that 25 countries will elect their direct representatives to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis of the report raises certain critical questions. On the one hand, the question of the legal basis. The time has not yet come to create a legal basis for the drawing up of the programmes, but the Convention and the future Intergovernmental Conference provide the opportunity to support the idea that the future Constitution should include – within the democratic life of the European Union – a reference to the citizens’ right to information, so that they may be genuine citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will refer to the issue of sectoral information, which – I am perfectly aware – as the representatives of the Commission have tried to demonstrate, is the exclusive responsibility of the Commission. The truth is, however, that the European Union's image is either promoted or harmed directly as a result of the actions resulting from the various sectoral policies. Coordination of the various sectoral policies, orienting sectoral policies towards a common objective – the development of the European Union – should be subject not to decision, of course, but at least to consideration, within the interinstitutional information body.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the issue of whether it is better to provide systemised, basic, pedagogical information, or whether we need the impact of spectacular campaigns which demand the attention of the citizen and for the fundamental elements to be expressed through them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the national authorities act as a filter. The citizens perceive Europe by means of their national authorities, for whom a success is something they have won from the rest of the Europeans and for whom harm is anything that they perceive as negative. Partnership and integration amongst the Member States and the regional and local authorities is fundamental for this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, in view of the interinstitutional strategy that we wish to develop to bolster the European Union's image, it is particularly important for all of the institutions to support this initiative and participate in making our shared objective a reality. Following the adoption of a particularly positive position by the Council of Ministers on 10 December and the first report of the European Parliament, which was drafted by Mr Andreasen, the Commission therefore welcomes Parliament's commitment to this cause and the specific proposals that Mr Bayona makes in his report, which combine technical expertise with an awareness of the political sensitivity of the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to respond to these under two headings. I will speak first about the general objectives of this joint strategy and then about how it will be implemented. We clearly cannot define and implement an information and communication strategy for the European Union without the support and active participation of the Council, but also and in particular the Member States. This causes us to reflect for a moment, as Mr Bayona invites us to do, on the link between information and citizenship, in particular with a view to next year's elections.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, the main objective of a proactive information and communication strategy has to be to improve the perception that the public has of the European Union: in essence, it should improve the public's awareness of the European dimension of their citizenship. The Commission therefore takes good note of the rapporteur's proposal to have an explicit reference in the text of the Constitution, which is currently being drafted, to the need for an information and communication policy as a condition for the exercise of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also fully supports your proposal that information distributed by the Union should highlight common European values, namely democracy, pluralism, security, solidarity, equal opportunities, cohesion and so on. The objective is indeed, Mr Bayona, to show citizens the practical advantages in their daily lives of belonging to the Union. With this in mind, as you yourself underline, the policy of distributing information in all of the Union's languages is something that we need to continue and build on further.</p>
<p class="contents">The visible expression of this citizenship should be active participation in the next European elections. There is no doubt that this decisive milestone in the democratic life of the Union should be our shared objective. It goes without saying that this alone provides ample justification for stepping up our interinstitutional cooperation. But is not the best way to encourage the public to turn out to vote to provide objective educational information to help them better to understand the major issues at stake in the project of European integration?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have agreed on four major information themes for 2003 to 2004 after the big campaign on the euro: enlargement, the future of the Union, the area of freedom, security and justice and the role of Europe in the world. Alongside other issues, in particular the social and economic agenda, these themes, especially enlargement and the future of the Union, are a priority concern today, particularly given that they are running on parallel timetables. They are therefore the best vectors for raising awareness amongst national public opinion of the importance of the major milestone in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I should like here to give full reassurance to the House. The Commission will scrupulously respect the priorities adopted by the European Parliament at the vote on the budget and has no intention of modifying the balance – in terms of either the detail or the broader picture – of the Prince programme as adopted by the budgetary authority. Nevertheless, allow me to point out – and I do so entirely objectively – as I have done several times previously, that the doubling of the appropriations allocated to the Prince programme that was approved by this House for the 2003 Budget, is obviously going to raise some serious practical problems when it comes to implementation. The Commission would have appreciated being given advance warning of this state of affairs at a prior meeting with the competent authorities in Parliament, as befits the spirit of interinstitutional cooperation that should prevail in the running of the Prince programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the practicalities of implementation are concerned, in response to the rapporteur's invitation requesting, with a view to the 2004 elections, an information campaign making particular use of television – it being understood that this campaign should be promoted and coordinated by the Commission – we have decided to launch a huge call for audiovisual proposals, which will cover both the theme of enlargement and that of the future of Europe. This integrated approach, which befits the complementary nature of these two subjects, will have a significant and renewed leverage effect for the audiovisual sector in Europe. The effect will be felt as much by the programme producers as by the audiovisual distributors and will enable us to reach the public more directly using their media of choice to find out more about the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the role of the European Union is viewed much more favourably by third countries than from within the Member States themselves. At our last meeting of the interinstitutional group, we thought it was essential to start working this year on information actions, targeted initially at opinion formers and the appropriate intermediary information providers, on the role of the Union in the world. As the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy rightly stresses, rapid progress needs to be made on this dimension of our information and communication strategy. This is all the more justified in the light of the seriousness of recent events. At this stage, and with the Council's full agreement, it is proposed to adopt a three-pronged approach to this theme. First, globalisation, which ties in with the Cancun meeting this autumn. Secondly, the proximity policy, which will accrue renewed geostrategic importance after enlargement. And finally, the common foreign and security policy and its initial work on defence policy. As you are aware, in order to do this, the Commission has submitted a supplementary and amending budget. From now on then the amount of work that is done on this new theme as of this year is in your hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, those in a few words are the Commission's main observations on Mr<span class="bold"> </span>Bayona's excellent report. As you will have noted, there is no doubt that our joint approach, the result of long interinstitutional experience, is bearing fruit. But to be effective, it is vital for a majority of Member States to follow the example of the coordinated approach adopted by the institutions. Only a structured partnership with the competent national authorities will enable us to exploit this strategy to its full potential, a strategy which is now co-owned by the institutions, and to ensure that it has maximum impact at regional and even at local level, in the general interests of the Union and for the benefit of all of its people.</p>

So you would expect, under these conditions of global knowledge, information and communication, that every citizen would be given the chance to obtain a tangible picture of reality. And yet, the result is increasingly intense confusion of public opinion, with all that implies, by which I mean a warped or distorted image of reality, an uncritical rejection or acceptance of facts, information, advice, perceptions and opinions and, hence, the opportunity for leading people by the hand. These are all consequences that cannot be combated, as we know from experience, with individual information programmes and strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">The information given to the citizens of the European Union should therefore be objective and free from the influence of political or other authorities. Citizens must be told about European stands and policies, especially as regards important issues such as foreign affairs and issues relating to the security and defence of the European Union. Special attention must be paid to issues such as political legitimacy, democratic control and transparency in decision making. In addition, information must be clear and documented. This means that the mass media need to report not what they consider to be essential reporting, but any decision taken on matters of importance to the Member States. This will give all the citizens of the European Union a clearer understanding of the decisions taken by its institutions, which are often wrongly presented, with the result that impressions are created that have absolutely nothing to do with reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Top priority issues, such as enlargement, the links between European policies and daily life and the problems of European citizens, especially following the accession of new countries to the European Union, which is expected to bring about considerable changes in European agricultural, budgetary and financial policy, need to be the subject of full, substantiated information.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a serious problem in the regions, where information is either limited or totally lacking. In these areas, closer and more fundamental cooperation is needed with local agencies in each Member State, so that information is accessible to everyone. More immediate and more objective information could be achieved with live coverage of important events, such as decision making in plenary sittings and at committee meetings, for example in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on television channels or, in order to avoid high costs, on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Proper, objective information for citizens is a necessity. Proper information for European citizens is also an appropriate and necessary condition for extending European integration and strengthening its role in the world. Consequently, efforts and initiatives need to be stepped up and systematised, given the deficit in this sector, and citizens need full, documented, clear, accessible information.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are debating today is the very substance of the issue of information and policy on this strategy of communication with the citizens of the European Union and I should like to take this opportunity of thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Bayona, on his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we talk about Europe, it reminds me a bit of school, where we always said ‘I have passed’ or ‘they have failed me’. Here, when something goes well, it is the country or region that claims all the credit, but when something goes badly, or there is a disaster, Europe is usually blamed. When they say, ‘it is Europe's fault’, the citizens do not even know which institution they are referring to, because in reality they do not know them, and they cannot distinguish between them. We must acknowledge that we have not made it at all easy for them. There may be languages in which it is not so difficult, but in Spanish we have the <span class="italic">Comisión Europea</span> [European Commission] and the <span class="italic">comisiones</span> [committees] of Parliament, the <span class="italic">Consejo de Europa</span> [Council of Europe] and the <span class="italic">Consejo Europeo</span> [European Council]. We know that they are completely different things, but the public in general does not know, and we must acknowledge that these coincidences or similarities are very unfortunate. That is why I believe that this report on the European Union's information strategies and subsequent implementation of the programmes are so important and vital to the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me now to relate this issue to my field; the field of sport. We must not forget that sport is a great instrument for communication and has a genuinely important multiplying effect. If we in this Parliament support the inclusion of an article referring to sport in the new Treaties of the European Union, we may have sport programmes which have a great impact, and this would benefit all of us. Furthermore, if we bear in mind that the essential thing is to educate and inform young people, who will be the real protagonists of the European Union within a few years and who will be its future, and that it is they who sporting information can mostly reach, we would truly be completing a circle which would be of the greatest interest and benefit in terms of the image of all the institutions of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, we are dealing with a great report, which is timely and of a high quality, on which my fellow Member, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, deserves the congratulations of the Socialist Group, and I am very happy to express them. In the Andreasen report this Parliament has already defined, together with the Commission, an information strategy intended to reach all the citizens. However, despite the fact that we are in the middle of the process of creating a Constitution, opinion polls are still indicating a certain lack of interest in European construction. We could sum up the situation by saying, like Marianne Thyssen, ‘Europe has been created, now let us create the Europeans’.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the information flowing from our institutions must not be neutral, we must create feelings of citizenship and of belonging to Europe in every European. We Europeans have an historic duty: we can and we must identify with each other and this must be accompanied, promoted or even provoked, if necessary, by the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast with what happens in the individual countries, European construction is not the result of feelings, but of reasons. It is not driven by peoples, but by political, economic or media elites. Many things are still lacking, including a European civil society, in other words, a system of intermediary organisations, which are relatively independent from the States and from the market, which are able to gather information, to deliberate, to make decisions and to act in a joint and cross-border manner. The priority tasks for the Commission, for the European media and for opinion-formers in general – including us in this Parliament – must be empowering the European political area, the development of a European image and identity, strengthening – as the Commissioner has said – a core of common values, the debate on the future of Europe and the European approach in all types of information.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the task must not be to restate the identity of Europe over and over again, but to seek, define and consolidate the bases on which the Europeans can identify with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the approval of this report and the fact that Commissioner Vitorino has been charged with implementing these policies, are, in my view, significant reasons for us to be hopeful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mr Bayona de Perogordo and congratulate him on the report on which we are now finally adopting a position. It is a comprehensive report, and I know from experience that the work involved in such a report is fairly demanding. The report takes us a good step closer to our goal of a comprehensive coordinated and decentralised information and communication policy, or in Commissioner Vitorino’s words in the ‘Friends of Europe’ debate: ‘the fight against apathy and ignorance regarding the EU’. I would also like to thank you, Commissioner Vitorino, for your great commitment to this issue. I would also express my regret at the form of debate that we are having here in Parliament, since it excludes you from being able to answer questions here and now.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have made some great progress, many questions remain unanswered, and I will mention some of them and will happily send them to you as well, for it is important that we do not rest on our laurels in the information and communication strategy at a time when so much is at stake concerning enlargement and the future of the EU and when we are also coming up to elections to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I ask: how far has the feasibility study got and the opportunities for a European ‘C-SPAN’ that the Commission is to implement? How far have we progressed in the work on the ‘Channel Europe’ concept? How far have we got with establishing a common visitor centre for the institutions in Brussels? How far have we got with calculations and costs for the initiatives proposed previously? How far have we got in our efforts to get the information offices of the Commission and of Parliament under the same roof in the capitals? I know that nothing has happened in Copenhagen. Allow me finally to ask the Presidency of Parliament: would it not be an idea, Mr President, for us to hold a debate in plenary on Parliament’s role in the information strategy up until the 2004 elections? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, 43% of Europeans continue to believe that a work permit is required if they want to work in any other Member State. It is regrettable that the advantages offered by the EU are not always recognised as they should be.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clearly evident from this, and also from many other examples, that the EU's existing information and communication policy is not working. Negative public opinion is of course reinforced by the EU's inability to get a grip on corruption, and by its failure to effectively dismantle the bureaucratic apparatus – I am thinking, for example, of the way our Parliament meets in two places. We should be a better state that what the public has at home. We have to take urgent action, by which I mean that the EU has to take a position on the things that have gone wrong, do away with them and put together an additional package of measures. For example, the EU could be introduced in schools as a specific subject, and pupils could be offered more opportunities to inform themselves locally about what is going on in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Such measures would be a step in the right direction, so that negative preconceptions about the EU could be eroded and public support for the Community ideal would be restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow, we will be deciding on the enlargement of the European Union by the addition of ten new Member States. Despite this success for the European Union, the Eurobarometer published in March 2002 clearly shows that fewer than one-third of the members of the public questioned regarded themselves as well informed about the European Union. Most indicators confirm that a large section of the population – 50% – is completely ignorant of the European Union or indifferent towards it. Voter turnout has fallen from 63% in 1979 to 49% in 1999. There is something not quite right here.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe one of our main problems to be the fact that we speak of the European Union as a distant structure. That also came across from what Mr Ilgenfritz said. The European Union is made up of all of us! I do believe that the main cause of our problem is the mental and emotional distance between people, wherever they live, and the European institutions. The political will to make European policy into internal policy is lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">The political will to reduce the distance between Europe's citizens and its institutions is absent – not from the European institutions, but from the Member States. Does, for example, every government state that there is no EU competence without the Member States' consent? Are people in the Member States told about how no directive can be enacted without the Member States' consent? Is it being stated openly that enlargement of the European Union cannot go ahead without the European Parliament, the Heads of State and of Government, the Member States and the candidate countries agreeing to it? No: whenever there is any doubt, people are told, ‘Brussels is doing it to us!’</p>
<p class="contents">The public do not know about the shared responsibility of the Member States for all European decisions, because this is not lived and communicated. Let me end by asking whether the regional parliaments are performing their task of exercising parliamentary control over their representatives in the Committee of the Regions. No, they are not! Are the national parliaments performing their task of exercising parliamentary control over what the Council does? No, they are not! Is the European Parliament adequately discharging its duties in exercising parliamentary control over the Commission and in working on legislation? Not satisfactorily so! If we do not fully perform our parliamentary functions at regional, national and European level, the connections between them and the interlinked decision-making mechanism cannot be presented in a transparent way. The best public information campaign is of no use if the public are not aware that they, through their governments, have a part in every decision.</p>

It had better do so too, because the Union is aiming to become the world’s leading knowledge-based society within seven years. I do not believe it will. Why not? Because the Member States are not implementing the jointly agreed decisions under the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Commission is worried about the indifference of our citizens to the Union and information about it, as fewer than half of them go out and vote. Has not the same thing happened, however, with regard to the Member States themselves, which are so indifferent that they are not implementing the Lisbon process? Moreover, the information-based economy is an issue connected with that very thing, information.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to remember that information is only raw material, knowledge is its product, and civilisation is its end result. Our objectives are good ones, but the media and the people are not very interested in them. We might say that brains that have been softened over the years by soap operas and television action series are our opponent in this. Could you not imagine making an action film about the European Union? That way we would get the audience we will not reach otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Euronews is a good objective. Other important matters include ties with everyday life, and, of course, the visitors service. The Secretary-General, for example, cancelled the Finnish language post and now there is no visitors’ service in Finnish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to congratulate Mr Bayona de Perogordo because he has listened, he has taken account of many opinions and, in fact, the final document is a document of consensus, enriched by Parliament, which has many new figures and many new initiatives, and I believe that that is the way to work in terms of institutional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we still have to take a further step, because the model in force, with the offices and the current system for disseminating parliamentary policy, is essentially a bureaucratic model. I believe we must change to a model of open and direct communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which I believe to be extremely important, and which I believe must also be revised, and in relation to which this document introduces a very clear request, is the issue of languages. Parliament’s reform policy on languages reduces the equality between them, it creates differences between some languages and others, and, in particular, in terms of translation, there is a difference between the dates for the delivery of documents. What does this mean? That in terms of communication, we are moving backwards, because some citizens will receive the information first and others later. And given the speed of many processes, there will be some citizens who do not receive the documents in their language and will hardly have the opportunity to present amendments on time. I therefore believe that the guarantee of the maintenance of languages is an essential point, particularly in view of the fact that the new technologies allow for much more direct dissemination. I therefore support an improvement in terms of the issue of interpreting.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue in this document which I believe to be essential, and which must be taken into account, is something which a previous speaker mentioned: there can be no communication without participation. And in view of the new technologies and the current capacity for communication, the citizens will not feel connected with these institutions unless they can participate in dialogue. And I believe that Parliament and the Commission must establish communication departments which, as in the case of other national parliaments, allow for an open system by means of which there can be access to what we are doing from any place and in any language.</p>
<p class="contents">The new technologies make this effort and this investment possible. And I am surprised that, in the reform, including of buildings, there has been no intention to broaden languages and communication, but rather a reductionist spirit has prevailed. I would therefore call for equality between all citizens to be respected and for the reform of communication to be dealt with from a more modern point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not to do with apathy either, strictly speaking: in the past month or so we all have seen millions of people exercising their concern about an issue that directly affected them – not necessarily in a personal way, but in a broader international way – and making their voices very clear in relation to the issue of war and peace. So it is not that people are disconnected from concerns about the world, but they certainly do not necessarily see any relevance in being asked to vote for the European Parliament, or indeed in some cases for national parliaments. That is a failure on the part of our institutions and it is a failure on our own part as politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">I have made a proposal in the European Convention that we should bring Europe home by having a coordinated European Week in each of the national parliaments, where we would invite a Commissioner to a national parliament to present the annual legislative programme; where the MEPs from a particular Member State would be present in the Parliament; where you would generate some national interest in what the European Union is doing, and what the European Parliament proposes to do in terms of scrutinising the Commission and the Council for the following year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fairly simple idea, but it one which would, in my view, generate a lot of interest amongst the citizens of Europe. I would urge the Commissioner to take it on board as a proposal. It does not require a constitutional amendment, but it would be useful to have it incorporated into the protocol relating to national parliaments which we are currently debating in the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Are we mad to be here at this time of night debating this issue? Really, it is the people who are not here who need to understand the importance of explaining what the European Union does. We have to get that message over. If we cannot do that, we must not be too surprised if the citizens of Europe are rather apathetic about it. Many colleagues have mentioned the low turnout at the last European elections – 49% overall, 24% in my country. That is a total disgrace, about which we should hang our heads in shame. The only consolation I have is that the turnout in the last American presidential elections was only 50%. So those of us who believe in democracy have a problem. The solution to that problem is explaining what we do, and that is information policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I asked to speak at this ridiculous hour of the night in order to make three simple points. I speak, not just as a Member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which is interested in information, but also as a Member of the Committee on Petitions. We received a number of petitions from citizens who are not citizens of the national state in which they live. They are entitled to vote in European elections but they found that in the last elections they had all sorts of problems: a British citizen living in Germany said that there are 6 000 non-German nationals entitled to vote in their district, but that only 40 did so because they had inadequate information; a Dutch citizen made exactly the same point in a petition about the situation in France. I am not criticising Germany or France. I am simply saying that if we want people to vote we have to explain the procedures by which they may do so. There is a responsibility upon Member States. They should honour that responsibility and explain to everybody entitled to vote in European elections just how they could do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make concerns Euronews. The way people get their information today is through television. There is one channel in Europe that provides European information and yet, I have to tell Parliament that this is a channel that is on the verge. It may succeed – and I hope that it does – and it may not. If people are going to be interested in Europe, they have to know about it. They learn about things through television, and we have to see that Euronews manages to succeed. It seems there is no-one here tonight from the Committee on Budgets, but they are the people who can help make sure that Euronews succeeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Committee on Petitions visited the Danish Parliament last year. The Danish Parliament said that it likes to provide information about Europe from the national parliament rather than from the European Parliament. If we can encourage the national parliaments and national authorities to give more information, then we have some hope. If we do it with a lot of stars, people will say it is only propaganda. So let us encourage the national parliaments to do the job as effectively as the Danes do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like very much to thank the Members of the House for the views they have expressed and very briefly to address two or three questions that were raised.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we are committed to the strategy of having common houses between the Commission and Parliament. At the end of next month we will provide Parliament with a report on the state of play as far as creating those common houses are concerned. We will have, on that occasion, the opportunity to discuss the issue that Mr Andreasen has raised.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as television is concerned, according to our polls 64% of European citizens recognise that whatever they know about the European Union comes from television. That is why we have launched a common invitation to tender for an audiovisual strategy to cover the issues concerning enlargement and the future of Europe. We are pursuing the feasibility study on the Europe channel. We have been in close contact with the services of the European Parliament and we are also following the evolution of the European audiovisual public sector, including the situation of Euronews, to have an overall picture and a better assessment of what we can do in the audiovisual sector, including television, to provide more information to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as Mr Karas said, the strategy cannot be developed just by the central institutions of the European Union. The challenge ahead of us is to build a partnership with the Member States, with regional and local authorities, to promote information about the Union. That partnership requires mutual confidence and a change in the culture of communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as you have said, if Europe is made the scapegoat for everything that goes wrong, it will be extremely difficult to portray what we do in a positive light. But at the end of the day I hope that Member States will understand that if they carry on with such a strategy, sooner or later, when they have to ask for the consent of citizens for the European project, they will be the first victims to fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I hope that this strategy will improve step by step. I am optimistic because, for the first time, the Council has engaged in close interinstitutional cooperation with Parliament and the Commission to develop information and communication strategies on the most important subjects. That partnership, which is on a voluntary basis, will start producing concrete results. Those Member States that produce concrete results will be the guiding light for the others to follow. We will succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
