By 2010 at the latest, the Member States have to ensure that their policy on water charges offers appropriate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and that it takes into account the social, ecological and economic effects of covering the costs and the geographical and climatic conditions of the region in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore attempted to make it clear in my report that the exploitability of our water resources must be maintained, for future generations as well, that we must keep to proven ways of keeping water pure and providing the population with clean drinking water, but that we may also look into new ways of doing this. In doing this, universal supply and drainage, high environmental standards, quality of provision and affordable prices must all be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be possible to introduce business instruments and involve private enterprise, but also achieve proportionate optimisation of the operational structures involved in providing water supplies. I myself say an emphatic ‘No’ to the deregulation of water supply and drainage, but I say ‘Yes’ to every country being able to use its water in the way that the people want. I say ‘Yes’ to solidarity in water use within Europe, but this must not be invoked to force any Member State to make its water available to another Member State without charge.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the many amendments that have been proposed, I would just like to say briefly one thing: It is marvellous to repeat things that are important, and also to repeat them over and over again. It is also very difficult to speak against things that are right and important, especially if they have long been part of legislation and of a directive, such as the water framework directive. But the question arises of how suitable it is to proceed in this way. Since we are today only drawing up guidelines rather than legislating, I would say: so what?</p>
<p class="contents">One amendment really hurts me – the one which, as it were, condemns a certain Member State because of a project which really is purely an internal matter for that State and the environmental effects of which have not yet been assessed and in respect of which, as and when European Union funds are actually granted, the laws of the European Union will of course have to be abided by. If I may establish a disagreeable precedent, I would be very happy if this amendment were perhaps to be voted down.</p>
<p class="contents">I found the Commission document very good. I also think it a good thing that Parliament, in contrast to the practice in many Member States, can also be heard on the subject of a law's implementing regulation. I would like to hope that the Commission and the Council will find their efforts supported by Parliament's opinion.</p>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the communication from the Commission. A suitable pricing policy for irrigation water will play a fundamental role in encouraging more efficient and sustainable use of water in agriculture, its largest consumer, and will free up resources for other uses, thereby reducing environmental pressures.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis of the pricing of irrigation water is complex, due to the wide range of agricultural uses in the European Union and also regional differences in the need and availability of water for agricultural usage. Water is, essentially, the very backbone of the agricultural community in the Mediterranean regions. Without water, nothing grows, apart from the controversial almond trees.</p>
<p class="contents">The pricing policy should be heterogeneous, taking into account the ‘polluter pays’ principle, as well as the social, environmental, economic, geographical and climatic variations in regions that no doubt will be the most affected by this pricing policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial, environmental and resource costs of irrigation farming require differential treatment if gradual-recovery objectives are to be achieved. For this reason, the introduction of this policy should be progressive, transparent and must be adapted to local requirements. In this way, information to irrigation farmers and the adaptation and optimisation of infrastructures and irrigation techniques should be applied in parallel so that farmers can accept this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in its current form the CAP does not help to achieve the objectives set out in the framework directive, which means we must seek coherence between these two policies in order to guarantee the protection of European agriculture’s functional model.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in Europe, water is a factor for cohesion between countries. The revision of Agenda 2000 on the development of agri-environmental measures should include the objectives of water policies. This will require the revision of certain types of aid, the application of eco-conditionality and the recognition of the right to adequate compensation for more vulnerable farmers, such as those who work on family holdings, with the aim of promoting the sustainable use of water and an integrated rural development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the subject should be broached with appropriate caution, so as not to give rise to counter-productive effects of an economic and environmental nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The great disparity in the application of criteria in this area should be taken into account, as well as the barriers that can exist in Member States, both of a legal nature and with regard to acquired rights and customs, that can be difficult to amend, particularly in the short term. On this subject, it is interesting to note that there are certain crops that contribute to the survival of a habitat and fauna that, without these crops, would disappear. There are also industries today that, after using a certain quantity of water, return it to its source in the same or even in a better state than before they used it. In principle, it does not seem a good idea to place a burden on this type of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">If time permitted, I could continue to give examples of economic activities, both agricultural and industrial, that, far from posing a threat to our water resources, are clearly beneficial to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, financial resources gained from water-pricing policies should be used to improve infrastructures, which would prevent water loss in transport, for example, and would ensure better and increased access to this resource. Paying for the amount of water we consume is, indeed, a key element, but only one of the many measures that should lead to a more rational use of this vital resource in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that this important issue of water distribution can be relatively easily solved if we have the good will and solidarity of EU governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Pricing policy is one way, therefore, in addition to the other instruments included in the framework directive on water, in which we can move closer to this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, therefore, that a price should be put on water and that this price reflects, as accurately as possible, its cost to the environment, the cost of supply and the cost of resources used.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important that a water pricing policy should take account of the social function of water, and of the need to consider climatic, geographical and regional aspects when the terms of such a policy are fixed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible, and, I would even say crucial, to make efficient and environmentally-aware water management compatible in all Member States with respect for the form of water resource management that each Member State feels is best suited to its needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should, therefore, support all the methods proposed in the communication aimed at achieving a more efficient use of water, and acknowledge that an appropriate pricing system is an important instrument in achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should strongly reject any proposal for intervention in a Member State’s water resource management policy. Firstly, because this goes entirely beyond the remit of the communication, and secondly, because it goes against the spirit and the letter of the framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget, when talking about costs and their recovery, about the terms in which this concept is fixed in the framework directive, in which establishing a pricing system that involves the maximum recovery of costs is advocated, leaving the criteria to each Member State, and with regard to the aspects that have already been mentioned – also in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for the concrete fixing of prices in each case.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the integrated recovery of costs, therefore, this recovery should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the framework directive, which is the only legislation in force on this matter in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore consider constant use of water and protection of water resources to be indispensable. One means by which this may be achieved is, as required by the water framework directive, a price for water that covers costs, comprising the environmental costs and the cost of infrastructure and of treatment. Incentives are necessary for water to be continuously used. Careful use of water is encouraged by having a basic price for basic services and increasing prices for use over and above that. The basic price must also take social aspects into account, for access to water must be possible for the less well off in society.</p>
<p class="contents">One important area in which there is a need for action is that of agriculture. The reduction of water subsidies in agriculture and the careful use of water resources will only be achieved by promoting rural development and finding new sources of income for farmers. Water polluters must also be called to account, which means that the 'polluter pays' principle applies. Every water consumer in Europe should additionally receive a statement of how much water he has used and how the price he pays for his water is made up.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as an important question, how much of a market we permit and whether private commitment conflicts with public and regionally-organised water supply and careful use of water. I believe that cooperation between public and private undertakings using private know-how and capital is an option when it comes to making the best use of water resources from an ecological and economic point of view, without regional supply zones being given up. So here I am not talking about deregulation and competition at any price, but about ensuring efficient and environmentally friendly water supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group is happy to support it. If water resources are to be used sustainably, the price of water to users must reflect both the costs of delivery and the costs of subsequent treatment. But when we vote tomorrow, a great deal of attention will be focused on just one aspect of the report, the Spanish hydrological scheme to build 120 dams and transfer vast quantities of water from one river basin to another.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure that a report about general principles should single out any one Member State for criticism but, having listened over the past few weeks to both sides of the debate, my personal view is that this scheme seems to be the antithesis of the approach laid down in Mrs Flemming's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has made very clear in the past her personal opposition to the use of EU structural funds to support projects which are damaging to the environment. So I hope she will watching closely when the Spanish Government comes to the Commission seeking billions of pounds in structural fund support for a project which seems to me to directly contravene the principles if not the letter of the water framework directive, one of the Commission's greatest achievements. I expect the Commission to make it absolutely clear that environmental impact studies must be independent and must consider the entire scheme, not just individual proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">This Spanish scheme is set to become a test case of whether the Commission's commitments toward environmental sustainability are matched by a determination to stand up to pressure from vested interests and the governments of Member States. I hope that the Commissioner will do her best to make sure that her colleagues pass that test. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> The Flemming report deals with water prices and, as Chris Davids has already stated, particularly relates to one very controversial issue, Paragraph 28, in which concern is expressed about the plan by the Aznar government to tap a vast quantity of the northern Spanish river, the Ebro, and to transport this water 1 000 km to southern Spain to cater partly for the tourist industry and partly for agriculture. This plan is detrimental to hundreds of nature reserves in Spain and will also adversely affect the natural habitat of the brown bear and Iberian wolf in the Pyrenees. This gigantic plan will cost EUR 22 billion and Spain wants Europe to contribute EUR 7 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain should learn that water is a precious commodity and that clean water comes at a price. That is why hotels and farmers use it sparingly. This is standard practice in northern Europe. It is also striking that the Portuguese government – Portugal is, after all, also on the Iberian Peninsula, does pursue a sound water price policy. Under pressure from the Aznar government, a new Amendment No 6 has been tabled by Messrs Flemming, Cox and Davis, precisely to delete reference to this Spanish plan. Does Pat Cox’ application for presidency have anything to do with this by any chance? How else can it be explained that the liberal group is now all of a sudden adopting a different position from that which it adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Fellow Members, I urge you to vote against Amendment No 6 to the Flemming report and to vote for the original paragraph. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot, therefore, support the amendments that talk of water as being a commodity or those which talk about the private management of water. And we will be voting against these amendments. However, I do believe that the rational use of water is an absolute necessity, as stated in Mrs Flemming’s report, and also a moral responsibility for Europeans with regard to those populations that have an enormous water deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 9 of the framework directive which, as the Commissioner knows very well, required a great deal of time and discussion time to complete, provides for the recovery of costs. The same directive, however, and the report by Mrs Flemming, as other speakers have mentioned, state that different regional, social and climatological situations should be taken into account, which leads on to the need to adopt water-saving measures in order to prevent leaks from water production and distribution systems, and to ensure the maximum re-usage of purified water, as well as the improvement of irrigation techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, the public, and those who work in the three sectors affected: domestic, agricultural and industrial, need to be informed. The quality and purity of water must also be improved. Commissioner, there is still a high level of nitrates in water and this should be addressed, as we have always said in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish, Mr President, by saying that it is hardly surprising that, in the context in which we are speaking, there should be clear opposition to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, approved, it is true, by a majority in the Spanish Parliament, for it is based principally on the use of reservoirs and the transfer of water in rivers such as the Ebro that could have a disastrous effect on an ecosystem that is unique in Europe. Furthermore, the planned reservoirs are located in Special Protection Areas. For this reason, it must be said, Commissioner, that, without wishing to condemn my own country in particular, we must pay more attention to how European funds are used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, the Member States must set a number of objectives for themselves to ensure the proper management of water. In this context, a comparison between States could lead to the use of best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">States must, however, maintain control over pricing and regulation. A community pricing system would create many problems. How can we reconcile the interests of the countries of the north with those of the south? As for regulation, the local water committees, for example, the main consultative and administrative bodies in France, should not be undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it makes sense for water policy to take account of specific geographical and regional characteristics. Water needs differ according to the type of agricultural production, soil quality and climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Commission, the rapporteur questions the application of the ‘polluter-pays’ principle to the agricultural sector. This pricing policy would lead to a substantial increase in price per cubic metre, an additional cost that would be added to the cost of animal welfare. Changing crop-growing techniques would put farmers in a risky and insecure situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulating water in too dramatic a way would penalise farming, which has already made huge efforts towards making refunds. Farming is in crisis and will have to stretch itself even further to comply with the rules of the WTO, which is now meeting in Doha. Instead, preserving the multifunctional character of our farming, which contributes to land-use planning and to managing the environment, will enable us to achieve better water quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislating now would be a mistake. Let us wait for the CAP reforms before we adopt a global approach to the issue of water, listening to and consulting all parties involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Average household water consumption varies, per person per day, between 120 litres in Belgium and 213 litres in Italy. Germany, with DM 7.72 per cubic metre for the supply of drinking water and for wastewater drainage, is, with Denmark, far and away at the top of the world league, but, as regards consumption, is third from the bottom. Adequate high-quality water supply and appropriate drainage are part, of course, of services of general interest in the broadest sense, such as we have been discussing this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, though, make the mistake of lumping deregulation and privatisation together. Privatisation can, in conjunction with other means, be perfectly adequate in achieving the objectives set by Article 9 of the water framework directive. I would, though, at this point, like – in the context of the discussion on the subject-matter for the new Inter-Governmental Conference – to give a clear reminder of the topic of the demarcation of competencies. We should not be making the sensitive area of water supply and drainage even more unstable while this issue has not been satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The various aspects of water and the price paid for it are among the most politically sensitive issues in some Member States, not only the southern ones, but also for Ireland and Austria, for example. I would wish to emphatically warn against mentioning or even attacking individual Member States. This applies all the more in view of the attempt, for example in item 28 for obvious reasons of party politics, to realise demands at a European level which would not be feasible in terms of domestic policy. Additionally in this case, the issues addressed are, then, only very marginally concerned, if at all, with the subject of the report. We would be creating a precedent with unforeseeable consequences, and I urge the adoption of Amendments Nos 3 and 6, for otherwise we would have to vote against an otherwise very good report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Members, however, found the temptation to include proposals on the prospects for privatisation in this sector too strong to resist. To my mind, privatisation is often the first step towards liberalisation. Some of us in this House support the idea that water must not become a commodity like any other and must instead be given special consideration and above all remain the property of everyone, in present and future generations. Public authorities must remain in control of the distribution and treatment of water, even if we accept the idea of delegating services to private companies for set periods and under precisely defined conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, if we wish to involve Europe’s citizens in these issues and to ensure that our policy does not simply result in higher bills, let us work on informing and communicating with the public on this crucial matter.

The report before us captures the spirit of the directive and applies it directly to the issue of the cost to be paid, by all users, although maybe not in equal amounts, for using water for economic purposes. However, the report also, rightly, and here I congratulate the rapporteur, stipulates that access to water at a proportionate or reduced cost, according to need, is a human right.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, any pricing policy must be based, above all, on a realistic examination of the social and other conditions in which the commodity of water is to be used, but also on a user education campaign that raises awareness and particularly focuses on water saving measures. In order to provide a service which best responds to the different situations, it would be appropriate to incorporate the principle of subsidiarity<span class="bold"> </span>so that each State makes its own decisions and each region sets its own levels and parameters.</p>
<p class="contents">The general line taken by this report could be described as preventing wastage and assisting the less economically developed areas, and our thoughts therefore turn immediately to the matter of the agricultural world, which, as some of the Members have pointed out, must certainly not be too casually confused with the general issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principle is, in fact, that all the users should, in any case, contribute to paying for the commodity of water but in different proportions. However, priority scales also need to be established on the basis of first social and then economic requirements. The most direct comparison is with the CAP, which is intended to encourage and propose development measures which, as well as being suitable for the area concerned, are also compatible with the level of water resources available. Where there is no water available at all, Mr President, I feel that this needs to be taken into account, especially in the pricing policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want especially to thank Mrs Flemming who took on the task of rapporteur for this very sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication must be seen in conjunction with the launch of the new water policy in Europe – the water framework directive, adopted last year. The aim of the communication is to establish guiding principles to support the implementation of the article on water pricing, that is to say Article 9 of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s draft opinion covers all the relevant issues affecting water pricing, from the covering of environmental costs to transparency and consumer participation. Moreover, emphasis is given to areas in which more research and analysis are required in order to ensure that future water pricing policy also embraces environmental, economic and social aspects. Part of this analysis will naturally be carried out in conjunction with the drawing up of management plans for river basin areas in accordance with the water framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The views of the European Parliament will form the basis for future work at EU level aimed at implementing a more sustainable pricing policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, allow me also to say something about what is happening in connection with the common strategy agreed by the Member States and the Commission to facilitate the implementation of the water framework directive. Working parties, including a working party on economic issues, have already been set up. These working parties are to develop implementation guidelines.
