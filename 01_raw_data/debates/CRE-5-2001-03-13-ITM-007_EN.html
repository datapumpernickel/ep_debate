<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Deprez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the main object of the initiative of the Republic of Finland which we have before us today is to reserve to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications. The initiative of the Portuguese Republic in effect pursues the same object, namely to reserve implementing powers to the Council, but this time with regard to border checks and surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the basic issue, I would call on Parliament to reject both initiatives because in my view they contain four serious political errors. The first is a political error against the Community spirit and against the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam. When it was decided that under the Treaty of Amsterdam the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> would be transferred from the third to the first pillar, this was done in order to remove this matter from the intergovernmental framework and integrate it into the normal legal and institutional framework. By reserving itself implementing powers, the Council would, in effect, be rejecting the spirit of the Treaty of Amsterdam and, in practice, perpetuating the intergovernmental methods that used to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">The second mistake is, I believe, an institutional one. Let me remind Members that Article 202 of the EC Treaty is not just any old article. It forms part of the institutional provisions in the strict sense, which the Court of Justice considers should take precedence over other provisions. In reserving itself implementing powers, in considering that this constitutes a specific case – which, however, it has not supported by a detailed statement of grounds – the Council is in my view taking liberties with a fundamental provision of the Treaty establishing the European Community. That is something I find unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council committed a third mistake, this time <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Commission. To justify reserving itself implementing powers, the Council maintains that visas and border control policy are a sensitive area. That argument does not stand up to analysis, especially when we remember that the regulation laying down a uniform format for visas expressly allows the Commission to take implementing measures, which are in fact secret, in what is clearly a particularly sensitive area. I would also be interested to know how much longer the Commission of the European Communities will stand by and watch the Council in effect dismantling its powers. Not only is the Council exercising the power of initiative that belongs to the Commission; on top of that it now wants to deprive the Commission of the implementing powers conferred on it by the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth error concerns Parliament directly. By reserving itself implementing powers – and I want every Member to realise this – the Council is completely depriving the European Parliament of the information to which it would have been entitled under the usual comitology arrangements. This refusal to provide information is all the more serious because some decisions already are and will continue to be taken in the framework of procedures classified as confidential. For example, by virtue of what is known as the prior consultation procedure, certain third-country nationals who wanted to enter an EU country, a Schengen country, would not be able to do so because a country, whose identity we would never know and which would not necessarily be the country of destination, had vetoed that person, for reasons we would never know and that would never have to be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly do not want to create confusion by suggesting that we must have a right to scrutinise individual decisions on each visa application, but I cannot accept the fact that on such fundamental matters, which affect the citizens' basic freedoms, the Council will never be accountable to anyone either for its priorities or for its selection criteria. That is not just a democratic deficit, it is a real denial of democracy. That is why I call on Parliament to follow the unanimous example of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and quite simply to reject outright the initiatives of the Republic of Finland and the Republic of Portugal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Socialist Group and the PPE-DE Group so wish, then perhaps even small groups may also be permitted to draw up reports on matters of interest. This report concerns a Portuguese initiative which tackles one of several problem areas in connection with visa policy. Unfortunately, however, this proposal – the Portuguese initiative – will create a number of problems because it does not really tie in with the other Schengen rules. Since, moreover, the situation is such that, in a very short time – in April, if I have understood correctly – the Commission is to come up with an initiative tackling all the problems surrounding the freedom to travel within the territory of the Member States, and since the Commission also shares my concern about the problems which the report will create, I very warmly recommend a vote in favour of my report and, thus, the rejection of the Portuguese initiative in favour of the later initiative to be produced by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">When we deal with these subjects, however, I think it might be a good idea if, once in a while, we were to take stock of what we are actually doing when we take these initiatives, which are, of course, all offshoots of the Schengen Convention and ideas about the ‘area of democracy, freedom and justice’ we talk so much about. The proposals with which we are dealing today and those with which we dealt previously are largely about closing this area of freedom, democracy and justice, which might be said already to be in the process of becoming isolated. We are, of course, well aware that our part of the world will require a labour force in not very many years’ time. We are well aware that several Member States are already facing the fact that we need a significant level of immigration if we wish to maintain a standard of living anything like that which we have at present and if, in addition, we aspire to a secure old age in which others work while we, hopefully, have time to ourselves. That is why it is so incomprehensible that we should continue to keep people out of our area, that we should accept that people will die en route to the EU, that we should be prepared to see the corpses of refugees or of people seeking a better life washed up on the coasts of the EU and that we should prefer to see these people as corpses than as citizens or as useful individuals in our part of the world. This is amazingly difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">My own country, Denmark, is among the worst. Ministers in positions of responsibility talk about putting refugees on desert islands, and when they talk like that, then the level of debate is as might be expected and anything is suddenly permitted. In my country, the term cultural struggle has acquired a resonance to the effect that all cultures must be combated if they are not Christian. The liberals in my country think that all refugees should be assembled in camps in the world's poorest countries. In the light of this, I am glad that my country is not involved in the common policy on refugees and, as a result, does not have any influence on those policies the EU is drawing up at the moment for, in spite of everything, the situation is a bit better than if Denmark had had any influence.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Wall came down in 1989, we all believed in a Europe without walls, but we are well on the way to putting walls up. We are not building them between us, we are building them around us. We should be asking how it is possible that we, the richest part of the world, so consistently choose repressive solutions. How can it be believed that an area of democracy, security and justice can be developed when repressive solutions directed against refugees are consistently chosen?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nassauer (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning Commissioner Vitorino complained that he had to comment on an initiative that was by no means of his own making. He is going to be faced with the same problem again, because we are now talking about a French initiative. It is concerned with mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third-country nationals and it is another case demonstrating that there are good reasons for reserving the power of initiative solely to the Commission. It is evident that the Commission is in a better position than the individual Member States to promote the Community interest, whereas individual Member States tend to concentrate on their own interests. So this is another piece of evidence that suggests we should press for the Commission to have a monopoly on legislative initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative dates back to the end of the French Presidency, at a time when the Presidency's achievements were threatening to look very slim indeed. So they rapidly came up with a whole string of initiatives just before the final whistle, in order to improve things somewhat, and they were all pretty rushed. I would recommend those of you who take an interest in legal matters to compare the first and second drafts. The first draft is all good will and politics, whereas the lawyers have crawled over the second draft and turned the whole thing into something that could reasonably be called a legislative initiative. In other words, there is a very considerable difference in the legislative quality of the first and second drafts of the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the legal objective of the initiative is now quite clear. It quite simply means that an expulsion decision made, say, in Paris, would be binding throughout the Community. That makes sense – after all it would be complete nonsense if a decision made in Paris could be appealed against in Helsinki or in Berlin or in any other Member State within the area of freedom, security and justice. But the Community needs a legal basis for such action. A legal objective is no replacement for a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a lesson we have just learnt from the European Court of Justice's ruling on the tobacco advertising directive. In that case too there was a legal objective which very much deserved to be debated, but the ECJ made it clear that there has to be a legal basis in the European treaties. The Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs twice unanimously rejected the French initiative on the grounds that there was no such legal basis. The French Government based its initiative on Article 63 of the EC Treaty, where you will find a legal basis for a European expulsion law. That is not quite the same thing as mutual recognition of decisions at national level concerning expulsions. A Community expulsion law would be a directive in which the Community lays down a proper legislative procedure stipulating the circumstances in which an illegal immigrant can be expelled and possibly even deported. However, in this case we are talking about all the Member States mutually recognising expulsion decisions and other similar decisions reached in accordance with their respective national legal frameworks. That is quite a different kettle of fish. As we have been rather more careful recently about whether the European Union and in particular the Community aspect of it can do everything it would like to do, we in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs were firmly of the opinion that while we support the legal objective pursued by the initiative, we can see no legal basis for it. We therefore propose that this initiative be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time we have immediately presented a suggestion for solving this problem. It is perfectly clear that this difficult situation could be resolved if there were a European expulsion law. So the inevitable consequence of this process is that we call on the Commission to bring forward a proposal for a directive creating a European, a Community expulsion law, which is also binding within the Community.

Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very worrying that this Parliament has rejected <span class="italic">en bloc </span>Council initiatives such as the ones we are considering here and that this demonstrates great disarray in the legislative process which the Treaty obliges us to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Free movement, for example, is a fundamental aspect, which requires legislation that is crystal-clear to both the citizens of the European Union and to those from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the reasoning that Mrs Frahm expresses in her report for rejecting the initiative and for expecting the Commission to fulfil the objectives proposed on the scoreboard, because we do need to consider all the scenarios in which nationals of third countries who are authorised to circulate within the territory of the Member States may find themselves in. It is also necessary, for the sake of this legal coherence, that the solutions proposed do not contradict the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said of Mr Nassauer’s report, in which he has expressed himself well and in which he rightly criticises the lack of legal rigour of the French Government’s initiatives on the mutual recognition of decisions regarding expulsion.</p>
<p class="contents">We should truly be considering whether the European institutions are providing a rigorous response to European society’s current demand that we create a policy on immigration which respects the principles of freedom, equality and justice that go hand in hand with European culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration and everything relating to it requires a tripartite pact between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, which will impose some order on this debate. The majority groups in this House, as happens in our own countries, must reach a consensus on the great principles enshrined in Chapter IV of the Treaty and its legislative implementation. We must achieve joint consensus and consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the path of confrontation which we are taking will not help to reach a solution to the problem, but rather make it worse, which would have dangerous consequences for all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No to these three initiatives. And yet here we are, going through the motions of a debate all over again. The authors of the proposal are absent so we are having a pleasant chat with the Commissioner on the subject, as he pointed out just now. Consequently, I think I will take advantage of the time allotted to me under the Rules of Procedure to make a few remarks. They will appear in the Minutes and should then reach the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the work they have put into carrying out a thorough legal analysis of the proposals. Their authors often seem to neglect to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall deal separately with Mr Nassauer’s report because I think the other two reports concern different issues.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Nassauer’s report, I should like to reiterate what I said earlier this morning. All too often we are presented with apparently simple proposals concerning very real and complex problems. Obviously, if you tell someone who is not that familiar with our literature that a person who has been expelled from one Member State should be expelled from all Member States, that first person is bound to agree. It seems sensible and logical. However, things are not that straightforward. An individual’s human rights have to be respected. So for this to come about a clear legal framework is needed, an effective common immigration policy, and an awareness of how and why a decision on expulsion should be dealt with in all Member States. I must congratulate Mr Nassauer on not having been taken in by the apparent simple-mindedness, if not simplicity, enshrined in the Council’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the reports by Mr Deprez and Mrs Frahm, I have to say that I think we really are in a very worrying position. These two Members have already explained far better than I could the technical and legal reasons why they advocate rejection of this proposal. I should, however, like to refer to a matter which seems to me to be of the highest political importance. The proposal considered by Mr Deprez contains the following sentence, “Because Member States have an enhanced role in respect of the development of visa policy”. This reflects the political sensitivity of the matter, in particular where relations with third countries are involved. It is used to support the argument that the Council should have the right to exercise implementing powers in this area. I find this very worrying. I believe it is a matter of great concern as we discuss a common visa list and are already implementing the free movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Will both Parliament and the Commission be called on again to come to the defence of the principle of freedom of movement and the Community bases for the implementation of this principle? Will we have to re-enact debates held prior to 1992? I trust the Council will take due note so that we can avoid doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time as walls are being torn down within Europe, new walls are being built to prevent people from making their way to Europe at all. As the EU’s external walls rise higher, more and more people are falling into the hands of unscrupulous people – middlemen who profiteer from refugees’ anxiety, fear and desire to survive and give their families a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that, in the last year alone, hundreds of people, including children clinging to the undersides of buses and lorries, have lost their lives – some of them off the Turkish coast, in Spanish waters and at Dover – in the hope of finding a better future in our part of the world. A few days ago, a young Kurdish man was shot by the police in a medium-sized town in Sweden. Exactly what happened, we do not know. What we do, however, know is that he had no valid identity papers and was to be deported.</p>
<p class="contents">Asylum policy is a common concern for the EU, but the disparate, and in some cases desperate, proposals received by the European Parliament threaten basic humanitarian values. It must go without saying that every refugee who wishes to stay within the EU must have his case carefully examined. European leaders must reflect upon why the smuggling of human beings into Europe is so dramatically on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN’s Secretary-General has been very clear in his criticism of the EU and of the EU’s obligation to protect asylum seekers’ rights. To impose visa requirements upon the citizens of approximately 130 countries in unworthy of European democracy. The basic rule must be that people have the right to travel freely into the EU. Mr Vitorino, the Commission should devote itself to shortening the list of countries upon which visa requirements are imposed. This is what Schengen cooperation should be about.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the ELDR Group regret that no overall asylum strategy has been presented and linked to labour market and immigration strategies. As matters now stand, there is no overview or comprehensive vision. Tighter measures, visa requirements and the threat of expulsion do not basically solve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a keen supporter of the EU and have wanted for a long time to see common rules within refugee and asylum policy, but we Liberals are not prepared to accept some kind of fenced-in Europe. The Iron Curtain must not be replaced by a more modern electronic variety.</p>

Spain's national government, supported by its majority in parliament and despite opposition from the remaining political parties, has forced through a law on immigrants, which denies ‘illegal’ immigrants basic human rights including those of freedom of association and freedom to join unions. Meanwhile, dead bodies are appearing on the beaches of the south of the Iberian Peninsula, many of them women and children who have perished in an attempt to reach land in search of work and opportunities for earning a living lacking in their home countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The sight of these corpses is a dramatic reminder that we are faced with a humanitarian problem that cannot be dealt with by adopting a faint-hearted or xenophobic approach. It needs to be approached in a rational, generous and forward-looking way, as the rapporteurs have done. I share the views of the Committee on Petitions on the Nassauer report on the initiative of the French Republic, namely that this vital issue needs to be resolved by making the European Union, when faced with the realities of immigration, an area of freedom, security and justice and not a society based on exclusion and expulsion, as so tragically personified by the young people found dead on the beaches that separate us from Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission need to prioritise work on an overall approach to immigration taking account of its humanitarian, economic, cultural and political aspects. We should not, on the other hand, forget that the eastward enlargement of the Union will inevitably lead to extraordinary internal migration flows creating a new social framework which we will not be able to address properly unless we solve the serious problem of immigration from third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What further barriers can we add to fortress Schengen to protect ourselves from outside threats?</p>
<p class="contents">That is the impression made on me by some aspects of the reports we will be voting on today; at the same time I approve the three rejections.</p>
<p class="contents">Less than a month after the tragedy of the <span class="italic">East Sea</span> that ran aground on the French coast, with 908 people crammed into the holds of an old tub, including three babies born during the crossing, we run the risk of perpetuating the image of a Europe that is suspicious of foreigners and wants, above all, to strengthen its borders, while alleging that the intention is to combat the trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot pursue an immigration policy based purely on policing, as the President of the French Human Rights League said a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The news shows us more horrors by the day and we hear expressions of indignation and emotion from all sides. We are bound to be shocked by the pictures of Kurdish families, dreaming of peace and freedom, who came to seek a future without persecution. They follow on from the pictures of the 58 Chinese immigrants who reached Dover only to be found dead among crates of tomatoes, of the fugitives from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Albania, Iraq, Africa or any other region stricken by poverty and war.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution. So the time has now come to strengthen the right of asylum as set out in the Geneva Convention; the idea of temporary protection, which does not prejudge recognition of refugee status, goes in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that trafficking in human beings exists and that there are criminal networks. We are all aware that fabulous sums can be made out of exploiting human misery. So if we are to combat this trafficking effectively we will have to attack the roots of the evil. Repression alone is not enough. We must impose severe penalties on those who organise and are responsible for this trafficking but we must also look into the reasons why individuals, exploited in a cowardly way, find themselves shunted from country to country, from continent to continent, in their search for El Dorado – all in the name of liberal globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not confuse the traffickers with their victims. We must seek out and penalise those who exploit illegal labour. In fact, immigration and economics go hand in hand. Yet the proposal to harmonise the penalties imposed on carriers could prove to be the wrong track to follow and could even be turned against certain people who are simply trying to help men and women under threat. Let us not make solidarity and humanity into an offence.</p>
<p class="contents">While the European Union is rightly seeking to pursue a humane development policy, let us make it clear that development depends on the free movement of people, their knowledge, their culture, as well as their suffering and their hopes. We must guarantee that freedom of movement. A society that decides to be tight-fisted and selective in granting residence permits, visas, places in holding centres, is a closed and sectarian society. Do we want a Europe that shuts itself off from the world; do we want a Europe that sorts people out and divides them up into good and bad refugees, acceptable immigrants and permanent exiles?</p>
<p class="contents">When will we see Council initiatives and proposals for directives drawn up in a spirit of openness to the world, a spirit of welcome and humanity, rather than one concerned primarily with policing and security?</p>
<p class="contents">Frantz Fanon wrote, “We always want to walk in the company of man, of all men.” I hope with all my heart that Europe can finally offer us that freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Something which very rarely happens in this Parliament occurred during the last voting session, and it occurred at the vote on the Ceyhun report, when Parliament rejected a Member State's proposal almost unanimously. The debate on these three reports, but also on the Kirkhope report, highlights an extremely clear-cut problem: we are not concerned with the merit of the proposal but its method. I therefore hope that, during this voting session, Parliament will once again heed the advice of the rapporteurs and the vote of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which calls for the Council's and Member States' proposals to be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, in particular, for a political solution<span class="bold">,</span> for Parliament to regain the dignity which a democratically elected institution which represents the citizens ought to have in matters of justice and home affairs, if only in terms of Parliament's institutional role. What I mean is, ultimately, Parliament has basically the same powers in this area as a non-governmental organisation. We Members often forget or prefer to forget this fact, but, as we know, under the Treaty, we have no decision-making power or influence over the outcome of the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that this is outrageous, particularly in an area which concerns the individual freedoms and rights of the European citizens. It is an outrage that democratic control is exercised by Council officials in these matters. It is an outrage that the work of Parliament and the work of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are, in fact, sidelined in favour of proposals which we are forced to discuss, proposals put forward by individual Member States, by groups of Member States, by the Council or by the States holding the Presidency, proposals which do not have a proper legal basis. Frequently, almost without exception, these proposals are the political manifestos of Member States which are perfectly aware that their proposals will never be adopted by the Council. Thus we find ourselves discussing matters which will never see the light of day or which will have to be re-examined, for the Council will never manage to reach a definitive conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for assuming a radical position rejecting the Council's proposals – a position which we consider to be appropriate to their role as Parliamentary rapporteurs. I confirm<span class="bold"> </span>that we will vote for the motion. We trust that, in the future, Parliament will do more than just protest, that Commissioner Vitorino will do more than just record the existence of a situation, and that tangible measures will be taken to change this state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So we regard it as most opportune at a time when the pressure of illegal immigration is rising and we regret the fact that the European Parliament intends, rather arbitrarily it seems, to reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">The French initiative seeks to introduce a kind of mutual application of certain judicial decisions, i.e. a new form of cooperation, which in principle deserves more attention. Under this proposal, if a Member State decides to expel a third-country national who presents a threat to public order or is an illegal resident, another Member State on whose territory that foreigner found himself could automatically enforce the expulsion measure, subject, of course, to any legal appeals. Despite the advantages of this proposal, the European Parliament's responsible committee is rejecting it for two reasons that I do not find convincing.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Article 63(3)(b) of the Treaty establishing the European Community would not constitute a relevant legal basis. This is not true because that article is concerned precisely with cooperation measures for the repatriation of illegally resident foreigners. That is very much the case here, since mutual recognition is indeed a measure that comes under that category.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are told yet again that the French initiative is too repressive and that first we need to establish a global European immigration policy. That is obviously a delaying tactic, for its proponents were very careful not to use the same argument a while ago when we were discussing the temporary protection of third-country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Republic's initiative on the mutual recognition of decisions on expulsion therefore certainly deserves to be approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These two proposals undermine Article 202, which establishes the general principle that the Commission alone has powers to implement the rules which the Council lays down, although the Council may also reserve the right, in specific well-founded cases, to exercise directly implementing powers itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The justification put forward is that the Council wishes to reserve for itself the right to exercise implementing powers for a five-year transitional period because the Member States have an enhanced role in respect of the development of visa policy, reflecting the political sensitivity of this area. This is not in itself, however, a sufficient reason for breaching a general principle of Community law. And it is not a valid argument, because it is contrary to the principle of the Protocol integrating the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> into the legal framework of the European Union, which specifically applies in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Frahm report, I believe that we should also support the rapporteur's position, which is to reject the Portuguese initiative. One of the reasons for this is that this initiative would lead to a lack of consistency in the rules governing the movement of third-country nationals within the territory of the Schengen Member States; the Schengen Convention covers three categories of third-country nationals who have a right to travel within the Member States: those required to have a visa, those exempt from any visa requirement and those who have a residence permit. This initiative only covers the second of these categories, thus fragmenting the right to travel of third-country nationals without indicating to what extent these rules revoke, replace or modify the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nassauer report also – and quite rightly – proposes that the French initiative should be rejected. Given that there are three proposals that we intend to reject, I would like to make an appeal to the Commissioner, António Vitorino, and to the Commission, that they should take the initiative in this area, thus ensuring the overall consistency of the Community framework of which it is the institutional guardian. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Chamber must stress once again that the Council can only exercise implementing powers which would otherwise be awarded to the Commission in specific cases and once a detailed statement of grounds has been given. Today the Council wants us to believe that visas and border checks are a specific case and to reserve for itself the implementing powers which belong to the Commission. At the same time, of course, it is ignoring the European Parliament and the required consultation procedure by amending decisions without consulting the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In resorting to these tactics, the Council is doing nothing to speed up the process of shaping a common European immigration policy; on the contrary, it is being obstructive, it is failing to take decisions and the Tampere process is making no headway whatsoever, thereby sustaining a climate in Europe which fosters racism and xenophobia and results in the sort of accident which we saw in Dover. There can be no doubt whatsoever that, if we want to create a common European area of security and justice, we need to oppose unilateral initiatives by Member States and make standard arrangements. Everyone crossing a border into Europe should be subject to the same rules and requirements, thereby ensuring smooth entry and residency procedures. Individual Member States and individual legal systems cannot be given the discretion to examine visa applications. Of course, we hardly need stress yet again that fortifying the borders and policing measures will do nothing to reduce migratory pressures and illegal border crossings as long as there is a huge prosperity differential between our countries and our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">So what the Council should do is to authorise the Commission, on the basis of the Tampere procedure, to take the necessary initiatives so that we can use assent procedures to introduce, as quickly as possible, a common immigration policy which regulates all outstanding issues fairly and is based on our common humanitarian European values and democratic tradition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They respond to demands by the Member States of the European Union either for greater flexibility as regards the period of residency of immigrants and a more lenient Community institutional framework, as in the case of Portugal, or for faster action on the decisions taken at Tampere on mutual recognition by all the Member States of decisions on the expulsion of third-country nationals, as in the case of France. All three reports have been rejected by the competent committee on formal grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be abstaining from the vote on the Deprez and Frahm reports and voting in favour of the Nassauer report, which rejects France’s initiative, because we, of course, disagree with the content, not the form of the initiative. The question which arises is why this constant preoccupation with immigrants? Perhaps there is no institutional framework? On the contrary. Both Union and national legislation have transformed the European Union into a well-guarded fortress in which there is no place for humanitarian values or solidarity, let alone the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">My country, Greece, is currently discussing a bill along these lines on so-called immigration policy which, to put it bluntly, treats immigration as a crime and anyone who fails to denounce or who assists an immigrant as an accessory to the crime. The causes of immigration stem, in our view, from the very policies of developed capitalist countries and the European Union, which plunder the wealth and rob the people of the fruits of their labour in the immigrants’ countries of origin, condemning them to a life of under-development and poverty. This is what causes mass immigration. Another cause of immigration is imperialist intervention, which foments national and local wars, causing huge waves of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">These current waves of immigrants, this modern slave trade suits big business in the countries in which the immigrants end up just fine. Can there by any doubt that what we have here is an inhumane interplay of the interests of slave traders, immigrants, war-mongering imperialists and those who exploit immigrants in the so-called host countries who, basically, as modern-day slave-masters, encourage unemployment and illegal immigration in order to attack the interests and rights of local workers in the coarsest manner? That is why protecting the rights of immigrants, both legal and illegal, must be one of the first and most urgent duties of the popular movement...</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are holding a joint debate on four Member State initiatives: on mutual recognition of expulsion decisions, on implementing powers with regard to the procedures for examining visa applications and for carrying out checks outside the Schengen borders and, lastly, on freedom to travel within the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">I will begin with the aspects relating to the provisions that come within the Schengen framework. First of all, I want to congratulate Mr Deprez on his precise and detailed examination of institutional relations in regard to the power to implement the rules established by the Council, powers relating to comitology as laid down in Article 202 of the Treaty establishing the Communities. The Commission does, in fact, believe that it should be possible to amend, adapt or update some of the provisions in the joint consular instruction, in the joint handbook and in the specifications of the Schengen consultation network, by a simplified method based on comitology. We can also subscribe to the initiatives of the Republics of Finland and Portugal, but we cannot subscribe to the majority of the proposed measures, which reserve implementing powers to the Council without, however, providing any circumstantial evidence that this really is a specific case that is an exception to the general rule laid down in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the analysis and the arguments put forward by Mr Deprez in his explanatory statement. Joint consular instruction, the joint handbook and the specifications of the Schengen consultation network have been integrated as the legal basis for Articles 62 and 67 of the Treaty of the European Communities, under Title IV. However, Title IV contains no institutional derogation from Article 202 of the Treaty. Moreover, most of the implementing measures linked to these instruments are purely technical in nature. They constitute no more than the practical formulation of political decisions taken by the Council in primary legislative acts, which are themselves governed by the appropriate provisions of Title IV.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I wish to express the Commission's total satisfaction with Parliament's position, a position entirely in line with that of the European Commission. And for the time being, the Commission not only emphasises its agreement but also hopes that the Council will listen to and accept the rapporteur's arguments, which I hope Parliament endorses, and the arguments along the same lines put forward by the Commission. In the event that it adopts a different interpretation, we will no doubt consider reacting by taking other measures…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">...measures which the Commission and Parliament can, in fact, take jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can endorse the aim of the Portuguese proposal for a regulation concerning the period during which third-country nationals who are exempt from the visa requirement can travel freely within the territory of the Member States. Indeed, Article 62 of the Treaty invites the Council to adopt, within five years following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, measures laying down the conditions under which third-country nationals can move freely within the territory of the Member States for a period of not more than three months.</p>
<p class="contents">However, and here it manifestly contradicts the Portuguese proposal, while the Treaty lays down a period of not more than three months, this is certainly not restricted to third-country nationals exempt from the visa requirement. That is why I agree with the comment by your rapporteur, Mrs Frahm, that it is not a good idea to regulate the situation of a single category, just as it seems obvious to me that we cannot extend the period of residence on the territory of the Member States beyond three months, up to a total of six months, solely on the basis of reciprocity agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission realises that the main object of the Portuguese initiative – for underlying reasons that are easy to understand – is to safeguard a number of existing bilateral agreements between the Member States and, for example, third countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Japan and Australia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, as I think I have made it clear, the method applied in this Portuguese initiative does not appear consistent with the Treaty, nor does it seem advisable to confine it to just one category of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we can confirm that the Commission intends in the near future to present a global proposal on the right to travel within the Schengen area, so as to avoid taking the kind of fragmented approach that could be an obstacle to transparency, to legibility for the citizens, and to legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come to the proposal for a directive on the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions, which the French Presidency presented last July. Taking the long-term view, it would seem desirable to allow an expulsion decision taken in one Member State to be executed in another Member State, without the latter having to take a new expulsion decision. The French Republic's initiative should be regarded as no more than a very first step towards achieving this objective, which we must recognise as an ambitious one.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, no common policy on repatriating asylum-seekers has been formulated in the framework of asylum and immigration policy. That is why I think it would be a much better idea, for the time being, to lay down common standards and principles, so that later on we could establish a binding legal framework governing the mutual recognition of measures to terminate a period of residence, in particular expulsion decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to defining such a policy, and as stated in its programme of work for the year 2001, the Commission will draw up a communication on a common policy on repatriation. This policy will include common principles, together with common standards and measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important common principle is to give primacy to voluntary return over forced return. The European Refugee Fund supports Member State efforts in this field. The discussions that will follow this communication and that will cover every aspect of the policy on repatriation promise to be very difficult, in view of the tensions between the Member States' need to implement the decisions and, on the other hand, the obvious human dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, persons who do not or who no longer satisfy the conditions laid down for enjoying the status of permanent or temporary legal resident should normally be asked to leave the territory of the European Union unless the Member States concerned have a legal obligation of whatever kind to allow them to remain.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to formulate a common immigration policy that is as complete as possible, we cannot leave aside the question of repatriation, which, if I may put it that way, is the other side of the coin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
