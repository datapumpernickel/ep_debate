<p>(FR)The European Union is a community of values founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. Like every Council Presidency, the Luxembourg Presidency has endeavoured to respect and promote European Union policy on and the positions that the Union has taken in the field of human rights.</p>
<p>The Council has also reaffirmed on many occasions that it attaches priority to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p>To that end, five years after Tampere, the European Council has adopted a new multiannual programme for the Union, to be known as the Hague Programme, the objectives of which include the improvement of the common capability of the Union and its Member States to attain the Union's objectives in that area.</p>
<p>On 3 June 2005, the Council adopted a Council and Commission Action Plan which includes the specific measures that will be referred to the European legislative body with a view to the implementation of the Hague Programme.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the European Union, meeting in Council in December 2003, advocated the conversion of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia into the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency to which the honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>The Commission has said that it will draft a proposal for a regulation on this issue. The Council will give full and in-depth consideration to such a proposal.</p>
<p>Finally, the attention of the honourable Member is drawn to the fact that, on 27 April 2005, the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Part 2) approved the establishment of an ad hoc working party with a remit to consider the proposal for a decision establishing, for the period 2007-2013, a specific programme on fundamental rights and citizenship (as part of the general fundamental rights and justice programme), which the Commission submitted to it on 26 April 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0391"></a>

<p>(EN)The Council is aware that an alarming number of people is still subject to forced labour, a phenomenon that indeed should have no place in this world.</p>
<p>In order to raise awareness and combat this and related phenomena, the EU regularly raises these issues in its relations with third countries, both at a bilateral and at a multilateral level, as well as with international governmental and non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p>For instance, as part of its efforts to promote effective multilateralism in the world, the EU puts a lot of effort in promoting ratification and implementation of the key international human rights instruments, many of which include provisions on labour standards and the protection of children.</p>
<p>These efforts include actions undertaken in the field of trade and development (for instance, the Generalised System of Trade Preferences (GSP), the international commodity agreements where the EC and its Member States are parties and most Partnership Agreements with third countries include human rights clauses) and justice and home affairs (combating crime and trafficking in human beings).</p>
<p>As an example, the preferences provided for by the GSP may at any time be temporarily withdrawn, in whole or in part, in cases of practice of any form of slavery or forced labour as defined in the Geneva Conventions of 25 September 1926 and 7 September 1956 and International Labour Organisation Conventions No 29 and No 105. In application of this provision, the benefit of the tariff preferences applicable to Myanmar has been withdrawn since 1997, following a report by the Commission on forced labour in that country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0393"></a>

<p>(FR)As has already been pointed out in answers to similar questions, it is important to draw attention to the importance which the Union, and more particularly the Council, has always attached to the issue of child protection in Romania.</p>
<p>In its 2004 report on the progress made by Romania on the road to accession, the Commission noted that regular progress had been observed as regards the reorganisation of child protection, in particular through the closure of the large, old-fashioned institutions and the establishment of alternative facilities. The Union, for its part, has provided financial support for the efforts made by Romania in improving the quality of state-run child welfare facilities.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the new legislation on children's rights and adoption, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, complies for the most part with the standards set by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the practice followed by EU Member States.</p>
<p>Although there is still some progress to be made in developing administrative capacities with a view to the proper and effective implementation of these new provisions, all the evidence shows that conditions have on the whole significantly improved and that the Romanian authorities have undertaken to continue their efforts to fully implement the reform of the child protection system.</p>
<p>The Council can assure the honourable Member that the Union will continue to closely monitor Romania's efforts and the outcome thereof.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0395"></a>

<p>(FR)The Council is well aware of the alarming situation facing millions of children in developing countries, and in Africa in particular, owing to their vulnerability vis-à-vis famine, violence, conflicts and disease. The Council would point out that children are directly or indirectly mentioned in the 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) whose implementation will be the subject of an initial report on the occasion of the United Nations Summit in September 2005.</p>
<p>The Council believes that it will not be possible to achieve these goals by 2015 unless a coherent policy is adopted with regard to children in the developing world.</p>
<p>Specific attention needs to be given to children in the implementation of the European Union's development policy. The Council has taken a series of recent initiatives to this end:</p>
<p>1. The Council and the representatives of the Member States meeting within the Council approved, in their conclusions of 24 May 2005, a set of measures aimed at speeding up the progress towards implementation of the MDG.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the fact that the Member States are well on the way to achieving the 0.39% of official development assistance objective contained in the Barcelona commitments by 2006.</p>
<p>The Council also took a crucial decision regarding a collective and individual increase in the volume of official development assistance by 2010, as a further step towards collectively contributing 0.7% of Community gross domestic income by 2015.</p>
<p>To this end, the Council decided that the European Union would collectively contribute 0.56% of its gross domestic income to official development assistance by 2010. In concrete terms, this is equivalent to a EUR 20 billion increase, which the EU will effect each year from 2010 in order to support the world's poorest countries. In making this collective commitment, the agreement has taken account of the specific situation of those Member States which joined the Union in May 2004.</p>
<p>In addition, the Council decided that the Member States would undertake to reach the 0.7% figure by 2015 and those which have already reached this figure have undertaken to remain above this rate. Those Member States which joined the EU after 2002 will endeavour to reach 0.33% by 2015. This is the first time that a clear timeframe has been set for achieving the 0.7% collective threshold.</p>
<p>2. At the same meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Council expressed its firm support for the European Action Programme to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculoses through external actions, submitted by the Commission at the end of April 2005. This programme provides for special attention to be devoted to children's rights and the needs of orphans and vulnerable children, as well as safety at school, especially for girls. A joint action by the EC and the Member States, in cooperation with the main international organisations in this area (UNICEF and UNFPA), together with teachers and parents' associations in the partner countries, is also planned.</p>
<p>3. The process of revising the joint declaration of November 2000 on the European Union's development policy is in progress. A Commission communication on future EU development policy is expected for the end of June. Many subjects were identified during the extended consultation process as possible thematic priorities, including child protection in particular.</p>
<p>Child protection is a vital aspect of EU development policy and the Council intends to ensure that this priority is adequately reflected both in the context of preparations for the September 2005 summit in New York on the implementation of the MDG and in the process of formulating future EC development policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0397"></a>

<p>(FR)The Council is aware of the work in progress at the World Bank to prepare a Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF). A recent meeting of the International Task Force on management of commodity risks, held in Interlaken, Switzerland, in May 2005, considered this proposal from the World Bank, on which we are expecting a concept report. According to the information available, index-based (for example, rainfall index) insurance for weather-related risks will be covered by the Facility proposed by the Bank. This Facility will be aimed at linking the demand in developing countries for insurance against risks relating inter alia to natural disasters with the world insurance market.</p>
<p>In the proposals concerning the use of the conditional billion from the 9th European Development Fund (EDF), the Commission proposed that the Council set aside an indicative amount of up to EUR 25 million to help finance the management of commodity risks.</p>
<p>This initiative followed on from the Council's approval (Doc. 8972/04) in April 2004 of an EU action plan proposed by the Commission (Doc. 6454/05) on commodities, which includes a proposal to improve producer access to commodity risk insurance and trade finance.</p>
<p>This funding could contribute to the establishment of the Facility proposed by the World Bank and the participation of other donors to supplement the amount put forward by the Bank, which is EUR 100 million. Its aim would be to help ACP countries to gain access to available market instruments for the management of commodity risks through temporary co-funding of their premiums. This would help to reduce the vulnerability of beneficiary ACP countries to fluctuations in commodity prices and natural disasters and to set up and eventually adopt instruments to manage commodity risks. A joint EU-ACP committee on agricultural commodities would supervise arrangements for the establishment and implementation of the programme.</p>
<p>As with all decisions regarding the use of EDF resources, such a contribution will require a decision from the ACP-EC Council, whose next session is to be held in Luxembourg on 24 and 25 June 2005. The EU Council is continuing its work to reach a position on all the Commission's proposals regarding the conditional billion with a view to this joint ministerial meeting. The ACP side is also due to establish its position at a ministerial meeting due to take place in mid-June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0401"></a>

It is not for the Council to express an opinion on the substance of this ruling. Obviously, Turkey is, however, expected to respect the Court’s ruling and to comply with it. The Constitutional Review of May 2004 established the principle of the primacy of international and European conventions in the field of human rights and therefore confirmed the capacity of the Turkish judicial system to give direct effect to the rulings of the ECHR. The need fully and quickly to implement the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights was, moreover, recently pointed out again by the EU in the position it adopted for the EU-Turkey Association Council of 26 April 2005.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a candidate country for accession to the EU, Turkey is also expected generally to pursue the reform process and to implement it effectively in all its aspects, particularly with regard to fundamental freedoms and full respect for human rights. The European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004 clearly indicated that the full and effective implementation of the reform process will continue to be monitored closely by the European Union. </p>

<p>(FR)The Resolution to which the honourable Member refers, which formed part of the 2002-2004 work plan on culture, was intended to enhance synergies with areas and activities other than cultural ones, as laid down, moreover, by the Treaty.

<p>(EN)On 10 February 2005 the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) stated officially that it possessed nuclear weapons and it suspended its participation in the “Six-Party” multilateral negotiations for an indefinite period of time. Subsequently, it also announced that it did not feel bound by the 1999 moratorium on ballistic missile testing. The Presidency clearly stated the EU position in a declaration, as well as in a letter subsequently sent (jointly with the HR and the EC External relations Commissioner) to the DPRK Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The EU stated its strong disappointment and concern at these announcements and urged the DPRK to refrain from any additional decision which would further undermine confidence. It also reasserted its strong support to the process of the Six-Party talks as the best means to resolve the nuclear issue. It welcomed and supported the recent calls by the international community for a rapid and unconditional resumption of the talks and encouraged the DPRK to take advantage of this opportunity and to return to talks as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The EU also renewed its appeal to the DPRK to comply with the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It reminded the DPRK that respect of international obligations, both on nuclear and human rights issues, is an indispensable condition for the EU to develop its bilateral relations with DPRK.</p>
<p>The EU continues to exercise pressure for an early resumption of the talks, including in the bilateral contacts with the DPRK. In the meantime the Presidency also keeps in close contact with the parties of the Six-Party talks, in particular the United States, Japan and China.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0413"></a>

<p>(FR)It is important to emphasise that establishing an area of freedom, justice and security requires information on convictions and disqualifications to be properly shared among the Member States’ judicial authorities.</p>
<p>The obligation to provide information on convictions already exists on the basis of Articles 13 and 22 of the 1959 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, supplemented by Article 4 of the Additional Protocol to this Convention, dated 17 March 1978.</p>
<p>It is also laid down in the draft Council Decision on the Exchange of information extracted from the criminal record, which is in the process of being adopted.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that, in adopting the Hague Programme, the European Council of 4-5 November 2004 prioritised the issue of the exchange of information on convictions between Member States and called on the Commission to draw up fresh proposals.</p>
<p>Consequently, on 25 January 2005, the Commission tabled the ‘White Paper on exchanges of information on convictions and the effect of such convictions in the European Union’. On the basis of that document, meetings were held to look into the feasibility of setting up an effective and complete system of exchange of information between national criminal records. Whilst the results of the feasibility studies demonstrated that setting up the exchange system is a complex process and that it places extra burdens on the national authorities in the Member States, such a system is an indispensable means of guaranteeing security, justice and effective cooperation between the national judicial authorities in the European Union.</p>
<p>The exchange of information and the interconnection between national criminal records were the subject of the deliberations of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in April. Following the orientation debate, there was broad agreement in the Council on the need to base exchanges of information on bilateral communication between criminal records.</p>
<p>As regards Community nationals, exchanges of information on convictions should be conducted via the Member State of which the convicted person is a national. A ‘European index’ will, moreover, be set up to identify the Member State of conviction in the case of third country nationals.</p>
<p>The new legislative proposal concerning the creation of a complete system of exchange of information between national criminal records, taking account of the above-mentioned conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, will be presented by the Commission at the end of the quarter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0419"></a>

<p>Since the Commission endorses this line, thereby seriously contradicting the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 12 May 2005 on the end of the Second World War which emphasises that 'there cannot be reconciliation without truth and remembrance', what is the Council’s view of truth in the light of our European past?

<p>(FR)As the honourable Member correctly points out, at the end of May the Commission tabled a proposal for a regulation on a multiannual funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency in the field of response to pollution caused by ships. This proposal is to be analysed jointly by Parliament and the Council within the framework of the codecision procedure, and forms part of the thrust of the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013. The instrument that is finally adopted will therefore reflect the outcome of proceedings on the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p>The Council has yet to analyse this brand new proposal and cannot therefore yet issue an opinion on the adequacy of the financial resources proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Council is already in a position to indicate that it welcomes in principle measures for ensuring efficient mobilisation of the necessary anti-pollution equipment (including clean-up vessels) to assist a Member State faced with a pollution problem.</p>
<p>Since as early as November 2001, the Council has also been calling on the Commission to carry out a study into the technical feasibility of enhancing the detection of illegal discharges of polluting substances at sea, inter alia by developing satellite technology aimed at implementing an oil-spill monitoring system which, in tandem with the new Automatic Identification System, could become a highly effective instrument for detecting oil spills and identifying their sources.</p>

<p>(FR)The eradication and prevention of torture is one of the human rights priorities of the European Union as is evidenced by the EU Guidelines on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which were adopted by the Council in 2001. In that context, numerous measures have been taken to this end, including the following:</p>
<p>In line with the Guidelines the EU has raised in the past, and will continue to raise the issue of torture and ill-treatment with third countries, including the US, during political dialogue meetings at bilateral as well as at multilateral level.</p>
<p>In its external relations, the EU systematically recalls that states should abide by their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law when countering terrorism.</p>
<p>EU Heads of Mission have drawn up reports on the occurrence of torture and carry out demarches with regard to individual cases of concern and general policies and practices in many countries in the world.</p>
<p>The EU also asks countries to cooperate with the UN Special Procedures, including extending an invitation to the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and to follow up on his recommendations.</p>

<p>(FR)Action taken by the Council and its General Secretariat in the area of transparency and public relations is governed by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents and by the decision of the Council General Secretariat of 25 June 2001, establishing a code of good administrative behaviour for the General Secretariat and its staff in their professional relations with the public.</p>
<p>Under Regulation 1049/2001, the Council made 11 067 documents public in 2004 following 2 160 access requests, out of a total number of 12 907 requested documents.</p>
<p>As regards information disclosed to the public under the code of good administrative behaviour, the Council’s ‘information to the public’ service dealt with a total of 9 227 requests for information in 2004, of which 8 529 were received by e-mail and 698 by letter.</p>
<p>Consequently, pressure groups and lobbying groups can, should they wish to do so, follow the Council’s decision-making process using this provision, along with other measures aimed at Council transparency, such as:</p>
<p>debates and proceedings open to the public</p>
<p>direct contact with officials under the code of good administrative behaviour governing relations between Council officials and the citizens</p>
<p>briefings arranged by the press office on the day after Council meetings</p>
<p>the chance for representatives of professional organisations to attend press conferences during ministerial meetings in the Council, subject to the availability of seats in the press room.</p>
<p>Given that, on the one hand, transparency is an integral part of Council proceedings and that, on the other hand, the decision-making process should be carried out effectively, the Council, as an institution, is not planning to introduce its own accreditation system for pressure groups and non-governmental organisations along the lines of the system that Parliament has in place or of the one that the Commission might put in place.</p>
<p>In this regard, it should be emphasised that the positions held by the delegations represented in the Council and its preparatory bodies are established in the capital cities, on the basis of the practices and the national regulations of the Member States.</p>
<p>Let us not forget, moreover, that when it acts as a legislator in areas relating to the first pillar, the Council is only called upon to give rulings on the proposal of the Commission. It would thus appear appropriate that talks with the interested parties should be conducted by the Commission in accordance with its own rules.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Council will study with the utmost interest any measures proposed to it by the Commission, aimed at improving transparency and, where applicable, dialogue with pressure groups.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0444"></a>

<p>(FR)As the honourable Member is aware, the European Council stated clearly in Helsinki in 1999 that candidate countries must share the European Union’s values and objectives as set out in the Treaties. In this respect, the European Council stressed the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter and urged candidate countries to make every effort to resolve any border disputes and other related issues.</p>
<p>The European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004 reiterated the need for unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations, whilst welcoming improvements in relations between Turkey and its neighbours. It also took stock of the situation regarding ongoing disputes and welcomed the exploratory contacts that have taken place to this end. Against this backdrop, it stated its opinion that unresolved disputes affecting the accession process should, where necessary, be brought before the International Court of Justice to be settled. The European Council stressed that it would be kept informed of progress, which it would analyse as appropriate.</p>
<p>In line with the conclusions of the above-mentioned European Council, and in the same spirit, the Council has consistently monitored the progress of relations between Turkey and its neighbours, especially those it maintains with a Member State, namely Greece. This issue has been, and will be, the subject of debate in the political dialogue meetings that are held regularly between the EU and Turkey and in the bodies set up as part of the Association Agreement. This was the case recently in the EC-Turkey Association Council of 26 April, during which the Presidency, on the Union’s behalf, urged Turkey to defuse any source of friction with its neighbours and to hold back from any action liable to have a detrimental effect on the process of settling border disputes peacefully.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0388"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission considers that there is a vital need to protect the integrity of sport. At all levels, appropriate measures must be taken with a view to promote fairness and anti-racism in the run up of such an important sport event as the Football World Cup. All actors are called upon to contribute to this work within the framework of their particular roles and competences.</p>
<p>Within its competences, the Commission has been active in promoting the positive values of sport. Along this line, the year 2004 has been designated as the “European Year of Education through sport” (EYES 2004). Learning from each other, promoting educational values of sport, using sport in general and football in particular to fight racism and discrimination were the key messages spread during the EYES 2004.</p>
<p>Other initiatives have been taken in this field, supported by the Directorate General of Education and Culture, like the project: "FOOTBALL AGAINST RACISM IN EUROPE - Using football as tool for intercultural dialogue and to promote European integration" that started on 1 September and will end on 30 June 2005.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Monitoring Centre On Racism and Xenophobia is continuing its work on football and racism, particularly by joining other actors such as the FARE network and the Committee of the Regions to raise awareness about the broader dimension of football in the community and encourage greater involvement of local authorities in following up the Braga Declaration. Cooperation with both actors includes undertaking public awareness raising activities in 2006 in the context of the FIFA World Cup in Germany.</p>
<p>Concerning the second question, even if there are no specific activities planned in the youth field at European level to accompany the World Cup – which does not exclude national initiatives by the hosting country or other countries - there are a number of other activities ongoing on the fight against racism and xenophobia in the youth field.</p>
<p>The fight against racism and xenophobia is a priority of the Commission’s White Paper “A New Impetus for European Youth”. In this context, the Commission has supported:</p>
<p>the creation of an Internet platform promoted by and for young people ;</p>
<p>a conference on youth and the promotion of diversity and mutual respect ;</p>
<p>cooperation with other services and institutions on initiatives such as the EU’s awareness-raising campaign “For Diversity-Against Discrimination” and the Council of Europe’s “All Equal-All Different” campaign.</p>
<p>It also is a priority in the calls for projects in the framework of the Youth Programme. In the framework of the Youth Programme projects of young people against racism and xenophobia are supported. Some of these projects relate to sports activities and promote diversity and mutual respect in sports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0394"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission shares the view that regular and active sport practice is essential to the physical and psychological well-being of Europe’s youth.</p>
<p>The importance of sport, and indeed any kind of physical activity, for keeping fit is well-known and well-documented. In today’s industrialised world the rampant obesity crisis has added a new dimension to this. A Commission-sponsored study conducted by a consortium led by the Universities of Paderborn and Duisburg-Essen, which was published on 3 January 2005, indicated that physical activity is urgently needed to avoid obesity, and that obesity presents an alarming health hazard to our children and young people, including typical old-people’s diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases.</p>
<p>Likewise, there is an increasing focus on the importance of sport and other kinds of physical activity for the psychological well-being of the individual. The Commission study referred to above concluded that fit children are happier and more balanced. Additionally, research results point to a correlation between possibilities offered for exercising physical activity and sport in school settings, on the one hand, and the level of academic results on the other.</p>
<p>The Commission recently launched a special initiative which aims to create links between all types of actions necessary to combat obesity, “Diet, Physical Activity and Health – a European Platform for Action” which may be of interest in this context.</p>
<p>In 2004, in the framework of the European Year of Education through Sport (EYES), funding was available which could apply to projects related to the issues discussed here. Unfortunately, there are presently no specific sport-dedicated funding possibilities due to the lack of legal basis in the current Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0411"></a>

<p>(EN)The study conducted under the Portuguese Presidency in 2000 focused on the conditions for the creation of a complementary funding scheme to be adopted at national or European level with a view to covering the additional costs of student mobility. It concluded that a loan scheme might be established to support the real additional costs of studying abroad with repayments related to the graduate’s future income. It suggested that the scheme could be financed by the European Investment Bank and administered by a “European Student Mobility Support Agency” established for the purpose. The study concluded that the scheme could be established either at European level or, in view of subsidiarity and proportionality, in interested Member States separately.</p>
<p>The Commission examined the recommendations of the study with the representatives of the Member States in the Socrates Higher Education Sub Committee in March 2001. While the interest of the idea was acknowledged in principle, concerns were expressed about subsidiarity, the feasibility and coverage of the proposed scheme, and the future of student mobility grants.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal for a new Integrated Lifelong Learning Programme, adopted in July 2004, proposed a significant increase in the volume and level of Erasmus student mobility grants (a tripling of the annual volume, and an increase in the average value of the grant from EUR 150 per month currently to EUR 250 by 2013). It did not consider it appropriate to propose at the same time the establishment of a Europe-wide student loan scheme for mobility. This does not of course preclude the establishment of such schemes in individual Member States.</p>
<p>The European Investment Bank has supported two pilot projects within Member States on student loans:</p>
<p>A Higher Education Student Loan Facility for students in three polytechnics (Bari, Milan and Turin) launched in December 2003.</p>
<p>A loan of € 100 million to the Hungarian Student Loan Centre (Diákhitel Központ Rt.), awarded in May 2005, for students studying in Hungarian universities.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that these projects are not, however, comparable with the scheme outlined in the 2000 study. They target the needs of students studying in their home country rather than the additional costs of study abroad.</p>
<p>For the time being the Commission has no plans to establish a Europe-wide system of complementary student loans for student mobility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0415"></a>

<p>(EN)The questions raised by the honourable Member refer to the future implementation of the Commission’s proposal for a Recommendation of the Council and of the Parliament on further European cooperation in quality assurance in higher education. This proposal was adopted by the Commission in October 2004<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and is currently being examined by the Parliament and the Council. Most of the issues raised by the honourable Member will depend on the discussions taking place within the legislative process. However it has to be underlined that the ENQA (European Network on Quality Assurance) approach does not lead to legally binding rules. The ENQA standards and procedures have been conceived in a context of intergovernmental cooperation based on confidence. They can be considered as political commitments.</p>
<p>Furthermore it should be stressed that the European Ministers of Higher Education met in Bergen on 19-20 May 2005 for a mid-term review towards achieving the European Higher Education Area (Bologna process – intergovernmental cooperation). They have adopted the standards and guidelines for quality assurance proposed by ENQA. They also committed themselves to introducing the proposed model for peer review of quality agencies on national basis. They welcomed the principle of a European register of quality assurance agencies based on national reviews and they asked for a further report on the practicalities of implementation.</p>
<p>The aims of the Bologna process are very close to those that the Commission has for the Higher Education field and the above mentioned Proposal for Recommendation will build on the achievements of the Bologna process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The search for knowledge has always been at the heart of the European adventure. Knowledge, in the broadest sense, has helped to define our identity and our values, and it is the driving force behind our future competitiveness.</p>
<p>In Europe, we need to overcome existing geographical and intellectual fragmentation, we need to become much better at producing knowledge through research, at diffusing knowledge through education and at using and applying knowledge through innovation.</p>
<p>This requires the knowledge triangle of research, education and innovation to function within favourable framework conditions, which reward the knowledge that is put to work.</p>
<p>The Commission is already working hard to develop such framework conditions for knowledge and innovation, for example through its proposal for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research, technological development and demonstration activities.</p>
<p>But there are also other initiatives aimed to reinforce Commission’s commitment to knowledge as a key to growth, particularly within the context of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p>Within this context; the Commission has recently suggested to establish a European Institute of Technology which would act as a pole of attraction for the best students, researchers and professors from Europe and from around the world.</p>
<p>The Commission has also transmitted a preliminary note of reflection on this to the Member States.</p>
<p>It stated that attempting to create a new institution in Europe would not be the right solution and that such an Institute should be based on a network approach which would itself have to be connected to further, subsidiary, networks in order to ensure that the scientific excellence and knowledge it creates would benefit the whole union.</p>
<p>We should not forget that Europe has a certain number of world class research centres, universities with good quality and leading industries in the field of technology. However, what does not seem to work in Europe is the knowledge transfer between them feeding into economic capacities.</p>
<p>This potential must be mobilised and shared and this is where the European Institute of Technology could add value: an entity that combines the essence of the knowledge triangle with a clearly world-class reputation and with a European identity.</p>
<p>The challenges for creating such an Institute are manifold. In order to explore with the Member States and public and private stakeholders on how best to take this idea forward and on how to define the role, nature, organisation and governance of such an Institute the Commission will launch in September this year a public consultation process.</p>
<p>Consequently, the outcomes of this consultation will be duly taken into account by the Commission when preparing its proposal for such an Institute.</p>
<p>That is the reason why the Commission is not yet able to take any position on the nature or location for such an Institute but it would like to invite the Parliament to actively take part in the consultation process and to share its ideas about this with it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0443"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission indeed considers research and development a top priority for the EU. This is reflected in its proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme and its request to double the budget for Community research. In the Seventh Framework Programme, the European Research Council (ERC) is the new major feature. It will be created under the “Ideas” programme and will fund investigator-driven, frontier research, selected on the basis of scientific excellence and competition between individual research teams at European level. This was the wish of the scientific community in Europe, as reflected also in the Kok report.</p>
<p>According to the Commission’s proposals, the ERC will consist of a scientific council and a dedicated implementation structure. The scientific council will be a group of eminent scientists, which will, inter alia, oversee decisions on the type of research to be funded and act as guarantor of the quality of the activity from the scientific perspective. Its task will cover, in particular the development of the annual work programme, the establishment of the peer review process, as well as the monitoring and quality control of the programme’s implementation from the scientific perspective. The dedicated implementation structure, in the form of an Executive Agency, will be responsible for all aspects of implementation and programme execution, as provided for in the annual work programme.</p>
<p>The timetable for the approval of the ERC will follow the timetable for the approval of the Framework and Specific Programmes. The provisional timetable foresees an adoption of all the legal texts by September 2006. Meanwhile, the Commission has already taken the necessary steps to prepare the ERC structures:</p>
<p>It has designated an “identification committee”, chaired by Lord Patten and charged with identifying potential members of the scientific council. The committee is expected to conclude its work by the end of June 2005. The Commission intends to appoint the scientific council, once the process for the identification of its members is completed. This will allow the timely implementation of the “Ideas” specific programme and will give the opportunity to the scientific council to establish its modus operandi.</p>
<p>In order to be able to make an informed decision, and also comply with the relevant legislation, it has also launched a cost-benefit analysis for the establishment of an Executive Agency. The final report of this analysis is expected in July 2005.</p>

<p>(EN)There is no doubt that the Research Framework Programme (FP) has allowed important investments in “neglected diseases” in the past decade through its international scientific cooperation activities.</p>
<p>The Commission published a call for projects for 2004 and another for September 2005 to support new research on how to prevent diseases which mostly affect people so poor that they will never represent a sizeable market for the pharmaceutical industry. The Commission is convinced that the number of projects it is funding or hopes to fund this year represents a substantial investment towards broader international efforts in this area. The Commission would also like to stress the fact that we are not only supporting high quality research but also high-quality partnerships over long periods of time, thus contributing to the countries’ capacities to design and implement new strategies for prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, our proposals for “collaborative research” in FP7 have a high international dimension. The Specific Programmes are under preparation and each theme should have a component of international cooperation. Third countries can participate in the European programmes and in the specific international cooperation activities which are actions of mutual interest and which reply to the needs of third countries, including developing countries. The Commission is confident that the field of health research will encompass specific international cooperation actions and priority areas will be adapted to local needs. It is also convinced that we will be able to implement these research activities by keeping up our tradition of partnership building.</p>
<p>It has been shown on a number of occasions that the research on drugs that we fund is excessively oriented towards discovery and not towards difficult product development steps. The honourable Member knows about our efforts to create structures allowing for better and faster clinical development in Africa via the EDCTP (European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership) and the Commission is aware of the problems we will have to expand these efforts towards other diseases.</p>
<p>Directorate General for Research and technological Development has been working in collaboration with other Directorates General on an alternative incentive to research grants to support more and better partnerships with industry, where most of the drug development capacities are located. The Commission will continue to explore a series of models and scenarios but we need to see a clearer position of these incentives from industry itself.</p>
<p>The recently adopted European Programme for Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis through External Action (2007-2011) foresees that the EU undertakes studies to establish a priority list of “pull incentives”. The objective is to engage private industry in the research and development of new tools and interventions, based on a cost-benefit analysis and on their feasibility. The studies should, in particular, analyse advanced markets mechanisms, cash premiums, an international financing facility for vaccines, and transferable privileges – such as Intellectual Property Rights extensions or fast-track approvals. The EC will also support a selected number of public-private partnerships and global initiatives. The aim will be to establish the coordination and synergy that are necessary and the appropriate level of resources required to accelerate R&amp;D efforts, to estimate the health, social and economic benefits that could be derived from the development and use of new diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic technologies, and new tools. The EU will enhance cooperation within Europe to ensure the viability and progress of innovative research initiatives towards the development of priority products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0426"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission has been addressing the issue of improving the participation of women in European research since 1999.</p>
<p>In its recent proposal for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme, the Commission gave a strong signal of its intent to continue the efforts concerning the participation of women in research and to give more weight to gender research. It is clearly said that due regard will be paid to the role of women in science and research with a view to further enhancing their active role in research.</p>
<p>A major problem identified over the years is the discrepancy between an increasing number of female students and very slow progress for women in decision making positions in research.</p>
<p>In Europe, female students are still significantly underrepresented in engineering studies (less than 25%). Women are generally better represented in natural sciences, though some disciplines such as physics remain largely unpopular with women.</p>
<p>Thus the “Education and Training 2010 Work Programme”, agreed by all Member States, sets as one of its key objectives increasing the number of young people choosing careers in the fields of mathematics, science and technology, and in particular reducing the actual gender imbalance in these sectors.</p>
<p>As a result of this Work Programme, the Education Council adopted in May 2003 a European benchmark: the total number of graduates in mathematics, science and technology in the European Union should increase by at least 15% by 2010 while at the same time the level of gender imbalance should decrease. The first part of the target will be achieved well ahead the deadline, probably within 2005. In spite of an overall improvement throughout the European Union, the gender balance remains an issue for most Member States.</p>
<p>Women all too rarely occupy posts of full professors in Europe. They represent only 14% of all professors and even in the most “feminised” scientific fields they remain in the minority.</p>
<p>At the Competitiveness Council of 18 April the Ministers adopted a European target of 25% of women in leading positions in research in the public sector- e.g. full professors. The Commission fully supports this target.</p>
<p>Also important is the regular collection of recruitment data and reporting in Europe to closely monitor progress. The Commission welcomes the Council conclusions in this respect.</p>
<p>In March, the Commission adopted a Staff Working Document entitled “Women and Science: Excellence and Innovation - Gender Equality in Science”. This document lists the main ongoing and foreseen Commission activities to improve the participation of women in science and technology.</p>
<p>It is clear that Europe should eliminate the remaining discrimination against women in research and needs especially to work on the disadvantages linked to maternity or care duties. Provisions for maternity leave should be included in research funding schemes, both nationally and at the European level. The European Charter for Researchers and Code of conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers could give guidance to Member States in this respect.</p>
<p>Europe has also to pursue the debate on gender bias and scientific excellence. Findings from a recent study indicate that existing methods of defining and evaluating scientific excellence, both in basic and applied research, are not as gender neutral as are claimed. More attention will be paid to ensure that research bodies, funding institutions and the scientific community at large think in a more general and systematic way about promoting a research environment free of gender bias.</p>
<p>There is also a need to improve the understanding of new challenges raised by EU enlargement and the changing roles and life plans of women and men in Europe, and their impact on the creation of the European Research Area, through more gender research.</p>
<p>Eventually, more attention has to be paid to women in industrial research. The Commission is defining specific activities for the coming years aimed at increasing their total number (currently 18% of the workforce in private research).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0427"></a>

<p>(EN)Knowledge is indeed at the core of the Lisbon Agenda and underpins all its elements. Research and technology are, together with education and innovation, the components of the “Triangle of knowledge”. Alongside Member States and in close cooperation with them, the EU must mobilise its legal and financial tools towards the goal of becoming the “most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world”, starting with the research Framework Programme.</p>
<p>Amongst others in its Communication “Science and technology, the key to Europe's future” (June 2004), the Commission has underlined the principle that, in order to achieve the Lisbon Agenda, Europe needs to realise the full research potential of the enlarged Union.</p>
<p>The integration of new Member States into the European Research Area is and will be facilitated through a variety of policies and instruments. Beyond the measures that were in place at the pre-accession stage, the new Member States now not only have full access to the RTD Framework Programme, but also - in a complementary way- to the Union’s Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Past and existing dedicated Community measures in research have already successfully explored ways of mobilising the research potential in the economically less developed regions. Examples of proven and successful measures are:</p>
<p>In Framework Programme (FP) 5: European Centres of Excellence in Acceding and Candidate Countries, to help to restructure the science and technology sectors in these countries and to support their economic and social development;</p>
<p>In the current FP6: “Marie Curie Host Fellowships for Transfer of Knowledge-Development scheme”, directed at the reinforcement of the research potential of research entities in need of new knowledge and competences, with a dedicated objective of 70% of the means for the scheme to be directed at research organisations in the Less Favoured Regions;</p>
<p>In the current FP6: Return (since FP4) and Reintegration Mechanisms, supporting the reintegration of researchers after a period of mobility, in particular in Less Favoured Regions and Associated Candidate Countries;</p>
<p>In its legislative proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme, adopted on 6 April 2005, the Commission has proposed to step up the Community research effort considerably in the period 2007-2013, doubling the expenditure from € 5 billion to € 10 billion a year on average. In order to strengthen excellence and raise the average level of research in Europe, the basic principle is to stimulate, organise and exploit all forms of cooperation in research, from collaboration in joint projects and networks to the coordination of national research programmes, competition at European level as well as the joint implementation of large technology initiatives and the common development of infrastructures of European dimension and interest. It is clear that research entities throughout the EU-25 and more, will be able to engage in and benefit from the full spectrum of these proposed Community actions.</p>
<p>As part of the FP7 proposal a dedicated budget, named “Research Potential” to the amount of € 554 million, is envisaged to help to unlock and develop the research potential in the EU’s convergence regions, and assist in strengthening the capacities of their researchers to successfully participate in research activities at European level. By focussing on the reinforcement and expansion of the collaboration of such research groups with other EU research centres, an important contribution will be given to unlocking their potential and with that to their long term sustained development. Through optimising their international exposure and recognition, leadership potential and high quality of their scientists, the visibility of these research groups will be increased and their participation in and crucial contribution to the European Research Area facilitated.</p>
<p>Like for all current and future Community research actions, the basic selection criterium in the RTD FP’s is excellence and high potential. This is what distinguishes measures in the Community research policy framework from other measures, which are key to developing education, research and innovation capacities in new Member States, based on other Community policies, like the Structural Funds. These Funds are really geared to development and cohesion. The new Member States are already using the current intermediate period of the Structural Funds (2004-2006) to reinforce their position in the European Research Area, by integrating a high proportion of their national or regional R&amp;D and innovation efforts in the Structural Funds Operational Programmes. This possibility will be enhanced in the new Programming period 2007-2013, since the Funds have made support to the Lisbon Strategy a centre-piece of their approach, especially in the convergence regions (ex Objective 1). The draft Regulations of the Funds, adopted by the Commission in July 2004 have indeed placed support to R&amp;D, innovation and knowledge economy at the heart of their priorities in all 3 new Objectives (convergence, regional competitiveness and territorial cooperation).</p>
<p>Special efforts are and will be made by the Commission’s services to achieve synergies between the RTD FP and the Structural Funds, for example for the creation of new infrastructures. For this to happen, Member States’ research communities and those planning authorities responsible for the Structural Funds must take the necessary steps to coordinate their input on R&amp;D in the future Structural Funds Operational Programmes. For its part, the Commission will take all the necessary steps to make this planning as efficient as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0429"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission is fully aware of the impact that rheumatic diseases have on the European population, the healthcare systems and economic competitiveness, and agrees that multidisciplinary research into these diseases needs to come up with more knowledge and insight on the fundamental, clinical and public health related questions raised by these diseases.</p>
<p>The Commission would like first to mention that, although these diseases are, as such, not specifically earmarked as major diseases in the current 6th Research framework programme, a number of projects, related to chronic inflammation, rheumatic disease models, and to the development of adequate therapies, are already being funded in this field under the current Framework Programme.</p>
<p>The Commission has also met with organisations representing interests and patient groups such as, the European League against rheumatism, EULAR, which have provided very useful position papers on the needs and perspectives of future research. These exchanges have constructively fed into the discussion about specifying research areas in FP7.</p>
<p>In this context, as the honourable Member is aware, the Commission has adopted on 6 April 2005 its proposal on the 7th Research Framework Programme. In this proposal, under the “health” theme in the “Cooperation” part, the Commission specifically puts forward to undertake transnational research in major diseases, including chronic diseases. The fact that osteoarthritis is explicitly mentioned as an example of such chronic diseases, proves the importance given to this type of research.</p>
<p>Furthermore the section on rare disorders might also give opportunities for research on rare rheumatic and autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>Finally it must be stressed that the “Health” theme contains two other strategic issues that will be addressed horizontally across all activities, being “child health” and “the health of the ageing population”.</p>
<p>As such the Commission trusts that its proposal provides sufficient prospects for research into rheumatic diseases.</p>
<p>On the budget question, the Commission can inform the honourable Member that an indicative budget figure for collaborative research in “Health” of 8.373 million € is proposed, but that specific allocation of funds to particular activities is still under discussion, and that therefore at present no figure can be provided for the research on these chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would also like to add that, besides research, complementary activity in the Community public health programme regarding health monitoring for this disease group and in the field of rare diseases are also relevant.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0435"></a>

<p>BONUS is a project funded under the ERA-NET scheme of the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for RTD. The main goal of BONUS is the coordination of the national Baltic Sea Research Programmes.</p>
<p>The project includes research funding organisations from all Baltic coastal states, including from Russia, as well as ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.</p>
<p>The coordination of these programmes affects several tens of research projects with an accumulated annual research budget estimated to around € 20 million.</p>
<p>According to the rules of the ERA-NET scheme, the EU financial contribution only covers the coordination costs of some € 3 million over 4 years, while the research funds are national funds.</p>
<p>ii) Article 169</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission is preparing the Proposals for the Specific Programmes of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for RTD. In this context, Member States around the Baltic Sea are preparing a proposal for a joint programme of research on the Baltic under the terms of Article 169 of the Treaty. The current BONUS project (which is an ERA-NET project) contributes to this preparatory work.</p>
<p>Article 169 allows for the participation of the Community in jointly implemented national research and development programmes. As such, Article 169 can be used as a funding scheme for implementing the Framework Programme.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal for FP-VII indicates that a dedicated implementation structure will be set up for each joint programme under Article 169. It is to this dedicated structure that the Commission would give the EU contribution. This contribution can be used both to fund research activities and to cover costs of the implementation structure.</p>
<p>Because of the geography and the environmental issues in the Baltic the involvement of Russia is highly desirable should a joint programme on the Baltic Sea be established under Article 169. This involvement would be done via the implementation structure and would be in line with the principle that the Framework Programme allows for participation of Third Countries.</p>
<p>Any joint programme under Article 169 is to be decided by both the Council of Ministers and the Parliament under the co-decision procedure. Hence, Members of Parliament will be fully informed about all aspects of the issue, scientific and financial.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Meanwhile, the Spanish Government has once again changed the criteria governing the extraordinary regularisation programme currently under way in Spain.

<p>(EN)Firstly, as a general rule, the Commission does not comment on the actions taken by individual Member States in the field of regularisations, as these decisions are still within their national competences. However, previous regularisations in some Member States have made it very clear that there is a strong need for a common EU approach in managing migration.</p>
<p>The Commission has carefully examined the Spanish Royal Decree 2393/2004 which contains, in its third transitional clause, the rules governing the regularisation procedure. The Commission is therefore fully aware that one of the requirements irregular migrants had to fulfil in order to obtain a residence and work permit under the regularisation procedure was to be registered in a municipal register (‘padrón’) before 8 August 2004.</p>
<p>Under existing Community legislation, Member States are not obliged to inform the Commission of national measures they take within areas of their competence. As no Community rules exist yet in the area of regularisation of irregular migrants, this is still an area of national competence, and therefore the Spanish Government was under no obligation to communicate to the Commission the actions it intended to undertake.</p>
<p>This situation may change in the future since the Commission will soon present a proposal on the establishment of a mutual information procedure on Member States’ measures in the areas of asylum and immigration. The objective of this proposal is to set up a compulsory mechanism by which Member States must inform other Member States and the Commission of planned national measures they intend to undertake in the areas of immigration and asylum.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0380"></a>

<p>The Spanish Government’s regularisation programme for immigrants ended on 7 May. The programme was a great success, with around 700 000 applications being made. The aim of the programme was to end illegal employment by integrating illegal immigrants into Spanish society. To achieve this, employment contracts were required for regularisation. The programme was backed across the board by trade unions, management and civil society. In addition to ending illegal employment and integrating illegal immigrants, the programme has put Spain in the perfect position to participate in and promote the establishment of a common European policy on immigration.</p>
<p>Does the Commission support the successful Spanish regularisation programme as a way of ending illegal employment and integrating illegal immigrants into society by granting them full rights?

<p>According to the information available to the Commission, Spain faced a particular problem caused by the presence of about 1 million irregular migrants, who were registered at municipal registers but who did not have residence or work permits delivered by the Ministry of Interior.

<p>(EN)Widening the scope of reduced rates was considered at the time the Commission was drafting its proposal on reduced VAT rates<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. As part of that consideration, the Commission decided to propose the extension of the option of applying reduced rates to the categories for which a significant number of Member States were already authorised to apply reduced rates under specific derogations and where, therefore, a common need had already been established.</p>
<p>Currently, housing is subject to a reduced rate in 14 Member States, while the restriction to social housing is applied in a variety of ways or not at all, by virtue of specific derogations granted to some Member States.</p>
<p>As far as the Commission knows, no Member State applies reduced rates to any other building services. They usually subsidise building services concerning schools and this can compensate VAT costs. This is also the case for other buildings such as places of worship, listed buildings, hospitals and other public buildings. This is a national issue outside the scope of VAT rules. In these circumstances, the Commission proposed reduced rates for the whole housing sector, including renting, but not for other buildings.</p>
<p>After several meetings at ministerial level, no agreement could be reached in the Council because some Member States are strongly opposed to any extension of the scope of the reduced rates. The Luxembourg Presidency has now proposed a compromise with a restricted category for housing<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. At this stage, this implies that school buildings would not be covered.</p>
<p>With reference to the Lisbon strategy, the Commission would like to emphasize that adequate tax policy is an indispensable means of achieving the Lisbon objectives whereby the EU is pushing for accelerated economic growth, job creation and improved competitiveness. Therefore, the Commission is ready to examine with an open mind any compromise solution that the Council of Ministers could reach on rates.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has already recognised the need to inform third countries about REACH and is already devoting sizeable resources to this. Furthermore, the Commission has recognised the need for clear guidance for stakeholders to ensure consistent, cost-effective and smooth operation of the system, explaining the many flexible elements in REACH available to companies. It has therefore started a major programme of work to develop such guidance, in co-operation with stakeholders. The Commission intends that appropriate guidance will be available at the time each part of the REACH system comes into force. The guidance will be available to domestic EU producers and importers alike.</p>
<p>The REACH proposal also recognises the need to improve international cooperation Under the REACH proposal there will be established a new European Chemicals Agency to manage the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of the REACH system. One of the tasks of the Agency will be at the Commission’s request, to provide technical and scientific support inter alia to improve cooperation between the Community and third countries, as well as active participation in technical assistance and capacity building activities on sound management of chemicals in developing countries’ (art. 73 (2) (i) of REACH).</p>
<p>The European Communities recognises its obligations under Article 11.3 of the TBT Agreement to provide adequate assistance to allow developing countries to comply with legislation such as REACH. In addition to the provision of extensive guidance material (as mentioned above), the Commission aims to do its best to help developing countries to familiarise themselves with REACH. This will be achieved in part through technical assistance and capacity building but also through training and provision of information by the proposed Chemicals Agency.</p>

<p>Various European industrialists have now drawn attention to the scale of the milk sales involved. Has the Commission given this any consideration?

<p>(EN)The Commission is well aware of the emerging markets for agricultural products in South-East Asia and in China and it has at various occasions encouraged Community producers and exporters to exploit those new markets while providing technical and political support.</p>
<p>With specific regard to milk and milk products it is clear that the potential in China is substantial, particularly against the background of the size of population and the increased standards of living. However, in real terms only milk powder seems to be an appropriate product as it is easy to transport, handle and store. The European producers and exporters of milk powder are no doubt aware of this potential market but whether actual exports will take place depends on their evaluation of the economical circumstances e.g. whether export refunds can be obtained or not. In that context, it is worth recalling that firstly the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement has fixed a quantitative and budgetary ceiling for subsidised milk powder and, secondly, that export refunds are likely to be phased out at a pace which remains to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Technical assistance, promotion, trade fairs etc. seems to the Commission to be far more appropriate tools than legislation in the effort to open up and exploit the market in China.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0371"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission is indeed aware of the European Parliament’s stance, adopted on 14 April 2005, and became aware of it prior to the Transport Council of 21 April.</p>
<p>Following the latest discussions between the European institutions, the industry and the other parties affected, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The common position issued by the Council on 9 December 2004 to which the Commission gave its agreement on 14 December 2004, has set 5 August 2005 as the date when tachographs will be brought into use in all new vehicles. The Commission is keen to see this provision enter into force at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>During a technical meeting on 14 April 2005 between the Commission, the Member States and representatives from the industry, the participants declared themselves ready to introduce digital tachographs.</p>
<p>However, information was also brought to the Commission’s attention, suggesting that it would not be possible to deliver the tachographs, on a broad scale, before 5 August. The Commission asked to meet those players likely to be most affected and is in the process of analysing the information. It will be sure to raise this point at the next Transport Council, if the problems are confirmed.</p>
<p>The implementation of European legislation on digital tachographs requires close collaboration between the tachograph manufacturers, who are to deliver the equipment to the car makers; the Member States, which are to deliver the driver cards; and the vehicle manufacturers, which are to install the equipment in all new vehicles. Lastly, suitable training programmes for drivers and vehicle operators must be set up by the tachograph manufacturers, in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission feels that the availability, in due course, of the new tachographs should be a prerequisite for the implementation of European legislation on digital tachographs.</p>
<p>Given that vehicles already on the road can continue to be driven using analogue tachographs, both types of tachograph will be used simultaneously for a certain amount of time. The two types will record the same driving times and rest times, however, and are to be supervised by the national authorities in the same way.</p>
<p>In order not to distort competition, the authorities of the Member States will be required to implement the rules on driving time properly and effectively.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The question relates to restructuring aid granted by the Spanish authorities in favour of Babcock Borsig España S.A. (“BBE”), engineering and construction undertaking active in the sector of capital goods in Galindo, Spain. The Commission authorised the payment of restructuring aid in favour of BBE for a total amount of € 294.66 million by means of a decision adopted on 3 July 2001 (OJ L 67, 9.3.2002). By letter of 19 November 2003 the Spanish authorities notified an amendment of the restructuring plan in favour of BBE, which was also approved by Commission’s decision on 16 December 2003 (OJ C 65, 13.3.2004, p.6). A new Commission’s decision was necessary because the initial buyer of BBE withdrew and the restructuring plan was amended by the new acquirer of BBE, i.e. Austrian Energy &amp; Environment AG.</p>
<p>It should initially be noted that contrary to the statement in the first question BBE is not a beneficiary of a Community subsidy, but a beneficiary of aid granted by the Spanish state. Also, the amended restructuring plan, adopted by the Commission on 16 December 2003 and which is to be implemented in five years and foresees a return to viability of BBE by the end of 2008, includes among other features the scaling down of some activities of BBE with parallel substantial reduction of employees.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the paragraph 45 of Community Guidelines on state aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission must be put in a position to make certain that the restructuring plan is being implemented properly, through detailed regular reports communicated by the Member State concerned.</p>
<p>Following the Commission’s decision of 2001 the Spanish authorities submitted the reports on the state of advancement of the restructuring plan of BBE in December 2001, July 2002 and November 2003. After the adoption of the Commission’s decision in 2003 on the amended restructuring programme, the Spanish authorities have not yet submitted a report on progress of the restructuring. The Commission has sent a reminder in this respect to the Spanish authorities, which promised to send a complete report shortly. In the meantime, the Commission has been informed by the Spanish authorities of the current stage of payment of the authorised aid until the end of 2004. According to this information only 1/3 of the total authorised aid was paid out. The payment of the aid is closely linked to the advancement of the restructuring plan of BBE, which shall be fully implemented by the end of 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to closely follow up the development of the restructuring plan and systematically monitor that the strict conditions of the restructuring plan of BBE are fulfilled as laid down in the Commission’s decisions of 3 July 2001 and 16 December 2003.</p>
<p>(FR)The Commission is aware of what is at stake in terms of employment and economic development in the case of restructuring raised by the honourable Member. In general, and without prejudice to the rules on State aid, it intends, as far as possible, to promote the search for solutions that combine all the economic and social aspects in a partnership process. Its recent Communication on ‘restructuring and employment’ forms part of this objective and organises the coordination of Community activities to this end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)At EU level three legislative instruments provide for rules on the setting up of joint investigation teams: the Convention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations, the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the Framework Decision on joint investigation teams.</p>
<p>The Convention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations adopted on 18 December 1997 has been ratified by 22 Member States (lack: IT, PL and MT). The 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters has been ratified by 11 Member States (AT, DK, EE, ES, FR, HU, LT, LV, NL, PT and FI) and it is not yet in force. The Commission has no power to force Member States to ratify a Convention.</p>
<p>The Framework Decision on joint investigation teams was adopted on 13 June 2002. The content of the Framework Decision reproduces Articles 13, 15 and 16 of the 2000 Convention dealing not only with the setting up of the teams but also with the criminal and civil liability regarding officials.</p>
<p>According to Article 34 TUE, framework decisions are binding upon Member States as to the result to be achieved but leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods. However, framework decisions shall not entail direct effect.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 4 of the Framework Decision, Member States were supposed to take the necessary measures to comply with it by 1 January 2003. In order to enable the Council to assess to what extent Member States have complied with the Framework Decision, the Commission evaluated the implementation measures taken by Member States in the report adopted on 7 January 2005. Only one Member State has been considered as fully compliant with the Framework Decision.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, whereas the Commission has under the Community Treaty the authority to start infringement proceedings against a Member State, this possibility does not exist within title VI of the TEU, concerning provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0381"></a>

<p>(EN)Regulation 998/2003 on veterinary rules applying to non-commercial movements of pets provides that rules relating to rabbits and rodents should be established through the Regulatory Committee procedure.</p>
<p>To this end a proposal has already been drafted by the Commission, discussed in an expert working group and at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health which is the Committee in charge of these issues.</p>
<p>The objective was to propose a simple system, easy to implement and taking account that these animals are usually kept at home.</p>
<p>The main lines were the following:</p>
<p>No difference between Member States as they are all equivalent with regard to the health risk associated with these species;</p>
<p>No conditions and no document requested for movements inside the European Union and from most of the European Third Countries;</p>
<p>A “home quarantine” of 30 days with a clinical examination was the only requirement for movements from other third countries.</p>
<p>However, as often happens with issues relating to pets, some Member States considered the draft proposal as too strict whilst others considered it as too liberal.</p>
<p>The Commission is now considering all the remarks and requests for amendments received from the Member States in order to find an acceptable compromise.</p>
<p>A new proposal will be submitted as soon as possible to the Committee.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes it will be favourably welcomed and that “bunny rabbits” will travel in accordance with simple and harmonised rules.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0383"></a>

<p>(EN)One of the objectives of the REACH proposal is to protect human health and the environment, including animals. It was triggered by the general lack of information about the dangerous properties of chemicals. Unfortunately, closing this knowledge gap without using test methods involving animals is currently very difficult.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the REACH proposal has been designed so as to keep animal testing to a minimum and avoid any unnecessary or redundant tests on animals.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Commission’s interim strategy for REACH, much of the preparatory work is currently being conducted as part of the REACH Implementation Projects (RIPs). One of these projects (RIP 3.3) aims to develop guidance for all stakeholders on information requirements and aims in particular at developing intelligent testing strategies which should allow minimal use of test animals. The activities within this RIP project will actively use the information that will become available, for example, through actions in the field of computerised methods (e.g. a (Q)SAR (Quantitative and Qualitative Structure Activity Relationship) and in the field of alternative test methods.</p>
<p>Since 1985, the European Union has been promoting alternative methods through framework research programmes. So far under the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Research Programme (2002-2006), the EU has funded projects to promote alternative methods, to an amount of 39 Mio Euro. According to the recently adopted Proposal for a 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Research Programme, alternative methods are to be promoted as research priorities for 2007 - 2013. In addition the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) has made a so-called catch-up validation possible in order to speed up the validation of alternative test methods.</p>
<p>The Commission remains committed to further promoting alternative methods at national, European and international level. It is proposed to hold a conference on alternative methods in autumn this year with the objective of bringing together leading experts to discuss those issues and to provide advice on how best to accelerate our goal to reduce animal testing to the strict minimum, and at the same time maintain the competitiveness of enterprises.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0389"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission thanks the honourable Member for her continuing interest in the issue of environmental protection in Romania’s mining area Rosia Montana.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the persistent concerns of the Parliament as recently expressed. The Commission ensures the honourable Member that it pays the highest attention to these interventions and concerns.</p>
<p>The Romanian authorities have informed the Commission that an application for an environmental permit has been submitted by the mining company in December 2004 and that following this application, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), compliant with the EU directive on Environmental Impact Assessment and with the transboundary requirements of the ESPOO convention, is being undertaken. The Commission has been informed that any further exploratory activities have been halted. The Romanian government has repeatedly confirmed that it will strictly respect the environmental acquis and that the decision-making process will be based on precaution and transparency.</p>
<p>No EU funds are or will be involved in the Rosia Montana project.</p>
<p>As regards Natura 2000, Romania has no obligation to classify sites before accession. According to the Commission’s information the Rosia Montana region is heavily mined since a very long time and the Commission would not expect that such an area could be classified under the Natura 2000 sites. It is important however to note, that the EIA procedure will have to include considerations about whether the Rosia Montana area would potentially fall under the Natura 2000 network.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0392"></a>

<p>(EN)The honourable Member refers to the seminar and workshops on “Multi-Agency Alternative Strategies for Targeting the Proceeds of Criminal Activity- A European Union Perspective” which took place in County Monaghan, Ireland on 24<span class="sup">th</span> to 27<span class="sup">th</span> April of this year. The conference was organised with financial support from the Commission’s AGIS Programme and the Irish Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
<p>The purpose of the conference was to bring together Member States police investigators and prosecutors with expertise in criminal asset identification, tracing, freezing and confiscation with a view to consider how to ensure most effective cooperation and information exchange in these areas. In addition to Member States experts, the conference was also attended by Europol, Eurojust, the Commission, Interpol and the International Monetary Fund. The conference was a useful contribution to promoting cooperation among practitioners in criminal asset forfeiture and a very worthwhile use of Commission AGIS funds.</p>
<p>The Commission gave a key note address at the conference, outlining the essential role of criminal asset confiscation in the fight against organised crime and indicating those areas the Commission believes are important to ensure that confiscation policy is implemented and operated in the most effective way. In addition, the Commission representative outlined possible options as to how the legal framework for the EU confiscation regime could develop in the future such as the possibility of requiring an offender to show the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime, including by reversing the onus and/or lightening the standard of proof. These issues will be addressed in a forthcoming Commission Communication on “Developing a strategic concept on tackling organised crime” which should be adopted by the Commission in June.</p>
<p>As regards the honourable Member’s question whether the Commission will take account of any proposals resulting from the above-mentioned conference, a Steering Group has been established to evaluate the workshop discussions and will meet to produce its conclusions in mid June. As the Commission made clear at the conference, it would strongly welcome the expert input of practitioners to the EU policy development process in the area of criminal asset confiscation. The Commission therefore looks forward to receiving the Steering Group conclusions and to the prospect of future conferences on criminal asset forfeiture that will build on and develop any conclusions resulting from the April 2005 conference.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0396"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the existence of “ghost fishing” off the western coasts of Ireland and Scotland, and is currently looking into the feasibility of retrieving lost or abandoned gillnets in these and other areas.</p>
<p>However, ghost fishing is only part of the problem. In the fisheries referred to by the honourable Member, relatively few vessels are fishing with more nets than they can manage, which means that soak times are sometimes excessive and a large part of the catch is consequently unfit for consumption by the time it is retrieved.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned about the impact of these deep-water fixed gillnet fisheries on the marine environment and considers that they need to be properly regulated. This is with reference to the damage done by certain vessels referred to by the honourable Member. This practice is in actual fact not illegal so far.</p>
<p>In the longer term there are a number of possible measures that might be considered, such as limitations on the number or total length of nets that any one vessel is allowed to work, limitation on maximum soak times, and an obligation to mark each net with the identity of the owner and the time of deployment. However the Commission also recognises that introducing such measures would take some time, and that they may be difficult to enforce because of the distance from the shore at which the fisheries operate.</p>
<p>Given the urgency with which action is needed, the Commission is currently consulting with the Member States with a view to introducing emergency measures under Article 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 that would constrain these fisheries until they can be properly regulated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0399"></a>

For any deviation from the original use of such projects the EIB needs to be informed and, when necessary, agree. On that basis, to the extent that schemes financed by EIB are directly affected by the new bill, which also covers installations not financed by the Bank, the State must accordingly inform the Bank, seeking the necessary consent if required.

<p>On 12 May 2005 the European Court of Human Rights delivered its judgment on the conditions of arrest and forced transfer of former PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan, the conduct of his trial and ill-treatment inflicted on him (application 46221/99 to the ECHR). The Court held that Öcalan had not had a fair and impartial trial in Turkey, ruling that various articles of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated and suggesting that Turkey hold a new trial. It also established that there had been serious violations of Öcalan's right of defence, with further substantial violations of the European Convention in this case.</p>
<p>What overall conclusions does the Commission draw from the ruling of 12 May 2005 of the European Court of Human Rights? Does the Commission agree, in particular, that Öcalan must be given a new trial before 3 October 2005, and does it not consider that the holding of this second trial is of essential importance if Turkey is to show that it adheres to the principles underpinning the rule of law?

Chronic fatigue is an 'invisible' illness owing to the difficulties involved in diagnosing it and the meagre resources allocated to research into and treatment of the illness. This scientific vacuum needs to be filled by improving the training of health professionals, developing agreed diagnostic protocols and facilitating access to the health system by sufferers. Effective solutions also need to be found to the problems that the illness causes sufferers at work. Most sufferers are women. In Spain, for example, it is estimated that 90% of all those suffering from the illness (between 3% and 5% of the population) are women.

<p>(EN)Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome have been, for sometime, controversial disorders. There are many experts within and outside the world of medicine who believe that these disorders may not exist and others believing in their reality. This situation has given rise to major differences of opinion concerning the ability of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome patients to work, and to their entitlement to social security benefits. In this context of scientific controversy, it has been difficult for the Commission to promote actions related to monitoring and prevention these diseases.</p>
<p>Nowadays it appears, more and more, as an established and accepted fact that these syndromes are genuine, severe and incapacitating disorders, even if controversy remains, and even if there are always discussions in relation to the most appropriate terminology. The United States CDC case criteria definition for chronic fatigue syndrome now seems accepted as an international standard.</p>
<p>In this favourable context, the Commission Decision adopting the work plan for 2005 for the implementation of the Public Health Programme has stated as a priority the work on information and definition of indicators on neurodegenerative, neurodevelopment and non-psychiatric brain diseases in relation to prevalence, treatments, risk factors, risk reduction strategies, best practices, cost of illness and social support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately no proposals in the area of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome have been submitted to the Commission in 2005. However the possibility of support to networking activities for these diseases will stay as a Commission priority in future Work Plans.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0405"></a>

<p>(EN)The honourable Member is perfectly right in that more than ever before the European Union needs to explain its aims and policies clearly and comprehensibly. That is why the Barroso Commission has made communication one of its strategic priorities. The foremost responsibility of the present Commission is connecting with citizens. But this is not just the Commission’s responsibility – it is the responsibility of all players – the Parliament, the Council, the Member State governments. The Commission will therefore put forward a White Paper on Communication which will address the role of all involved and which will give the other institutions the possibility to define and organise their input.</p>
<p>As for the Commission, it has already started to put its own house in order and professionalize its communication activities: This involves improving research, planning, coordination and evaluation of communication activities and a better use of the excellent communication tools the Commission has at its disposal:</p>
<p>A daily press conference attended by hundreds of journalists</p>
<p>A team of Spokespeople</p>
<p>TV recording and broadcasting facilities</p>
<p>The largest multilingual website in the world</p>
<p>A call centre which can respond to questions in all 20 official languages</p>
<p>The possibility to conduct opinion polls</p>
<p>A wide range of printed publications</p>
<p>Representations in the 25 Member States.</p>
<p>In order to interest Europeans in European politics, the Commission’s new communication approach will be more “demand-driven”, involving a better understanding of target audiences and of those who act as ‘multipliers’, a better use of modern and effective communication tools and techniques and a more professional attitude to all its communication work.</p>
<p>Communication will be integrated into the Commission’s working culture and into policy formulation from its very beginning. This needs to be maintained throughout the whole political process.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of its mandate, the present Commission has put an important stress on communicating Europe. Currently, an important part of the Commission’s efforts lie with the ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. While respecting the fact that the ratification of the Constitution falls primarily under the responsibility of the Member States, the Commission has been an active partner in informing European citizens about its content and its importance for the future of the European Union. In this it has enjoyed the support of the Parliament. The Commission has developed a strategy consisting of ten initiatives which form an integrated concept and which support and enhance each other:</p>
<p>the wide distribution of the text of the Constitution for free,</p>
<p>a Constitution web site,</p>
<p>trainings for national and regional journalists,</p>
<p>roundtable discussions with civil society organised by the Commission’s Representations,</p>
<p>information actions targeted to universities and schools (such as "European Spring Day"),</p>
<p>support for the production of radio and television programmes,</p>
<p>targeting the use of the EUROPE DIRECT call centre,</p>
<p>mobilizing the Commission’s networks of multipliers in various policy areas,</p>
<p>undertaking detailed opinion poll analysis and focus group research,</p>
<p>and, last but not least, supporting the information campaigns in the Member States.</p>
<p>Moreover, as from the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of May 2005 the new generation of EUROPE DIRECT information centres network comprising 393 relays is operational. This network replaces the former one of Info-Points Europe and Carrefours under one single name. At the same time, it is being enlarged within the old Member States and extended to the new ones.</p>
<p>The Commission has kept the Parliament regularly informed on the development of the communication strategy, which has been discussed in the plenary on the occasion of the debates on the Herrero report on the 12<span class="sup">th</span> of May, in the Parliament’s Culture committee on 14<span class="sup">th</span> of March, and at the last Inter-institutional Group on Information on the 8<span class="sup">th</span> of March.</p>
<p>The Commission will invite the Parliament and the Council to comment on its White Paper.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0406"></a>

<p>On 12 May 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2005-0187_EN.html">P6_TA(2005)0187</a>) calling for steps to be taken to alleviate the effects of the unprecedented drought and frosts experienced in Spain this year, which have destroyed millions of fruit trees, olive trees and annual crops of all kinds in large parts of the country. I understand that on the same day, on the heels of Parliament's resolution, the Spanish Government sent a letter to the Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel, requesting that a raft of measures be implemented to tackle the disaster suffered by Spain. However, in its letter the Spanish Government simply asked whether the Solidarity Fund could be harnessed, without making a formal request which, moreover, should have been addressed to the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Danuta Hubner, and not to the Agriculture Commissioner.</p>
<p>Could the Commission indicate whether it intends to place at Spain's disposal a share of the resources available this year under the Solidarity Fund, as called for in the European Parliament resolution, and whether it has now received a formal request from the Spanish Government, addressed to the appropriate services?</p>

<p>The Commission adopted a Decision on 10 May 2005 allowing the use of set-aside land for feeding animals in nine autonomous communities in Spain.</p>

<p>According to Council Regulation (EC) n° 2012/2002, the European Union Solidarity Fund can only be mobilised on request of the affected Member State within ten weeks of the first damage caused by the disaster and under specific criteria which apply to qualify for the aid.

<p>(FR)The Commission thanks the honourable Member for drawing its attention to the rulings of the Portuguese national courts, especially that of the Azores Supreme Court of 20 May 2005, regarding precautionary measures sought by an operator from mainland Portugal against the shipment to the mainland of sugar from the Azores.</p>
<p>The issue of the legality of sugar shipments from the Azores to the mainland was referred to the Court of Justice by the Ponte Delgada Court and was the subject of a preliminary ruling on 15 March 2003 in case C-282/00, ‘Refinarias de Açúcar Reunidas (RAR) versus Sociedade de Indústrias Agrícolas Açoreanas SA (Sinaga)’. As far as the Commission is aware, the Ponte Delgada Court has yet to issue a ruling, following the Court of Justice’s interpretation given two years ago.</p>
<p>Although the Commission is ready to carry out a thorough examination of the rulings to which the honourable Member refers, it considers from the outset that, due to the nature and the objective of the infringement proceedings at the Commission’s disposal as Guardian of the Treaty, these rulings do not constitute a decisive factor in the ongoing infringement proceedings. As current Community law stands – according to the Court of Justice’s interpretation in its aforementioned ruling – the Commission considers that to re-dispatch to the mainland quantities of white sugar derived from the processing of raw sugar in the Azores introduced into the Azores under the specific supply arrangements laid down in the Poséima programme runs counter to the ban contained in regulations (EEC) Nos 1600/92 and 1453/2001, insofar as the re-dispatches cannot be considered traditional shipments to the rest of the Community, for which a derogation has been provided. On the face of it, it would appear, incidentally, that neither the ruling of the Lisbon Court of Appeal, following examination of the shipments to the mainland in the light of the criteria laid down by the Court, nor the ruling of the Supreme Court, is at variance with the principle of the ban on re-dispatching in the case concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0432"></a>

<p>(EN)The legal base for collecting tourism statistics in the European Union is the “Council Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism”.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Directive, the data to be collected shall relate to:</p>
<p>the capacity of collective tourist accommodation establishments;</p>
<p>guest flows in collective accommodation establishments and;</p>
<p>tourism demand.</p>
<p>To measure tourist flows, both monthly and annual data is collected on arrivals of residents and non-residents as well as on nights spent by residents and non-residents.</p>
<p>These statistics allow a comprehensive understanding of tourist flows. On what concerns the better understanding of the situation related to tourist products and services, the Commission has undertaken the Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSA) initiative to facilitate international comparisons of tourism and to evaluate EU tourism’s performance in internationally standardised statistical/macro-economic terms. The Commission will continue to support the Member States for the development of the TSA within the EU-25. Already two rounds of calls for proposals have been arranged, with 14 Member States taking advantage of these grants. A third round is going to be published in the near future and Greece’s participation would be welcomed.</p>
<p>For analysis and study purposes the Commission uses, in addition to the above mentioned directive generated data and other statistical data provided by Eurostat, relevant international data available, for example from the World Tourism Organization.</p>
<p>Actions and work currently carried out in the Member States to implement the Directive can now be considered as fully operational and fairly advanced. Generally, data availability and timeliness have increased considerably since the adoption of the Directive 95/57/EC.</p>
<p>In particular, Greece is slowly catching up with data transmissions but is still about one year behind schedule. Annual data is now available for 2002 and quarterly data for the 2nd quarter of 2003.</p>
<p>According to these latest figures available, resident nights decreased between 2001 and 2002 by around 2.9% (compared to a decrease of 2.3% in the EU as a whole), while non resident nights decreased by 19.8% (mainly due to greatly reduced nights spent by visitors from the UK and Germany) in the same period (compared to a decrease of 2.7% in the EU as a whole).</p>
<p>It is noticeable that arrivals by non-residents to Greece only decreased by 7.1%, which means that the reduction in nights spent by non-residents is due to shorter stays rather than reduced numbers of foreign visitors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0433"></a>

The success of country strategies depends to a large extent on their ability to overcome stigma and discrimination and to ensure that vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, get access to adequate services, such as information, prevention, treatment and care. Information needs to be made available in accessible formats. Prejudice around issues such as the sexuality of people with disabilities has to be addressed.</p>
<p>The new European Community policy framework to confront HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis through external action <a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the recently adopted Programme for Action<a href="#defann_63_2" name="refann_63_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> put more emphasis on promoting human security and protecting human rights as key aspects of the response to the three diseases. Issues surrounding stigma and discrimination will be addressed in dialogue with governments, donors and other stakeholders. The Commission will encourage the participation of vulnerable groups and their representatives in the design, implementation and monitoring of country programmes. Unfortunately, the needs of people with disabilities are not sufficiently addressed in all countries where the Commission supports HIV/AIDS programmes. Through dialogue, and by promoting civil society participation the Commission tries to ensure that the specific issues are addressed and the resources needed are allocated. The Commission does not, however, foresee earmarking resources specifically for this purpose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission states that restrictions on gaming activities must meet certain conditions: in the words of its most recent answer, this means that such restrictions must be consistent and systematic. Does the Commission consider that Denmark meets with these conditions, and can it clarify its answer with a concrete example?</p>
<p>In its same answer, the Commission states that a study has been commissioned to review all the national rules applicable to the differing forms of gambling services and the development of the market in gambling services.

<p>(EN)In response to the honourable Member’s first request for clarification as to whether restrictions on sports betting services in Denmark are justified by imperative requirements in the general interest and suitable for achieving those objectives, the Commission can only refer to its press-release relating to an on-going procedure, dated 30 March 2004 (IP 04/401). This press-release describes the key elements of the letter of formal notice that was sent to Denmark by the Commission. The Danish authorities responded to the Commission’s letter of formal notice and the Commission is currently evaluating that response. It is therefore not possible to provide further information on this issue at this stage.</p>
<p>As regards the second request relating to the study, the Commission wishes to clarify two points:</p>
<p>First, the study will not only focus on sports betting services but on a wide range of different gambling services.</p>
<p>Second, the study will provide the Commission with facts and figures relating to the identified gambling sectors (including national laws and jurisprudence). The Commission is not seeking the advice of the contractor on whether or how it should regulate any gambling sector. The Commission’s intention is not to liberalise this sector but – where cross-border problems have been identified - to seek solutions consistent with the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to point out that the Court has specified that restrictions on gaming activities may be justified by imperative requirements in the general interest, such as consumer protection and the prevention of both fraud and incitement to squander on gaming. It has also ruled that restrictions based on such grounds and on the need to preserve public order must be suitable for achieving those objectives, inasmuch as they must serve to limit betting activities in a consistent and systematic manner. Therefore, although it has not explicitly ruled about the maintenance of a betting monopoly, it has ruled that such a regime as for any other limitations to betting activities must comply with these conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0440"></a>

<p>On 11 May 2005 the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the simplification of the common organisations of the market in fruit and vegetables, in which it expressed firm opposition to the delay in the reform of the sector which had been announced by the EU Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel.</p>
<p>In its report, Parliament takes the view that it is both unreasonable and unacceptable for the Commission proposal to be put back by one or two years, in view of the fact that the market crises (which cannot be overcome by means of the management instruments available) need to be resolved as a matter of urgency. The European Parliament has asked the Commission not to turn a deaf ear to a sector which makes a significant contribution to EU final agricultural production (accounting for 17% of the total) and which is at risk of being marginalised in the negotiations on the new financial perspective.</p>

<p>(EN)The Presidency Conclusions of November 2004 on possible reform of the Fruit and vegetables sector are twofold: firstly, they recognize that the path undertaken with the major 1996 reform should be continued for the fresh sector. Secondly, on the processed sector, the Commission is called on by the Council to carry out the appropriate impact analysis on a possible shift from the current regimes to an approach based on objectives and instruments already used in the 2003 Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform.</p>
<p>For the sake of coherency, the Commission decided to present a global proposal covering both the fresh and processed sectors, because such a solution should allow presenting a better-balanced proposal.</p>
<p>As regard timing, due to the need to take into account the requirements of the impact assessment, the opportunity to launch an external evaluation on the aid schemes for processed products and the need to proceed to extended inter-service consultations, a global proposal can not be adopted before September 2006.</p>
