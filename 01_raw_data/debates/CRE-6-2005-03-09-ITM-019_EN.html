<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alvaro (ALDE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Frattini for attending this debate tonight, which is the first on data protection during this parliamentary term, on the initiative of my own Group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. This is not the first time that Parliament has examined the issue of PNR, but it is almost two years to the day since Parliament first raised this issue. Tonight’s debate is therefore intended to take stock of what has happened since then.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been appointed rapporteur on the initiative by four Member States relating to data retention. That is why some months ago we tabled two oral questions on the issue of PNR and the issue of data retention, with a view to having a public debate on two issues that raise serious concerns from the point of view of fundamental human rights, and to get more information from the Commission on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Frattini, we were pleased to hear during the EP hearings of candidate Commissioners that you attach a great deal of importance to defending fundamental rights, and I know that you are personally committed to defending citizens’ privacy. We appreciate that stance, but also want the Commission to bring forward the proposals on data protection under the third pillar that we have been promised for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament finds itself in quite a conflictual situation vis-à-vis other EU institutions. We have strongly disagreed with the Commission and Council on the PNR issue, challenging their decisions before the Court of Justice, but unfortunately will have to wait a long time before the Court issues its decision. On the data retention issue, I am unconvinced by the four Member States’ initiative, with regard both to the content and the legal basis. I know that the Commission shares these doubts.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, the European Parliament is extremely worried about the compliance of these provisions with international and European human rights norms, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, and the related jurisprudence, as well as with EU law. That is why we are here tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of data retention, we know the Commission has raised the scrutiny reservation on the correctness of the legal basis of the four Member States’ proposal. The Commission believes that a third pillar basis is not correct, and that a first pillar basis would be the right one. We would be keen to view the Commission’s legal responding, since I have the same doubts and have requested Parliament’s legal service to make the same legal check. However, we also have doubts on the necessity and proportionality of European data retention provisions. That is why we would ask the Commission whether it supports the four Member States’ initiative not only in terms of the legal basis but also in terms of the content.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we would like to know whether the Commission will ask the four Member States to withdraw their initiative, a move the Commission has not yet made. We would also like to know if and when the Commission will propose a first pillar instrument. The Commission 2005 working programme schedules for this month the adoption by the Commission of a directive on the retention of data for law enforcement purposes. Will this deadline be respected and what will the content of the proposal be?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we would like an update on the long-overdue third pillar data protection instrument that Commissioner Frattini personally promised would be brought forward. Let me underline that the Article 29 Working Party has already drafted a proposal for harmonised data protection principles for the third pillar. We would be honoured to hear your remarks on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the PNR issue, Parliament has a keen interest and a right to have an update on the current action before the Court of Justice, with Parliament objecting to the signing of the international agreement of 28 May 2004 that makes the transfer of air passenger data to the US possible. First of all, Parliament has consistently requested the development of a push system, most recently in the amendment adopted to the 2005 budget. Can the Commission inform Parliament whether there have been any developments?</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to the protection of the privacy of European air passengers, could the Commission inform Parliament of the volume of passenger data which the authorities have access to and whether there is an effective filtering of sensitive data. Also, are intra-European flights excluded?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has published a communication on a global EU approach on PNR. However, the Commission is evidently not following a coherent approach, since on the one hand it has not finalised the international agreement with Australia, while on the other hand it is ready to negotiate with Canada on standards that are entirely different from those which apply to the US. Will the Commission follow up on the communication and will it start adhering to a truly global EU approach?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, why has Parliament never been informed about the negotiations on PNR at an ICAO level? The current practice is not democratic, transparent or justifiable. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing your answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, it is worth restating that last year, in April 2004, the European Parliament rejected the agreement negotiated between the Council, the Commission and the United States and referred the matter to the Court of Justice. I would also remind you that Article 7 of Directive 95/46 provides an exhaustive list of circumstances in which personal data may be processed. These authorisations must be understood as being laid down by Community law or by the national law of a Member State, and not by the law of a third country.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you not think that, in the absence of an opinion from the Court of Justice, and in view of the European Parliament's negative opinion, the automatic transmission of passenger data to the US authorities violates European citizens' right to protection of their private lives? I would remind you that the US authorities cannot guarantee the level of data protection that we require in Europe and that we also ask of other third countries such as Australia and Canada. In particular, we have no way of knowing who has access to these data.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue should be settled with respect for fundamental rights and in line with the principles defined by the European Parliament. Thus, we need to define what data can be transferred automatically and what data can be transferred on a case-by-case basis. We would like the list of serious crimes for which an additional request can be made, the list of authorities and agencies that can have access to the data and the data protection conditions that must be met to be determined. We would like to know for how long these two types of data will be kept. We know, of course, that data relating to the prevention of serious crime must be exchanged in accordance with the EU-US agreement on mutual legal assistance and extradition. We would like to satisfy ourselves that passengers will be guaranteed the ability to correct data relating to them. Do you think, Commissioner, that the transfer of data complies with the principles of finality and proportionality advocated by the Article 29 working party?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we would like to have assessments and figures and to know the results of this practical experience. Finally, do you not think that it is all the more urgent to deal with the issue of data protection under the third pillar, with a framework decision? An initiative has been proposed by France, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden regarding a draft framework decision on data retention, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is also currently working on it. We would like to know, Commissioner, whether you support this? What, in fact, are your plans with regard to data protection? Do you want to put forward your own proposals? We in the Civil Liberties Committee need to know the legislative basis on which we have to work, and we would be grateful if you could answer all these questions precisely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You may remember Mr Bolkestein’s letter to the American Minister, Tom Ridge, about the transfer of passenger data, in which he even quoted Benjamin Franklin with the well-known phrase: ‘They who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security deserve neither liberty or security’.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we would like to know what exactly happens with our citizens’ data. In previous debates, the transfer of sensitive data, such as the person’s religion or their state of health, proved extremely controversial. Mr Bolkestein promised that ‘pending the installation of filters by airlines, the United States should filter them and then delete them altogether’, which suggests that the United States gets its hands on the data, but is not allowed to read it. Has the Commission meanwhile checked whether the United States actually abides by this rule or do you simply take President Bush’s word for it?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the latest on the development of those filter systems for airline companies? Last year, the Commission considered Parliament’s lawsuit to be generally unnecessary, because they could get the push system off the ground within a few months, six months at the most. What is happening with it now?</p>
<p class="contents">The Americans’ interest in the European public’s personal data cannot be seen in isolation from their efforts to set up a Global Computer Surveillance System. It is their desire to create a profile of as many citizens worldwide as possible on the basis of their travelling behaviour and their credit-card purchases. On 11 March 2004, the Commission response indicated its willingness, under certain conditions, to help develop this CAPPS II system and said that at the present time, the American authorities are not yet carrying out tests with our passenger data. I would ask the Commission whether, a year down the line, this situation has changed, so that they are now testing our passenger data. Have you checked this? What is the latest on the CAPPS II system or perhaps its successor? Is the Commission now involved in the development of this system with the United States? I should like to have precise answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also convinced that he knows that Parliament supports a balanced viewpoint where combating crime comes up against the issue of privacy, as in this case involving data storage.</p>
<p class="contents">All day long, we have discussed the Lisbon Process and how we are to become more competitive. It cannot, then, be the right time to impose upon enterprises, authorities and citizens enormous costs for which we do not even have an impact assessment; in other words, costs for which there is no basis. It seems to me entirely unreasonable and illogical to take decisions before such an assessment has been carried out while, at the same time, discussing competitiveness and Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be unreasonable to make people pay for this surveillance of themselves. I believe that it must always be the party who requests the information who pays. Otherwise, the situation would work in favour of a Big Brother society. Moreover, it has not been demonstrated that this approach is necessary, something that is essential before any decisions can be taken. Should the Commission submit a proposal, it is logical for the Member States to withdraw theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope and believe that Mr Frattini realises that it is a good idea – even necessary – to ensure that the protection of people’s privacy on a third pillar basis is at least as good as the same protection based on the first pillar. I share my fellow MEPs’ viewpoint that it would be interesting to hear how you intend to deal with this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For my part, I shall concentrate, in my comments, on the issue of the storage of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal currently before the Council entails a very clear conflict between personal integrity and respect for privacy, on the one hand, and society’s need for surveillance, on the other. I believe that this draft goes way too far in infringing privacy, for it is based in practice on the concept of surveillance even when no crime is suspected and is actually based on a kind of underlying suspicion of everyone. This is clearly in conflict with the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, particularly Article 8 concerning respect for private and family life, home and correspondence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States signed this Convention from the Council of Europe on the assumption that the EU as an institution would also do so. Are we serious about this if, at the same time, we can adopt legislation that clearly infringes international conventions? This is a key issue concerning our credibility, which the Commission must address.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is the severe criticism made of this proposal by what is known as the Article 29 Group. This comprises some of the foremost experts that we have in the Union when it comes to data protection. It would also be interesting to hear the Commission comment on the Article 29 Group’s criticism in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in times of crisis that the rule of law is put to the test, and it is in times of crisis that the rule of law is needed most of all, in order to protect people, partly from unwarranted surveillance by society itself. Following the terrorist attacks in the USA a few years ago, we saw that, once the line concerned has been crossed, it is that much easier to cross it again. That is why it is important to stand up for the fundamental values of the rule of law. The Commission and the Council must therefore also be prepared to debate this legislation in good time. Far too often we have discussed these issues – on many occasions without getting answers – only to find that it is then too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet there can be no question that prioritising the fight against crime is equally important, particularly in this day and age. It is extremely difficult to weigh up data protection against opportunities to fight crime, and I am genuinely open and ready to discuss this matter. With regard to this draft report, however, I must say that no definite answer has yet been provided to a question that was asked quite clearly several months ago, namely whether there is actually any need for this report. I can therefore fully understand why all the groups within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs believe – as I, indeed, very certainly do – that the scheme that is being pursued is absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a clear answer from the Commission. If these measures are necessary, then we can discuss them. Yet if they are unnecessary, which I currently believe to be the case, then we must do everything in our power to stop them. What worries me is that this process will go on and on, and that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or at some other point in the future, we will be presented with a proposal that we will carry on debating, and that there will no longer be any way to escape the process, even though every Member of this House believes it to be misguided. I would therefore be extremely interested to hear the Commission’s views on this. We have been discussing Lisbon and our desire to see less regulation, but we are well on the way to regulating something that is absurd and that no one wants apart from the four Member States which backed the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, given that all groups in the House are in agreement and have expressed their concerns on this matter, I would expect the Commission to explain to the House whether – and, if so, when – it intends to present a proposal and what the substance of this proposal will be. I do not want to wait around too long before we are told what we will be agreeing to, and who will bear the costs. Mrs Cederschiöld asked a short while ago who would foot the bill – will it be the public, industry, or those who called for these measures, namely the Member States behind the initiative? Additional questions can then be dealt with at a later date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the</span> <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission shares the overall concern that Member States are aiming to address with the envisaged framework decision on data retention, which is to guarantee the capability of law enforcement authorities to access certain data related to electronic communication to underpin their efforts to fight crime, including terrorism and organised crime. From a legal point of view, the initiative of France, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom on data retention currently under discussion was tabled under Title 6 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is of the opinion that the provisions of the draft instrument that deal with the harmonisation of obligations on electronic communication providers to retain data related to the provision of electronic communication services fall under the European Community Treaty, notably in view of the existing provisions of Community law on the subject. As a consequence, the Commission will present an alternative proposal on data retention based on Article 95 of the European Community Treaty by early spring 2005. Personally, I hope that the four Member States in question will withdraw their proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware of the possible cost implications of data retention obligations on the providers of electronic communication services. An impact assessment will be carried out to determine to what extent the creation of obligations to retain data will have economic implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding a third pillar general data protection instrument, the Commission intends to issue the first comprehensive proposal in the second half of 2005; in October or November. To that end, the Commission has started consultations with experts representing the relevant ministries and data protection control authorities of the Member States and the Schengen States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the transfer of passenger data to the United States joint review, a number of questions concerning the transfer of passenger data – the PNR issue – are related to the implementation of undertakings by the US Customs and Border Protection agency. Those undertakings provide for a joint review on their implementation to be conducted by the US authorities and the Commission, the latter assisted by representatives of European law enforcement authorities and data protection supervisors. This joint review will take place in the first half of this year, i.e. during the first year of operation of the agreement and associated undertakings, which entered into force on 28 May 2004. The review aims to provide a clear picture of the way the undertakings function. It is my intention to inform this Parliament of the outcome of this joint review and any important developments in this file.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already mentioned, national data protection authorities will be part of the Commission-led team conducting the joint review. This should allow the Article 29 Working Party to participate to assess fully the implementation of the undertaking. I am pleased to tell you that, in spite of differences of opinion on the US PNR package, there is excellent cooperation on the implementation of this package between the Article 29 Working Party and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards passenger information, as an example of that excellent cooperation between the Article 29 Working Party and the Commission, the Working Party has issued a passenger information notice, which airlines and travel agents use in order to inform airline passengers of the fact that personal data are transferred to the US Customs and Border Protection agency for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards data transfers to third countries, according to information we received from the United States, no passenger data have been transferred so far to third countries. No doubt this issue will be looked into during the joint review exercise that will take place very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards ‘Secure Flight’ and CAPPS II, you will be aware that the US Transportation Security Administration has dropped its controversial computer-assisted passenger pre-screening system – also known as CAPPS II – in favour of a new programme called ‘Secure Flight’. That programme will use passenger data for pre-screening passengers on US domestic flights against a terrorist watch list, with the aim of helping to identify potential terrorists. Unlike CAPPS II, ‘Secure Flight’, for the time being, is limited to US domestic flights, which make it much less problematic than CAPPS II from a new data protection point of view. ‘Secure Flight’ is only in its testing phase. That is why, for the moment, no negotiations are planned. This is an issue to be watched very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the EU’s global plan for PNR policy, the Commission issued a communication in December 2003 on the EU’s global approach on passenger data, advocating a comprehensive and balanced approach. The Commission indicated in the communication that it will pursue its task with other third countries requesting passengers’ data. The Commission has entered into talks with Canada and Australia. Concerning Canada, we will soon seek Parliament’s opinion on a draft Commission document and an accompanying international agreement. Talks with Australia are also well advanced. In both cases the Article 29 Working Party has issued a positive opinion. As you can see, the Commission’s strategy as outlined in the communication of December 2003 is being put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the International Civil Aviation Organization, that organisation established the passenger name record access study group in June 2004, following an initiative by several states within that organisation. They called for the development of a harmonised set of principles under the auspices of the ICAO. Guidelines are currently being prepared. The European Commission and several EU Member States are participating actively in the work of the study group. I will keep you well informed about further developments in that programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like you, I hope that the four Member States will withdraw their initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to PNR, this is an issue that has concerned Parliament for two years. As you know, Mr Frattini, the need for cooperation at Community level and at Transatlantic level is not the issue here. What we are highlighting is the need to maintain a balance between the citizens’ security, freedom and rights and we wish to emphasise our view that data transfer can take place only if the third country in question is able to guarantee adequate levels of protection. It is also absolutely crucial that a legal and secure framework be established on the transfer of PNR. We would advocate a ‘push’ system accompanied by the appropriate filters and would like to see the necessary guarantees with regard to the accuracy, security and supervision of data. Furthermore, the principle of reciprocity must always underpin any exchange of information with the US authorities or those of any other third country.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the comments that you made on the involvement of Article 29 and on your readiness to continue to give Parliament all of the information on this dossier. We sincerely hope that the ongoing negotiations with Canada and Australia set the standard for other countries, in particular the United States of America, to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">There was no reference to the issue of the chip in passports in the information – the response – that you gave. We understand that the United States is planning to insert a non-encrypted chip enabling remote reading and this is a further concern heading into these global talks on transferring data between the Union and the United States of America</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a number of questions regarding the retention of data in telecommunications networks, to which I hope your proposal will be able to provide answers.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question relates to costs, as long-term data retention is a major financial burden, in particular for small telecommunications firms. The proposal put forward by the Council and the four Member States makes no provision for compensation. Who is meant to pay for these measures, and what is their cost-benefit ratio? It is quite clear that longer retention periods will not mean increased security for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Data protection experts, and even law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Criminal Police Office in Germany, have expressed doubt as to whether there is any need for the measures outlined in the Council decision. The <span class="italic">Bundestag </span>has even stated its opposition to the minimum period for retention of traffic data, and it is calling on the Federal Government to withdraw its support for the proposal. How can we expect to achieve greater security if terrorists and those involved in organised crime still have alternatives open to them that are not covered at all in this proposal? What measures will be taken to deal with Internet cafés, flat rate lines, public telephone boxes and calls using telephone providers based abroad, and who will be in a position to monitor and retain all this data? Data protection is another extremely important issue as regards the transfer of data to third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also quite clear that what we need is effective security, and more of it. No one is opposed to fighting international terrorism or organised crime, but we have absolutely no need for unnecessary monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you will provide answers to all these questions in your proposal. It is quite obvious, and we firmly believe it to be true, that although it is good that checks should be carried out, it is even better if people have confidence in them. As it stands, the proposal by the four Member States will not foster confidence among the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first like to say something about the procedure, and then move on to the content. The procedure is extremely vague. We in this House have been asked to assess a proposal which, technically speaking, does not yet exist. Indeed, the Council has tabled a proposal on the retention of traffic data, but this is still being drafted and it is not clear what the proposal will ultimately stipulate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first pillar, a ban on data retention has been agreed upon before and it is abundantly clear that some governments have tabled this proposal only because they cannot get it past their own parliaments. That is how the Council takes advantage of the democratic hole in the European Union, because as you know, this House only has an advisory role in this respect. I heard a moment ago that you are in agreement with us, or at least that is what I inferred from what you said. I should like to spell out once again, though, that the European Union is not designed for whitewashing failed national proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As for content, it is for this House to decide whether or not the final proposal is proportionate. We must assess how proportionate this limitation of communication secrecy is in terms of how much this limitation is needed. How can we assess a proposal’s proportionality if its content is still unclear and proof that it is needed has never been given?</p>
<p class="contents">You said a moment ago that, if the Commission were to table a proposal on this, you would weigh up the economic consequences of such a proposal. That is, in all honesty, a little too fast for my liking. I would first like to see proof for such a proposal. In other words, why is it necessary? It has never been proven that it is. Dutch research has shown the reverse, if anything. The Dutch Government had kept that research secret, but our Government Information (Public Access) Act eventually obliged it to come clean.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to make a general comment on terrorism. As I stand here, I do not feel terribly comfortable, because I have the feeling that I am giving up the fight against terrorism. I think it is an important fight, and also think it is a disgrace that the European Council should put this House in a position where we have to stand on the brakes where proposals intended to fight terrorism are concerned. To do so is to take advantage of our position. I would like to discuss what we should coordinate at European level and I would like to do this in a democratic manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all the Members who have spoken. The first thought is that the Commission is trying to reconcile two great European values, which are the people’s right to security and the people’s right to have their freedoms and fundamental rights safeguarded. I do not think these two fundamental rights are contradictory. We in the Commission will work to show that proposals are possible which give greater security and greater freedom, that is to say greater safeguards for the fundamental right to personal data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned a data protection initiative under the third pillar. The Commission will, of course, base it on Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. I can briefly give Parliament a foretaste of certain principles: the principle by which processed data must be used transparently and only for specified purposes, the principle by which the interested party’s consent is required, the principle by which the legal basis must first be established by law and therefore cannot remain uncertain, and lastly the principle by which monitoring by an independent authority is required.</p>
<p class="contents">These are guidelines that will enable the Commission, by the end of the year, to submit a proposal under the third pillar laying down a new generation of guarantees. More guarantees are needed that will take account of the times and changes in technology.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the initiative by the four Member States in relation to the first pillar, I have stated our intention of formulating an alternative proposal, because I am convinced that the legal basis on which those Member States have proceeded is incorrect. I have therefore also said that I will try to persuade them to withdraw their proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the question on biometric information on travel documents, especially passports, I am sure that rules are needed to encrypt the most sensitive data, such as fingerprints. This principle is contained in the actions and initiatives that the Commission is developing.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of the joint review, I am not in a position to anticipate the results, simply because the joint review has not yet been completed. I myself have not received any report on the outcome of the inquiry, but I confirm that I shall inform Parliament of it as soon as possible – within a few weeks, I expect, and no later than a month and a half from now.</p>
<p class="contents">The last topic is the ‘push’ system. We are working to convince as many non-EU countries as possible to adopt this system, which I am certain is the best. You probably know that, during our talks, Canada agreed to start off with the push system, and I cherish a certain hope that the United States too, given a little persuasion, will come round to believing that it is the best system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
