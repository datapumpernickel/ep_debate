<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Trautmann (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, my report deals with the World Summit on the Information Society, a process initiated by the United Nations. The first phase took place in Geneva in 2003 and concluded with the adoption of a declaration of principles and a plan of action. The second phase, which will take place in Tunis this November, will focus on the implementation of the plan and on two unresolved issues, namely financing the plan of action and governance of the Internet. The European Union has engaged in this process with a coordinated position and considerable authority, because it can speak with one voice. If my fellow Members adopt this resolution, our Parliament will underpin the position of the Union and signal its commitment to the success of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Information and communication technology, ICT, plays an integral part in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals, which are all about the elimination of poverty. The war on poverty focuses on material necessities but it also involves access to online services, whether these be educational, health-related, administrative or commercial. The rise of the Internet and of mobile telephony has created new potential for development, competitiveness and growth. Europe suffers from four dimensions of the digital divide: geographical, social, economic and cultural. This divide is even deeper in the least-developed countries, or LDCs, which have neither an adequate infrastructure nor the means to provide mass access to these forms of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue to emphasise is the contribution of ICT to democracy. It is an essential means of reducing inequality and promoting human dignity as well as of guaranteeing freedom of expression and information, pluralism of opinion and popular involvement in decision-making processes. It is imperative that these human rights be respected in the information society. The concern of the World Summit to ensure that a better regulatory framework, an appropriate system of governance, is created to avert the risks and aberrations that might jeopardise the security and integrity of individuals, organisations and even governments, cannot justify failure to respect these rights. Cultural and linguistic diversity should be one of the driving forces of the progress initiated by the World Summit. Such diversity is easier to achieve in a democratic context, and our Parliament has a duty to point this out to Tunisia, which will be hosting the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the need for a new form of partnership with the countries of the South. These countries require confidence and the prospect of long-term stability before they can act. Cancelling the debt of the poorest countries is a good thing as long as it does not reduce their access to funding. Merely substituting donations for access to lending facilities would be ineffective. The European Union did not want a new fund to be created at the United Nations for the purpose of encouraging cooperative ventures, since it would entail the mobilisation of the existing funds allocated to our own development programmes, to the framework programme for research and development and to the Competitiveness and Innovation programme. In the same vein, I have suggested that unused development appropriations be allocated to the plan of action.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of the Digital Solidarity Fund on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed, but the Fund remains a complementary instrument. The Union should give preference to multipartite initiatives involving national governments, the private sector, local and/or regional authorities and NGOs. People using ICT should be involved as users and players, thereby helping to ensure that ICT-based services promote the quality of life, the development of entrepreneurial activity and the production of content with due respect for local cultures and local know-how. Multipartite ventures are an indicator of confidence and mobilisation. Before our representatives leave for Tunis, incidentally, our Parliament will meet interested parties from civil society in order to establish a durable working relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me say that the key aim is the promotion of fair and sustainable development. This is the essence of our vision of an inclusive information society. It is for this reason that I should like the timetables for the Lisbon and i2010 strategies to be linked to the plan of action and the involvement of the European Union to be considered in terms of shared development and shared responsibility. Our partners, like ourselves, should be assured of a voice in the system of governance and of the preservation of their sovereign decision-making powers. Whether in the field of health care, prevention, environmental risks, waste management or conservation of resources, we are interdependent. European growth is inconceivable without solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this report on the information society, dealing with the UN World Summit in Tunis in November, is a useful and timely initiative. It confirms the interest you have already shown in this summit, both through the participation of several Members of Parliament in the Geneva session in December 2003 and through your regular debates on the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the summit and is also devoting considerable efforts to it in close liaison with the Member States. This is no coincidence, for the vision of the information society adopted by the international community in the UN framework is in line with European thinking, which extends beyond the technological dimension to encompass the impact of the relevant technology on society and social welfare. I should therefore like to emphasise our concordance of views with the analysis presented by Mrs Trautmann and to tell you how much the Commission appreciates the work that has been done on its behalf. Indeed, the report clearly identifies the main issues of the summit, namely the development dimension and the importance of the social component of the digital divide, the role of technology in improving essential public services, in increasing popular participation in decision-making processes and, ultimately, in developing participatory democracy. The same applies to the subjects on the agenda, such as governance of the Internet, financing, partnerships and the follow-up to the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, your report rightly stresses the significance of a consistent approach on the part of the Community. It also underlines the importance of participation by civil society and mobilisation of the private sector. For the future, it supports the Commission’s proposals in general and proposes a follow-up focusing on targeted initiatives in the various areas of Community competence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to inform you that, on 2 June of this year, the Commission adopted a communication which lays the foundations of the European position for the summit, a position that the Council should set out in the form of conclusions in Luxembourg this coming Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">What we expect from Tunis may be summed up as follows: confirmation of the Geneva declaration on an inclusive information society respecting human rights, freedom of expression and cultural and linguistic diversity; a summit focused on action and devoting its attention to a limited number of priorities; an agreement on financing which will result in higher priority being attached to information and communication technology within the existing mechanisms and which incorporates the Digital Solidarity Fund created in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">The Internet has become an essential resource for all countries; for this reason, we should be committed to a more international form of governance of the Internet, the practicalities of which must be compatible with the responsibility of governments to their citizens. A new model of cooperation is needed in order to translate into practice the provisions of the declaration of principles adopted at the Geneva summit relating to the crucial role of all parties involved in this governance. As far as the follow-up to the summit is concerned, our wish is for a simple, effective, decentralised solution that makes use of existing organisations and their coordination mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to say to the rapporteur and her collaborators that I share their concern about the human-rights situation in Tunisia. The situation is far from satisfactory in many areas, particularly as regards freedom of expression and association. For my part, I have taken every available opportunity to express the view that the host country of a summit must be irreproachable in its adherence to the principles approved at preceding summits. I also attach great importance to the full participation of NGOs at the Tunis summit, and I should like to say to Mrs Trautmann that I shall, if at all possible, attend the hearing she is organising to consult the European NGOs prior to the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to congratulate your Assembly on this report and to assure you that the Commission will heed your recommendations and follow them up. Let me also express my conviction that the message you are delivering will strengthen the position of the European Union in the global arena. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With a view to the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, that will take place in Tunisia in November, and also in view of the Millennium Objectives of the United Nations and the Lisbon Strategy, the rapporteur has included all the considerations relating to information and communication technologies and the information society, from an economic point of view and also from technological, social and cultural points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field that concerns me in particular, the cultural field, the report has incorporated the suggestions of this Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education: it states that the information society must be open to everybody and education, training and digital literacy are priority fields in terms of creating an inclusive information society which helps to overcome digital fragmentation and guarantees access to basic technologies under equal conditions, and also helps the citizens to participate in political decision-making, with a view to strengthening democracy, though always moving in the direction laid down in the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">It also indicates that, as well as presenting risks, the information society also offers an opportunity to promote intercultural dialogue and to guarantee freedom of expression and information, cultural diversity and multilingualism.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in this respect, our reflection is complete. It is now time to turn these priorities into real actions, and in order to do so we also need a good budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pointless to carry on working and talking about priorities unless we have a budget to back them up. Genuine political will is expressed through commitments and, as the Commission also indicated in its Communication on ‘i2010 – A European Information Society for growth and employment’, the information society is a key factor which must also be considered, given its significant impact on economic growth, employment and social cohesion. It is therefore urgent that we organise a debate at European level, together with the governments of the Member States, and consider how we are going to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in a Europe of 25 with a budget of just 1% of Community revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we leave aside exclusively State interests, leave aside the focus on the ‘me’ and think of ‘us’, in Europe, our political will will be called seriously into question, if it has not already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After Geneva, we have now reached a second phase. We therefore greatly appreciate Mrs Trautmann’s own-initiative report and also her way of going about things. Although she managed to organise the dialogue between the groups in a very fruitful and sound manner, she also knows that we have some critical comments to make about the presentation of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The title of the report ‘On the information society’ is very ambitious and broad indeed, but what is it about? It is about Parliament expressing an opinion and making its contribution to the conference of 16 to 18 November 2005. That is why we suggested she should choose less ambitious and more direct wording along the lines of ‘The world summit on the information society, second phase’. This would also be more in keeping with Mrs Reding’s communication. As I said, our group greatly appreciates this discussion and active participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to the Internet, special attention to ICT and education all over the world, on-line government and truly participatory democracy are crucial. High-level ICT is not only central to our Lisbon agenda but also, and specifically, to its implications for the developing countries. A combination of education and development of networks and corresponding services is of major importance for developing countries. We would do well to consider what support the EU can offer in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the instruments that we discussed. The PPE-DE Group advocates a framework of independent regulatory authorities guaranteeing access, freedom of expression and information, cultural diversity and multilingualism. We are therefore opposed to even more rules and regulations, and we support the existing current basis for on-line government. Having also debated the free and public search programmes, we will not be backing the amendments that have been tabled concerning them.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, as we just heard, Mrs Reding unfolded her plans for <span class="italic">e-</span>2010. She places ICT in the context of the development of economic growth and job creation, and this something that we welcome. This is where economic growth and a social model fit together very well. In <span class="italic">e-</span>2010, the emphasis is on a competitive and open internal market, on increasing EU investments, information and communication technology and on promoting a universally accessible information society in order to narrow the gap between the haves and have-nots. This is what ties in with EU policy, for the gap is still enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the PPE-DE Group are very keen that there should be projects at global level to flesh out, and it goes without saying that this means that a financial basis is urgently needed. It can hardly be said that the past weeks have increased confidence in this area. That will be the subject of a follow-up debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an issue of balanced development, but above all of social equality.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, information technology is a fundamental element for constructing a more culturally-rich and more unified society. The information society has to be accessible to all: an element of democracy that takes account of cultural diversities and that promotes the participation of the citizens, who are involved parties and not only consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of public investment is fundamental in order to safeguard the accessible character of information technology, for instance, in ensuring the development of free software and its adoption within public administration. There is, moreover, the issue of governance, which Europe has to address in order to establish a control mechanism at international level. The mandate of the ICANN is about to expire. It is a matter of ensuring the representativeness and the legitimacy of the new organisation managing the Internet, by establishing governance with various players: governments, NGOs, private sector, and civil society, each with its own role and clear obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting the proposal, the fact that knowledge, as an instrument of development and of freedom, is a common asset should be reaffirmed. Worrying signs are, however, emerging from the Council, which are at odds with this. By means of the directive on the patenting of software, the right to free movement of knowledge is attacked, challenging the objective of the information society becoming accessible to all and thus undermining the very foundations of the Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner and rapporteur have done some excellent work. The new information and communication technologies can help promote European democracy, skills and expertise, and competitiveness. The Union’s legislation must, however, ensure that this is actually the case.</p>
<p class="contents">New communications media, such as the mobile television, will open up new opportunities for small producers. Mobile communications are not affected by restrictions such as prime time viewing or viewing times that are too short. In other words, everyone can in principle watch television when they like.</p>
<p class="contents">I would propose that the Commission should set up a programme to support small European producers of these new media; for example, the mobile television. That way we would bring about an increase in much needed, distinctive and versatile software. A multicultural Europe is just the right basis for that, and, consequently, as Europeans, we would find our place in these new communication technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">As legislators, we have a democratic and cultural duty to prevent centralisation of the sector. That is a problem we all have in common. The same giant companies now own not only the television, radio and press institutions but also the mobile communications technologies, and this kind of homogeneity presents us with a major challenge, because diversified communication is absolutely essential for us to develop a knowledge-based economy. The Commission should therefore take a close look at the viability of markets and access to a diverse culture and information in different countries, different media and different content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has every chance of setting an example to the rest of the world in this field, particularly since the information society plays a leading role in the Lisbon Strategy, the main objectives of which are growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task must be to show people that what growth really means is how much they have in the bank at the end of each month. We must also show them that increases in employment, or in other words in the number of people in work, mean that we can spend more on welfare benefits, whether in the case of pensions, students or universities. The digital divide plays a key role in this respect; to take but one example, family businesses in developing countries lack the basics not only in terms of hardware and software, but above all in terms of training.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus of our efforts must be on promoting the role of Internet-based professional training. The Internet is also home to a wealth of cultural and linguistic diversity – another example of which can be seen in this House, with its 20 languages – and so it opens up a wide range of possibilities for achieving what must be our main goal, namely encouraging growth and employment throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Health is another factor that must not be neglected, as it will be a key determinant of future welfare spending. The provision of Internet-based information on health, prevention and awareness of the causes of disease will have a major impact on such spending, and will be most useful in the case of diseases of old age.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that research, development and trade are of absolutely vital importance, as are family businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises. I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that such issues take centre stage in Tunis.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Tunisia Summit must demonstrate the political will of the European Union and the Member States to promote information and communication technologies as a strategic instrument for economic and social development, and also for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s leadership with regard to cooperation with developing countries undoubtedly offers those countries an opportunity to open up to the information society to the benefit of everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Two issues concern me, however. The first is the funding of the action plan. The World Digital Solidarity Fund is clearly insufficient, given its voluntary nature, and we must therefore mobilise more financial resources, whether they be development, structural or other new resources. I am sure that the citizens would support us in this; the last Eurobarometer confirmed this: 71% of Europeans want more emphasis and more resources to be dedicated to the information society. And if we reach an agreement on the new financial perspectives, we in the European Union have the opportunity to take advantage of the priority, already expressed by the next Presidency of the Council, attached to promoting greater establishment and development of information and communication technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the governance of the Internet and in view of the approaching conclusion of the ICANN, a new model must be created that is based on an international organisation and in which political decisions are reserved for governments and technical tasks for the industry and the private sector, undoubtedly with a flexible operation that reconciles decision making with the participation of all the States.</p>
<p class="contents">That model, ladies and gentlemen, must also ensure the participation of civil society, through the creation of a discussion forum to respond to the challenges and problems raised by the development of the Internet; only in that way will our true support for the information society be credible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This negative thing is a phenomenon that can be described using the increasingly familiar expression ‘e-apathy’. The Trautmann report is undoubtedly correct when it asserts that ICT development must serve to strengthen democracy and citizens’ interests, so as to make people participants and not simply consumers in the information society. This really is our only possible goal, but we must see the obstacles too.</p>
<p class="contents">E-apathy is one of these obstacles. In Hungary today, for example, only one in every four adults uses the Internet regularly. Meanwhile, the vast majority of non-users insist that they do not need it, or are simply not interested. This example is not unique. The ratio is similar in the majority of the new Member States. To a significant share of the population the advantages and opportunities provided by the Internet appear ambivalent. In these Member States, development of the services sector and infrastructure could easily become asymmetrical as a result, since a significant portion of society, lacking the appropriate motivation, is passive or dismissive towards the implementation of costly systems. </p>
<p class="contents">All of this of course could also bring about asymmetry in the relationship between the old and new Member States. It is in our common interest to avoid this and strengthen cohesion in this area too. We must therefore do everything we can to reinforce <span class="italic">e</span>-inclusion by ensuring more vigorous, clearer and more intelligible communication than hitherto. And we must also give priority to dispelling engrained negative attitudes and misconceptions surrounding the new medium, alongside emphasising its positive attributes. I am confident that the report has taken a step in this direction and so I support it, and of course I too congratulate Mrs Trautmann and thank her for her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Alongside the fact that they increase productivity and promote inclusion in society, this transition to the age of digital communication is also a cause of exclusion from society, especially if users or citizens are insufficiently aware of the advantages, or are not capable of using our modern acquisitions. It is therefore extremely important that we invest in the development of the information society, and at the same time in education for the use of modern technology even in the earliest stages of school education.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, society should not exclude older people who are still afraid to use modern communication and modern media. Many cases are known where citizens have preferred to retire or become unemployed rather than adapt to using computers. At today’s rapid pace we have trouble keeping up with what is new, and this will be repeated from generation to generation. There exists, therefore, the danger of elite groups emerging, owing to exclusion from the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we perform an increasing number of services by modern means and a declining number on paper, there is the possibility of discrimination emerging owing to a lack of knowledge and experience in this area. For this reason, in addition to development, society must ensure the possibility of education for all strata of the population and for all age groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important is that great attention should be paid to the security of using modern technology and communication, and that trust will grow through development and the possibility of misuse will diminish. Institutions offering these services must advise consumers of the possibility of dangers, while at the same time giving them guarantees against misuse.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must now go one step further. The next challenge awaiting us is the development of an information society, in which technology and communications are used to enforce human rights standards effectively at international, national and regional levels. While building this information society, we must focus not only on the obvious tasks of promoting and constructing basic infrastructure, but also and above all, on education. By this I mean firstly primary education, in order to ensure that no one feels scared of technological progress, and secondly education on media content, which would allow young people to take a critical and creative approach to all forms of media.</p>
<p class="contents">The information society entails free and unrestricted access to technology and information, and this is why I believe that software patents would mean certain death for such a society. Grim dictatorships, motivated by the fear of certain ideas, still find ways of blocking access to information. There is nothing new in this. A law has been adopted in Cuba restricting Internet access to selected businesses and government offices, and banning the sale of computers to the public. Only 6 000 of the 100 000 computers in Cuba are connected to international networks, and even these are kept under close control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belarussian Government is also well aware of the potential role of the Internet in developing civil society and democracy, and it uses every means at its disposal to curb its growing popularity. A new law has been drafted on the mass media. <span class="italic">Inter alia</span>, this law provides for mandatory registration and makes it necessary for Internet-based publishers to obtain what is known as a publishing licence. In reality, the latter will act as a powerful instrument of censorship. A further characteristic feature of the situation in Belarus is the fact that the state is the only Internet provider, as there are no other operators in the country with access to external telecommunications services. The Belarussian Ministry of Communications requires all Internet users to obtain authorisation for their modems at a cost of USD 20, even though the average monthly income per capita is USD 60. There is no escaping the conclusion that this issue must also be a focus of our activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unusually, everything has run very early tonight. I am pleased to be here to support Mrs Trautmann’s report, particularly because I was part of the delegation that went to the first World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003 with her distinguished predecessor, Erkki Liikanen. I was privileged to be there in the great chamber in Geneva when he made a very eloquent speech on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell colleagues from that experience that it is quite clear how respected the European Union has been and continues to be within the whole process of developing the work of the information society. It has given a clear lead to other member states as well. I am sure that Commissioner Reding will want to continue that important tradition, because there is much work to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to underline two points that were emphasised to me during that time in Geneva. The first is the importance of our research programme and spreading that research programme out to the less-developed world. There are many computer scientists struggling with totally inadequate facilities who would really like to be on our research networks and working with our research scientists. I know that part of the next generation of the ‘Geant’ programme, which the Commissioner launched last week, will address that issue. I cannot overstate the importance of that, particularly because we want those computer scientists to develop the tools, products, services and new ideas that will help their communities, whether it is in health, education or other forms of local service provision, particularly over a very widespread area and one where communications are very light.</p>
