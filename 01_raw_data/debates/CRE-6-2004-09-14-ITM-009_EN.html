<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, it is with considerable pleasure that I can inform you and Parliament that the Commission has today adopted a proposal that modifies national regimes of design protection so as to liberalise the secondary market in spare parts for repair purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the opinion of this Parliament in favour of liberalisation, the Commission attempted to harmonise and liberalise the market before, in 1996. Member States, however, were at that time not able to agree with a view shared by the Commission and this Parliament. Instead they requested that the Commission revisit the subject at a later date, which is what we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal, which is of particular importance to the market in automobiles, would remove internal market barriers that have thus far remained. It would allow independent parts manufacturers to compete throughout the EU market for visible, 'must-match' replacement parts, such as bonnets, bumpers, doors, lamps, windscreens and wings. They must match the spare part produced by the manufacturer: in looks they must be identical. Potentially that market is worth billions of euros. Opinions differ as to the amount: the manufacturers themselves estimate EUR 2.5 billion per year, others EUR 10 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Non-visible parts - e.g. engine parts or mechanical parts - are not affected by this proposal, neither are components in new vehicles, i.e. the primary market is not affected. We are talking here about the repair market. Therefore, at most, only 25% of the entire spare-part market will be affected. However, the proposal will give significant benefits to that part of the market. Firstly, it would give consumers better choice and value when they buy spare parts. The Commission estimates that spare parts are 6-10% more expensive in Member States where they are subject to design protection. People are entitled to value for money throughout the life of a vehicle, and this proposal will help them get it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on employment, liberalisation should have a positive net impact on EU jobs, benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. New jobs ought to be created by the growth of the market, in both the production and distribution of spare parts. EU parts manufacturers will be able to produce in the European Union parts for supplying import and export markets. Car makers from Japan or any other third country manufacturing or selling in the European Union would no longer be able to keep EU producers out of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Europe's competitiveness would benefit. The lack of harmonised rules is burdensome for companies. Independent parts manufacturers remain squeezed out of the market for visible replacement parts in many Member States. Under the proposal, car manufacturers would, moreover, retain full and exclusive rights covering the use of designs for the production and sale of new vehicles. That should be sufficient to reward their investment in design and to maintain a strong incentive to innovate.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, a remark on safety. The liberalisation of design protection for replacement car parts has no impact on safety. Design protection covers only the outward appearance of products. The proposal would therefore not affect the safety or quality of spare parts. Safety standards, moreover, are governed by other EU and national laws. They set objective minimum standards for all spare parts. All producers would continue to have to respect these. The Commission, independently of the adoption of the proposal today, will undertake a study to ensure that all safety concerns will be addressed by those directives.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members will be aware, the proposal has been the subject of intense lobbying on the part of car manufacturers, who are about to turn the full focus of their attention on Members of this Parliament. Their campaign has been a classic example of the narrow vested interests of the few, namely a handful of large car manufacturers with huge resources trying to undermine the broader interests of the many, namely car owners, throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to Members of this Parliament to stand firm as the Commission has done. After all, the Commission's proposal strikes the right balance. It protects the advantages of design protection where it matters, which is in the primary market for new cars; but it also makes sure that goods can move freely throughout the European Union and that competition is not distorted by indefensible monopolies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are waiting with great interest to see the Commission's proposal. I was also pleased to have some reassurance from the Commission that it recognises that there are other consumer protection issues, particularly in relation to safety, which need to be looked at. Speaking as draftsman of the opinion of our committee on the pedestrian protection requirements on motor vehicles, on which this House has spent a great deal of time, I have to say that since 1996 things have moved on as regards the important contribution that visible parts make to pedestrian protection. We need assurances that it will not be possible for independent manufacturers to supply parts, such as bonnets or bumpers, that will not meet the pedestrian protection standards demanded by this House. That is a significant issue, considering the overall consumer benefits and harmonisation of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to ask the Commissioner to confirm that he will be sending us a full economic and impact appraisal of this proposal. I was slightly surprised that he thought there would be a growth market in these components. Given that all the targets that we are again looking at in this House suggest that we wish casualties from motor vehicle accidents to decline significantly over the next ten years – by implication that suggests to me that the market in repair parts from accident damage, which is what we are talking about here, is likely to go down, not up – I would like to ask the Commissioner what his justification is for suggesting in this worthwhile proposal that it will be driven by growth markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard it as dealing with an anomaly in the marketplace, but I want to make sure that the anomaly is not achieved at the expense of road safety. I want to make sure that the complexities of this are justified in terms of real economic benefit, both to the European economy and to consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me deal first with the question of safety. In markets where the repair market has been liberalised, as in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy or the Netherlands, there have been no incidences of casualties attributable to the fact that third party providers have supplied some spare parts. The safety record in liberalised markets is as good – or, if you like, as bad – but no different from the safety record in markets where there is protection of the design.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, believe it or not, there are 90 directives, concerned with the safety of pedestrians, which apply to all cars and parts of cars, and therefore also to parts supplied by third party suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that there is a so-called 'extended impact assessment' attached to the proposal, which deals with safety – it runs to 50 pages. I can assure Members of this House, particularly Mr Harbour, that it is a very thorough impact assessment. He and other Members of Parliament that express an interest will receive it, together with the proposal. The extended impact assessment deals with the issue very thoroughly, but in order to still fears and apprehensions which exist, not only here but also at the Commission, I have said that, now that the proposal has been adopted, I shall see to it that a further study is carried out into the safety aspects, so that we all can rest assured that the matter is being looked at. The extended impact assessment is a very thorough job and I have held extensive consultations with stakeholders, particularly with the car industry itself. Members of this House will be able to read the extended impact assessment and form their own opinions. I look forward to a discussion on this proposal in Parliament, even though I personally will not take part, but will be replaced by my successor, Charlie McCreevy from Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that the principle of mutual recognition through the use of standardisation is an extremely efficient and competitive method, and this is of course particularly true for spare parts. In all countries where the CE mark is used or must be used, the consumer is provided with a guarantee that legal requirements have been complied with. However, it then becomes crucial that testing agencies, which check whether the necessary requirements have in fact been complied with, are certified. Voluntary test marks, such as the GS (‘Safety Tested’) mark in Germany, would be a good idea, although the Commission has expressed widely differing opinions on this issue. In such cases a separate market exists where the consumer has an additional test mark, and can therefore see that an authorised testing agency has addressed the issue. The test mark allows the consumer to see that he can buy a very safe product.</p>

As I said earlier, there are 90 directives concerned with the safety of automobiles and these directives are policed, if you like, by the Member States. The same will therefore apply to spare parts produced by a third party. Those motor vehicles and those parts will also be supervised or policed by Member States. So we can rest assured on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and this is something I put in the directive only last night, we realise that consumers need to be adequately informed. Therefore, if the spare parts are not produced by the original car manufacturer but by third parties, the buyer must be informed accordingly. So to that extent the consumer will be advised that what he is buying comes from a different factory, which will enable him to say that he does not want that spare part, he wants the original, even though it may be somewhat more expensive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it would have been preferable to leave this to the incoming Commission, which would perhaps then have placed a slightly different emphasis in terms of content.</p>
<p class="contents">In your explanation of the decision, you mentioned that a new market would be opened up and that this would mean that new jobs could also be created. In another context you spoke of impact assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is this: has there also been an impact assessment of this creation of jobs, or is it not rather the case that existing jobs in the industrial sector will be cut, as liberalisation of such matters will now be forced through for ideological reasons, and that by means of this Directive we are moving jobs out of the European Union and into non-European foreign countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time no agreement could be reached on the issue of spare parts for cars and the matter was put on hold. However, it was agreed that any change in legislation should go in the direction of liberalisation. That is what we have done today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in 2002 my colleague, Mr Monti, convinced the Commission and others of the need to liberalise the distribution of cars, which is called block exemption. This was done, and this proposal is the natural concomitant of his proposal, which was adopted in 2002. Therefore, it was of the essence that this Commission should deal with this issue because, as I have said, it goes with his proposal. I therefore insisted that this Commission should deal with it. Moreover, I think the Member who has just spoken would agree that it would not do for this Commission – even though it is within six weeks of the end of its term of office – to pass on difficult decisions to the next Commission. We are paid to take decisions – even though they may be difficult – and we should do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point refers to employment. At the moment car manufacturers obtain spare parts beyond and outside the European Union. They buy bonnets, headlamps and rear windows in countries like Turkey, Brazil and Korea. In other words, at the moment car manufacturers have exported jobs to those countries. If we open the market for repairs and the secondary market for spare parts, it is more than likely that the jobs created by small and medium-sized enterprises – which, we all agree, are very important for industry in general and in particular for German industry – will more than compensate for the loss of jobs as car manufacturers have been outsourcing their components – their spare parts – to suppliers beyond the confines of the European Union. Although it is difficult to point to hard facts, I am confident that the net result will be positive for employment, since I expect these small- and medium-sized enterprises to become very successful in the secondary market for spare parts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
