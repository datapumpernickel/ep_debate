So far, the international community has made efforts to support the peace forces in those countries. Needless to say, there are also opposing forces, and those claim victims. In addition to the fact that attempts are still being made from different quarters to have the last word, and to threaten Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unit, there are also religious conflicts, of course. Conflicts which are related to the symbols, and anyone who is politically active appreciates the significance of symbols. That is also very much the case in a country which is torn by war. It is therefore of key importance for us to join forces in a resolute manner, with all international, and particularly local, forces which strive for peace on the ground. It is therefore also of key importance for us to be able to offer the guarantee that our presence there is not short-lived, that we persevere in our commitment, and that we can persuade the United States, which, with its new Bush administration, is forming a threat to that lasting stability, to continue its commitment to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the West, or the European Union, became actively involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina because it wanted to promote peaceful relations between the different social, religious and ethnic groups. We did not want to accept that in today's and tomorrow's Europe, conflict and war could be caused by ethnicity or religion.</p>
<p class="contents">Dayton was the result, and led – as we believed – to the founding of a new state. This was and probably remains the only option to bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina at this time. Many of us here in this House are not satisfied with Dayton, but as I said, it was a chance to end the war. What we cannot accept, however, is that we are now retreating from Dayton again. There are some forces which actively support this development and want to create new or restore old ethnic divisions within Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there were the Croat extremists who, having lost Zagreb's support, have attempted to join forces and create their own new Croat (mini-) state in Bosnia. Then there are the Serb extremists, who can undoubtedly count on continued support from Belgrade and perhaps even from President Kostunica on occasion, and who also believe that the time has come to settle old scores and prevent some elements of life in a multi-ethnic community from being restored, like the mosque where these incidents took place when the foundation stone was to be laid.</p>
<p class="contents">This development has undoubtedly been caused by the fact that refugee return and thus the ‘mix’ of the various ethnic groups have not taken place on the scale demanded by the international community, and especially by this House. Moreover, the hindering of refugee return at various levels has undoubtedly also fuelled hopes that the mono-ethnic orientation and focus of the individual entities, especially the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span>, can be preserved. We cannot be deterred now, however. We must call upon everyone in a position of responsibility in this region, and of course in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, to ensure that Dayton at least – which is the very minimum we can or should achieve at this time – and multi-ethnicity are restored on the scale or in the direction which formerly existed.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, it is essential that Croatia also takes measures with regard to its property laws, but also conditions at local level, to encourage refugees to return. Above all, however, it is vital that <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> plays its part. There is the agreement between the Croatian Foreign Minister and the former Prime Minister or President of the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span>. The President is no longer in office, but even during his incumbency, little was done to comply with the provisions of this Treaty or these agreements. This House must call on all sides and groupings in Bosnia finally to fulfil their commitments, and the commitments which were adopted on their behalf by the international community, because we – after all – were the ones who helped them end this dreadful war and the dying.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing an incident concerning a mosque. This mosque was not destroyed in any war. This mosque stood in Banja Luka, where there was no war. It was razed to the ground in 1993, its foundations were torn up, and a car park was built on the site. This mosque was destroyed – like hundreds of other Muslim and Catholic places of worship – on the orders of Karadzic and his henchmen. Not only were these places of worship destroyed; hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Croats were forced to flee their homes at a time when there was no war in this region, namely between 1991 and 1995. As Johannes Swoboda has already pointed out, the Dayton Agreement has now been in place since late 1995. We never liked this Agreement. It ended the war, but it has not yet brought peace to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Six years have now passed, and we have to recognise that Dayton contains few promises and has achieved even less. It has divided the country into two ethnic entities, a mono-ethnic Serb entity, and a Muslim-Croat entity. This situation has proved highly problematical in practice. In essence, we have created an artificial product. Do we really expect Bosnia's inexperienced politicians to cope with this state of affairs today? It is extremely difficult. What's more, we do not always help each entity equally. The numbers of people returning are still too low. Hundreds of thousands of people were expelled, and there are still half a million displaced persons in Bosnia who have not returned home. I think we must appeal to everyone to take action here.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> lags behind the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina with regard to refugee return, and this is obviously one reason for the situation which we witnessed ten days ago in Banja Luka. At the laying of the foundation stone of this ancient mosque, and eight days earlier at the laying of the foundation stone for another mosque in Trebinje, hardliners from the SDS, the Serb nationalists, were yet again able to drum up supporters who interrupted the ceremonies, set fire to buses, and threatened the lives of participants.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> and his government and Prime Minister must make serious efforts to condemn this incident and create an atmosphere which fosters peaceful relations between the communities, which were the norm in this region until 1991. In my view, we should also have no qualms about coupling financial assistance with conditions at last. We made it quite clear to Milorad Dodik, the previous Prime Minister of the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span>, that he could count on our financial support if he encouraged refugee return. We supported his work when he was in office, yet he did not allow any displaced persons to return. There is now a new government in office, and we really must proceed with caution. We are talking about taxpayers' money here, and we must be sure that it is used to achieve the goals set by the international community and the European Union. Refugees wishing to return must be able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The same naturally applies to the neighbouring region of Croatia as well. In Croatia, there is a law preventing the restitution of property to Serb owners who fled from the region. Admittedly, many Serbs no longer want to return, but their property should at least be restored to them, and they should be given support to enable them to return to – or from – Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have addressed a number of other issues in our motion as well. In the Muslim-Croat Federation, hardline Croat separatists are also disrupting peaceful relations between the communities and trying to set up a breakaway mini-state in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They will never be successful. The moderates are stronger, and we must give them our support. However, given that the international community has a certain amount of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we should not use it arbitrarily to amend an electoral law in a way which discriminates against a specific ethnic group. This simply reinforces the hardliners' cause and increases support for them. I realise that this step is now regretted, but it is important to address this issue so that it does not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will do everything possible within the scope of our CARDS programme to ensure that the refugees are able to return to all parts of the region. This is the best contribution we can make to promoting peaceful relations between the communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

That is, of course, not difficult to answer. We need to lend our support to the principles of multi-ethnic tolerance and cooperation, and support those who advocate these principles. We also need to underline the importance of building democracy and the role of democratic, political parties in that region. We also need to call a spade a spade. This is done in this resolution, and the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> is being urged not only to hand over Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic at long last, but also to mount a full enquiry into how the violence has actually been able to take root?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission, and particularly the Member States, to implement the recently concluded Stability Pact in its entirety and swiftly, including the pledged funds, since in that area, it seems as if things are not always running as smoothly as we would have liked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Bosnia-Herzegovina will either be a three-nation state, or it will cease to exist. The country will only survive if – at least in the medium term – all three communities want to live in this state. That sounds simplistic, but it is a fact which we very often ignore. I therefore believe that the time has come not only to take action against the hardliners of all nationalities, but also to ask ourselves self-critically for once what we have done wrong. In my view, Doris Pack pointed the right way forward here. Dayton was a step towards the absence of war. Now it is time to start moving towards genuine peace. Moving towards peace ultimately means creating a tripartite federation in which all three communities enjoy equal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Believe me, I do not want to justify the actions of the Croat extremists in Mostar, but one reason why they are popular, of course, is that they do not see why the Croats, as an ethnic group, do not enjoy the same rights as the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span>, for example. This is an enormous problem which we must address, for in this respect, there is no equality or symmetry within the Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which we must be clear about – as Doris Pack has already mentioned – is refugee return. In this area too, there must be no double standards, and the same applies to the issue of cooperation with the Tribunal in The Hague. There is a considerable lack of symmetry as regards the extradition of indicted persons to The Hague. In the long term, the people in this region will only be prepared to cooperate with the Tribunal if they are confident that the perpetrators from all three communities will be extradited and convicted on an even-handed basis. This means that we cannot always point the finger at others; we must be self-critical for once and admit that for a whole range of reasons, we very often apply double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Swoboda for openly addressing an issue which we must all be clear about: that unfortunately, President Kostunica also appears to be encouraging certain forces in the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> to pursue nationalist policies. I believe that we must make it quite clear to Belgrade that there are conditions attached to the assistance we provide, and that this type of support for the nationalists in the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> is unacceptable. There must be conditionality across the board: not only in our assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina but also to Serbia or Yugoslavia. We made this quite clear in the case of Croatia. As for Yugoslavia, our euphoria about the ousting of Milosevic – which we naturally welcome – threatens to make us lose our perspective to some extent. Unfortunately, that distorts our view of what is important in the region.</p>

My colleague Chris Patten, who is responsible for this area of work, is visiting Bosnia this afternoon. He has issued a statement condemning the violence and demanding that the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> authorities find those responsible and make sure they face justice.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Croats' 'self-rule' within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission fully supports the High Representative's decision to remove Mr Jelavic from his position as a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and his appeal to the Bosnian Croats to support the development of a stable multi-ethnic state.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one thing quite clear: the recent incidents do not further the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into European structures in any way; nor do they enhance the country's international reputation, especially among donors. On the contrary, the incidents make it even more difficult to attract the funds which Bosnia so urgently needs, and on which it continues to depend.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will not withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina. We will continue our efforts to promote the reconstruction of the country and support the many citizens who yearn to live a life in peace. However, the country's internal problems cannot be resolved merely by concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement or offering the prospect of closer relations with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, a key prerequisite for the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the European Union is that the country itself undergoes a profound transformation at domestic level and that in doing so, it respects the fundamental values, such as human and minority rights, on which the European Union is founded. This transformation process is indispensable if integration into the EU is to bring additional benefits in terms of stability, security and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union's view, the progress achieved by Bosnia and Herzegovina in the stabilisation and association process are the test of the country's willingness to complete this transformation. Above all, we expect progress in implementing the specific measures agreed a year ago as part of the 'Road Map', which include refugee return.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the 18 measures in total, just 5 have been fully implemented so far. A further 9 have been partially implemented, while 4 have still not been addressed at all. Yet the next phase of the process, that is, the feasibility study, cannot begin until all the measures have been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the CARDS programme, the Commission will continue to focus its assistance on target groups which promote refugee return and the reconciliation process. Out of a total of EUR 105.3 million in funding for Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2001, EUR 37.3 million – by far the largest individual amount – will be used to support refugee return. Of this figure, around 16 million are earmarked for the fostering of integration, reconciliation and institution-building, which includes strengthening the constitutional court and three human rights bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the calls voiced here by the honourable Members, the assistance provided within the CARDS framework is linked to conditions. As there have been more obstacles to refugee return in the <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> than in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, <span class="italic">Republika Srpska</span> has received less funding in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">When deciding on the restructuring or cancellation of assistance, it must be borne in mind that the CARDS programme provides support for major structural projects – such as refugee return, human rights, judicial reform, and the development of an independent media – which are a priority for the EU. Abandoning these projects would merely give fresh impetus to the extremists in Bosnia, who are also hostile to projects of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to CARDS, the Commission's reciprocal macrofinancial assistance is not linked to specific conditions. The assistance is provided as part of a coherent macroeconomic package which was agreed by the authorities in the region and is supported by the international financial institutions. Due to the specific conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, the Commission tries to ensure that the overall political environment, that is, the political reality on the ground, is as favourable as possible and that the macroeconomic assistance ties in with other measures taken by the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
