<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zimmerling (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is considering at second reading the harmonisation of artists' right of resale, thus taking up again a directive for the benefit of artists as also galleries and auction houses in Europe that has been under discussion since 1996. First I want to thank those colleagues who have assisted with this project. It was very difficult to resolve the problems in a way that was useful for those concerned. In the end we did manage to do so thanks to the goodwill of all the groups in this House, as shown in particular by the decision in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">I owe special thanks to Mr Dehousse and Mr Echerer, whose many discussions helped bring about workable compromises. Right of resale is the unassignable and inalienable right of creative artists to receive a share of the profits made from the selling on of their works. As such it forms part of societal copyright protection and is the expression of the societal acknowledgement of artistic creativity. It needs to be harmonised because although it already applies in many EU states, it has not so far been recognised in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland or Austria. That leads to considerable distortions of competition because it means that in one country an artist profits from the resale, whereas in another he gets nothing. That is not acceptable in the European market and is contrary to the requirements of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes the following specific amendments to the Council's common position. Right of resale should extend to the professional trade in works of art. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposes graduating the amount of royalties to be paid by the seller on the basis of a percentage rate of 4% for the portion of the sale price up to EUR 50 000 and 1% for the portion above EUR 200 000. Moreover, the artist is assigned a right of information so that he can make his claims to royalties known to a professional art dealer during a period of up to three years, which is reasonable since the dealer has to keep the accounts of his purchases and sales. So here we must not allow a collective management firm to be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The new minimum sale price of EUR 1 000 repeats a proposal the European Parliament made at first reading. Most transactions in Europe take place up to the threshold sale price of EUR 4 000 provided for in the Council's common position, so that this area needs to be harmonised now. For amounts below EUR 1 000, however, there is no need for harmonisation since this does not affect the European market and on the basis of subsidiarity no European right of resale should apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have deleted the Council's proposed ceiling of EUR 12 500 as the highest amount of royalties an artist may receive, since there is no reason why successful artists should be penalised. In regard to the time limits for implementing this directive, on my proposal the committee decided to set a deadline of two years for each Member State to transpose it into its national law and during which the rights of the successor in title must be enforced in countries that have not hitherto recognised the right of resale.</p>
<p class="contents">The time limits of five and ten years wanted by the Council and in particular by the United Kingdom are unacceptable because in effect this would simply enshrine the status quo and would only benefit the art market in the United Kingdom. The reservations voiced in several quarters can be summarised in two major groups. On the one side, UK lobbyists fear job losses. However, I do not see any risk of art markets relocating to Switzerland or the USA, since the insurance and transport costs exceed the costs involved in the right of resale and make it unprofitable to relocate.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is in the interests of both Switzerland and the USA to introduce a right of resale once we have adopted a harmonised right of resale in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem concerns Austria, where groups of artists have formed who fear the directive will have adverse effects and therefore oppose it. This is based on the quite mistaken assumption that it is compulsory to involve collective management firms, as has hitherto been the case in Austria. But that is precisely what the directive does not provide. Accordingly, this matter should be put before the Austrian legislator instead of attacking the European legislator who is only creating positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope our UK colleagues will not show the same national tendency to block progress that we saw in Nice but that this Parliament will adopt a forward-looking European directive on the art market.</p>

However, it is in force only in eight countries, and this is with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of resale is not recognised in the legislation of Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Outside the European Union, neither Switzerland nor the United States recognise the right of resale.</p>
<p class="contents">At first sight, establishing a legislative text concerning the right of resale would seem to be justified by a desire for equity and in order to benefit creative artists. In fact, the resale right does not benefit artists, quite the contrary: it hinders the market which should be dynamic and be able to grow with a minimum of restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer dynamics and sales potential are matters of concern to living artists who discern an increase in their market value and reassessment of their work. The resale right gives rise to complicated court cases, which are truly costly compared with the often modest sums involved, which generally do not reach the beneficiary. It entails additional administrative tasks, which serve to fuel criticism of European standards. It penalises the efforts of galleries who should be focussing on helping artists. It gives rise to fear, creates extra costs and administrative hassles for well-meaning potential buyers. And on occasion, it can lead to absurd situations: given that the right of resale is calculated on the basis of the resale price, in the event of depreciation transferring a work of art is more lucrative than actually creating one.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it therefore necessary to extend this legislative text to the countries who do not want it – I am referring here to the United Kingdom which is currently at the top of the European art market – if to do so would be to threaten their competitiveness? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement reached by the Council is no longer an accurate reflection of the Commission’s initial proposal, which was widely supported by Parliament at its first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group, as well as the greater part of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was astonished at the attitude of the Council of Ministers, whose position is unacceptable in several respects. The suggestion that transposition periods for Member States should be increased to 15 years is the least acceptable element, given that the Commission’s original proposal was four years ago. As a matter of principal, a 15-year time limit is unacceptable in such a rapidly changing world as our own. The industry will change beyond recognition in that time, mainly due to technological progress. In addition, setting this type of precedent at a time when the European Union is set to double in size would be to give out the wrong signal to candidate states. It would be better to give up the idea of a directive rather than establish such a time limit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group did not therefore want Parliament to discredit itself by accepting proposals which make a mockery of the votes cast at the first reading. So we are delighted, firstly, that Mr Zimmerling, the rapporteur, understands and shares our feelings on the issue of the time limit as well as many other problems, which he detailed this evening. We are moreover delighted that almost all the democratic groups share the same constructive point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the debate and the upcoming vote will be decided between those wishing to forge ahead with European integration and those who are prepared to let themselves be side-tracked by national interests (of dubious legitimacy) rather than the interests of European creative artists. It is furthermore essential that we find a common position on the matter in hand, since this is the only way that the European Union will be able to carry any weight internationally and to defend the interests of creative artists worldwide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my country, which does not have the right of resale, the artists are opposed to this directive. Understandably so, when you look at Austrian tradition in its home market, an internationally recognised market. I will have a hard job persuading the people in my country, but I am firmly convinced that the harmonisation of the right of resale, on the basis of the EP's proposals, will bring benefits to all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope for the Commission's support, at least on one of the three major points of dispute. And I am also thinking a step ahead. In the very near future we will have to make more effort to seek a dialogue with the collective management firms, we must jointly seek simpler and more transparent structures and ensure that the administrative costs of this directive do not become absurd. Collective management firms are not just a kind of collection agency, they are very important partners for the artists of Europe when it comes to their rights. The opinions expressed on the right of resale reflect the views not of the political groups but of the Member States. I have understanding for the different cultural traditions, but at the same time I beg this House to show the same European spirit that prevailed this morning. It is not just a question of individual national artists, national gallery owners and national auction houses.

The right of resale remains as controversial as ever. In the end, the issue is the competitiveness of the European art market, which is already finding it hard to fight off foreign competition. In my own country, the artists themselves say that they feel they are being forced into this against their will and point to Germany, where fewer than 1% of the 42 000 artists have gained from the right of resale.</p>
<p class="contents">The galleries, which play a crucial part in promoting young artists, are anxious and also oppose the right of resale, since it has to be applied even if a work of art is sold at a loss. The auction houses are concerned because the maximum amount of EUR 12 500 is no longer to apply. I think it is important to voice the concerns of the auction houses, the artists, the galleries, the art world of a country and a platform of artists in this debate and to take them into consideration. That has nothing to do with special national interests but contributes to an open and transparent political debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope you are going to take as robust a position on Mr Zimmerling's amendments as you did on the Lehne report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an issue about the vitality and competitiveness of the European art market. If it was centred on Berlin I am sure that Mr Zimmerling would argue quite differently on transposition times and thresholds. Without an international <span class="italic">droit de suite,</span> the fact is that the European art market will go offshore. There is evidence to prove that. I too, like Mrs Echerer, must listen to artists. They are divided. There is <span class="italic">K�nstler gegen Folgerecht</span>. They are divided. It is arrogant of Mr Zimmerling to dismiss the views of people for whom we claim to legislate in this Parliament. We legislate in their interests. We should listen to their views as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also see that the <span class="italic">Folgerecht</span> does not actually advantage many artists. In Germany, for example, in 1998, of 7 000 artists who transferred their rights, only 274 actually got any money from it and 40% of the <span class="italic">droit de suite</span> was taken up in costs in levying the sum. So there are some problems with how it currently operates.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to use this opportunity to register my dismay that the Commission has failed to provide any analysis or evaluation of the economic impact of <span class="italic">droit de suite</span>. It is far too important a piece of legislation for it not to have done this work. I still fail to understand how the Commission reached the arbitrary threshold of EUR 1 000 with no scientific evidence to back that up. Therefore I must plead for a long transition period to open serious negotiations on an international <span class="italic">droit de suite</span>, without which we will lose the European art market, wherever it is located, whether it be Paris, Berlin or London. I do not believe artists will gain from that either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They had raised their fears about these proposals and I went back there recently and we looked at some case studies together. We took paintings from a recent auction that would have been affected by this proposal. With one item there would have been considerable difficulty in tracing the artist's family; only tracing agents and collecting societies would have benefited. In another case, the item would undoubtedly have been sold elsewhere, i.e. in America. The one artist we were able to contact who would have benefited was not interested and said it would all be too complex to help him or his family.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid this leads me to the inevitable conclusion that we do not need this, and that without international agreement in place, it is one piece of internal market legislation that we can do without. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because, as has already been pointed out, many artists have recently testified it does not in fact help them. Furthermore, as experience in France shows, the main beneficiaries are the heirs of dead, rich painters, not poor, living ones. At any event, why as a matter of principle should it be right to impose a levy on the sale of a second-hand picture and not to do the same to the maker of a second-hand car or the tailor of a second-hand suit?</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unnecessary in the single European art market, which for years has worked quite satisfactorily without it, as has already been pointed out this evening. In short, there is no need for harmonisation of this sort in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we in the United Kingdom have, with misgivings and in a spirit of compromise, accepted a formula which includes its eventual introduction in the UK. It is complicated and takes years to come into effect. Cynics might say: a bit like the Treaty of Nice. But London, the centre of the art market in Europe, will disproportionately suffer if much of the trade goes off-shore to Geneva or the United States, unilaterally exporting British jobs with it, unless an international regime is put into place to eliminate global market distortion.</p>
<p class="contents">If the substance of the compromise is not honoured, we would rather this unnecessary directive did not reach the statute book. If it did so, it would be a great injustice, especially to those whose livelihoods depend upon the art market and, in particular, the art market in London.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure the House that, if my party leader William Hague wins the general election, he will match the present Prime Minister's commitment to oppose this proposal in the essential interests of our country. It goes beyond what was agreed in the common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the majority of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and congratulates Mr Zimmerling, the rapporteur, on this dedication to achieving agreement and the way in which he has been able to gain consensus on the most important questions, particularly that of the time limit, which is, in Amendments Nos 11 and 15, brought down to four years in total, made up of a two-year transitional period and two-year transposition period. This seems to be a reasonable period to enable the profession to adapt to the change and for national authorities to introduce the necessary changes in regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important issue is that of the total amount, which is removed in Amendment No 7. However, this amendment can be only partially approved. The Commission believes that to divide royalties into five portions, as set out in the common position, remains more effective than the proposed method, since it avoids possible loss of sales, especially in the highest portion of the sale price. The third and final issue is that of the threshold, which Amendment No 6 brings back down to EUR 1 000 or, in other words, to the Commission’s original proposal. I repeat, this amendment can be only partially approved since the Commission is not in a position to agree with you and make the threshold compulsory. The Commission believes that, on a national level, the abolition of the right to resale below this threshold cannot be justified due to the internal market. In some Member States, this may put artists at a disadvantage, in contrast to the situation prior to harmonisation. Amendment No 4 and the part of Amendment No 7 which relates to this issue should also be rejected for the same reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, the Commission is able to approve Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 and is able to approve Amendment Nos 6 and 7 only in part for the reasons mentioned previously. The Commission is able to approve Amendment No 9 as a recital and not as an article. However, the Commission is unable to approve Amendment No 4, which relates to the compulsory aspect of the threshold, or Amendment No 8, since the distinction made between heirs who are able to benefit from the right of resale is not the same as the concept of ownership of this right and arises solely from national law. A similar amendment was rejected at first reading. Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10 for the reason that to draw up and maintain a list of third countries where the right of resale is in force would create practical problems and would not enhance legal security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
