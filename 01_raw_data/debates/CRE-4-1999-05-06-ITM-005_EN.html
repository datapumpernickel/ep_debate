<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Newens </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Although there were high hopes in the aftermath of the resignation of President Suharto that the way would at last be open to a peaceful resolution of the problems of East Timor, after a quarter of a century of bloodshed in which a third of the population has died as a consequence of the Indonesian invasion of 1975, those hopes have not been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Anti‐independence militias armed by the Indonesian military have created havoc and killed large numbers of people in a desperate bid to frustrate the demand for self rule. Far from being a safeguard against violence, the presence of the Indonesian army has continued to be a cause of the problem. If the result of the referendum on autonomy for East Timor, planned for 8 August with United Nations backing is to be accepted, the ballot must be held in fair and free conditions which Indonesian forces cannot be relied upon to guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, violence seems to be rising throughout the region and reports of yet another massacre this week by the Indonesian army confirm once again its reputation for ruthless violence. An independent United Nations backed force is required to ensure that voting in the East Timor referendum takes place in conditions free from violence and intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">Political prisoners still have not been released, Mr Xanana Gusmão, one the leaders of the independence movement still under house arrest, should be granted full and unconditional freedom. The right of the people of East Timor to reject autonomy and demand full independence must be fully ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament we have over the years consistently denounced the oppression imposed on the people of East Timor and their suffering at the hands of the Indonesian regime.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this Parliament it is important that we should reaffirm our support for these people and their rights and I am proud that in my last speech here I shall be doing precisely this.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Girão Pereira </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Parliament can be proud of the role it has played during this parliamentary term and of its important part in finding a solution to the problems of East Timor. This issue has been addressed here many times during this parliamentary term and it has perhaps been one of the international policy and human rights issues most frequently raised in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament has done itself credit and has aided the Timorese cause. And it is strange that it should be right now, during the final days of this parliamentary term, that a solution for East Timor seems to be appearing at the end of the tunnel. The agreement concluded between Portugal and Indonesia yesterday in New York, under the auspices of the United Nations, is a ray of hope for a solution of this martyrised people's problems.</p>
<p class="contents">However, although it has for the first time become clear in this agreement – and Indonesia is to be congratulated on this – that Timor's right to self‐determination and independence is recognised, I would like to emphasise, and someone must stress this point because it represents an important change of policy regarding East Timor which I sincerely welcome, that we also need to bear in mind the rather hypocritical behaviour already mentioned here.</p>
<p class="contents">I say hypocritical behaviour because at the same time as this political stance is being adopted, the Indonesian army and the militias and security forces are continuing to arm men who are trying at all costs to prevent self‐determination. If leaders continue to be killed, if the population has to flee to the mountains and is afraid of voting, if the thousands of pro‐Indonesian people who were transferred to Timor last year are to have the right to vote, and if leaders like Xanana Gusmão are still to be kept under arrest, then I believe that it is impossible to hold a free and fair referendum for East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">And that is the great challenge for the international community. In the agreement signed yesterday, Indonesia undertook that the safety of the people and the security of the referendum would be guaranteed by Indonesia itself. I have my doubts. Indonesia's recent behaviour does not give us great cause for hope here. I believe, Commissioner, that the United Nations and the European Union have an important role to play in ensuring that the Timorese problem is resolved justly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ribeiro </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the European Union has unequivocally supported the cause of the Timorese people and their inalienable right to self‐determination and independence, and has from the outset made a significant contribution to ensuring that their struggle did not go unnoticed. We can therefore take some pleasure in the fact that we are concluding this parliamentary term by adopting positions which suggest this may actually happen. It is particularly felicitous that this is taking place at a critical point in the process, with the signing of the agreement reached under the auspices of the United Nations, which embraces the possibility of the Timorese people being able to freely determine their own future.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome this victory for the Timorese people and we are delighted that our modest but insistent and solid contribution, which some people have signed up to only recently – be it opportunely or opportunistically – has been of some assistance. We are leaving this Parliament with a feeling that in this case at least we have done our duty as elected representatives. The cause of the Timorese people demonstrates that it is worthwhile fighting, that it is worthwhile to resist. Nevertheless, our satisfaction is somewhat diminished by our lack of confidence in Indonesia's policy and by the alarm it is causing. We must not lower our guard. And we must not forget that the referendum is not so much a happy ending as one more step – an important one – on the long road which will enable the people of East Timor finally to be masters of their own destiny, after centuries of Portuguese colonisation and a quarter century of brutal occupation by Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">We must carry on demanding that the Indonesian authorities match this diplomatic decision with consistent practical measures. The process of disarming and dissolving the pro‐integration militias must be started immediately, and it is essential that Indonesia should demilitarise the territory so that the referendum can take place freely and democratically, and the referendum should be monitored and given credibility by the United Nations. We should also demand that all members of the Timorese resistance movement under arrest should be freed, in particular Xanana Gusmão, and that their participation in this process should be guaranteed, as should the safe return of those who have been exiled. We must also reiterate our condemnation of those countries which hypocritically hail human rights but do not hesitate to carry on selling arms to a regime guilty of genocide. That is what we have pledged to do within this Parliament and outside it.</p>

I hope that the European Union and the United Nations will lend a helping hand to whatever government is in power in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">East Timor is, of course, in a very special position because of its past, and the situation there is explosive, but the concern that we felt has possibly been slightly alleviated by the New York agreement between Portugal and Indonesia that various people have mentioned. The referendum on 8 August is vitally important, and both the European Union and the UN must do everything in their power to ensure that it is fairly and properly organised. It would appear to be absolutely vital to send in a UN policing force immediately. This would not just bring stability to East Timor, it could also have a positive influence on the entire region, or at least the immediate region of the Sunda islands, of which East Timor forms part.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mendes Bota </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the signing of the agreement between Portugal and Indonesia yesterday in New York under the auspices of the United Nations, an agreement on holding a referendum in East Timor with a view to self‐determination for the Timorese people, is a historic moment that we should welcome. This agreement is the culmination of fifteen years of diplomatic efforts and comes 23 years after the forced annexation of this former Portuguese colony where hundreds of thousands of people have died as victims of the civil war and of the brutal repression of the Indonesian army. Nevertheless, world history is littered with agreements and treaties that were not respected and led to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the obstinate refusal of the Indonesian government, issues relating to security and the achievement of a climate of peace in which the people are free from coercion have not been properly safeguarded. The contingent of 600 UN representatives who are to organise and observe the referendum process consists of unarmed civilians, possibly supplemented by 250 police, also unarmed, without any means of defending anyone – including themselves – in the face of the activity of the pro‐integrationist militias who are spreading terror in Dili and the rest of the territory with impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The natural leader of East Timor, Xanana Gusmão, has not hesitated to denounce as a historical aberration the suggestion that the Indonesian armed forces can be considered an impartial force. All the independent observers are unanimous in accusing the Indonesian army of conniving with the pro‐Indonesian armed militias and of being their main source of inspiration and supplier of arms and munitions. If an impartial military force cannot be guaranteed in Timor, the real choice in the referendum will not be between autonomy and independence, but between integration and staying alive. Furthermore, the intimidatory election campaign has already started: Indonesian flags have recently been flooding into houses in East Timor, and the inhabitants are being forced to wear badges bearing the Indonesian colours and to sign pro‐integrationist declarations. There is not much choice when you have a pistol pointing at your head.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations, the European Union and the international community in general must maintain pressure on Indonesia so as to force it to accept a military presence to guarantee the neutrality of the referendum and to stop this turning into a sham with fairly predictable and bloody consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been my 150th speech in the plenary, and it will also be my last. So, in saying farewell, I would like to wish all those of you who, like myself, will not be continuing to sit in the hemicycle of the European Parliament, every personal, professional and political success in the future. And to all of you who will be continuing, I hope that you will be in the fortunate position next September of celebrating a great victory for the Timorese people, as a result of their freedom of expression in deciding their own future in a referendum which will take place on 8 August.</p>

It is quite correct, as my colleagues have stated here, that resolve on the part of the European Parliament has had its effect on this outcome. However, today, it has to be said, the situation is perhaps more explosive than it has been for a long time, as paramilitary activity has jeopardised the forthcoming referendum. We would all certainly call on the Commission to do all it can to defuse the situation in East Timor, so that the referendum on 8 August can be held in a peaceful atmosphere. For this to happen, the European Union should participate in an international effort to guarantee an international presence in East Timor. Australia has made significant proposals to the UN about this, and pledged to provide funding. Our task now is to consider what this presence would consist of – police forces operating under UN supervision, or perhaps peace‐keeping forces – and I would be very interested to hear the Commissioner"s views on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important issue is that there are soon to be parliamentary elections in Indonesia, and preparations for the East Timor referendum are under way. We also surely need to send observers to monitor these events, not only official observers, but also representatives of voluntary organisations. I would like to hear if the Commission has made any preparations for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that there has been a seamless bond of cooperation among the Members of the European Parliament on the question of East Timor. Hopefully, that will continue during the next term, and let us hope, meanwhile, that East Timor achieves independence.</p>

I hope that the new agreement will be a breakthrough, but at the same time I would join the previous speaker in urging that practical steps should be taken, including by the European Union, to ensure that appropriate pressure really is brought to bear. It is important to send observers, but it is also important for the UN to have a presence operating under appropriate instructions, because this is something else that is lacking and is creating increasing disillusionment.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that after so many years of suffering, law and order can finally be restored, that the right to self‐determination will finally become a reality, and that the forthcoming referendum will give genuine democracy a chance instead of the increasing violence we are currently seeing in so many areas of Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether this will be my last term of office and whether this will be my last speech, but wherever I am, I shall continue to work with all those fighting for the right to self‐determination and human rights, because East Timor is only one of the many countries where war has been impossible to prevent. I hope that East Timor will prove to be an exception and will win its independence.</p>

This is very much the culmination of a long process in which Parliament and the European Union have played their part, and in which the struggle of the people of East Timor has certainly played a key role, but at the same time we must pay tribute here to the importance of the diplomatic triumph achieved by the Portuguese Government yesterday in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement and its implementation should provide us with a basis for achieving the desired results, that is to say enabling the Timorese people to freely exercise their right to self‐determination and independence. This is why it is essential – despite what some Members might say – for us to recognise the importance of the commitment entered into yesterday that the referendum on 8 August should be held under the auspices of the United Nations and its Security Council. And that is also why in addition to the police force already mentioned here it should be possible to secure the presence of a security force.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that this case once again confirms the diplomatic force of an argument which has recently arisen on the international political scene, namely that the international community cannot apply double standards. If the international community demands that human rights should be respected in Kosovo, then it has to be consistent and demand that they should also be respected in other parts of the world. I know that the Portuguese Government has deployed this argument very effectively and that it will continue to do so, just as we should carry on using it to persuade the European Union to use its full political powers and its scope for financial support to ensure that the process in East Timor goes smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the umpteenth time that we have discussed the issue of East Timor in the European Parliament. However, I feel that today our discussion is taking place in a climate of special political importance, because we are not just talking about a mere question of human rights but about a political issue. I would like to thank my colleague from the Socialist Group, Stanley Newens, whose persistence enabled us to get this point included on today"s agenda.</p>

The UN agreement that has been concluded does not talk about security forces, but only a civilian police force.</p>
<p class="contents">The referendum on East Timor on 8 August will be held under a new government, and if people reject autonomy and integration it will bring the prospect of independence closer. Xanana Gusmăo would like to see this, as would everyone else, and he has already said that he is going to need a great deal of help. I wonder who from – perhaps Australia, which is already stripping the territorial waters of minerals.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains to be seen whether this is in the best interests of the Timorese in the long run. If it becomes independent, it seems obvious that it will go back to the situation before 1975, with Portugal resuming responsibility for this island which it abandoned to its fate and offering East Timor the status of an overseas territory like Guadeloupe or Martinique. Timor could then benefit indirectly from EU assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of general points I would like to make. After the collapse of Yugoslavia, the aspirations of the Kurds and the distinct revival of minorities and races, we should not be under any illusion about what East Timor"s independence will mean for the Indonesian archipelago and the Asiatic region. If the new Indonesian Government does not succeed in holding the islands together, there is bound to be instability, with China emerging as the dominant factor in the region and other countries building up their stocks of weapons. In short, an independent Timor sounds all very romantic, and I also think that we need to be fair to the people of Timor, but in geopolitical strategic terms it would cause an imbalance. Do not forget that the largest Allied cemetery from the Second World War is in Indonesia, on Dili, which only goes to show just how strategically important the island is. I too believe that the people must have justice, and above all I think that Parliament must send observers after all the resolutions we have adopted.</p>

Mrs van Bladel did indeed refer to a point in my speech about the kind of force that the United Nations is to send to this territory. It is indeed a police force. But I wish to emphasise that placing the entire referendum process under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council will inevitably make it necessary for the appropriate security forces to intervene if Indonesia does not comply with its duty to disarm the militias and to ensure this process takes place without interference from armed terrorist groups. That is exactly why I see the agreement that has been signed in such a positive light – as I think we all should – and I wanted to explain that to Mrs van Bladel.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission naturally welcomes the fact that in the final round of tripartite negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations in New York, historic progress was made by the Portuguese and Indonesian Governments on resolving the longstanding, delicate and tragic problem of East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission applauds the signing of the agreement in the early hours of this morning, as indeed you all do. This agreement establishes the framework for the territory"s autonomy, the methods and organisation of the referendum and also security provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Commission believes that the decision by President Habibie of Indonesia to approve the presence of United Nations observers is a step forward. These observers will supervise the referendum organised by the Indonesian authorities in East Timor. The Commission trusts that their presence will ensure that the referendum is held in a climate of peace, impartiality, freedom and security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also believes that the establishment of a trust fund for this referendum by the United Nations is a positive step. And, in relation to this, I must report that this very week, and probably tomorrow, the European Union"s financial contribution to this fund will be approved. This will provide a sum of EUR 1 million that will be aimed specifically at studying how the European Union can become involved in the process. You asked whether or not the European Parliament would participate as an observer during the referendum, as it usually does. In principle, this issue will have to be resolved by the Council of Ministers, which will determine how we should participate under the framework of the United Nations and with respect for the terms of the agreement between Indonesia and Portugal. In any event, the European Union"s financial contribution to the trust fund is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, Mr Mendes Bota – as you and other Members highlighted, particularly Mr Newens – we do of course share your concern over the continued presence of armed militias. These militias are obviously interfering in the political process that is to lead to the referendum. As one speaker said, we will have to see how this matter can be resolved, although I would stress that within the agreement itself there are specific provisions on how to ensure and increase security. This is the United Nation"s responsibility and I imagine that, through dialogue, organisation and the actual political implementation of the agreement, it will be possible to determine how to participate with security.</p>
<p class="contents">But how will this happen? One of the commitments in the United Nations agreement is to disarm the militias, as Mr Barros Moura pointed out. Disarming the militias is a promise that must be kept for the sake of security. We are convinced that Indonesia will have to make every possible effort to disarm the militias and, clearly, depending on how these efforts are received internationally, we will then be able to decide if corrective measures need to be taken, if there are sufficient police forces or whether more are needed and if we must send more international missions. At the end of the day, it is difficult at this stage to predict how the agreement signed in New York in the early hours of this morning will develop between now and 8 August.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, as far as the European Union is concerned, I have already told you that provisions have already been made and I can tell you that more are to follow. More specifically, at the request of the Portuguese Government, we have already begun work on the need to step up cooperation with the region, irrespective of the outcome, whilst naturally respecting the will of the people.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I do not mind. There are two decisions. The first relates to the trust fund set up by Kofi Annan to carry out the whole referendum process, on the basis of the agreement between Indonesia and Portugal. The Council of Ministers asked the Commission to draw up an emergency contribution. This emergency contribution has been set at EUR 1 million and will be presented next week so that it can be operational immediately. I would imagine that there will also be donations from other countries: from the Member States, from the United States and from Japan. This trust fund must be used to guarantee security, organise the referendum, prepare the electoral colleges, and allow for international observation. If the United Nations believes that European observers are needed, this will be possible thanks to this trust fund.</p>
<p class="contents">However, over the past two years, a programme for humanitarian aid and emergency rehabilitation was established, based on the Council of Ministers" common position. It was carried out through Caritas, because of the importance of the Catholic Church in East Timor and, in particular, of the Nobel Prize winner, Archbishop Belo. This was a programme used only for humanitarian aid for emergency rehabilitation. Irrespective of the outcome on 8 August, the Commission is already considering a plan that could in theory become a cooperation programme that would enhance our involvement.</p>

It has made a gesture of political far‐sightedness and unilateral generosity towards the peace process, it has avoided a period of upheaval and a negative influence on the elections in Israel and a serious crisis in the peace process, with the danger of military conflict flaring up again.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the European Parliament called for in its resolution of 11 March, in which, while recognising the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to found their own State, it considered it essential for the international guarantors of the Oslo agreements solemnly to reaffirm their commitment to achieving all the objectives of the peace process, thereby giving the Palestinian National Authority the support required to justify an extension of the period of application of the provisional agreement beyond the date of 4 May 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">And this is what the Palestinian National Council has done. It did so because – apart from the request made by this House – there was a commitment made by the European Council in Berlin. Let me quote what we say in the resolution, that Parliament ‘welcomes the statement issued by the Berlin European Council on the peace process, particularly the Palestinians" unconditional right to self‐determination, including the right to create a State, which the European Union is prepared to consider recognising in due course, and the undertakings given by the European Union concerning the future settlement of the conflict."</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that all this is important; I believe that these commitments are binding and we should remember them. We must be faithful to them, and they will require a strong initiative to be taken by the European Union and the United States after the Israeli elections.</p>

By agreeing to this, they have shown that they still believe in the Oslo accords and the Wye Plantation agreement, and they have also shown their desire to prevent the peace process from becoming bogged down. Without it, an escalation in the conflict would have been very likely, but now the Palestinian decision may increase the mutual trust that is needed for a lasting peace. We are also pleased with the statement made by the Berlin European Council, as Mr Colajanni said, and these sorts of clear political signals could give the Union greater influence in the Middle East. Internal divisions in the past have meant that the Union"s political influence has always been too weak. It has always been the biggest provider of funds, but giving money is obviously much easier than agreeing a common political line. It was significant that the agreement of 23 October 1998 showed that constant external pressure is needed to keep the peace process going. Since that interim agreement, there have been too many wrong signals from both sides, most of them from Israel, I have to say, including granting approval for the construction of more houses in Har Homa and Hebron.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to ask the Commission, and in this case Commissioner Marín, what the situation is with the hospital in Gaza that is being built with European funding. During an earlier debate, the Commission told us that a management team had been sent to open the hospital at long last. I was just there, Commissioner, but I saw little evidence of it.</p>

This is something we would find hard to justify to our voters.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Palestinians have allowed common sense to prevail by refraining from declaring an independent state on 4 May. Generally speaking, there has been little violence in the region in recent weeks, and certainly none of the bomb attacks that Hamas was probably responsible for. It would appear that the escalating violence in the Balkans has brought the two sides in the Middle East up short, since everyone knows that this kind of escalation can lead to unpredictable situations. So for the time being, people on both sides are using their common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Palestinian position calls for an immediate and positive continuation of the negotiations with the Israelis after the elections. I also still think that a final positive outcome can only be achieved after agreements have been concluded with Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">I submitted a written question this week calling for an amnesty for 250 people illegally detained on Palestinian territory, but I have heard from your office that my question is not to be answered or published. I only hope that the Palestinian representative in the public gallery has heard my appeal, and that these people will be given access to the judicial process.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent times, we have paid frequent visits to the Palestinian territories under the leadership of Mr Colajanni. Progress has been made, but sadly not enough. A further initiative must be launched immediately after the elections to move everyone forward.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elmalan </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, like my colleagues, I would like to say that, in order to protect the peace process, the Palestinians have demonstrated their good will by agreeing to postpone the date for the declaration of the Palestinian State, which the Oslo Agreement had set for 4 May. Meanwhile, the Israeli Government is continuing to violate its commitments and is increasing its provocation of the Palestinians by deciding to close Orient House in east Jerusalem and openly encouraging settlement, particularly in the West Bank. Was it not the Minister for Foreign Affairs himself, Ariel Sharon, who called on the settlers to take the hills in order to establish <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span> ? His call was heard, as new settlements are constantly being established.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowingly violating the Wye Plantation agreement of October 1998, which forbids any unilateral measures that could complicate negotiations on the final status of the territories, the Israeli Government is pursuing a deliberate strategy of draining the future negotiations of all substance and removing any possibility of the West Bank continuing as a territory, with the aim of preventing a future Palestinian state from being viable.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation. Along with my colleagues, I welcome the fact that the Berlin European Council recognised the Palestinian people"s right of self‐determination and their right to establish a state. However, we need to go further than this and use all the political, economic and commercial means at our disposal to put pressure on Israel and to force the government to respect its commitments so that the two states can finally live in peace.</p>

A European who experienced the Second World War and Hitlerism will always have profound sympathy for the persecuted Jews – the more so in my case, because so many of my friends lost their lives in that catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, I have to say that my political thinking is governed by the principle that there must never be another war in the Middle East; a lasting settlement will never be achieved by force. So we must do everything in our power to bring about reconciliation between the Jews and Arabs. That is by no means impossible, for there are many Arab states, such as Morocco, where there is perfect understanding between Jews and Arabs. I have seen at first hand how the numerous Moroccan Jews in Israel are providing the most reliable bridge between Israel and the Islamic country of Morocco. It therefore makes good sense for us to table this sort of resolution at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a great deal of talk about the fact that the Palestinian State was to be proclaimed on 4 May, and I am pleased that Mr Arafat, who has shown great statesmanship in this situation, declared his willingness to postpone the proclamation. On the other hand, we must not forget that elections are looming in Israel, elections that will be crucially important to the future of the region. There are Israeli statesmen who clearly recognise that Israel cannot live without the friendship of the Arabs, that failure to cultivate that friendship will result sooner or later in the destruction of Israel. There are those such as Shimon Peres or some of his colleagues in the Labour Party who really do follow a clear political line in that respect, and that is why we should now express the hope that the Israeli side will declare unequivocally that it desires peace and that it will now halt the various repressive measures which have been taking place with regrettable regularity since the seizure of power and since the appointment of Mr Netanyahu as Prime Minister will now stop. We hope that the people who come to power in Israel will be totally committed to turning the present situation around and working for reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians, since therein lies the future of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that anyone who knows the Middle East will be aware that successful reconciliation will enable the region to flourish, and the various tensions that exist at the present time will then be no more than a sad memory of past intransigence.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gahrton </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the Palestinians have demonstrated admirable forbearance in not now doing what they have every right in the world to do, namely proclaiming a Palestinian state in accordance with the agreements which have been signed. Fifty years have passed since they were subjected to a similar fate to that afflicting the Kosovo Albanians today. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were driven out of their country, never to be allowed to return. The UN decided in 1947 that they should have their own state alongside the Jewish State of Israel, but they never got it.</p>
<p class="contents">For many decades, the Palestinians lived in the illusion that liberation would come either through intervention by foreign armies, or in the wake of their own sustained military struggle. This was not to be. Not until the Palestinians switched to non‐military methods, to civil disobedience through the <span class="italic">intifada</span> , to patient negotiations with an enemy perceived by them as fascist and racist – not until this happened did they begin to see signs of success. Now there is a peace process under way and, as a result, much of the world is willing to back their justified claims for an independent state.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it behoves us to remember these lessons of the past, and I hope that the liberation of small peoples will in future come about according to the Palestinian method. I trust that this will be the norm, and that the Kosovo method will remain a deplorable exception in the history of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a critic of the EU, but the Palestinian question is one which I think that the Union has handled in a constructive and positive fashion. I note with satisfaction the statement in principle that a future Palestinian state will be granted recognition. I hope that this actually happens once the Palestinians themselves decide to proclaim the State of Palestine.</p>

<p class="contents">However, the reason I asked leave to speak was to thank, on behalf of my group, two men in this Chamber who have campaigned tirelessly for the rights of the Palestinians in that same spirit. The first is Vice‐President Marín, whom we in this House have not always given an easy life – and nor has the Council, for that matter. Nevertheless, he has taken his decisions clearly and has pursued his aims, and for that I should like to express our very, very sincere thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to give our special thanks to Luigi Colajanni, who has done a great deal on behalf of our group for the Palestinians and whom we shall miss, particularly for his commitment to the Palestinian cause.

<p class="contents">I believe that this would have seriously interfered in the electoral process taking place in Israel. I hope that a democratic government like the one country has had until now will emerge as a result of this process so that the negotiations will continue and arrive at a positive outcome for this peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the decision by the Berlin European Council on this matter was very positive and that it will help maintain the European Union"s influence in this area. But elections will also need to be held in Palestine in the very near future. The European Union itself was present at the 1996 elections and soon a period of four years will have elapsed since then. Only once elections have taken place will we be able to genuinely talk about real dialogue between democratic states.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the European Commission also believes that the Palestinian leaders have taken the right decision in the interests of the Palestinian people by postponing the 4 May date for proclaiming a state. Better still, the Commission believes that this positive move was possible in part due to the courage displayed by the European Council in adopting the so‐called Berlin Declaration on the Middle East. Our common foreign and security policy has worked properly in this instance as this declaration was important in guaranteeing the peaceful and constructive continuation of the peace process in spite of the fact that the first transitional period established by the Oslo Agreements had come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission already called for an increased political and economic role for the Union in the Middle East in its communication of January 1998. Nonetheless, it is clear that the tacit extension of the transitional period does not provide a long‐term solution. In this respect, the European Union has expressed its belief that the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state that is democratic, viable and peaceful, created on the basis of the existing agreements and through negotiation would be the best guarantee of security for Israel and the best guarantee of success in the region. The European Union has stated that, in due course, it is prepared to recognise a Palestinian state established in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term – as is also stated in the Berlin declaration – the European Union is still concerned about the stalemate in the peace process and, in this respect, it is vital that after the elections in Israel, the parties urgently turn their attention to fully applying the respective commitments made in the Wye Plantation memorandum. This would allow accelerated negotiations on issues relating to the region"s permanent status to begin at the same time, with a view to concluding these negotiations within the set period of one year.</p>
<p class="contents">Assuming that the parties involved show the political will needed to make progress, the European Union will continue to help them by facilitating the resolution of all outstanding matters. We must take all steps to ensure that the Wye Plantation Agreement does not become another Israeli or Palestinian agreement that is not applied.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, there should be no attempts to introduce new conditions. What is more, we agree with the United States that the Palestinian authorities have fulfilled, and are continuing to fulfil, the majority of their commitments. Consequently, we are keenly awaiting the next stages of withdrawals from the West Bank as well as the release of many prisoners. In addition, we still recommend that Israel should be flexible over fundamental issues such as safety on the roads between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the development, opening and completion of the port of Gaza itself, as these are issues that have been postponed for a long time. In this respect, the Commission is still working closely with Mr Moratinos, the European Union"s special envoy responsible for common dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the revitalisation of the Israeli‐Palestinian aspect of the peace process would also facilitate the long awaited resumption of multilateral negotiations. And although the European Union is aware that this is extremely difficult, it will continue to try to revitalise and initiate cooperation. This means that we would also be very interested to see the Syrian and Lebanese parties becoming involved in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question by Mr Bertens and Mrs van Bladel concerning the hospital, the Gaza hospital is an UNRWA hospital. It is not a European Commission hospital nor is was it built by the European Commission; it is an UNRWA hospital. Nonetheless, in the guerrilla warfare of recent months, all the bad things taking place in the world are being blamed on the European Commission. The hospital was built by the UNRWA and it has received a contribution from the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there are other contributions from the Danish, German, Austrian, Spanish, Swedish and Belgian national budgets. So what happened? There was a twelve‐month delay in opening the hospital. The problem is now resolved, and as I sure you are informed about what you ask of the Commission, you must remember that we decided not to pay any more running costs. The European Commission must do what it can do well. The European Commission is not a hospital agent and it cannot run a large hospital thousands of kilometres away. Consequently, technical assistance has been given to the Palestinian Authority in the form of an international team that is going to work with the Palestinian authorities for two years. The aim of this is to ensure that the Palestinian Authority takes responsibility for managing the hospital. Fortunately, this issue has now been resolved.</p>

Of course I, like many of my colleagues too, I imagine, would respond positively in this case, as in the cases of other people condemned to death in China, Iran and in many other countries as well as the United States. But we feel the time has now come to do something out of the ordinary: we would like to use this famous year 2000 – a year of great symbolic value for all the countries of the world, not just those with a particular tradition, history or religion – to make an exceptional gesture.</p>
<p class="contents">If the year 2000 does have great symbolic value, let us seriously and genuinely use it to send out this universal message: let us have a moratorium on all cases where a death sentence has already been handed down, in other words let us suspend capital punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the request we are making in this resolution, which I think will meet with the approval of all the groups in Parliament. Our group fully supports it in any case. We therefore want to send a clear message to the Cologne Council: the German Presidency should ask for this issue to be put on the agenda for the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly and the Finnish Presidency should be given the task of following this decision through so that, by August, this item is on the United Nations" agenda and can actually be discussed at the next General Assembly. If this decision on a moratorium were actually to be taken at the next United Nations General Assembly, I think we would have sent out a positive message to all the countries of the world and we would also have raised a problem in those countries which refuse to tackle this subject in a decisive way.</p>
<p class="contents">The death penalty is not justice but vengeance! This needs to be realised once and for all in all the countries of the world.</p>

It should be pointed out that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights approved three such resolutions in succession: in 1997, 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Imbeni has just said, the time has come to use the year 2000 to take that qualitative leap and to present a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly for a universal moratorium. There is a majority of 101 countries, out of the total of 190 in the international community, who are in favour of a universal moratorium, and the Treaties that have been adopted and the constitutional changes that have been made by many countries show that it is not simply a theoretical majority.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions are therefore in place for launching an offensive that will undoubtedly not be the final step, but which could be a decisive move towards the definitive abolition of the death penalty in the world. I urge the Council and the Commission to work towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to point out an error – which is of a formal rather than a political nature – in the text of the resolution. I apologise for this and I will table an oral amendment to delete from recital E the words ‘unlike the resolutions already adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, " because this is not strictly correct. If my colleagues have no objection, I will table an oral amendment shortly, when it is put to the vote.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cars </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I see it as a great feat of civilisation that the European continent is now virtually rid of capital punishment. Such an advance would not have been possible without the unequivocal stance adopted by the European Union, and the world should be aware of that. This is a message that Europe can be proud to proclaim.</p>
<p class="contents">There are positive developments outside Europe too, particularly in Latin America. In countries where democracy does not exist, however – in China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq – the death penalty is often applied. Yet we still have one large democracy where ever more people are being executed, ever more people put to death. This is a serious issue in itself, and it brings with it certain consequences. China and the other countries I mentioned can say that ‘as long as America continues to execute its citizens, why should we care what Europe thinks?"</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans shy away from criticising America. We have our good reasons; yet capital punishment must be combated. Let us make our voice heard; let us defend our position more forcefully and powerfully. Not in a spirit of moral superiority – that is not what I mean at all – but because we worry and care as fellow human beings.</p>

We have been making these speeches for 20 years, and our cooperation has been fruitful. It is perhaps slightly gratifying, if I may endorse what my colleagues have said, that we have seen some more progress on this very issue of the death penalty. It may be that we have played some part in ensuring that a third call is now being made in Geneva for a worldwide moratorium on executions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the sincere wish of our group, and of others too, that the Council should sponsor a motion to that effect at the General Assembly of the United Nations. That may be the only way to make those countries that Mr Cars has just mentioned realise that the death penalty is truly the worst means of restoring people's human dignity, for every person should have the opportunity to atone for the wrong that he or she has done. With the death penalty, that opportunity is irretrievably lost – quite apart from the fact that the death penalty is flagrantly abused in some cases.</p>
<p class="contents">If we in the European Parliament have helped to broaden awareness of that, not only through Mr Dupuis reminding us to include the death penalty on every agenda but also simply by highlighting a number of facts time and again in the name of our Parliament, then perhaps we have contributed in some small way to the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, let me say that I fervently wish – and you will see whether this happens – that the next Parliament will continue this discussion, that it will not allow human rights to be squeezed out by economic issues, by the issues relating to enlargement, important though they may be, but that it will regard human rights as a political priority that must be pursued through the policies of the European Union, through its foreign policy and its enlargement policy. Abolition of the death penalty is part of that priority. There are many others, and I sincerely hope that they will all receive due consideration.</p>

No nation in the world should employ capital punishment. We all need to castigate the USA, China and many other countries which so blatantly violate human dignity by persisting in allowing the death penalty to be imposed. Many of the EU Member States have an important role to play here. We have all been pioneers in fighting for the abolition of capital punishment. It would certainly be a step in the right direction if a universal moratorium, heralding an end to this practice, were to be proclaimed</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Council to make provision for this issue to be taken up during the next session of the United Nations General Assembly. Action will be required from both the German and the Finnish Presidencies to ensure that this actually happens, and that we can say goodbye once and for all to capital punishment.</p>

We must be conscious of the great deal of work that remains to be done in order to civilise mankind, given that in 1999 we are still asking for a universal moratorium on capital punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss America, that vast country that claims to be the policeman of the world and the model of democracy, freedom and modernity. On 21 April, a fortnight ago, I became the first Member of the European Parliament to ever enter death row, in order to meet Mumia Abu Jamal, a political prisoner who has been sentenced to death, and on whose behalf Parliament has passed many resolutions. Something of me stayed in that prison in Greene, where 111 prisoners out of 600 were awaiting execution.</p>
<p class="contents">Parts of me stayed in prison. It is not an image, it is a very physical experience. It hurts. I find the idea of his execution unbearable, as I do the execution of thousands who are sentenced to death, some of whom I saw behind Mumia Abu Jamal, wearing their white and blue prison clothes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mumia Abu Jamal talked to me first of all about the tragedy in Denver, which had happened the day before, about Kosovo, and about the culture of death that is consuming American society. So today I would like to put a question to America. Your children are now killing your children. Are you going to educate them by putting them in the electric chair? No. This violence is in fact the response to your state violence, which takes the form of the death penalty, but also the racist justice and class justice which Mumia condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to convince the Council and all of my colleagues to never give up on this issue, allow me to tell you a short anecdote. In the morning, before I arrived at the prison and death row, I gave a press conference. A journalist stood up and said to me that it had just been announced that three names had been given for the death warrants for May. He asked me if I took that as a response to what I was doing at the time in America.</p>
<p class="contents">My first reaction was to shed tears, then I recovered myself, but it was unbearable to think about that. The reason I am telling you this today is to tell you that although the tears may not return, that emotion will stay with me until we have succeeded in obtaining this moratorium, in abandoning the ways of the past, the barbarity, and moving forward on the path of the future and of civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish this last speech, this last cry from the voice of those who have no voice, with the rallying cry of the black people, who are campaigning in large numbers against the death penalty in the United States, along with whites, Indians, Amerindians and Latinos, saying ‘On the move!"</p>

First of all, the Öcalan case has come before the courts. We do not really have the impression that this is a fair, open and transparent trial. We have a feeling of unease, stemming from the fact that the death penalty is once again being made popular and respectable in Turkey, notably through the Öcalan trial. Secondly, we are deeply concerned that an extremely nationalistic party experienced a very strong upsurge in support at the last elections and that its manifesto does not call for conciliation with the Kurdish population, but rather the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the HADEP party did well in the elections, especially in the Kurdish area, and there are now 41 HADEP members in charge of local administrations. We doubt whether these 41 mayors will be allowed to exercise their democratic rights as elected representatives of the people. There are already numerous indications that the government would really prefer to deprive the mayors of that right. We know that many, many dozens and indeed hundreds of people are still locked up in prisons, some of them officials of that selfsame party, without due process, without trial, without conviction. What about them? When will they finally be released? When will they stand trial before a court of law? Why do the authorities hesitate to institute proceedings against these people? There is probably no real evidence against them.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there is Akin Birdal, whom I was able to visit in Ankara a few days after the attempt on his life and whom all, or at least many of us know as a staunch campaigner for human rights. He seems to have recovered enough to be put in prison, and he is to be taken into custody in the next few days. We know, however, that the care and treatment and the therapy he needs if he is really to be restored to full health will scarcely be possible in a Turkish prison. A serious question mark hangs over this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, perhaps the most encouraging feature of the whole situation is that there is a President of the Constitutional Court who said clearly and plainly only a few days ago that many legal provisions in Turkey would have to be amended because they were contrary to human rights, because they were incompatible with the rights that should exist in a democratic state. I hope that this school of thought can gradually gain the upper hand. It is a hard struggle, and I hope, Commissioner, Mr Vice‐President, that you will speak out clearly on behalf of the Commission and the European Union in order to help that school of thought to prevail, because at the moment Turkey is turning away from Europe rather than moving in our direction. If we in this House and in this European Union do something to help the Kurds, we shall actually be doing something for Turkey and helping to bring it closer to the rest of Europe.</p>

We have never tried to put a positive spin on his activities or his aims, and we only hope that the Turkish Government will ensure that his trial is open and fair, although we do not feel exactly optimistic about this. His lawyers have scarcely been given access to him, the national security court hardly seems the most appropriate place to be holding the trial, and no international observers are to be admitted. I hope that the new government in Turkey realises that if it wants to be rid of the Kurdish problem, Öcalan must certainly be given a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is a day – indeed a whole week – of goodbyes, but unfortunately we cannot say goodbye to the problems and issues that we have discussed in the topical and urgent debates. I also hope that we will not be saying goodbye to the debates themselves, because in the ten years I have been in Parliament I have heard it said almost every month that this would be the last time we would be having such a debate. I can tell you that I have done my calculations and I reckon that I have spoken some 428 times in the topical and urgent debates. I do not know whether it has ever achieved anything, but my successors – and your successor and the Commissioner"s successor – should all bear in mind that this is the only channel the European Parliament has to show that we also care about people outside this House and outside Europe, and that we care about other things than just our salaries and pensions.

I have here the press release of the public prosecutor"s office of the Ankara State Security Court, signed by the public prosecutor, Tjerdet Volkan, which rules out the participation in the trial of ‘observers from any institution or organisation whatsoever". It provides for the participation of the general public, insofar as the capacity of the court room allows, with the authorisation of the special office of the Court and then not for all the days of the trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Mr President, Turkey has not been put under any serious pressure – and I do not mean the outrageous bombing that others are suffering – to comply with the standards of a modern European rule of law, for reasons which the Council, so sensitive and so rigorous in other circumstances, has not managed to explain!</p>
<p class="contents">This weakness does not simply concern Mr Öcalan, but the more important issue of the human rights of all Turks and, more especially, the large Kurdish minority in Turkey, whose identity, language, education and political expression is not recognised. The HADEP Party is savagely persecuted, Leyla Zana, the recipient of the European Parliament"s Sakharov Prize for the defence of human rights is in prison, and we do nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Council, as it does in other circumstances, perhaps express its condemnation of this suppression of the political and cultural rights of the Kurds? How does the Council – and, what is more, the Commission – plan to exert its influence to reform and improve the regime that is being enforced against the Kurds?</p>
<p class="contents">The bottom line is that Turkey and its people, of whatever national and linguistic origin, belong to the European horizon, and the ‘humanitarian" and ‘liberal" declarations which most governments in the European Union – also members of NATO – allegedly want to implement within a wider Europe relate to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there anyone in the Council or the Commission who has something convincing to say on these matters, Mr President?</p>

Parliament is right to continue to call for Mr Öcalan to be given a fair trial. But we must not forget that we have pushed this man from one country to another because we ourselves were unable to try him – and there was a warrant out for his arrest – under our own legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, however, if we look at the situation since we concluded the Customs Union with Turkey, it has actually turned its back on us, and the recent elections showed that it is turning inwards and becoming increasingly nationalistic, and with the events nearby in the Balkans there will be little scope for the fundamental aspirations and rights of the Kurds. Or perhaps there will be. Perhaps there is a sensible man in Ankara who thinks the time to negotiate with the Kurds and to forge a new relationship with them is now or never. But this would require an international confidence‐building plan with a fixed timetable, and there is still no mention of that. I hope there is a politician or perhaps a former Commissioner somewhere who could draw up such a plan so that, having left office, he can help to bring the Turks and the Kurds closer together. But it would have to be a plan with a fixed timetable that can restore confidence, because having to receive Kurds every day in your office is no joke, believe me. I am perfectly happy to do it, but it is not helping them.</p>

I come from Germany, and in my country Mr Öcalan would have received a trial. This is about the fact that we rightly expect Turkey to ensure in the next few days or months that the procedure and outcome of this trial are in accordance with the rule of law. That is what Europe legitimately expects of Turkey, a country with a great interest in becoming a member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If Turkey really does want to become a member of the European Union, it must show us how the rule of law applies to the treatment of a defendant in its trials. That is the substance of this motion which we are discussing today and which we shall probably adopt tomorrow. This expectation of ours must not be misinterpreted in Turkey. The Turkish judicial authorities and the other Turkish authorities involved in this trial ultimately have a very important task. If they genuinely want to bring about a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish problem, they must now treat Mr Öcalan properly as a defendant. There can be no talk of his being guilty before the prosecution has proved its case in court. He must be treated fairly at all costs, and his lawyers must not suffer harassment because they are representing him.</p>
<p class="contents">If Turkey maintains it is a European country, a country fit for the European Union, these European values, these Western standards, must be applied there.

No self‐respecting democracy would allow the flagrant infringements of human rights that are occurring there. Malaysia claims to be democratic; yet it arrests and imprisons individuals who seek peacefully to express political or religious views, denying them due legal process. This is no way to behave.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incumbent upon us to take these matters up with the Malaysian authorities and make them understand. The treatment of homosexuals in the country is another issue which needs to be raised. It is disgraceful – and a crime against fundamental human rights – that people can be sentenced to up to 20 years in gaol for having engaged in homosexual relations. Provided two individuals have consented to have such contact, there are no grounds for condemning them. We must continue to argue along these lines in order to ensure that homosexuals are not treated in such a way.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, it is a pity that we did not demonstrate greater understanding of homosexuality by showing the renowned exhibition entitled <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span> in Parliament"s premises.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly they continue to maintain their internal security act which, against any normal conception of human rights, allows those peacefully expressing both religious and political opinions at odds with those of the government to be arrested, denied proper legal representation or even a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, they have a penal code which – as Mr Holm said earlier – condemns homosexual acts between consenting adults with a punishment of whipping and up to 20 years' imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, all the evidence is that the trials of both Anwar Ibrahim and Lim Guan Eng were politically motivated. We know that Anwar Ibrahim was physically abused prior to his trial. He received six years in jail for corruption, following what most outside observers considered to be farcical proceedings which were a travesty of any notion of justice. And yet they continue to pursue him with threats of yet more trials.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we have to urge the Malaysian authorities to recognise that the development of further political <span class="italic">and</span> economic cooperation between the European Union and Malaysia will largely depend on the opening of a serious dialogue that will lead to moves in Malaysia for the observation of basic human rights in that country.</p>

Unfortunately this is just one aspect of the ethnic and political oppression which has deprived most of this country"s people of their basic rights. Through our resolution we therefore intend to call upon the authorities of Djibouti, and first and foremost President Guelleh, to rectify this unacceptable situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the Horn of Africa is devastated by conflicts of every type; it is up to the Djibouti authorities to decide whether to let their country plunge into violence, instability and lawlessness or, on the other hand, to rebuild the conditions necessary for coexistence on new foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that this partly depends on the revival of a peace and stability process for the entire region. Therefore we urge that there should be a stop to all ill‐treatment of political prisoners, and that they should be given access to any care and treatment required, allowed a fair trial and be released. Respect for human rights must also be restored and guaranteed for all and, above all, any discrimination based on ethnic origin must cease.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Djibouti also undertook to respect this principle when it signed up to the Lomé Convention, Article 5 of which states that each signatory shall be guided by the principles of respect for human rights and democratisation of their own country. I think Article 5 should be borne in mind because if, first and foremost, the specific situation of political prisoners and, more generally, the human rights situation are not improved, the application of this article and the measures which derive from it is an option worth considering.</p>

Today we are talking about Djibouti and other countries, and I am firmly convinced that if we take the right measures now we can help these countries to develop peacefully and to avoid war.</p>
<p class="contents">A new president has been elected in Djibouti, so this is a good time to point out that there must be an end to the human rights violations and the inhuman treatment of political prisoners, who are left languishing in prison untended and without rights. We are not trying to deny that there is armed opposition in Djibouti, but even unarmed political opponents are thrown into prison anyway, and that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Djibouti is one of the countries covered by the Lomé Convention, and we should regard this as a contract between us and point this out to the other countries involved.

<p class="contents">I think we should press this point very strongly. We cannot be satisfied with the answer that a country"s straitened economic circumstances are an obstacle to the establishment of a fully‐fledged democracy. I think it would be more true to say precisely the opposite! Indeed in the developing countries, those which have signed the Lomé Convention, we see many good examples of countries which have got under way with economic development as a consequence of the re‐establishment of democratic rules, and for precisely this reason we should put more pressure on Djibouti to comply with this genuine contractual agreement it has entered into with its European partners.</p>

<p class="contents">We agree with everything that has been said by the previous speakers from all groups. As Mrs Maes said, I think that we should indeed take advantage of the recent election of the new President, Mr Guelleh, in order to define the Union"s position very clearly and firmly and to indicate that we will see to it that the famous Article 5 is applied very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrest of a number of leaders of the opposition outside the borders of Djibouti, notably in Ethiopia and Yemen, their extradition to Djibouti and their imprisonment, the conditions in which they are being detained, the absence of a trial and of lawyers, the particularly difficult and distressing conditions of their imprisonment: we are aware of all these things and it is clear that we cannot allow this to happen. The Djibouti authorities must know that we are going to act swiftly and that we are going to make use of the texts to which their country is a signatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think that if we delay we are in danger of being faced with an even more distressing and even more difficult situation in a few months" time, if that is possible given the fate of those whom we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on behalf of my group, I call upon the Commission and the Council to take firm and immediate action as quickly as possible, so that our intentions will be made known without delay.</p>

Nevertheless, before this Court can actually become effective in practice, its Statute has to be ratified by at least 60 countries. And up to now, with the honourable exceptions of Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago and San Marino, no other country in the international community has ratified it yet, although some have started the ratification process.</p>
<p class="contents">So the objective of the resolution we have submitted is to get the Statute ratified by at least 60 countries by the end of the year 2000, so that the International Criminal Court can start to function in that year. The resolution further calls upon the Council to include this objective on the agenda of the European Council in Cologne. Now, I believe that at a time when we are discussing the right to humanitarian intervention, and at a time when it is recognised that the international community requires instruments enabling it to defend fundamental human rights where they are being violated in a serious and flagrant manner, it is clearly perverse that there should be delays in creating what might be viewed as a legal forum governing the right of intervention, which is precisely what this would be. It is equally paradoxical that it should be precisely a number of those countries that are practising so‐called ‘humanitarian intervention" which have the most reservations about approving the Statute of the International Criminal Court, bearing in mind that this Statute contains an unacceptable exclusion clause. That is why I believe that it is important for us to appeal to those countries, and above all our Member States and the larger countries, to ratify the Statute and to specifically reject the exclusion clause on war crimes, so as to create a genuine legal body with compulsory jurisdiction, through which we can legitimise the right of intervention.</p>

It must be operational as soon as possible and be able to effectively try those responsible for such crimes so that they do not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is disappointing that no Member State of the European Union has ratified the Statute for this Court. This is all the more disappointing when we take account of the fact that the Union claims to be not only an area of pluralism and diversity but, in particular, a Community of law. The ratification of the Statute of the Court, with no exclusions in terms of its remit, would demonstrate our commitment to complying with the law and to defending freedoms and human life. These objectives of the Union are at least as important as our commercial objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I am calling on the Council and the Commission today to establish the ratification of the Statute of the Criminal Court as a political objective for the Union. When we talk about the right to intervene, this House believes that the right to intervene is valid when it refers to military situations but not when it refers to other matters.</p>

We want to see the court operational as soon as possible. Nothing that has occurred in Kosovo or anywhere else has diminished the significance of this. The Liberal Group unanimously endorses the call for such a court to be set up.</p>
<p class="contents">This week – in the course of my three final speeches in the European Parliament – it has given me great satisfaction to be able to speak out in favour of peace and freedom in Kosovo, to support the EU"s fight for the abolition of the death penalty, and to argue for an international tribunal to judge war crimes. These three issues reflect some of the basic values underpinning our Union: freedom for the oppressed, the rule of law, democracy and common humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">As a student from a country which did not take part in the Second World War, I was horrified by what that conflict produced. For me too, European integration came to figure as the key to overcoming hatred and building a new and better order for a healed and whole Europe. I have met many people in this Parliament who feel the same way and have as a result become my friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more than I could ever even have dreamed of as a young man has come about, but a great deal still remains to be achieved. I like to believe that there will always be people with dreams and expectations of a better Europe and a better world – people with the strength and determination to make their dreams a reality.</p>

I think that Parliament has done a great deal of work in that direction through its intergroup, which bears the significant name ‘No peace without justice'. I believe one thing must be clear to us here, namely that this intergroup which deals with the subject of the International Criminal Court, and of which my colleague Mr Dell'Alba is one of the leaders, is saying quite plainly that there must be justice with a legal basis. Sad to say, we usually have a legal basis for various operations, as we are witnessing in Kosovo at the present time; we have it at international level through the United Nations or through an organisation such as NATO, we have it at national level and at regional level, where such legal provisions can be effectively enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">One area in which we are regrettably without such a legal basis is that of ethnic groups and minorities. I believe that is the reason why many conflicts of the past ten to fifteen years have been pursued by force of arms rather than before a tribunal or a criminal court. I therefore consider it especially important that we in the European Union should act with the utmost vigour and tell our Member States that they should be among the first to ratify the Statute of this International Criminal Court and that they should press for the establishment of the Court and not leave it to other states, such as San Marino and Senegal, which have devoted themselves to this cause with admirable zeal. We should set an example here. The European Parliament, with its tradition of commitment to human rights, certainly possesses excellent credentials in this area.</p>

The turn taken by events in recent years has borne out what we have been repeating all along in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is an international forum in which – before there is recourse to military means – issues can be managed and resolved in a dignified way. It was a major step forward when the Statute was adopted last July, but I deplore the fact that not one of the EU"s Member States has yet ratified it. The procedures ought to have been set in train much more swiftly. I am pleased to see that as many as 82 countries have in fact signed the Statute, but it is regrettable that only three have ratified.</p>

I would like to thank Karl Habsburg very much indeed for mentioning the role of the intergroup we set up with so many colleagues. The ‘No peace without justice" campaign by the international radical movement has helped to promote what I feel amounts to one of the most important messages we can pass on at the end of a century which has been the bloodiest in history. Just three countries have already ratified the Statute of the Court but others are about to do so. Our country, Mr President, will probably do so at the end of May, and France is well on the way. A strong signal needs to come from Cologne so that the fifteen Member States, whose role was decisive for the success of the Rome Conference, should set the tone for the other countries and be the first to ratify the Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not by chance that the very first countries to do so were an African country, a Caribbean country and San Marino. Europe is lagging behind somewhat: it should pass on this message! I hope that Parliament will state this clearly afterwards.</p>

A few weeks ago in front of the Parliament building in Brussels, a woman was murdered. The important thing is that the culprit should be quickly arrested, brought to trial and fairly sentenced. It is exactly the same with international human rights. We cannot simply tolerate and accept the violation of human rights. What we need is a system whereby offenders are extradited and made to face the consequences of their actions. Justice and security, after all, are among the main pillars on which our European Union is built, and not only our European Union but also the applicant countries and the rest of the world. We must campaign to ensure that our 15 Member States recognise the International Criminal Court and also that the rest of the world acknowledges these principles of justice and security.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, I should like to pass on the European Commission"s reactions to the different points that have been raised in this urgent debate on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the death penalty and the establishment of a universal moratorium on capital punishment, as you are all aware, on 28 April, the European Union did in fact take the initiative of submitting a draft resolution on the death penalty to the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution was approved by 30 of the 53 member countries of this Commission and was sponsored by 72 states, seven more than in the previous session. In other words, awareness of this situation is being raised at international level. We must not give up hope as this type of battle, just like the battle you highlighted, and as is usually the case with all problems that affect human beings, is won on the basis of a persistent day‐to‐day fight.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, in relation to previous situations, there is no doubt that we are making progress. Of course, whether or not the United Nations General Assembly adopts a resolution is in the hands of its members. If it were up to the Commission, we would have no trouble promoting it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Kurdish issue and the Öcalan case, I would point out that, as you all know, the European Union adopted a declaration on the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan and the trial that is to take place in the near future. And, of course, the Commission fully supports the declaration made by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, the Commission stresses that the trial must be public, it must comply with the rule of law, it must take place before an independent court, Mr Öcalan must have access to a defence lawyer of his choice and international observers must be allowed to attend. The Commission is disappointed with the response from the Turkish Government stating that they will not admit international observers and it takes note of the fact that it has been assured that the trial will be a public one. We also deeply regret the request for the death penalty from the private prosecution. The Commission will pay close attention to the trial and the procedures followed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Malaysia, the Commission shares your view that the Malaysian Government must ensure that its legal system is not misused for political reasons. In line with this view, and given that Mr Anwar Ibrahim has already spent almost seven months in prison without bail being set, the Commission considers that the trial and the appeal the defence lawyers have already announced, must be concluded in accordance with the internationally accepted criteria on guaranteeing a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also trusts that the necessary legal measures will be taken to determine who is responsible for the verbal and physical assaults on Mr Anwar Ibrahim. This also shows that the incident is linked to the current debate in Malaysia on the reform of the police.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is still concerned that if fundamental human rights continue to be restricted, such as the right to peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of expression and opinion, this may give rise to a climate of instability and social unrest in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Djibouti, the Commission is aware that some political figures are being held in the Gabode prison and fully shares your concerns over the fate of these political prisoners. In all its contacts with the country"s authorities, the Commission has reiterated its position on the respect for fundamental human freedoms and the rule of law. The Commission has also taken note of the recent proposals made by the Government of Djibouti which seek to allow the Red Cross or any other independent bodies to carry out inspection visits of the prisons. And, of course, we warmly welcome this position from the new government.</p>
<p class="contents">Contact has been made with the International Committee of the Red Cross and with the Member States so that they can begin helping displaced persons and refugees to return home, thus respecting their right to return to their place of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, I naturally believe that you have pointed out something that is mere common sense: the sooner this Court is up and running, the easier it will be to address and begin to resolve problems such as those in the Balkans – with Kosovo as the most recent example – as well as other problems throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">But of course we also believe, in particular, that our Member States should set an example and speed up the ratification procedures in the various national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw to your attention to the fact that the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has been receiving financial support from the Community for several years. The Commission intends to continue to provide this support within the terms of the regulation adopted by the Council, which creates the legal basis that allows us to carry out and develop actions in the field of human rights.</p>

I should say ‘the most recent" coup d"état, because goodness knows the Comoros have experienced a considerable number of them since gaining independence in 1975: this is the eighteenth one to be recorded!</p>
<p class="contents">Several comments have been made concerning the responsibility that could be attributed to those responsible for the secession of the island of Anjouan in the current crisis. To a certain extent the problem is like that of the chicken and the egg. In other words, the question is who first caused the problems. The fact that some of the problems in the Comoros have worsened and have been repeated is very probably because the existence of some populations with their own crises and their own problems, particularly on the island of Anjouan but also on the island of Mohéli, was not taken sufficiently into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, some people here – I know that Mr Hory is going to take the floor in a moment – know this area and the problems that it faces infinitely better than I do. What we can hope is that we are able to find a solution – and the Union must take part in this – that will be capable of stabilising relations between the three islands, if this is possible. In any case, this is what we want to see. This solution must also take account of the specific and particular needs of the people of each of these islands, needs which are specific even though the various populations are not very far from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, Mr President, I must say that I regret that recital G of this joint motion for a resolution casts some doubt on Parliament"s opinion concerning the initiatives taken by the chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Mr Michel Rocard. Personally, I approved and supported them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hory </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, having observed the political collapse of the Comoros, we could well think that they are the victims of some sort of bad luck. In fact bad luck has nothing to do with it, and if we consider the situation objectively, we can clearly see three levels of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – and even though it is not at all fashionable here to say such things – there is the responsibility of the Comoran people, or more precisely, of their leaders. In the 19th century the Comoros were called the islands of the battling sultans, because Grande Comore and Anjouan were dominated by a few supposedly noble families who had been fighting for power for centuries, and who forced the vast majority of the population to bear the weight of their privileges by enforcing vast social inequalities, unjustifiable financial monopolies and a truly medieval structure of society. This is the first level of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current crisis – and this is not a fashionable thing to say either – the responsibility of the Organisation of African Unity must be underlined. It is theoretically in charge of reconciling the people of Grande Comore with those of Anjouan after the secession of the island of Anjouan.</p>
<p class="contents">The sole activity of the OAU, if not its sole <span class="italic">raison d"ętre</span> , seems to be to defend the old colonial borders, against everything, against everyone, and even against obvious facts. The OAU is therefore very understandably accused of partiality, as it has shown itself to be indifferent to even the most legitimate claims made by Anjouan and Mohéli.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I will not dwell very long on this point, there is the responsibility of France, which has been caricatured by the fact that the eighteenth coup d"état in the Comoros coincides with the opening of the trial in Paris of the mercenary, Bob Denard, who in 1975, 1978, 1989 and 1995 was himself responsible for four coups d"état in Moroni and who is suspected of murdering two Comoran heads of state. Today we have learnt that a former French Minister for Cooperation and Development will attend the trial to testify in his favour. I think that is all that need be said.</p>
<p class="contents">Having established these responsibilities, it seems that the European Union has a duty to make up for the inability of the usual key players on the Comoran stage by mounting a political initiative for inter‐island reconciliation, a considerable degree of humanitarian aid, particularly for Anjouan, and a fresh emergency economic aid programme for the Comoros.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally – and I will now conclude – I would like to stress this urgency from a particular point of view. As Mr Lehideux was kind enough to say, I am fortunate to have a last chance to speak in this House on a subject which concerns me personally. Since 1997, in Mayotte, which has fortunately remained French territory, there has been a massive and artificial influx of refugees as a result of the crisis in the Comoros that neither the public services, the local economy nor the people of Mayotte can withstand for much longer. The stabilisation of the Comoros is therefore the condition necessary for peace in the entire region.</p>

<p class="contents">The Islamic Republic of Comoros is a state which for many years now, virtually ever since independence, has been living through a serious institutional crisis, as previous speakers recalled. And it is the very unity of the country, or rather of the three islands making it up, that is constantly being called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago a framework agreement was reached – helped on its way by the unobtrusive but extremely important work of President Michel Rocard, to whom we pay tribute – which did and still does provide a good basis on which to re‐establish conditions enabling coexistence between the various islands and the very survival of a state in the Comoros.</p>
<p class="contents">The military coup d"état, which we of course condemn, followed in the wake of a number of serious incidents on Grande Comore against people from the island of Anjouan and was also due to the civil authorities" inability to uphold the process of state reunification and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that two things need to be done: the first is surely to re‐establish constitutional and civil order and put an end to the coup d"état, which – as colleagues have pointed out – is the eighteenth one since the mid‐seventies; and secondly, and at the same time, the process of seeking a national agreement needs to continue and should also deal with those forces, not just military forces, wishing to maintain the supremacy of the people in one island over the others.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason it is important that the representatives of the island of Anjouan be allowed to consult the people and to sign up to the agreement which all the others had endorsed before the coup. Furthermore, the international community, working <span class="italic">inter alia </span> through the Organisation of African Unity, but with the European Union playing an active role, should back this agreement and get to work preparing an economic assistance programme of both emergency and long‐term aid, to allow the country to recover in economic terms as well. This agreement would moreover, if it were successful, set a positive example for other African countries experiencing crises of a similar order and complexion.</p>

This statistic is sufficient to convey the difficult situation of a region which would otherwise have every likelihood of taking the right path towards democracy and development. We need only think of the example of Mauritius, which has many similar cultural and geopolitical characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in my own humble opinion and in that of the group I represent, the European Union must deliver a clear, specific and united response from. Actions by individual politicians and countries are important, but only a collective effort on the part of the Union can bring something good out of this difficult and troubled time.</p>
<p class="contents">And having expressed this hope, Mr President, I would like to thank you in your capacity as President for the achievements of these last five years, and I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly those taking part in meetings on human rights and matters of urgency, for all the work they have done here and for all that I have learned from them.</p>

<p class="contents">As you are well aware, the Commission reacted immediately and stressed the European Union"s disapproval to the chief of staff, Colonel Azali Assoumani, drawing his attention to the principles on which our cooperation is based, the main elements of which are the respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Furthermore, the European Commission has suggested to the Member States that they should apply the procedure set out in Article 366 of the Lomé Convention, which allows them to suspend cooperation with the Comoros.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is examining with the Member States the possibility of a diplomatic initiative aimed at applying the agreement signed in Madagascar on 29 April 1999 under the auspices of the OAU. Since 1998, the Commission has financed humanitarian aid programmes to the order of EUR 1 million to improve the situation of the people of Anjouan in terms of nutrition and health care, and the Commission has just approved a new programme to the value of EUR 730 000 which is aimed at providing primary health care. It is also examining whether or not it would be appropriate to approve an additional humanitarian aid programme in view of the requirements on the three islands as a result of the political instability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s office in the Comoros is paying close attention to how the situation develops and, according to our latest information, the situation is calm and the army has established the initial contact needed to establish a transitional government in accordance with the agreement reached in Madagascar.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flemming </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in a few days' time, the Czech Government will make its decision on the completion of the nuclear power station in Temelin. Let me quote the report by the International Commission on Temelin, which said that there is currently an excess productive capacity and that power from the Temelin plant can only marginalise the use of other resources for power production. The stage has already been reached when any solution to the Temelin project will have more adverse than beneficial effects. Completion may bring even greater financial losses than discontinuing the construction work would cause. Economically, then, the situation is very tricky to downright crazy. And yet Western industries are still trying to make money there and have no compunction about possibly creating economic difficulties for a young democracy which, I hope, will very soon be a member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Atomic Energy Agency formulates minimum technical safety standards for nuclear plants which even nuclear power stations in the third world could satisfy. That is well known. This assessment does not come from me, but from very high‐ranking diplomats and scientists. I consider that to be an insult to the Czech Government and an affront to the Czech people. In its conclusion of 7 December 1998 on nuclear safety, the Council, distancing itself from the IAEA, speaks of a ‘high level of nuclear safety'. That is quite a different matter!</p>
<p class="contents">If I may quote the Temelin report again, it says that the release of radioactive substances will be prevented by a simple concrete shell in the event of a nuclear accident. How simple, I wonder! The report also states that the long‐term storage of radioactive waste will be assured in due course. So when and where will it be stored? Whatever the answers to these questions, I should like to thank all of my colleagues, particularly those from my own group, who intend to vote in favour of this resolution today.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Graenitz </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety has always been a very important subject in this House, since we are all aware that an accident in a nuclear power station affects not only the people who live and work nearby but also everyone else in Europe, and that we must therefore devote very special attention to safety.</p>
<p class="contents">As the previous speaker said, the government of the Czech Republic has been faced in these past few weeks with a decision as to whether or not the construction of the Temelin nuclear power station is to be completed. Ever since the borders between the Czech Republic and my own country were opened, this nuclear plant has been a source of endless amazement, since it was supposed to have been completed several years ago. Time and again they said the work would be done, but time and again it failed to materialise. I believe that all these points have to be considered very carefully; the fact that money has been spent on it already is no reason to finish building something that is neither safe nor economical.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to highlight another point here. My group is not only anxious to voice our concerns about public safety in the European Union and in the Czech Republic and neighbouring countries; it also wishes to see aid being offered to promote change, to promote another form of energy production, another source of energy, a different type of energy efficiency to that which can be achieved with a nuclear power station, with the accompanying wastage of electrical energy.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are interested in is being able to offer ecologically as well as economically acceptable ways of obtaining sustainable energy to meet people's needs. Since this is my last speech in this House, allow me to mention that I myself have launched an initiative to that end. Under the scheme, known as ‘Building with the sun in Upper Austria and Southern Bohemia', mayors, administrators, engineers and architects are invited to work together on projects in which greater use is made of solar power, for the sun, after all, is a source of energy for all of us, and it is better to harness that energy than to construct our buildings in such a way that we need a great deal of nuclear power in order to heat them.</p>

We know this, but we also know that we in western Europe tend to differentiate more. It is clear that the obsolete Russian nuclear plants need to be shut down, but the sort of plant we are discussing now, at Temelin, is a modern Russian power station, although it still needs to be brought up to international safety standards. I actually think that we need to consider which option is best for each country. Sometimes alternatives to nuclear power are possible, and if there is an option that is just as cost‐effective, then that is the one to go for. But if it appears that upgrading the obsolete plants is the only option, then the European Union must work with the applicant country, in this case the Czech Republic, to achieve this. Because there are question marks about the economic feasibility of Temelin, I do not think that we can take a decision yet, but we must work with the Czech Government to find the right solution. I hope that the Commission will concentrate its efforts on this over the next few months.</p>

But the European Parliament must focus on the following point: all these matters have a bearing on the Community too and affect every one of us. In the case of power plants, this applies to safety standards, especially those governing the construction and operation of nuclear power stations, their fuel cycle and the disposal of their waste, and all of these things are important in the context of future accession treaties, because we cannot admit any new Member States which maintain lower safety standards than those which obtain in Western Europe by virtue of political decisions. Secondly, this is about the free energy market and future participants in that market. We shall naturally be unable to tolerate a situation in which customers can freely obtain electricity from producers who do not apply the common safety standards and thereby secure competitive advantages in an unacceptable way. These are the two Community aspects that we in Parliament must discuss. That is why it is right to adopt this resolution. That is why it is right that the Commission should deliver its opinion on the present reports too, because we have a duty to the European people to create transparency publicly here on this important issue. So it is certainly not a matter of the Czech Republic and Austria alone but rather about the European public, and we must remember that if we are to fulfil the mandate from our electorate.</p>

I visited it as a national of a country that has four large nuclear power stations on its borders, notably the Cattenom station that is on French territory. French engineers have always tried to convince us that the French power stations were entirely safe with a high level of security. It has now been demonstrated that this is not the case. There is always a risk, one which the people of Luxembourg do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that the Austrians, who are neighbours of the Czechs, should be exposed to the risks of a power station that is even more vulnerable to accidents. I think that the European Union should help the Czech Republic to equip itself with an alternative system for producing energy, that uses soft energy, but should not release funds for a Soviet‐designed type VVER 1000 power station which, in my opinion, presents a great many risks.</p>

What some of you dismissed at that time as the reaction of Luddites has long since proved to be a recognition of the insoluble nature of the problems of nuclear power, of the security issue, the waste disposal issue and the cost issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, the European Parliament has been increasingly supportive of the quest for new, sustainable forms of energy. It has recognised that the risks emanating from nuclear energy production in Central and Eastern Europe have assumed an entirely new dimension, but it has also recognised that the accession talks present us with a new opportunity. The Temelin nuclear power station is a yardstick of the credibility of this House. But the parliamentary groups remain split. The influence of the nuclear lobby in this House is still intolerably powerful. I wish we had received more decisive support in the past from some of those who have tabled this resolution today, particularly the European People's Party, and I wish that some of the signatories had been more effective advocates within their own party. Had that been the case, today's debate would not have exuded this faint odour of electioneering.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, this Parliament of ours is still unable to act on its own judgement by making the abandonment of nuclear power in Europe one of its top priorities. But there is one responsibility that this House cannot evade today, namely its responsibility for enabling the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to switch to alternative energy policies, instead of helping them to pursue the dangerous and senseless upgrading and conversion of their nuclear plants.</p>

At the same time, I think we need to adopt a sober and even strict approach when it comes to meeting the agreed political and economic criteria, since the successful operation of the enlarged Union is at stake here. However, this sensibly cautious approach must not mean that solutions to bilateral problems are forced on the applicant countries under the pressure of the accession process or by subtle references to it. The applicant countries are the weaker party in relations with the Union, and I do not think I need to remind anyone here that it is one of the most difficult tasks in politics to ensure that justice is done to the weaker party. As for the objections that Austria especially has against nuclear power stations in general and the one at Temelin in particular, I would point out that there are a number of recently built power stations in Central and Eastern Europe, many of which are considerably more dangerous than the one at Temelin. Furthermore, Temelin at least meets the internationally recognised minimum requirements, which definitely cannot be said of various other plants. This is why many in my group feel that it would not be right to single out the Czech Republic, particularly when this issue has already been covered in much greater depth and in a more appropriate context in the Adam report. There is no reason to pick on the Czech Republic, and certainly not on Temelin. This would simply be underestimating the dangers presented by many others. We need to show some understanding for the Czech Government, which has few alternatives for meeting its energy needs. I hardly think that brown coal can be seen as a viable option, because of the huge environmental damage that it causes. So we need to adopt a more positive approach towards the Czech Government.</p>

<p class="contents">In the case of the Czech power station, Temelín, it seems highly unlikely that the maximum safety levels for power stations which is required of applicants for accession will be achieved, particularly in the light of the Czech authorities" plan to use Soviet‐type VVER 1000 reactors, which are presented as latest generation plants but have actually proved not to be very reliable at all.</p>
<p class="contents">These reactors do not appear to meet the maximum safety levels we should now be demanding and there are doubts about their viability insofar as their much vaunted energy efficiency is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering that the Adam report on nuclear safety, which was approved by this House last March, called among other things for restrictions on the use of RBMK reactors and also VVER Soviet‐built models, which the Czech authorities are now planning to use in Temelin, let us reaffirm the conclusions submitted by Alleanza Nazionale"s head of delegation and the draftsman of the opinion on the Adam report: first, safety is the key element of the pre‐accession strategy; secondly, international legislation on safety systems must be strengthened; and thirdly, the application of such legislation should be supervised by an independent body.</p>
<p class="contents">We can therefore approve the common resolution submitted today, paying particular attention to environmental protection standards, which are, moreover, the only way of guaranteeing that public health is protected.</p>

As immediate neighbours of the Czech Republic, we in Austria are particularly affected by the planned high‐risk reactor. Looking beyond the present motion, however, we take the view that, in the context of its enlargement to the East, the European Union must spell out clearly that accession would be inconceivable unless the applicant countries completely change their dangerous nuclear policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me point out, for example, that reactors built to the same specifications in the former German Democratic Republic were decommissioned after the reunification of Germany. We believe that the financing of this reactor by means of a grant or loan from EU funds would be tantamount to misappropriation on both economic and ecological grounds.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Is that all you can say about the nuclear power station? Is that all the importance you attach to this subject? It is certainly legitimate to support these countries financially in the establishment of a sustainable energy system. I thank you, Mr President, and I thank the gentleman who felt he had to shout out his statement on this important subject in order to book his place in tomorrow's newspaper.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> I will be brief, Mr President. The Commission understands that the Temelin reactors are, in principle, among those that can be improved to meet acceptable safety levels. And, as indicated in Agenda 2000 and in the communication of March 1998, the Commission"s overall objective in relation to this type of reactor is to ensure that the improvements undertaken by the respective countries are carried out in a rapid and efficient manner and produce satisfactory results.</p>
<p class="contents">However, two elements must be taken into account. The authorities in the country where the nuclear power plants are situated are responsible for their nuclear safety. A high level of nuclear safety is a priority in the accession process and the Commission is prepared to cooperate with all the applicant countries to help improve nuclear safety. The Commission is also prepared to help guarantee that the levels of technological and operational safety are brought into line with the safety practices currently in force in the Union. In the Czech Republic, aid has been granted under the framework of the PHARE programme to the authorities responsible for nuclear safety and to improve the safety of the Duckovani nuclear power plant.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the specific case of Temelin, the Commission does not have sufficient information on the current state of progress. At the moment, there is no formal agreement with the Czech authorities under the PHARE framework to allow the European Union"s technical safety bodies to carry out an overall safety assessment. The Commission has taken careful note of the opinion on Temelin set out in the report published by the WENRA regulators. This report does not provide sufficient information to allow us to reach a definitive conclusion on the level of safety that has been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the economic aspects of the Temelin project, the Commission supports the development of an energy strategy that gives due consideration to energy production and the diversification of sources. The PHARE programme has supported this approach in various projects.</p>

This is not strictly a point of order, but it concerns events that have occurred since the morning. I ask that we somehow take them into account.</p>
<p class="contents">You may know that there has been an announcement by the G8 ministers which offers terms for a Kosovo solution which are much less intransigent than the five conditions that have been insisted upon until now and significantly re‐involves the Security Council. In view of that, the resolutions that we have tabled this week are very much out of step with events and give the impression that Parliament is out of touch with what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do not know procedurally what should be done, but I ask you with your superior knowledge of procedure to invent some way in which we can take account of this event and show that we do follow the live process rather than sticking to dogmatic positions that bring nothing new and contribute nothing to the solution of this tragedy.</p>
