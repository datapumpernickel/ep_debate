<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, our second topic today, as you said, concerns the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World in 2011. This report, which, I am pleased to say, is now on the Council website, is set to be adopted in two weeks’ time. I am very happy to present the outline of this report to the House – on time – this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual report shows how the EU really can make a difference when and where it matters most. The report covers 2011 but, if I might, I would like to give some up-to-date figures to illustrate what I mean. Since the beginning of this year, we have made 36 declarations or statements on behalf of human rights defenders or country situations of concern. Of course, that does not include the countless number of <span class="italic">démarches</span> we conduct – for obvious reasons – behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">Since January, we have also conducted 14 in-depth human rights discussions with countries around the globe, with another 22 still to come this year. From Jordan to Vietnam, from Ukraine to the United States, from Argentina to Pakistan, the European Union sits down in the spirit of partnership to see how we can, together, improve the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual report details all of this action in 2011. But it does more: in line with the wishes of Parliament, the report contains a section on freedom of religion or belief, which is so essential to the development of free societies. 2011 saw worrying developments in this connection, with intolerance spilling over from discrimination into violent attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, for the first time, the report contains a section on international humanitarian law, which was the subject of various EU initiatives in 2011, culminating in the seven pledges made in November to the 31st International conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.</p>
<p class="contents">As in previous years, the annual report catalogues our work across the whole range of thematic issues, bilateral and multilateral. It encapsulates the tremendous challenges to human rights and democracy in 2011, and how we responded.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, just a few examples to show that we stay consistently active:</p>
<p class="contents">In Bahrain, we have been working since the events of February 2011 to encourage all sides to engage in national reconciliation. I personally expressed support for the independent commission of inquiry and the implementation of its recommendations when I met with his Majesty the King and with the Foreign Minister. We have kept a close eye on the case of Mr al-Khawaja and I have asked my officials to meet him in prison; this took place just before he ended his hunger strike. The EU is also following the fate of Mr Nabeel Rajab, who has just been arrested yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">In Mongolia, the EU has been following the situation since the arrest of former President Enkhbayar on corruption charges, his hunger strike and subsequent release. We are determined to support the democratic process in Mongolia ahead of the elections on 28 June.</p>
<p class="contents">In Pakistan, the EU intervened in the case of Mr Behram Khan, who has been on death row since 2003. Following the rejection of several appeals, he was due to be executed on 23 May, but after several EU appeals to the Pakistani authorities, the execution was put off. During my visit last week to Pakistan, I raised the issues of the need to protect and promote the rights of women, to abolish the death penalty and to make good on the promise of legislative changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the package concerns human rights and democracy. Our election observation missions remain an essential tool to support democracy and accompany political change, as in the case of the historic elections in Tunisia, the creation of a new state in South Sudan, the important parliamentary elections in Algeria – with the first ever EU election observation there – and Peru, where the observation mission contributed to strengthening our bilateral relations, and, of course, many other places across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Members of this House for their participation in these missions, adding visibility and enhancing the political commitment of the European Union. On a related note, I am happy to confirm that we are making good progress in preparing the draft statute for the European Endowment for Democracy, including on the basis of the Lambsdorff report.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will consider the annual report a useful resource.

<p class="contents">In the spirit of the guiding values of the UN Charter, we take this report very seriously, and it is our priority to cooperate with the EEAS for a comprehensive strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back at the past year, however, in spite of all our commitment, we have to face reality. Regular and systematic human rights violations continue. People face repression around the world and innocent people die every day. Yet, there is reason for hope. In spite of the aforementioned violations, we also witness increasing demand for human rights coming from the people, from brave individuals, inspired to action by the principle of human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Millions poured out into the streets to demand justice and freedom in the Arab world; courageous people in China continue showing the world that they are not afraid. They want accountability, just as those Tibetans who choose to sacrifice themselves in peaceful protest against China’s communist rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights defenders and lawyers continue protecting those who want to practise their freedom. We are witnessing increasing non-violent resistance, reflecting self-consciousness among people – just as Liu Xiaobo wrote in 2006 in his essay ‘Changing the regime by changing society’.</p>
<p class="contents">His words are still of great inspiration today. Our solidarity with entire communities that rise up in spite of intimidation is crucial. We cannot force change from the outside. It needs to come from the inside and we have to stay committed in order to catalyse this change now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will be working, of course, with our next rapporteur on human rights, Mr Donskis, who will speak next. With him, I know that the High Representative and her services have made a major effort to get the timetable back on track and to ensure that she herself is present to deliver this annual human rights report to our plenary. I would like to sincerely thank her and her services for restoring this important action.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to place on record that I agree with many of the conclusions of the report. This was indeed a momentous year for human rights and democracy building in which we have all – the EU included – had to step up to the task. I agree that this report, in a sense, will be the last of its kind, as next year we will be able to report and debate on implementation of the strategic review on human rights. In this context, I applaud, for example, the EU’s action to protest against the arrest of bloggers exercising their freedom of expression, the new consensus the EU has now forged in EU institutions on freedom of religion and belief, the unanimous support of EU members of the Human Rights Council for the groundbreaking resolution on sexual orientation and gender identity, the new common position on the international criminal court, and, as the High Representative has said herself, the successful EU observation missions. I would like to thank her for what she said this afternoon about Nabeel Rajab, who I know, thanks to this wonderful world of social media. I would be grateful if, in her response, she could comment about the four ICC staff who are currently detained in Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although I have been proud to contribute personally to the work of the mandate holder leading to the guiding principles on business and human rights, I would like the High Representative to charge an identified person within her services to spearhead their implementation within the European Union and to follow up the recommendations of the Edinburgh Study detailed in her last annual report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have had an historic opportunity to convince ourselves that the pursuit of freedom and dignity is not just an invention of the modern Western world, but that it is a universal goal of humanity, spontaneously and momentarily, even without any refined policy or philosophy, bringing humanity together throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the Arab Spring, the aspiration of freedom and democracy that broke through with great force, which can rightly be compared with such momentous events in our recent history as the Eastern European nations’ struggle for freedom and the great human rights movements from Andrei Sakharov and his companions in Russia to <span class="italic">Solidarity</span> in Poland. As future rapporteur, I will have the difficult task of trying to evaluate the lessons learnt by Europe thanks to the Arab Spring and analyse the consequences of these lessons for common European Union human rights policy in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Arab Spring and the other events of last year increasingly reveal the power of information technology and the importance of expression, the media and social media for democratic revolutions and democratic progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I therefore cannot fail to mention the important events of last year in Belarus and the very poor human rights situation in Tibet, which is a concern both for my group and, I believe, Parliament as a whole, and which must be raised at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the Annual Report on Human Rights and the European Parliament’s cooperation with you must become an opportunity to look boldly into the future of Europe and the world because, let us be frank and let us not hide it, retrospective talk in the report taking into account the situation in the world in 2011 is tantamount to talking about the world’s future and humanity strategies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The full title of the Special Representative – Special Representative of the European Union – shows that they are not the special representative of the External Action Service or the special representative of the Council, and nor are they your special representative or personal representative. If they are a Special Representative of the European Union, they must be accountable to the EU institutions and be a special representative for the Union. That is my constitutional reading on the basis of the Treaties and if, as you told us, High Representative, it is already laid down in the Treaties that they will be accountable to the EU institutions, including this House, which is one of those institutions, I really cannot understand why their mandate does not include the obligation to appear before Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the annual reports, I defer to my colleagues, both Mr Howitt and Mr Donskis, on the work they have been doing and their very praiseworthy work on monitoring the situation this year. I should like to add just one matter for our consideration. Last year was not just a momentous year in human rights terms; it was also a very important year for the European Union: it was the year when the European Union was at its weakest in terms of economic and political power; it was the year in which many of our Member States received representatives from China, Angola or other countries with human rights problems and asked them for money to pay their debts.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the strategic aspect of reflecting on how we will act as regards human rights, it is very important that Europe starts by putting its house in order and by thinking it is necessary, not just to imagine a better world, but also to come up with a more streamlined way of acting in terms of external policy. Clearly, one of the most important things – and here I am returning to the start of my speech – has to do with cooperation between our institutions, which should be reliable, documented and structured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Finally, after many years of pressure from Members of this House, as well as from many Member States, the Council’s attention has been drawn to the urgent issue of breaches of religious freedom in almost every part of the world. I very much appreciate the role that the High Representative has played in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Religious freedom is currently the most frequently breached human right in the world, with extremely serious consequences. Seventy-five per cent of such cases – from restrictions on access to schools to dramatic cases of murder on religious grounds – affect Christians. Despite this, the Council’s report avoids naming victims and instead surrenders to a false sense of political correctness. A refusal to name the victims is, in effect, yet another blow, another form of discrimination against people who are already suffering. To hide the fact that today it is Christians who are the most frequently attacked religious group weakens our position and it is a continuation of the former policy of turning a blind eye to the undermining of religious freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly refers to the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in February 2011. Why then is it taking a step back with regard to Christianity? Has someone forgotten that even then, some Member States did not agree with this shameful practice of deleting victims’ names? The formulation adopted at the time, stating that, I quote: ‘a growing number of acts of religious intolerance and discrimination as epitomised by recent violence and acts of terror in various countries against Christians and their places of worship, Muslim pilgrims and other religious communities’ was a good compromise. Why is this compromise being rejected today? The Council’s conclusions were adopted immediately following the bomb attack on a Coptic church in Alexandria in which 23 people died and 97 were injured. Does our solidarity with persecuted Christians last only a few weeks from the date of a tragedy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are not good working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is still a long list and was, without doubt, a compulsory exercise. There are some positive points; a number of improvements have been made, but there is still a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, there are still many double standards in the examples provided, as well as some rather distorted perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is there no mention of the human rights violations in all Latin American countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Why are the murders of trade union representatives in Mexico and Colombia and the impunity granted to their killers not condemned?</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the discrimination against Kurds in Turkey not condemned? Sakharov prize winner Leyla Zana was recently severely sentenced.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the freedom not to believe not granted the same level of attention as the freedom to believe? Non-believers are, in many cases, the first victims of religious fundamentalism, yet this is not included in the statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the Arab Spring and the example of Tunisia. The EUR 150 million of extra aid is a derisory amount given the challenges being faced and when we know that Tunisia has a colossal debt of EUR 17 billion – a large part of which is odious debt – and that the country reimburses over EUR 300 million annually, a large part of which goes to the European Union. Millions of euros worth of Ben Ali’s assets remain frozen because they were paid for with public money.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, just EUR 2 million of these funds were intended for local development, when this is, in fact, the crux of the problem. Local development is where Tunisian needs are the most colossal and was the main cause of the Tunisian revolution. Economic and social rights are just as important as civil and political rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union and the High Representative undertake very many initiatives in the area of protecting and promoting human rights. It cannot be denied, however, that there is still a gap between the recognition of human rights and their effective implementation of these rights. The rights of millions are breached as a result of poverty, wars, occupation and autocratic regimes. On many occasions, we have called for a more consistent, transparent and effective EU human rights policy. The appointment of a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights may breathe fresh life into these efforts. Whether or not this will be effective will depend, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, on the mandate that the Special Representative is given, his/her experience, and whether or not EU institutions are willing to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">For the EU to speak with one voice on human rights issues, we need synergy between European Union institutions as regards the drafting of joint ideas and the undertaking of specific actions. We should also support international human rights institutions and mechanisms at national and regional levels. We must build global alliances in order to be effective in counteracting human rights violations. It is important for our reports to be verified and for conclusions to be drawn for successive years. Let us remember that throughout the world, it is women who are still the principal victims of discrimination, inequality, degradation and violence. For this reason, their rights should be treated as a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
