<p class="contents">Naturally, it is a pleasure to address the European Parliament on the EU’s progress within the Common Foreign and Security Policy. As pointed out in the committee’s report, the EU faces major global challenges. Both our own populations and third countries expect the EU to be able to help to solve conflicts and calm tensions around the world. In my statement here I will concentrate on the following topics: Afghanistan, the fight against terrorism, the Middle East, Iraq, India, Pakistan, Russia and Africa. As far as the ICC is concerned, I refer to my other statement.</p>
<p class="contents">My Greek colleague, Mr Tassos Yiannitsis, Minister for Europe, will give an account of aspects of the work in the area of the common security and defence policy, or ESDP.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned, I will start with Afghanistan. The situation there remains frail, but the Loya Jirga process still provides a good basis on which to build. Far more refugees and internally displaced persons than expected have returned home, and that shows that there is hope for the future of their country.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Afghanistan still faces very difficult challenges. The recent assassination attempt on President Karzai and other terrorist attacks are evidence of the serious security problems. Without internal security, neither stable government nor sustainable development can be achieved. The role of the central government must therefore be strengthened and the influence of the warlords reduced. Civil society and the role and rights of women must similarly be strengthened. The Afghan institutions and basic infrastructure must be built up again. Reforms must be implemented within the judicial system and police, and a national army under civil control must be established. The remaining refugees and displaced persons must be allowed to return, and we must support their reintegration.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently call upon the international community, including in particular Afghanistan’s neighbours, to continue to support a further stabilisation of Afghanistan. The UN will play a very central role here through the UN special representative Mr Brahimi.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will continue to do what is in its power to rebuild the country and to implement the Bonn Agreement fully. We promised to do so last week during a special debate at the UN. We will maintain our strong commitment to humanitarian and restructuring aid, and the EU will follow the work of the new Afghan human rights commission closely. We expect the EU Member States involved to continue contributing to the ISAF troops.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency further gives the highest priority to combating terrorism. We are implementing the European action plan to combat terrorism as planned. We will continue our efforts to incorporate the combating of terrorism into all aspects of EU foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Follow-up by the EU to date has focused on the EU’s internal measures, in which considerable progress has been made towards implementation. Implementation within the EU of UN Security Council Resolution 1373 on freezing the financial resources of terrorist groups may be mentioned here in particular. This work will naturally be continued under the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, based on the Seville European Council, the EU’s action plan and the Council conclusions of 22 July 2002, the Danish Presidency will aim to move EU policy forward as regards the EU’s international role in the fight against terrorism, including in particular cooperation with third countries and relevant international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Seville declaration, the European Council defined the Common Foreign and Security Policy’s contribution to the fight against terrorism, including the contribution of the security and defence policy. As a follow-up to this, on 22 July the Council approved a number of decisions with a view to implementing the Seville declaration. These included a revision of the dimensions relating to combating terrorism through the links with third countries, including such links in the form of conventions and specific measures that can help third countries to meet their obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency attaches importance to the Council’s conclusions being followed up by practical initiatives. A number of concrete steps have already been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about the non-proliferation and disarmament policy. We have earmarked the non-proliferation and disarmament policy for renewed consideration as part of the global fight against terrorism. We consider it of great importance that this non-proliferation and disarmament policy should be strengthened and we will be bringing the matter up with all the parties involved in Troika cooperation. On 15 April 2002, the Council adopted as many as 42 concrete measures that will help to strengthen multilateral instruments, export controls, cooperation and political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency faces two great challenges here: firstly, continuing efforts to succeed, in The Hague in November, in implementing the international Code of Conduct against the spread of ballistic missiles and secondly strengthening the convention banning biological and chemical weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">This logically leads me on to Iraq. In the Middle East, Iraq still is a serious source of concern as far as weapons of mass destruction are concerned. We agree with President Bush on this point, which he emphasised in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq has violated various Security Council resolutions in respect of the country’s disarmament obligations. The country must comply with these obligations immediately. The EU is firmly resolved to support the United Nations’ continued efforts in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, the Security Council has demanded that Iraq give the UN weapons inspectors unconditional and unfettered access and ensure that the country’s authorities cooperate to the extent required. The EU has fully supported this demand.</p>
<p class="contents">On 16 September the Iraqi Government notified the Secretary-General of the UN that it accepted the return of the weapons inspectors. The Security Council is now investigating whether the Iraqi notification complies with the Security Council’s requirements in respect of the weapons inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency agrees with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the Security Council must comply with its responsibilities, should Iraq still refuse to co-operate.</p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture, I would like to say something about the Middle East. It is two years now since the violent Israeli-Palestinian conflict broke out again. However, a number of positive signs of progress – particularly in the area of reforms – have given cause for cautious optimism in recent times, that is, since the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s response is that this progress should be utilised for the resumption of political negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians which are able to give both parties concrete prospects of a peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has therefore endeavoured to send a concrete message as to how this aim can be achieved. At the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Elsinore on 30-31 August of this year, the EU completed its proposal for a timetable pointing the way towards peace and towards the establishment of a Palestinian state by the summer of 2005. This proposal, which gives practical expression to President Bush’s vision and to the Arab peace proposal for a Palestinian state within three years – and which largely takes the Arab peace initiative as its starting point – anticipates three phases. Firstly, entry this year into an Israeli-Palestinian security agreement that will stop the violence and pave the way for the Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections that are expected to be held on 20 January 2003. Following these elections, negotiations are to be started on the establishment of a Palestinian state with temporary borders, and this is to take place in the autumn of 2003. We will then enter the third phase, in which a final peace agreement is to be entered into, adopting positions on the difficult issues of Jerusalem, borders, refugees and settlers which must be solved before the final establishment of a Palestinian state in mid-2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with this – if we are to achieve a comprehensive peace – efforts must be made to resume the negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, so that the process can lead to an overall peace solution in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">During my trip to the Middle East in early September, the proposal was generally well received by the parties in the region. The Arab countries gave the proposal a positive reception. The proposal was also welcomed by the Israeli side, although Israel expressed a number of reservations as regards certain elements of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting of the Middle East Quartet on 17 September this year, agreement was reached that, in the weeks ahead, the Quartet – partly following the EU’s lead – will seek to reach agreement on a final joint timetable for the three phases of establishing a Palestinian state by August 2005. There was also support for the EU’s suggestion of holding an international donor conference on support for the Palestinian reform process by the end of the year. The Danish EU Presidency has offered to host the conference and thus also the meeting of the Quartet that is expected to be held in connection with the donor conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the Presidency are working in accordance with the declaration made by the Seville European Council on the holding of an early peace conference which will be able to discuss and reach agreement on a timetable for the road ahead towards lasting peace in the Middle East. I have noted that, in its recent report on developments in the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy, the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy also shares this approach. The members of the Middle East Quartet have agreed to continue discussions on the date and modalities of such an international peace conference.</p>
<p class="contents">My clear impression is that the members of the Quartet take a fairly similar view of the situation and that we will therefore be able to achieve a common timetable relatively quickly. The Danish Presidency intends to continue this policy and to work actively towards a detailed timetable which can pave the way for a peaceful solution to one of the most enduring conflicts in recent history. I also note that yesterday’s security resolution specifically mentions the necessity of the EU’s and the Quartet’s peace plan, or timetable, moving forward despite what happened last week.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened – as all of you here know – is that there were two suicide attacks in Israel. That bodes ill as regards achieving the progress that was otherwise on the way following the summer’s task forces and working groups, following endorsement by the Quartet and the expansion of the EU’s plan for peace. Now we have had these serious setbacks. Otherwise we would have had reason for optimism, because partly thanks to the EU’s intervention Fatah and Tanzim had declared a moratorium on attacks on Israeli civilians. However, last week’s actions show that militant groups such as Islamic Jihad have no intention of complying with Fatah and Tanzim’s moratorium. The Presidency has expressed to both parties its great regret about both the Palestinian suicide bombings and the Israeli retaliation. Israel has the right to fight terrorism, but the fierce Israeli retaliation – including the siege and bombardment of President Arafat’s headquarters in Ramallah – will not bring peace and security to the Israeli and Palestinian people. In recent days, the Presidency has been in close contact with the parties about the situation as well as with Russia, the USA and Egypt, and we have sent representatives to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the heralded American/Jordanian/Egyptian support of Palestinian police and security forces is put into effect very quickly so that there is a unified security system on the Palestinian side with which Israel feels reasonably secure. We must not let the radical groups derail the political initiatives yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">Radical groups also threaten peace in the relationship between India and Pakistan, which remains tense. The EU is still prepared to contribute to the international efforts to reduce the current crisis, to promote measures to create confidence and to create the conditions for dialogue between the parties on a lasting solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Local elections are currently being held in Jammu and Kashmir. The run-up to the elections has been violent and has given cause for concern. However, it is our hope that the elections in Jammu and Kashmir will be able to pave the way for a resumption of the dialogue between India and Pakistan on a long-term solution. India has opposed international election observers, but representatives of a number of EU countries’ embassies in New Delhi will be present during the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to Europe and to our nearest neighbour, Russia. It goes without saying that how the EU gets on with Russia and how Russia gets on with us plays a crucial role in the peaceful development of Europe. The lead-up to the summit between the EU and Russia, which will take place in Copenhagen on 11 November 2002, will provide us with an opportunity to take stock of five years of partnership and cooperation. We will face new challenges in connection with enlargement. We all know that. In the first instance, the Presidency attaches particular importance to finding a rapid solution to the issue of the Kaliningrad enclave. On 30 September the Council will discuss the investigation of this issue carried out by the Commission in order, in consultation with Poland and Lithuania, to find a solution complying with current Community law. Russia is included in our strategy for the Northern Dimension, but we also intend to present a strategy for our new neighbours, since with the forthcoming enlargement there will naturally be a need to consider a new overall strategy in respect of the European Union’s neighbouring states to the east following enlargement, that is, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. The purpose of such a strategy will be to encourage democratic and economic reforms in the neighbouring countries and to strengthen cross-border cooperation with these countries. On 30 September 2002 the Council will go through the contributions that have already been received concerning the European Union’s links with its new neighbours. A communication that the Commission will present in the course of the autumn will naturally supplement these deliberations and hopefully lead to a decision in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I will move away from Europe and move down to Africa. As you all know, critical conditions prevail in southern Africa, where the EU is concerned at the worsening of the situation in Zimbabwe – including the latest attacks on the media, the continuing spiteful actions against farmers and President Mugabe’s appointment of a new hard-line government which is being called a ‘war cabinet’.</p>
<p class="contents">On 22 July the EU tightened up its restrictions against Zimbabwe by adding a number of names to the list of people covered by the travel ban. At the same time, the EU decided to continue cooperating with other international parties with a view to finding a solution in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">The restrictions introduced by the EU are aimed at people whom we regard as responsible for the crisis in the country. The EU will, however, continue to support Zimbabwe’s population – which is suffering from the consequences of Mugabe’s policies – by sending massive quantities of food aid which will ease the famine in the country and by offering social and medical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU notes with increasing concern that a food crisis is rapidly developing in southern Africa and that the humanitarian situation is deteriorating. The Community and its Member States have already responded by offering the region food and humanitarian aid to a value of EUR 490 million. This aid initiative is being targeted at those countries hardest hit – namely Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of political decisions and measures taken by the governments in the region, particularly that of Zimbabwe, have further contributed to worsening the already alarming humanitarian situation. We have therefore made it clear that under no circumstances must food aid be used as a political tool and that the recipient countries must ensure that it is distributed fairly and entirely without political considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to express the Presidency’s satisfaction with the course of the summit that we have just had in Copenhagen – the ASEM Summit. It is my impression that everyone from the Asian countries and the European countries were pleased with the summit. In addition to informal talks, concrete initiatives were put on the table which we will now work on further, including youth games staged in Asia. We also want to strengthen links between Europe and Asia; there are great opportunities for cooperation not only in the economic sphere, but also in the political and cultural spheres.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I hand over now to Mr Tassos Yiannitsis I would like to say that I agree with the report’s remarks on the EU’s successful work in the Balkans. The EU has succeeded in bringing a region characterised by dissolution and instability back into the general development of Europe. With the takeover of the UN police mission in Bosnia on 1 January 2003 the EU will make another substantial contribution to promoting stability further in the Balkans.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, it is a very great honour, as deputy Foreign Minister of Greece, to address you today on the aspects of European security and defence policy with military and defence implications. I should particularly like to take this opportunity of thanking the Danish Presidency for the way in which it has cooperated on this novel experiment by the dual presidency, which is no easy task.</p>
<p class="contents">May I start by saying that the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies were especially productive and gave a tremendous fillip to the European security and defence policy and it is befitting for us to acknowledge that from this forum.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a whole series of developments which I should like to mention. The first, and perhaps most important, is the official announcement in Laeken last year that the European Union is now ready to carry out certain operations and is gradually moving towards full operational capability which will allow it to take on even the most demanding of Petersburg-type missions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wanted to mention concerns the development of military capabilities, which are perhaps the most important factor in completing the Union's operational capabilities and which have also made considerable progress. A conference was held on improving capabilities, giving both the Member States and third countries the opportunity to make additional contributions, and the action plan on capabilities was adopted in Laeken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency also pushed on with the application of the plan in question, and I should like to acknowledge that. May I point out that the announcement of partial operational readiness in Laeken is not simply of theoretical value. It says that we have the political will to implement the CFSP mechanism, even if it is still unfinished. What this means in practice is that we have given the go-ahead for specific operations to be undertaken in the Balkans, such as the policing mission in Bosnia and Task Force Fox in the FYROM. The Spanish Presidency also seriously addressed the related matter of equipment and took the relevant initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point concerns the European Union's first exercise, which was conducted during the Spanish Presidency and allowed the procedures planned to be tested and conclusions to be drawn which will be invaluable in improving these procedures in the future. And as part of this procedural operational framework for the defence and security policy mechanism, I should also mention that framework guidelines defining the funding system for military operations, which is again a very important aspect, were adopted in Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has, of course, been done to set up the mechanism for developing capabilities which, in turn, is the basic tool of military administration. Much of the work has already been done and all that remains is to enhance certain points so that the mechanism can be put into action. However, there are a few outstanding questions, such as relations between the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ and the related issue of the involvement of European allies who are not part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the first question is concerned, progress has not been exactly spectacular. Unquestionably, some progress has been made, mainly following discussions within ΝΑΤΟ of individual issues pertaining to relations between the two organisations. However, it is true to say, by way of a general conclusion, that relations between the two organisations need to progress further.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason given for this in certain quarters is the delay in dealing with the outstanding issue of participation. I should like to point out that this is not entirely accurate because, although resolving this issue would certainly make it easier to complete permanent arrangements, the fact that it is outstanding is no reason to delay on individual matters. Here too, progress has been made, as noted in the Seville conclusions, thanks to the efforts of the Spanish Presidency which, working with the General Secretariat and with the help of certain partners actively involved in the overall issue, brokered a compromise proposal before Seville. Unfortunately, this proposal has still not been developed. However, the Presidency and the General Secretariat are continuing in their endeavours, as instructed in Seville.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as relations with third countries are concerned, significant progress was also made in Seville, which adopted arrangements to broaden the provisions made in Nice on the involvement in European defence and security policy of potential partners, such as Canada, Russia and the Ukraine. As far as the European Union's taking over the Task Force Fox operation in the FYROM is concerned, serious preparations have also been made here. However, given that one of the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>for taking over this operation is that permanent arrangements have to be in place between the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ, which there appears to be little likelihood of completing by the end of October, we may have to examine alternatives. Of course, this does not reflect all the progress made on the CFSP over the last year. A great deal of more or less important progress has been made, but there is too little time to describe it all.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European defence enterprise is helping to satisfy the demands of European citizens, which are being voiced even more loudly at the moment, for the European Union to take a strong lead on defence issues. The European Parliament, with its direct links to the citizens of Europe and with its sensitive approach to important issues in the European Union, will, we are sure, help with this new dimension currently being structured in the European Union. We are aware of the fact that, with the CFSP, we are opening up new prospects for the European Union and the cooperation established at the outset is very important. For our part, we shall do our very best during our presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to thank the European Parliament and its president for giving me the opportunity to present the defence aspects of the policy for which Greece has assumed the presidency during the current six-month term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I have been asked to respond to both the Brok and Titley reports and to make a statement on the Middle East as well. I should like to begin with the report by Mr Brok.</p>
<p class="contents">This offers a very good overview of the progress achieved and the new challenges that emerged in 2001/2002. When we met here 11 months ago to discuss the previous CFSP Report, we had just been hit by the terrorist attacks in the United States and the war in Afghanistan. The picture today has changed dramatically. The impact of 11 September on world politics has been immense.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Brok that there are currently four major tasks for our Common Foreign and Security Policy. None of them are easily met: firstly there is our partnership with the United States. The complexity and diversity of this indispensable partnership inevitably generate a certain degree of friction. We stand united against terrorism, we share similar values. But our interpretation of these values is not always identical.</p>
<p class="contents">United States leadership since the war has been based on two pillars, represented perhaps by the work of President Truman and General Marshall: first containment of threat; second the establishment of a global rule book and of global institutions which could encourage democracy, open markets and the rule of law, both on continents and internationally. That approach, which produced so much prosperity and stability for the last half of the last century, is still the right approach today. That is why all Members in this House are united in thinking that the right way of approaching the problem of Iraq is through the means of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In our cooperation with the US, but also more generally, the European Union has shown resolve in the pursuit of this multilateral approach to foreign policy. We strongly believe that multilateral arrangements and conventions, the UN, the G8, the OSCE and others are the key to tackling the security, development and environmental problems which confront the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The structures of ESDP and its relationship with NATO are of particular concern. I am worried that despite almost indefatigable efforts of many, the Berlin-plus issue remains unsettled with consequences, as we know, for our aspirations in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, bilateral relations have continued to expand in the past year with virtually all major countries in the world. Among them, Russia is an increasingly important strategic partner. Today, we have an ambitious, comprehensive, bilateral agenda with Russia, including a structured and intensive dialogue on Common Foreign and Security Policy. This partnership also helps us to address sensitive issues like Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">I broadly agree with Mr Brok's remarks regarding the agenda of our regional policies. The report includes a series of proposals which are welcome, such as the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly, fresh initiatives for our partnerships with Asia and Latin America and support to the New Partnership for Africa's Development in sub-Saharan Africa (NEPAD).</p>
<p class="contents">There are four issues that I would like to touch on in particular. In the Western Balkans we need to ensure that we work together to preserve the integrity of the stabilisation and association process. Those agreements should not be seen as political goodwill signals. It is in no-one’s interest to finalise agreements with countries before the objective criteria for an agreement have been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Iraq, I spoke to the House on this subject earlier this month and said that we must continue to press for full Iraqi compliance with the UN resolutions. The political action on Iraq at present is in New York and that is exactly where it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan is an issue I remain seriously concerned about. The assassination attempt on President Karzai and the bomb in central Kabul earlier this month are just the most recent examples of the fragility of Afghanistan. We must not spare efforts to help the central government extend its authority to the entire country. At the UN, in the margins of the General Assembly, I attended an important meeting of Afghanistan's principal aid donors at which we underlined the importance of delivering as rapidly as possible on our respective pledges.</p>
<p class="contents">The regional agenda, important as it is, must not stop us from thinking ahead. There are long-term strategic issues that we need to keep in sight. There is firstly, for example, the institutional framework for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The architecture of the treaties is complex and our work on CFSP is right at the institutional frontiers. The work of the Convention will soon produce new proposals to improve the present arrangements. I look forward to participating in the discussions of the Dehaene Working Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are preparations for the consequences of enlargement on CFSP and ESDP. Enlargement will have a major impact on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Together with the Danish Presidency, we have started thinking about the consequences of this. We have to make CFSP structures responsive enough to cater for 10 or more new Member States. Through the Wider Europe initiative we will look more closely into how to organise relations, and whenever possible, seek partnership with the 'near abroad' in the East, the South-East and the South.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly I should mention Crisis Management and Conflict Prevention which must become a cross-cutting issue for all CFSP and external relations initiatives. Our work on conflict indicators will be instrumental in gearing diplomatic action and aid programming towards conflict prevention and crisis management. We need to implement the Göteborg programme for the prevention of violent conflict and we need to further strengthen our human rights and democracy promotion policies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many examples of how CFSP yields operational results when we effectively pool national and EU resources, both in the Commission and in the Council. I look forward to working with Parliament on improving our mechanisms for this and in extending full democratic control and accountability to the field of CFSP. But I must say, and I hope it will not be regarded as a revolutionary observation, that however much we discuss improving instruments, however much we discuss institutional architecture, in my judgment on the basis of three years' experience there is no substitute for political will.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let me refer briefly to the admirable report by Mr Titley on the code of conduct on arms exports. That code is politically binding on the Member States, and the Commission has a limited role in this process. We nevertheless welcome progress made in the Council with respect to improving the implementation of the code and enhancing transparency provided through the annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome Parliament's intensive interest in this subject and in particular the constructive and very ambitious stance of Mr Titley’s report which encourages the Council to pursue and improve further its work in this area. We share several of the suggestions presented in the report, such as those referring to arms-brokering activities and the production of military goods under licence, as well as the control of the end user of arms exports. We also welcome the suggestions for all Member States to publish national annual reports for ensuring the maximum involvement of the accession countries in information exchange and denial notification as well as for promoting adherence to the principles of the code by third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has spoken about the Middle East and about the positive atmosphere at our Quartet meeting of 17 September. I am sure Parliament is aware of the huge amount of work the Danish Presidency put into the preparation of this meeting. It was constructive and the meeting served to set the basis for a possible peace plan, as well as for further international support for Palestinian reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately the situation on the ground gives no reason to believe that things will get any better soon. There was a six-week period of calm – calm of a sort, at any rate, even though during that period 50 Palestinians were killed. Then there were the despicable suicide bombings. There was also the bombing of the Palestinian school and so the violence increased again.</p>
<p class="contents">To be fair there were some signs of improvement which have passed largely unacknowledged. We were encouraged by the declaration of Fatah/Tanzim of their intention to stop attacks on Israeli civilians. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres called the Fatah document a 'first dawn of a different season, hopefully' he added, 'spring'. But this new understanding seems to have evaporated and the Palestinian Authority and President Arafat have again become the target of an assault in retaliation for suicide attacks by those who do not believe in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress once again – as I have done on several occasions in this House – that we must continue insisting that the Palestinian Authority does everything possible to stop terrorism. We should exert the utmost pressure on the Palestinian Authority to prevent terror attacks and to bring terrorists to justice. But how does it help the cause of peace to deprive the Palestinian Authority of the power and means to do any of these things? How does it improve security to destroy the Palestinian Authority? How does the isolation and attempted humiliation of President Arafat and the Palestinian Authority contribute to the fight against terror? Or, for that matter, attempts to drive him into exile. No wonder the Secretary-General of the United Nations described Israeli policy this week as bankrupt, as being likely to increase extremism rather than reduce it.</p>
<p class="contents">On a less gloomy note, the Quartet reviewed the Palestinian reform process which seems to be on track in as much as this is possible under the current situation. The reform of financial and budgetary management is continuing with European Union support and under European Union pressure. In this context I welcome – as a positive first step – the decision by Israel to pay USD 45 million in frozen tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority through the same bank account and the same monitoring mechanism which was set up as a result of our support to the Palestinian Authority. I repeat: through the same bank account and using the same monitoring mechanism which was set up as a result of the efforts of the European Commission and the European Union. I hope that the irony of that remark is not lost on some of those who have been criticising the efforts that we have made in order to promote the cause of reform in the Palestinian Authority. And I hope that Israel will immediately release the remaining money.</p>
<p class="contents">A wide sector of Palestinian society regards elections as a crucial part of the reform process. The pressure for elections must be maintained. The events in the Palestinian Legislative Council over the past week and the resignation of the Palestinian Cabinet shows the emergence of a real democratic debate within Palestinian society. This is a very positive sign of parliamentary life. I sincerely hope that a new Palestinian Cabinet dedicated to the reform process is formed soon and that the achievements of the past few months are not destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is ready to provide assistance if there is a minimum guarantee that the elections will be free and fair. Whilst we fully support Palestinian elections and the need for Palestinian people to elect their own leadership, we continue to caution against elections if the legal, administrative and logistic framework for elections, including the political environment, is not in place. And how can those things be in place if there are closures, if there are curfews, if there are tanks in the streets?</p>
<p class="contents">But despite the progress on the reform agenda the humanitarian and economic situation continues to deteriorate.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been recently highlighted by UN envoy Catherine Bertini in her sobering report on the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories: two thirds of the population is under the poverty line and up to half of the population is currently unemployed. The situation must dramatically improve if we are to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. But we must do much more than fighting the symptoms of the crisis. We must address its causes. Providing humanitarian assistance can only be a short-term approach – improving the economy must be our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention here that the European Union's humanitarian work is severely affected by the restriction of movement, not just within the Palestinian Territories but on arrival at the border. This year so far we have had over 20 cases of Israel denying entry to EU humanitarian teams.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Quartet agreed to hold in November a ministerial-level meeting of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee, involving the major donors in the international community. The meeting will review the economic and humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as efforts to support and encourage the reform process in the Palestinian Authority, including the prospects for elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to bring to Parliament’s attention the fact that donors will inevitably be asked to identify the possibilities of additional funding. I should warn Parliament I am likely to come back to Parliament and the Budgetary Authority as a whole on this in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last six months we have made some political progress. The perspectives are much clearer now; and the Palestinians and the donor community are working hard on building institutions and reforming existing structures. But there is a danger of this becoming a sort of virtual politics, while the real situation on the ground goes from bad to worse to appalling. Every day we talk of peace; every day people die – Palestinians, Israelis. How much longer must this go on? How much longer must Israelis and Palestinians live in Gethsemane?</p>

I would like first to extend my very warm thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Titley, for the excellent reports that they have produced.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda, we can talk about that some other time. I would have had no objections to the two rapporteurs presenting their reports, but that was not my decision, nor do I have any reason to question the President's rulings, so that is not a question for me, and I am therefore not going to comment on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive elements of European foreign policy include a topic that we have not yet mentioned at all, that is, the accession of the central European countries to the European Union. That is, indeed, at present still a foreign policy matter, and when these countries join the European Union, it will be a matter for internal affairs. That we will soon – we hope, by the end of year – be concluding negotiations with what are obviously ten European countries, is in fact a great success story. It is one of the great European political successes. Reference has been made to the Balkans, and that is also a positive development. There, the European Union is playing a positive part in the interests of stability, security and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan has been mentioned, and here too Europeans have been active; 13 of the 15 EU States are involved in Afghanistan, whether militarily or in other ways. What is actually astonishing is that, although we – by which I mean the European Union and its Member States – are the greatest donors of funds, this actually goes almost without being noticed. When the Americans donate a million dollars somewhere or other, then the whole world gets to know about it. When we donate a billion euro, I sometimes get the impression that it is the best kept of Europe's state secrets. We have to give some thought to how we can make our public relations work even better.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Iraq, we very much support the American President's efforts to involve the United Nations in this issue, and we call on all Member States of the European Union to take up a common position as Europeans together. We see it as irresponsible for one or more Member States to go their own way. Not only does it do damage to that country's relationship with the United States of America, but it also shows a lack of solidarity with Europeans in the European Union, for we can influence American policy and global politics only if we Europeans act together. We now have to require the Iraqi dictator to open up his country to inspections – the British Government produced an important document on the subject yesterday – and, if these inspections on the ground are not feasible, then it is the Iraqi dictator who, at the end of the day, bears the responsibility if military action has to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I can endorse everything that Commissioner Patten said on the subject of the Middle East. Whilst we remain convinced that the escalation of violence must be halted, and that terrorism by suicide commando must come to an end, Israel's responses are quite disproportionate; the Palestinians, too, have their own dignity. I can, then, only encourage the Council and the Commission to stick to their policy of talking to both sides in reasonable terms. There are others who do not do it in this way, and we have an important part to play, as both sides trust us – one perhaps rather more than the other. We Europeans must cooperate with those whose dignity is being violated. What we are saying, with the utmost clarity, is that Israel has the right to live within secure borders, but the Palestinian people also have the right to live in peace and within secure borders. The representatives of the Palestinian people must also be given opportunities to express their views and suggest sensible ways ahead for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Yiannitsis, the deputy defence minister of Greece, was right to point out that there is as yet no agreement between the European Union and NATO on access to the North Atlantic Alliance's planning facilities and military capabilities. We hope that we will soon be able to come to an arrangement, and also call upon our Turkish partners to contribute towards finding a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by observing that Commissioner Patten referred to the need to improve Europe's foreign, security and defence policy instruments. We hope that the Convention will make important proposals on this, and if the European Union is to be able to act and commit itself as it is in Afghanistan, then effective institutions must be the outward expression of this. Our group will therefore do all in its power to make the Convention a success, for on this will depend to a great extent the European Union's success with its Common Foreign, Security and Defence Policy.</p>

Then I believe we need to discuss the Brok and Titley Reports – and I congratulate both rapporteurs on their work – and the rest of my group will talk about other subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the facts are indisputable and do not currently allow for the cautious optimism you have expressed with regard to the Middle East. Unfortunately, every day we receive the most terrible, bleak news of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We unreservedly condemn the mass suicide attacks against the population. We also condemn the fact that there is a continuous list of deaths every day, but, most of all, I believe we now need to address the Israeli Government – the government presided over by Mr Sharon – which is well aware that the physical and political destruction of the Palestinian Authority and its headquarters will not help either to end the attacks or to put an end to a desire that is unanimous at international level, the creation of the Palestinian State, even more so at a time when things are happening in Palestine which are important for democrats: the threat of a vote of no confidence, the resignation of the government and the announcement of forthcoming general elections. In that context and in that part of the world, this is something that must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, therefore, in keeping with our multilateral focus and our respect for the UN – and let us remember that it was the UN that created the State of Israel by means of a resolution – Israel must be told that it must fulfil each and every one of the UN resolutions, and that no one has the right to choose which resolutions they wish to apply, on the pretext that they are biased. This must clearly be our line of approach, and I therefore wish to express here the support of my group for Resolution No 1435, and to ask for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from within, outside and around Ramallah and the withdrawal of occupying forces from Palestinian cities. That is the way that corresponds to the three-stage plan you mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the statement made by the High Representative and we ask that you take a stronger line with regard to the Quartet so that true changes can take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope Mr Patten will allow me the liberty of asking him to tell us about an important political and budgetary aspect, concerning his reference to Israeli and Community payments into the same account. I ask him to provide Parliament with a detailed report analysing the destruction caused in Palestine territory by the Israeli State and funded by the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The taxpayers, our citizens, have a right to know this and it should be made public.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I would say that you should continue with your work, because it is absolutely necessary and there is no other way of overcoming a situation in which, at any given time, the only question we can ask ourselves is how much blood must be shed for both parties to be able to overcome this kind of tragic escalation.</p>

Simply invoking the United Nations and international law is not enough as a formula to change Washington from a unilateral to a multilateral player. Only if the European Union organises itself more effectively on a political and military plane can it be a worthy Atlantic partner. However, as long as European leaders set greater store by internal political considerations than they do by common foreign policy, our endeavours in this area will be in vain and we will continue to give America all the political leeway it needs to determine its own agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">This particularly applies with regard to Iraq. The European Union must sail a liberal course midway between two Social-Democratic extremes: Mr Schröder, the electoral opportunist, and Mr Blair, President Bush’s London branch manager. The pressure on Saddam Hussein to allow unfettered access to all weapons and to destroy all dangerous weapons must be stepped up to the highest level possible. Needless to say, possible military action cannot be ruled out then. After all, if we continue to allow Saddam Hussein to ignore the UN resolutions, he will become a great danger to his environment and the UN Security Council itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Military action does, of course, require the Security Council’s explicit approval. If the international community joins forces, the Atlantic allies will have to follow suit. Only with Europe’s help can America tackle the problems in the world effectively. Political and cultural differences should not make us blind to Europe’s and America’s common interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the enlarged EU can add more weight globally, decision-making must be adapted and the right to veto must be abolished. It remains crucial, though, for a common foreign policy in Europe to become more important than the political leaders’ own national profile. If that does not change, we only have ourselves to blame for America being able to take global control on its own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are few regions in which a State breaches international law, humanitarian law and United Nations’ resolutions to such a degree and quite so repeatedly, and there is certainly no State associated with the Union which treats Europe in such an off-hand way, destroying Palestinian infrastructures that we have financed, which refuses, first Mr Solana, then Mr Moratinos, the right to visit an occupied Palestinian territory. And there is, above all, no State which treats the appeals that we make to it with such scorn, practically torpedoing the peace efforts on which we are working.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that the President-in-Office of the Council speaks of optimism and sees the main obstacle to peace to be the Palestinians. I cannot comprehend this! You are obviously right to condemn outright the suicide attacks and any act of terrorism against innocent people, in Israel just as in any other country. The Palestinian Authority also condemns them systematically and has often tried to put a stop to them. But what has Mr Sharon done during the last six weeks of relative calm to try to dispel the tension and re-launch the dialogue? The <span class="italic">Ha’aretz</span> newspaper answers for you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in pointing out that 30 Palestinian civilians were killed in August alone and <span class="italic">Yedioth Ahronot</span>, another newspaper, condemned the irresponsible nature of these crimes, although, apparently, the number of terrorist attacks has fallen spectacularly. This is the truth, and it has to be told, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sharon will not bring security and peace to his own people by re-occupying Palestinian towns, setting up yet more colonies, starving the population and destroying everything that can keep the hope of a State alive, particularly the hope of Palestinian Authority, and this is something being pointed out by many dignified and courageous people in Israel itself.</p>
<p class="contents">What credibility can the Elsinore peace plan that you mentioned have, if you gloss over the root causes of the Middle East tragedy? What sort of tragedy might this reckless headlong pursuit of the strategy of force lead to, if all those who have some authority do not use all their influence to stop Ariel Sharon? You did not even demand an end to the siege of President Arafat or the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Does it not bother you that your position is a considerable distance from Commissioner Patten’s, for example? Europe must live up to the world’s expectations of it. Today, you unfortunately fell far short of them.</p>

<p class="contents">Regarding the Middle East, we are in a global situation in which there has just been a new development, which is not yet reflected in either the Brok or Titley Report. The US Administration is putting forward a new strategy for re-organising the world. As part of this new strategy, the US Administration is telling us that there are situations in which we must intervene and take preventative action. This is its first argument. Its second argument is if the United Nations supports this action, all well and good; if it is against this action, it does not matter, we shall take action with the support of our friends.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the European Union to draft a memorandum in response to this new situation. I do not want the response from Mr Schröder, from Mr Blair or Mr Chirac, or from Mr Anyone. I want a response from Europe regarding a situation which completely changes the last 50 years of history.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last 50 years, we have attempted to put in place a global justice system and global rules by means of global institutions such as the UN. It is clear that, in a region such as the Middle East, there are two states, two entities that do not respect the decisions of the UN. Israel does not respect the decisions of the UN, it is true, but there are those within the Palestinian Movement who do not respect them either. I therefore fully agree with the condemnation of Israel, of the Israeli policy, but I do not agree with the way the Palestinians condemn the attacks, which is purely verbal. This is one of the problems: we are faced with two sides who do not respect what the United Nations or the political forces decide. Yet the two nations concerned need political forces which respect what global law asks of them. Both sides need political leaders which respects what is asked.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that we in Europe – unlike the US – shall only make progress in the Middle East if we show the same empathy, the same sympathy for the Israelis as we show the Palestinians, only if we feel the same way for the Israelis as we do the Palestinians. If someone, a political force, decides to support one side rather than the other, we shall have lost, because it will be impossible to go forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the role of the European Union is so important. The Union is the only political entity which is capable today of making each side see reason and of helping, at the same time, both the Israelis and the Palestinians. It is this policy that Europe must pursue; but above all, Europe must condemn Ariel Sharon when he blockades Yasser Arafat and condemn the Palestinians when they hide behind terrorists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That peace has been shattered by renewed acts of terror intended to wreck the peace process. Once again suicide bombers attacked in Israel. More families have been bereaved and more victims have been added to the tragic pages of the Middle East conflict. Then came the deployment of Israeli tanks in Ramallah and in the north of the Gaza Strip. Palestinian children were targeted in their schoolyard in Hebron.</p>
<p class="contents">Both sides must show their commitment to peace by acting with maximum restraint, as called for by the EU Presidency in its recent declaration. Force cannot defeat force, but peace can be built on peace. The siege of the Palestinian Presidency compound is counterproductive. Restricting the freedom of movement of the Palestinian leadership does not contribute to fighting terror. It is hard to see how it will lead to a reform of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">For far too long the Palestinian people have been denied their legitimate rights. Their ability to survive is constantly undermined. They are stalked by poverty. Without jobs and essential services they are forced to live in appalling conditions. The people of Israel also live in a situation of insecurity. Attack and counter-attack are leading nowhere. The parties must move forward. The security issues must be addressed, but not at the expense of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is committed to working closely with the UN, the US and Russia in seeking ways to encourage and assist the parties involved to end the conflict and move towards a permanent peace. The conflict must end. The way to move forward is through cooperation and dialogue, and permanent peace must be established. This must be our resolve. The longer the conflict continues, the more it becomes a source of regional instability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This belief is put forward, in the report that is, with the call for the communitarisation of the CFSP, which was also quite rightly criticised last August by the French President, but which constantly comes back to and which is based on this – I repeat, surreal – idea, of the pre-existence of an interest and, therefore, of a common foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, reality, from one crisis to the next, continually challenges this belief. The crises in the Balkans, firstly in Bosnia and then, more recently, in Kosovo, in the meantime, the crises in the Great Lakes region, the various phases of the crises in the Middle East, have shown us that the European Union has never ever succeeded in taking an initiative and in playing a role other than that of the stooge, of the United States, obviously. We can only respond to the initiatives taken by others, on other sides of the Atlantic, and, the worst thing, which is, in a way, the most delightful thing for those who know what Europe is really made of, namely of independent nations, is that in several crises, particularly in the current crisis in Iraq, there are - poor old Europe, it is still in disarray - stark differences between London and Berlin, and Paris as well, and these are, to a certain extent, patently obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should perhaps reflect sooner or later on the very way the CFSP is put into practice, because we are verging on a degree of absurdity, by constantly repeating that we will do better next time and that, from one report to the next, we will be able to define a common foreign policy. This is still a figment of our imagination and will remain so. I think that, sooner or later, we should reflect on just how possible this common foreign policy actually is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will not, however, be an easy matter. When the USA – at a time when Bill Clinton was still President – and England bombed Baghdad shortly before Christmas 1999 without a UN mandate, I wrote a comment piece in an Austrian newspaper, <span class="italic">Der Standard</span>, the key point in which was that this bombardment, denounced by France, Italy, and Russia, and which drew a sharp protest note from the Vatican, had resulted in a fine crack running across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I leave it to you to judge whether this chasm has widened or become narrower in the meantime. I would also ask you to consider whether substantial European interests would be affected by an attack on Iraq or even on Iran, which is sought by certain hawks in the US administration who aim to topple the regimes in Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in any case to be welcomed that the EU's Foreign Ministers, at the informal Council meeting in Elsinore expressed their opposition to military intervention in Iraq. This awakens hope that the current geopolitical tendency, led by the USA, of resorting to force rather than having recourse to international law, will not be endorsed in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an area of stability, democracy and prosperity, which will be extended by the enlargement of the European Union. I consider this a crucial justification for a specifically European policy of making further progress in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to use it to build bridges to those parts of our continent that even now are not able or due to join the European Union, as well as with those who do not want to. Relations with Russia are, for example, made crucially important by the enlargement of the European Union; a positive interaction must come into being, and we must not set up new boundaries, but rather these boundaries must be turned into bridges. Commissioner Patten, what the Commission has now proposed in connection with Kaliningrad strikes me as a step in the right direction when it comes to finding a starting point that takes into account small countries' interests, their sensitivities and their claims to sovereignty, and also enables them to implement Schengen whilst at the same time accepting that Russia has a certain interest in the matter. I hope that these negotiations lead to a constructive result that incorporates both points of view. I know that the Danish Council Presidency has a particular interest in this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also on the right track in other areas, for example in the Barcelona process. We are proud that we are able to say that we spend three times as much of our budget on preventive action in the area of external policy than does the United States of America. We should also have something to say about the positive elements. But – and this is the big ‘but’ – Europe still lacks a voice when it comes to the real issues of war and peace. The significance of what has happened over recent weeks in connection with Iraq, whether it be the uncritical tagging along behind Washington, whether it be an uncritical rejection of its demands for electoral reasons, is that there is no common European position. Yet it is only together that we can exert the pressure that is needed to keep the dictator's hands away from weapons of mass destruction, and, on the other hand, to be able to enforce a process of consultation with the United States of America, one that will give consideration not only to the risks of a military intervention but also to all the options for a peaceful solution to the problem of how to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein has in his possession, and does so in tandem with the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In neither of these directions have we demonstrated our capacity to give our citizens security, and we have known since 11 September that security is no longer clearly bounded by certain frontiers, but that it is also possible for a mere handful of terrorists to be operating with dangerous weapons in the midst of our own countries and to be capable of killing people in their thousands.</p>
<p class="contents">This has to do with the fact that most people in our Member States have not yet grasped that the small size and weakness of our Member States means that national interests can only be safeguarded if we pool our capacities. What is needed is for us to really grasp that and also get it through to our citizens – or rather, it is the citizens that will get it across to the governments, as 70% of the public in the European Union favour a European Security and Defence Policy! Only in the foreign ministries of our countries is that not yet understood!</p>
<p class="contents">It also ties in with military capabilities. That the 60 000-strong rapid reaction force will be set up on paper by next year, is something of which I am certain, but will it be at all effective, being blind and lame for lack of any logistics capability or satellite facilities? Is it truly operational and capable of making a contribution to a secure peace? Are we in a position to devise an arms policy that will make us independent and give us the technological capabilities that are also of great importance for competitiveness in non-military spheres? Mr Titley's report will go into this in greater depth. Have we sorted out the problems we had with Operation Amber Fox and Macedonia? Do we have rules to prevent the European Union and Turkey from being at loggerheads? All this shows that national posturing and egoism have prevented us from making really decisive progress in matters of war and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe that much of the good that was said in the aftermath of 11 September is now forgotten and was locked away in governments' desk drawers not long after it saw the light of day. Let us take, for example, the issue of external and internal security. Let us just retrieve the great speeches our Heads of State or Government delivered after 11 September, and let us see how much was put into practice. If we do, we will see this for the low point that it is. I believe that our projects will only succeed insofar as we fashion a vessel in which a common European will can develop in the area of foreign, security and defence policy. That is what makes the Convention so very important. We have to bring about a reform of the institutions, one in which Europe speaks with one voice, with a voice, moreover, that is subject to Parliamentary control, and whose Budget is subject to Parliamentary control, in other words, with a voice originating from the Commission, although any such external affairs commissioner should of course be legitimised by having a special link with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of dual structures, which is currently being talked up so much, has, however, nothing to do with the people involved at the top, who do outstanding work. It costs money, and 80% of its energy is expended on infighting instead of being used to develop European positions in external affairs. That is only human nature, but I do think it is something we should overcome. We are shortly to have twenty-five Member States, and then that really will not work any more! What this shows is that, when it comes to these issues, the European Union must at last come to realise where its interests lie. I believe that the public have moved on from what we are doing politically, and so we in this Parliament should pursue this campaign rigorously. It is the governments of the Member States that are enfeebling Europe, while we should be restoring her strength!</p>

When we are discussing the Code of Conduct, I think we have to set it in a very clear context. We should begin by recognising that the Code of Conduct is the most comprehensive international arms export control regime in existence. Nowhere else is there such a sharing of information about arms transfers. We must also recognise just how far we have come. We were told at one time that a Code of Conduct was not possible. Then, that if we had it, it would be no more than a statement of intention. Then, that any annual report would not be published. And then that the Parliament would never be consulted on such an annual report. All these things have come to pass, and we see that the Code, in operation, has developed its own in-built dynamics. So, it is actually taking Member States further than they initially wanted to go when they started off rather suspiciously with a Code of Conduct. We should recognise that and set all our criticisms in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of the Code is leading Member States towards greater dialogue, mutual understanding and greater convergence. What is fascinating for me is that the annual reports show that we are making progress on the very issues which the European Parliament has raised. We have often called for action to be taken on arms brokering, and we believe that it has been a fundamental weakness of the Code of Conduct that it has not addressed this issue. Therefore, we are very pleased that the third Annual Report states that guidelines for controlling arms brokers have been agreed in Council, that Member States should be looking to register arms brokers, and that these legal controls should be supported by penalties. We welcome that. However, the report does not say when this is all going to happen. We need a timetable for progress, so that all Member States take action in relation to arms brokers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have called for greater transparency, both at national and European level, we recognise that some of the problem of lack of transparency is created by different Member States collecting information in different ways. We welcome, therefore, the improvements in the third Annual Report, but we are still having problems in relation to data collection and reporting. We look to the Danish Presidency, given its Nordic enthusiasm for transparency, to make progress in this area, during its time in office.</p>
<p class="contents">At a national level, we welcome the fact that the third Annual Report has set out a matrix, seeking to note where information converges and where it does not. We would hope that that information is not used to reduce the information to the lowest common denominator; we should be working on best practice in this field. Under the Code of Conduct, Member States who grant a licence for an essentially identical transaction previously denied by another Member State should consult that Member State. We have never been clear about what 'identical transaction' means, so we welcome the third Annual Report's statement that 'there will be a broad interpretation of that phrase' – but we are still not clear what it means. Until we are clear what it means, there will be considerable uncertainty about the 'no undercutting' clause. I think we should be asking whether these transactions have an identical consequence. If that is the case, then they are an identical transaction; and we would be intrigued to know if consultation did in fact take place on the recent saga over Belgian exports to Nepal.</p>
<p class="contents">We have asked in any case that these discussions should not be bilateral but multilateral. Therefore, we welcome indications that there will be multilateral discussions in cases where there is no agreement about whether a licence should be given. We would hope that will be expanded, although we recognise the difficulties it presents. We have also asked for greater efforts to be made on end-user certification, so we welcome the fact that the COARM working party is working towards this. We would like to see a Europe-wide database established in order to assist smaller countries, who find end-user certification and follow-up particularly onerous.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also asked for action to be taken on licensed production abroad; and here again we welcome the fact that there is progress on this in the third Annual Report. What we would like to see, however, is clarification on the terms of the Code of Conduct with regard to the export of arms into areas of instability. To what extent – particularly given areas of obvious instability, such as India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or the situation in the Middle East – are Member States interpreting that?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that the third Annual Report is a huge step forward, but on closer inspection, much of it is about words and intentions rather than actions. My conclusion is this: we have come a long way, a lot has been done, but a lot more still needs to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Heads of State or Government of the time set themselves ambitious objectives, and the early months made it possible to assume that these objectives would be achieved relatively speedily and within the time limits envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at matters today, when the deadline is fast approaching, we can see that we are far from achieving these objectives. The current proposal that NATO should deploy and build up a crisis intervention force makes it clear that our American friends have also lost confidence that we Europeans can actually reach the decisions that are required. This should prompt us to make new attempts along these lines, as this European crisis intervention force is, as I see it, an essential step towards securing peace around the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, I would like to thank Mr Titley for his excellent report. We have common rules on arms exports, we have a common code and a code of conduct, but these rules are interpreted in different ways. We have just seen an export to one Member State prohibited, whilst the same goods were then allowed to be exported to another. This must not be allowed to happen in future; whilst we need common rules, the way in which they are applied must also be common to all. It will probably turn out that any code of conduct will be insufficient, and these rules will also have to be put on a legal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">When talking about arms exports, we are on the way to a common market in the defence field as well. That is why I consider it important, if we are talking about shipping armaments within the European Union and the export rules unfortunately cease to be applied, for these shipments to be made easier. All 15 EU countries, after all, form a community of values composed of democratic states, and this leads me to believe that such a thing is possible, as are substantial savings, estimated by experts at EUR 240 billion per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by pointing out how important democratic control is in this area. I would therefore like there to be even greater attention paid to this debate. If not only foreign policy, but also defence policy, are under discussion, then the matter at issue is war and peace, about which democratically elected parliaments alone can decide. At present, this burden rests primarily on the shoulders of our counterparts in the national parliaments, but, the more this European policy develops, the more this Parliament will also have to take upon itself this crucial task.</p>

He has once again used disproportionate force.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Palestinian suicide attacks are despicable – we all know that – but what did Mr Sharon do during the periods in which there were no attacks? Let us remember his requirement in June 2001 that seven days should pass without violence before he would make any political concessions. In December 2001, there were three weeks of peace; in 2002, six weeks. Did Mr Sharon make the slightest political gesture? No, but during those six weeks of peace the <span class="italic">Tsahal</span> killed dozens of Palestinians. I ask the Council, here and now, is this not a bad sign?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sharon carried out military attacks at key moments with the intention of invalidating periods in which there were no suicide attacks. The last time, when all the Palestinian groups, under pressure from Mr Arafat, were considering the possibility of putting an end to suicide attacks against civilians in Israel, Mr Sharon’s political response was to bomb an entire building in the Gaza strip, killing dozens of people, including eleven children.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sharon – let us be clear about this – has never made, nor will he ever make, any political concessions, except those imposed upon him, because he is not interested in peace. Mr Sharon is interested in pacification, humiliation, the capitulation of the Palestinians, but not in a genuine, fair peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation, Mr President, is extremely serious with regard to Mr Arafat’s physical safety, the Palestine identity, which has been crushed by Israel – and more specifically by Mr Sharon – and the area, because Mr Sharon will continue on the warpath until there is an invasion of Iraq, unilaterally decided on by the United States, at which point Mr Sharon will take advantage of the situation to definitively destroy any remaining fragment of the Oslo process, of the 'peace of the brave'.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the EU continue to limit itself to expressing its deep concern over what is going on?</p>

There has certainly been progress, but there remains much to be done, exactly as the rapporteur states. Foreign policy is one of the most important areas in which we really need strong European cooperation. Only through consistent action and a unanimous voice can the EU play a role in the international arena.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Liberals, it is important that foreign policy be based on a clear strategy, characterised by the defence of democracy and human rights, respect for international conventions, free trade, conflict management and cooperation with other nations and organisations. We must be clear in our demands and values. If the famous human rights clause is to have any credibility, it is important to find tools that enable it to be applied. If we do not activate the human rights clause, despite the dreadful attacks made against human rights in the countries we are in partnership with, the clause will only arouse derision.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Liberals, scrutiny of foreign policy is also important. Elected representatives and the public must be able as far as possible to follow and control what happens. Of course there are exceptions, but my group is not completely happy with the agreement that has been reached with regard to access to foreign documents.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many good things to say about Mr Brok’s report. My group also fully supports Mr Titley’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say in conclusion that we certainly disagree with the US administration on many points, and we have often criticised it in this Chamber. The anti-Americanism that sometimes emanates from here does, however, ring somewhat hollow when it is used solely as an excuse for concealing our own failure to produce a clear, common policy on matters such as Iraq and the Middle East issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, however, believe that there is a middle way between killing and dying, which we must take. I am not making a philosophical statement: this must be our political strategy, a strategy of living. However, in reality, George Bush’s decision to use war as a deterrent<span class="bold"> </span>takes us back to the <span class="italic">Pax Romana</span>: they called it peace and turned it into a desert. After 1945, we Europeans said ‘No more war, ever’. This is the strategy we must pursue, a strategy of dignity, for our dignity is also diminished by dishonesty such as that we are currently displaying. Of course, Saddam Hussein must be made to change, but his people must change too. We must promote democracy in Iraq, we must ensure that the UN resolutions are complied with, but we also have to ensure compliance with the UN resolutions by Israel as well as by Saddam Hussein, and Israel has failed to comply with hundreds of declarations and resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten asked when death and suffering for Palestinians and Israelis will come to an end. Yes, when will it end? I believe it will not end until we stop producing statements like those made by the President-in-Office of the Council today. As long as we continue along this path, Palestinians and Israelis will endure death and suffering for, as everyone is aware, Ariel Sharon’s policy is a criminal policy which is destroying both his own and the Palestinian people. Yet it is not just the violence and cruelty which concern me, it is the political decision to colonise a country. Indeed, in recent days, while all our eyes have been fixed on the siege of the Muqata,<span class="bold"> </span>Ariel Sharon has been appropriating land at Rafah and,<span class="bold"> </span>at Kalandria,<span class="bold"> </span>the airport has been reopened as an Israeli airport. What we are witnessing here is a colonial war.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my genuine belief that, in the interests of peace, it is essential that we follow the example of the Israelis and Palestinians who are stating clearly that it is military occupation that is responsible for the situation. On no account can we continue as we have been doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am truly appalled and saddened, for we are all, myself included, responsible for what is happening in the Middle East and for the continuing deaths in the region.</p>

I will have to keep a check on myself, although I should like to say that many of the cries from the heart pull on my heart strings. Although we are all agreed on peace, we sometimes question the methods and we sometimes doubt the ways in which peace is reached, and, above all, we do not want to accept the consequences. After all, we do not have a Common Foreign and Security Policy, and we need this in the first pillar with input from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on Mr Titley’s excellent report concerning the arms trade. In his explanatory statement, Mr Titley identified the bottlenecks that are still troubling us at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, above all, like to focus on the bottleneck caused by failure to implement various regulations, the first one being the Code of Conduct. Although it is in place, it is not enforceable, not at European level or in our countries. Various countries are yet to incorporate this Code of Conduct in their own legislation and add the necessary penal provisions. I should particularly like to point out that even a country such as Belgium, which incorporates this Code of Conduct in a law – and this law is being praised here – violates this law on a daily basis. Belgium supplies weapons to countries such as Nepal, while Germany, for example, had refused to do so. This is in contravention of the Code of Conduct. I should like to point out that Belgium supplies weapons to Pakistan, India, and a raft of these so-called sensitive countries. And this brings us to the point which Mr Titley flagged. The sensitive countries are the most delicate ones, but they are also the best customers ...</p>

Less than an hour’s flight away from my native Sicily, the tragedy of two peoples with which we share friendship, history, culture and trade is continuing along its inexorable course. President Arafat is still enclosed in his headquarters, which have been reduced to a miserable cement hut, deprived of freedom of movement. Islamic terrorists continue to stain the cities of Israel with blood, striking at the civilian people without discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree in Europe on the need to create two free, sovereign states, and we all agree that this is the only way to restore peace in the Holy Land. How much credibility can Europe claim, though? My countrymen ask me: ‘How much credibility can you expect to have, as Members of the European Parliament, how can you expect us to become genuine supporters of Europe if Europe continues to sit still, defenceless, in the face of genocide which is taking place only a few miles away from us? How can you fail to convene a major international conference involving the European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations, as called for by the High Representative for CFSP, to discuss the Palestinian question and the creation of two States?’</p>
<p class="contents">If economic measures are not matched by political, diplomatic action, the European Union will not succeed in freeing the two peoples from the tyranny of hatred.

<p class="contents">We think that the progress made thus far to bring about the coexistence of two States should have aroused greater interest, but we fear that this plan will not be applied any better than previous ones, because it lacks a specific point of departure. In order to get the process off the ground, so that the Israeli army withdraws from the occupied territories, we also need the suicide attacks, which bring the whole process to a standstill, to stop once and for all.

It is clear that this policy does not contribute either to reducing terrorist activity – but rather, on the contrary, stimulates and increases it – or to democratising the Palestinian National Authority, which had been planning legislative and presidential elections for January next year, nor does it contribute to finding safety valves to put an end to the damaging situation that this region is currently experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe we must ask the President-in-Office of the Council to request, clearly and convincingly, a resolution to this situation. This resolution must necessarily involve the lifting of the siege of the President of the Palestinian National Authority and compliance with the United Nations resolutions. The European Union, Mr President, must demand, clearly and convincingly, that the United Nations resolutions be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a truce allowing the Palestinian National Authority to control terrorist activity is also essential. It is ludicrous to say that the President of the Palestinian National Authority should control Palestinian terrorist activity when at the moment he is fighting just to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it absolutely essential to establish a series of measures aimed at ending Israeli military oppression, which is causing countless casualties, most of whom are civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, Mr President, that only on the basis of these premises will the initiatives of the Quartet, a peace conference for the region and the European Union’s desire for peace, understanding, concord and reconciliation prevail in the region.</p>

These reports quite rightly emphasise the progress made since last year in the area of the CFSP and in that of the ESDP. We have made progress, for example, by establishing the ESDP bodies, in the fight against terrorism and conflict prevention. I am thinking of the Balkans and of how specific crises have been managed.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this progress, however, it must be noted that things have not been going too well just lately. Europe’s voice often cannot be heard. Several speakers have told you this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. Here are some examples: the European Union played no part in the military action in Afghanistan, although the Member States participated. In civilian matters, the Union once again provided substantial humanitarian and material aid, but its political role remained very low-key. In Iraq, in response to US intentions, the Union did, to its credit, reiterate the role that the United Nations should play. But what can the High Representative do, when confronted with the conflicting positions of the members of the Council of Ministers?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are you, personally, doing today, on behalf of the European Union? You have proposed absolutely nothing! And what has our wonderful Mediterranean policy achieved, not only in the Middle East, but in Maghreb and the Mashreq countries? The European Parliament is not the place where we will answer the question ‘what can be done?’</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would simply like to make one comment: the CFSP and the ESDP are intergovernmental policies. Once again, this method is showing its limitations. If our governments continue to disagree or choose silence or inaction, if, therefore, the Union has no genuine foreign policy or any genuine security policy, then we must change method and perhaps use the Community method instead. The answer lies primarily in the hands of the ministers. But as you said, Commissioner, nothing is a substitute for political will.</p>

The need for this code became apparent recently in my country, Belgium, where a minister resigned over an arms delivery to Nepal. Incidentally, I should like to note my regret at the fact that a number of Green MEPs have seized on this report for internal political purposes and I am surprised, Mr Staes, at their tabling amendments in which they condemn a decision made by the Belgian Government, while their Green colleagues endorsed this very decision in government.</p>
<p class="contents">However, far more fundamental is that the Belgian Government has announced its willingness to include the provisions of the Code of Conduct in national legislation, as a result of which this code will become legally binding. I hope that other Member States will follow this example. In this way, we can prevent arms orders refused by one country from being accepted by another country. Moreover, Mr Titley is right in quoting existing Belgian law on arms trading as an example. This law indeed provides for tough sanctions on those who trade in weapons without a licence.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, however, does not only lie in the country of origin. It becomes a serious issue when the arms reach their final destination. A well-known Brussels research centre announced this week that half of all weapons transactions fail to meet the legal obligation of the arrival certificate. Consequently, there is an urgent need for an effective inspection system to monitor final destinations. It is of crucial importance to know in whose hands the weapons eventually end up. Otherwise, the European Code of Conduct, no matter how well intended, is completely futile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have a number of problems with Mr Brok’s report. In my opinion it contains a fantastic amount of useful and important things, but the emphasis is wrong. Far too much weight has been placed on military security policy, while civil and economic security policy is left in the shadows. I consider that to be getting your priorities wrong, because in fact it is precisely this area in which the EU has a unique opportunity and some unique resources. You could say that the arena is now entirely open for us in this area. The USA is unilaterally prioritising military security policy. It is our strength to move into this field. We must use our trade agreements, our many contacts, etc. in the fight for peace, human rights and democracy. Unfortunately my own country has helped to prevent some of these opportunities, for example by not wishing to be part of renegotiating the Association Agreement with Israel. It is the Association Agreement that Israel is violating time after time. Finally, with regard to Iraq: what is the evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction? I have now studied the flood of reports that have come in. I have read them in detail. The most powerful intelligence services in the world have worked towards this as their sole aim. There is not a shred of evidence. Why is that? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first point relates to paragraph 20 in Mr Brok's resolution, which states that if the EU wishes to be credible, a further effort in the defence budget of certain Member States will be needed. This represents a serious misconception and analytical error. Total expenditure of all EU countries in the area of defence and security amounts to 50% of that of the United States. The options created as a result only amount to 10%. This means that it is of vital importance for cooperation and efficiency to be improved. In other words, the EU can do a lot more with the same money. This is why my group is completely convinced that an increase in defence expenditure is unnecessary, completely unfeasible in financial terms and wholly undesirable from a political perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the remark by Mr Yiannitsis, chairman of the Council for security, not, of course, to be confused with the Security Council. Unfortunately, you have had to repeat here what many of your predecessors have said before you, namely that no compromise has as yet been reached on the EU's use of NATO funds. This can only mean one of three things: either Greece is still being obstructive, and Turkey is outdoing it in obstructiveness, or they are both still being obstructive. I beg you, Mr Yiannitsis, spare us all a disappointment in this respect. The need for joint EU action has never been so great and, as you said yourself, support among the people has never been so great. I urge you to excel yourself for once. Show us that Greece, and this also goes for Turkey, is not a prisoner of the past. You, Greece, can do the EU a great service, but you can also do it a disservice. The choice is yours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I prefer to retain a national foreign policy and work through NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events over Iraq have questioned the viability of the CFSP. Nevertheless, I engage constructively with the EU reality, and I recognise the positive role Javier Solana has played, through the Quartet in the Middle East, in promoting long-term peace between Israel and Palestine. I also particularly support the role of Russia as our strategic partner. Nevertheless, I support the High Representative's role as an intergovernmental envoy and do not want these vital areas made Community-based. Furthermore, I support US aims to rid the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">I was responsible for the amendment raising the serious issue of organised crime in the Balkans. A great advantage of EU enlargement in the long run is the inclusion of a country such as, for example, Ukraine, whose aspirations to join the EU the Commission is, sadly, ignoring. Enlargement will bind these countries to the West, encourage economic prosperity and make a much more coordinated fight against crime and illegal immigration possible when organisations such as Europol have a formal mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of my interests is India, which is clearly amongst several potential great powers that are in the midst of internal transition. With economic liberalisation, India offers a growing market for EU businesses. A multicultural secular democracy in an otherwise troubled region, it is a source of stability with a no-first-use nuclear policy. It is a bulwark against the rise of extremism, in particular regional Islamist tendencies such as those evidenced by recent attacks on Christian and western targets in Pakistan. These demonstrate an unchecked rise of religious fanaticism in that country, despite President Musharraf's rhetoric. Tragically, only yesterday 34 Hindus were killed by an Islamic terrorist bomb attack on a Hindu temple in Gujarat.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not share all the Brok report's objectives, but I remain an interested observer of this revolutionary change from the city state of some 2 000 years ago, to the 19th-century nation-state, and to the EU Member State that we are witnessing today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Schröder had the courage to say clearly and directly to President Bush what the vast majority of citizens is thinking. His ‘no’ marks Europe’s emancipation from the Pentagon’s imperialist tendencies. This preventative and solitary war would have been unjust, because, without the authorisation of the United Nations Security Council, it would have caused political difficulties and severe economic setbacks in Europe, it would have alienated the Arab world, it would not have been in the interest of Israel either, as this war would have converted Israel into a fortress perpetually under siege.</p>
<p class="contents">The most affected, however, would have been the Palestinian people, who are today surrounded, trapped and starving in their vast open-air prison. According to the findings of the Luxembourg Committee for a Just Peace in the Middle East, this war would have exposed the Palestinians to serious dangers. The best case scenario would have been an acute increase in repression; the worst case scenario, which would fulfil Mr Sharon’s ambitions, would be the wholesale movement of populations, the colonisation of the occupied territories and the straightforward annexation of these people by Israel. The preparations for repression were already so far advanced that Mr Sharon sent in the bulldozers, even in the absence of an attack on Iraq. All that the world had to do would have been to turn a blind eye.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in a few months, the UN inspectors will tell us whether Iraq really does have military weaponry. There will still be time then, and I am speaking to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to implement, in its entirety, Security Council Resolution 687(91) which emphasises that the disarmament of Iraq is part of an initiative whose goal is to establish in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles. The new world order, proclaimed after the Gulf War by President Bush Snr, has quickly been forgotten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Stopping the supply of weapons and the granting of licences is well known to be among the most effective methods of preventing conflict, and this is, incidentally, true also of the Middle East. Many things are actually less surprising when one looks at the figures that show how much was supplied to the Middle East last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the bringing of conflict prevention to the fore is part of the European Union's purpose – for it is cheaper than ending military conflicts later on – people are still cheerfully exporting to conflict regions. The Belgians are supplying firearms to Nepal, where civil war is raging, Great Britain's supply of radar screens for fighter aircraft contravenes Criterion 3 of the Code, while Sweden, France, and Great Britain are contravening its Operative Provision 4 by supplying heavy munitions to India without facing the consequences. It is precisely in this area that the Code is weak, as it is not binding and makes no provision for sanctions against those who supply weapons to conflict regions all the same.</p>
<p class="contents">It must not surprise us if taxpayers complain that this European Union of ours gives out, on the one hand, development aid to these countries, which, on the other, are then destroyed by their own munitions. It is for this reason that the Code of Conduct has to be applied in such a way as to really stop the supply of weapons to crisis regions. That must be our objective!</p>

It is to bring about the disarmament of Saddam Hussein's regime so that he is no longer a threat to us or indeed to his regional neighbours. We should have acted earlier. 11 September has now given us a heightened sensitivity to potential threats. If we let Saddam carry on in the way that he is, then what message does this send to others of malign intent?</p>
<p class="contents">My criticism of the British Government is that it has left it far too late to fight the battle for public opinion and that its effort to build a coalition of political support among the Europeans has clearly been poor. The example of Iraq exposes yet again the frailty of common security policy in the European Union and not surprisingly it confirms a widely differing outlook in interests of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Poos, I do not see Mr Schröder as my spokesman. Some Members of this House have a reflex anti-Americanism. Instead, I had hoped that they would all be motivated by the need to enhance western security in a dangerous world. This requires strong and unassailable partnership with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brok report reveals a different set of motives. It is all about empowering the European Union and boosting the role of the European Commission in particular. I disagree with this. It has nothing to do with enhancing the security of our citizens. Yesterday in Warsaw NATO Foreign Ministers welcomed proposals for a NATO military response force. 20 000 troops will be used for short-term, high-intensity combat operations. This would complement other NATO reaction forces already in existence and be a real incentive for NATO allies other than just the Americans and British to provide a small number of highly-trained and well-equipped forces ready to take on urgent tasks on a global basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The European countries should forget the distractions of the European rapid reaction force separate from NATO and concentrate instead on improving military capabilities for alliance operations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He would also observe that, basically, European policy in both areas of tension is conspicuous by its absence. Does that mean we have no profile? If we look at other areas of the world, we have a very high profile. However, they all have one thing in common. Where we have intervened in crises, we have not intervened either to create a crisis or to resolve it, we have intervened merely in order to manage it.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, in the Middle East, the only time when progress was made, in the agreement between Arafat and assassinated Prime Minister Rabin, the European Union was involved. So what does that prove? That the third pillar of the European Union needs more work to build it up. It needs a stratagem defined in terms of a number of general principles on which we all agree.</p>
<p class="contents">What are these general principles? First, respect for the European political culture. Secondly, respect for international law. Thirdly, a balance in relations between the centres of power on the world map. Fourthly, a perception of the fact that a common defence and security policy requires certain minimum policies in other sectors. For example, I should like to ask the Commissioner, what happens next with Galileo? What happens next with the European Union's famous common aircraft carrier, despite the fact that it is nothing to do with the European Union? Having said which, I think that important progress has been made but that more needs to be done, because a Common Foreign and Security Policy forms an integral part of economic development and peace and every other kind of development. I think that the Brok Report provides a fairly relaxed framework for a military perception and we shall slowly have to set it on a firmer basis, with a clear direction and with the objective of international peace, security and cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following his pacific speech, I would ask him, during the vote, to be guided by his conscience rather than by the Flemish Liberal Democrat party whip. I fully endorse Mr Titley's remark about the absolute need for multilateral discussion once one Member State has refused a licence. In this respect, I would recommend approval of Amendments Nos 1 and 7, which make undercutting more difficult. It is said, with good reason, that the code of conduct must become absolutely binding. This is the gist of our Amendments Nos 2 and 8. Further to the Nepal crisis, the Belgian Government will at long last include the code of conduct in national legislation. Could I invite the other fourteen governments finally to follow this Belgian example? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fear that today defence is too serious a business to be left to politicians. It is my fear that in an understandable but misguided wish for the European Union to have its own defence capability, politicians are forging ahead with plans that are at best wishful thinking, and at worst dangerous. If the plan is to mirror the position of the EMU in relationship to the EU, then I foresee that the ESDP is going to inhibit NATO from functioning efficiently and properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read Mr Brok's report, and while there is much in it – especially in the original draft – that I find interesting, I fear its proposals will create more problems than they solve. Let us be honest, Europe's armed forces have a woefully depleted capability. Europe's national governments have no coherence or agreement when it comes to military operations. None of the experience and sophistication that has been so painstakingly and carefully developed by NATO on both the political and operational fronts is apparent in any of these proposals. Without an increase in defence spending that would be unacceptable to our electors, Europe's armed forces cannot mount and maintain any major operation outside the immediate area.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody can deny that NATO's record is what we should be seeking to protect, not to undermine. It is time that Prime Minister Blair stopped dallying with other concepts. He should make it clear that Britain and the other European states that are NATO members have a future only within NATO. Defence policy is literally a matter of life and death: the death not of politicians, but of soldiers, sailors and airmen. They cannot be put at risk for the sake for closer European political integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can, indeed we must, have grave doubts about whether the regime in Iraq, which is certainly abhorrent, should be eliminated by external military means. But both moral insight and political common sense mitigate strongly against intervening in Iraq for as long as Israel is not prepared to implement the United Nations resolutions and for as long as Israel is not prepared to allow the Palestinians to elect their political leadership freely and without external pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events show particularly clearly that the current government – and it is not the country of Israel as such – is unwilling to do its bit to break the spiral of violence and stabilise the region. How much more reasonable and successful it would be surely to let our colleagues in the Palestinian Legislative Council get on with their legitimate political work. It seems that the Sharon Government actually does not want democratic decision-making structures and free elections in Palestine at all. The natural right of any government to defend itself against terrorism is often only used as a pretext.</p>
<p class="contents">The Middle East is a region whose security affects our security in Europe. That is why Europe must defend itself against private terrorism, against unreasonable State military measures and unilateral, external interventions not backed by UN resolutions. Only in this way can the right to sovereignty and internal self-determination be realised. Following the general recognition of Israel, including by the Arab States, it is now time – decades after the founding of the State of Israel – for the second half of the UN resolution concerned to be implemented too, namely the creation of a Palestinian State.</p>
<p class="contents">The best and most successful way of putting an end to terrorism – and this, Mr President-in-Office, should be stated loud and clear – is to recognise those natural rights that are the prerogative of every people and every nation, including the Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been interesting to listen to the many speeches and points of view. Weighing up the speeches as a whole, it is quite clear that we must see more progress in the CFSP and that we must have more in the way of a common foreign policy. I am pleased that those are also the conclusions drawn in Parliament’s report and in Mr Brok’s speech. I should like, however, to make the point that, in view of the fact that there are 15 countries for which foreign policy is of prime concern, we have really done rather well actually to have a common foreign policy in so many cases. The common foreign policy is in actual fact the rule rather than the exception. It will succeed only if we listen to each other and bring about a consensus, but that is something we are all united in aiming for. It is true that different foreign policy positions are expressed but, when we reach the point of taking the final decision on the common foreign policy, it is usual for us to do so jointly. That applies in the cases both of the Middle East and of Iraq. There is in fact consensus in these areas in spite of what is often a variety of public statements of our positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is nonetheless clearly right about our having most influence when we stand together. If, moreover, divisions are created in the EU, there is also a loss of influence. Parliament is right about this.</p>
<p class="contents">It should nonetheless be emphasised that the EU has in actual fact become one of the leading actors in the efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East. I have the impression that it has to some extent escaped Parliament’s attention that it is the European peace plan that is being worked on at the moment. We have not in fact had such a plan before. We have had French and German peace plans, together with American and Arabic ones, but we have not had a European plan. Moreover, the European peace plan also led, of course, to working parties and task forces being set up in July, and these have in actual fact progressively advanced the process of reform in the Middle East. There has been money that, in spite of everything, has been restored to Palestine. There have been workers who, in spite of everything, have been given permission to leave Palestine and work in Israel. I acknowledge that my introductory speech was probably too optimistic, and I am sorry about that. I also said in my speech, however, that the optimism I had felt had been shattered by the events of last week. I regret moreover that I did not, then, express myself sufficiently clearly regarding the pessimism that is again on the point of getting the upper hand in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">We can therefore choose to be pessimists and not do anything at all. It is the easiest thing in the world to be a pessimist. That way, you always turn out to be right. We are obliged to work in a spirit of optimism. Otherwise, we could not stand to go on working. That is why we have devised the peace plan that was adopted by the Quartet and, as I mentioned the other day, is now also the Security Council’s plan. Has the European Parliament experienced anything similar before in the Middle East? I really do not think so. Moreover, it has been brought about by virtue of constructive cooperation with Russia, the UN and the United States, whereby we do not seek sources of conflict but try to find the solidarity that will carry us through. As Parliament quite rightly says on this subject – and this is something with which I agree, as does the whole of Europe and, indeed, the whole world – solidarity of this kind would consist in two states existing peacefully side by side, and it is a source of some astonishment that so much blood has to be shed in the region in order to achieve what we all know will be the final outcome. It cannot end in any other way. That is why we constantly make powerful appeals to both parties. We call upon the terrorists to cease their acts of terror and upon the Israeli army to halt its excessive use of force. That is the message we constantly convey. It is, moreover, the same message that Kofi Annan delivered to the UN General Assembly the other day, when he said that the peace process must be driven by hope and by deeds: deeds on the part of the Palestinians, aimed at genuinely halting the terrorism, and hope in the form of Israel’s really making it clear that the outcome will be a Palestinian state. Otherwise, the terrorism will not successfully be brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">European policy, or the Council of Minister’s policy, is therefore quite clear and corresponds, then, to what is also global policy. I agree completely with Mr Cohn-Bendit that we must not forget the Palestinians’ responsibility for combating terrorism and, as some MEPs have mentioned, we are putting pressure on both parties. I talked for an hour the other evening with Mr Sharon about the pointlessness of maintaining the present siege. He will not achieve his objectives in that way. This has been said quite clearly. Mr Arafat has also been told that he needs to guarantee that no terrorists enter Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The main topic’s having after all been the Middle East, I want finally to say that the European position has also carried the day with regard to Iraq. The European common position is that we should comply with the Security Council. The European position is that the Security Council should be supported. That also means, then – and this is the common position we adopted in Elsinore – that we must listen to the Security Council and be willing to accommodate its requirements of us. There is no split in the European position as adopted by the Foreign Ministers. It is about complying with the Security Council. It is also a position that has paid off, because the United States has of course also agreed to comply with, and consult, the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank Mr Titley for his report on the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. I endorse Mr Titley’s concluding words to the effect that a lot has been done and that more needs to be done. With regard to the transparency that Mr Titley was kind enough to expect from the Danish Presidency, I should like to say that we shall be very pleased to accommodate that wish. The fourth annual report under the Danish Presidency will increase transparency by providing more statistical data and will add a compendium of adopted practices to show how the code is being implemented by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The report will also contain new agreements on transit, final user certificates and the production of military equipment under licence in third countries. That is how the Member States are obliged to regulate the arms trade. Several Member States have introduced the legislation, and others are preparing such legislation. On the basis of Mr Titley’s report and the backing it has received from Parliament, I am able to say that Parliament’s support for the Danish Presidency’s efforts is very welcome and very valuable. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall confine myself to two comments: first, on the question raised by Mr von Wogau, who highlighted an interesting shortcoming in Europe's defence and security policy, to do with the absence of a single market. We do in fact agree that this is an area in which cooperation, be it on the production side or be it on the research and development side, as well as more general cooperation between countries can bring in significant results. It is a shortcoming, as Mr Brok also notes in his report, which makes some very interesting points as regards security and defence, with which, as I said, we agree. We believe that Europe, which has made such a tremendous effort and has achieved results in research and development in the non-military sector of the economy, could extend this effort to the area of defence if it wishes to acquire greater autonomy, independence and development potential and derive economic benefit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment has to do with the question raised by Mr Lagendijk. As the Presidency, I have outlined the efforts being made to resolve the problem. I should like to point out that the solution we need to aim for is a European foreign and security policy which is open to any third countries wishing to share this new experience with the European Union. However, we also need to safeguard certain principles: the principle of independence of the Union's decision-making system and the integrity of its institutions. These are principles which Parliament itself has called for and they are included in the Treaties, which is why we are working to make a success of them. I am positive that, with the systematic efforts being made and with the real spirit which can be demonstrated on all sides, we shall be able – I hope soon – to reach a result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are both points, certainly the first, on which I hope to say rather more over the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is that grumbling about the United States of America is not the same as having European foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, assuming that any European initiative is wrong and that any scintilla of disagreement with the United States is somehow high treason does not strike me as being a very good basis for the protection of the national interests of any Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am always surprised that some of the most fierce protectors and protestors about national sovereignty seem to suppress that point of view as soon as Richard Pearl raises his voice.</p>
<p class="contents">So in the distinguished and ever noble presence of my honourable friend and publisher, ever noble despite the constitutional machinations of New Labour, I commend, as ever, the middle way. But if we are to take the middle way of European multilateralism providing more weight on our end of the transatlantic rope, being able to act as a counterpart and occasionally as a counterweight, then we have as European politicians to face up to the political and financial consequences of that. I hope that we will increasingly be prepared to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second point I should make in response to the honourable Member, Mr Barón Crespo. He asked for a report on destroyed EU financial projects. He will recall that we tried to provide the figures for Commission projects a few months ago. At present, we are trying to get information from Member States on all of their projects. It is not made easy by the situation on the ground. As soon as we have that information in as accurate a form as possible, we will of course share it with the honourable Member and the whole House. It is an important point and it should be possible to arrive at a figure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the point that is most worrying is the shattered aspirations of the Palestinian territories and, it has to be said, the shattered aspirations of Israel as well. The sooner we have peace, the sooner we can restore a decent standard of living and quality of life for all the people who live in that region.</p>
