<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean-Paul Gauzès, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Minister, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to recap on why this report has come back to the plenary sitting today, after having been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON).</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation on countries experiencing difficulties, for which I was rapporteur, was adopted by 25 votes to 4, with 13 abstentions. The abstentions were primarily by the Socialists. However, they did vote in favour of most of the amendments and all of the compromise amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Before opening the negotiations, which, from what we have been hearing from the Presidency, will not be easy, I felt it was important to obtain a more solid mandate from plenary. When the time comes, therefore, I will ask that we do not proceed with the vote on the legislative resolution so that, if applicable, we can secure an agreement at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft regulation on strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area is set against the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis that the European Union is facing and will continue to face. The Union is trying to learn lessons from the crisis, and to propose solutions. The Commission’s proposals complement the package on economic governance: the ‘six-pack’ adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2011. Excessive national debt can have dramatic consequences, both within the countries concerned and for the other Member States of the European Union. The difficulties of a small country can even have global repercussions. What is at risk is the euro area’s reputation, rather than its existence.</p>
<p class="contents">The serious economic and social consequences that some Member States are experiencing today could have been avoided if early, targeted action had been taken. At the time, the European Union did not have the necessary instruments, but this will now be put right by the combination of the ‘six-pack’ and two new pieces of legislation (the ‘two-pack’), including this one.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘six-pack’ needs to be strengthened, in order to ensure both financial stability and economic growth in the euro area. Several Member States have had to seek financial assistance. Preventive action at an early stage is preferable to corrective measures taken later – perhaps too late – in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad thrust of the draft regulation adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is in line with the original proposal, which provides for a Member State whose currency is the euro to be subject to enhanced surveillance when it is experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, severe financial disturbance. It should be swiftly returned to a normal situation and the other euro area Member States should be protected against possible negative spillover effects. The regulation sets out clear procedures to this effect for countries experiencing difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary committee was keen to increase the powers that the original proposal gave the Commission, in particular, by introducing wider use of the reverse qualified majority rule in Council votes. For example, this rule would apply when the Commission recommends that a country should take corrective measures, or when it instructs a country to submit new debt reduction plans. Such decisions would be deemed to have been adopted unless the Council categorically rejected them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning that ECON adopted the protection system for States in major difficulties by a wide majority. I would like to point out that there were no negotiations on this amendment and that the vote was left to each individual’s judgment. A majority of our Members chose not to heed the arguments put forward by detractors of this proposal, which were partly based on a distorted presentation of its objective. The intention is not to organise a restructuring or reduction of the debt, but to allow the State to get itself back into shape so that it can deal with its obligations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ‘two-pack’ is yet another initiative to strengthen the budgetary discipline of the euro area Member States. Now, following the economic governance ‘six-pack’, the conditions have been created for strengthened surveillance of these countries, even before they request help, their budgetary targets have been reinforced and the budgetary timelines have been coordinated. Budgetary discipline has been the start and end point of the Commission’s legislative initiative, with jobs, workers and salaries being the adjustment variable. This ignores the basic fact that if all of the economies in an internal market, including those with surpluses, are forced to practise austerity, the market ends up inexorably contracting. All countries are trying to export to markets that are closing, competing by squeezing salaries, the only variable selected for this purpose. Local demand disappears and, under these conditions, unemployment spreads. Rising unemployment and the loss of tax receipts make the intended rebalancing of the public finances impossible and government debt is left entirely at the mercy of those running the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘two-pack’ legislative initiative was developed in this context, precisely when the fourth EU economy was beginning to show its weakness. As the representatives of our citizens, we can no longer colegislate on initiatives that focus solely on discipline and austerity. The initiatives have to be adjusted and rebalanced. It is therefore essential that improvements made to the legislation are strongly approved and strongly endorsed. They ensure balance between the short-term objectives and the medium-term requirements to correct the imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">There is greater respect for national democracy in setting national budgets and the need for coordination between Member States is recognised, but there is also respect for social consultation at a national level. In addition, it is also essential for the Commission, as soon as possible, to produce the road map for the only possible firebreak with which to moderate sovereign debt; that is, to jointly manage the debt above 60% through a medium- and long-term fund, to provide some degree of coordination for the short-term management of the bonds for this debt and to produce a road map to achieve the effective and definitive constitution of eurobonds.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is essential that the internal demand obstacle and the lack of European stabilising instruments are overcome and, for this purpose, an instrument of 1% of GDP over 10 years is proposed precisely to fill this void. Thirdly, it is fundamental when evaluating deficit levels, debt and the imposition of rules for budgetary rebalancing to protect the strategic investment that enables countries to overcome structural weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come ready to work, to work intensely to build consensus, as our Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and this plenary are mandated to do. This consensus requires sacrifice and compromise, whether within each political group or between different political groups, but we are confident that the vote tomorrow will strongly reinforce the position of this Parliament, which represents our citizens, and that it will allow them to play a constructive role in overcoming the crisis that we are going through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The purpose of the discussion this morning and, of course, of the vote tomorrow, is to establish Parliament’s position in view of upcoming trialogues. I would like to thank, in particular, Ms Ferreira and Mr Gauzès for their dedicated work; we have talked a number of times about their work on these issues and their contribution to establishing Parliament’s positions on the text put forward by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is keenly awaiting the outcome of your deliberations and looks forward to a constructive trialogue. You will be aware that the Danish Presidency steered discussions in the Council to a rapid conclusion, so that already by 21 February, we were able to adopt a general approach in Council on both these proposals. The general approach of the Council is to close the original proposals of the Commission which we believe to be an important contribution to ensuring sound and sustainable public finance in the euro area and thereby also to growth and employment, with those two things being two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability will ensure that surveillance of those Member States under a financial assistance programme or, of course, facing threats of financial instability, is robust, follows clear procedures and is embedded in EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation on common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficits of the Member States in the euro area will require these countries to present their draft budgetary plans, which will enable the Commission to assess whether the budgetary plans are in accordance with budgetary objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation also proposes closer monitoring and reporting requirements for euro area countries in an excessive deficit procedure. I should add that I remain confident that we will reach an agreement which is acceptable to the Council and Parliament in the end. The two proposals will make an important contribution to further strengthening of the economic governance framework within the euro area and we are ready to start a trialogue as soon as Parliament is ready.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to recall, and I should of course do that very briefly, the context in which we are discussing these two proposals. We are all only too well aware of the persistent financial and economic crisis which continues to impact across Europe, and also beyond European borders, despite the reins applied and measures taken after 2010. But having said that, I still think it is important to realise that much has been achieved. We have strengthened economic governance and policy coordination within the framework of the European Semester. The ‘six-pack’ – and I consider this a major achievement by the Council and Parliament, with very close cooperation on very difficult files – has strengthened the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and created a new macro-economic imbalances procedure. We have set up rescue mechanisms such as the EFSM, the EFS and the ESM, and used these facilities to support vulnerable Member States. We have strengthened financial supervision through a European systemic risk board and strengthened the role of the European supervisory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As an absolutely crucial part of the EU crisis management strategy, the Council and Parliament are taking major steps on stronger financial regulations. We have agreed, or are in the process of agreeing, on a number of financial regulation files, including new capital requirements of banks, rules on markets for financial derivatives, rules on short selling and credit default swaps, hedge funds and credit rating agencies. Further proposals which will contribute to better regulation of the financial markets are in the pipeline, such as the proposal for an EU framework for bank recovery and resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and hand in hand with our efforts on stronger economic governance and financial regulation, we are working on promoting stronger growth and job creation, with this being done through reforms, initiatives at both national level and European level. However, it is clear that further work is required. The current economic problems have revealed the need for an ever closer policy coordination and decisive action from the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is against this background that honourable Members will be discussing today the ‘two-pack’ proposals which, although only a part of the overall picture, will nevertheless play a key role in the overall strengthening of the coordination of economic policies. Much is at stake, and I therefore have strong hopes that, following your debate today and your vote tomorrow, we can make rapid progress towards reaching an overall agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you of the Danish Presidency’s commitment to this dossier. I also know that, as we are almost at the end of our presidency term, the incoming Cyprus Presidency is equally determined to adopt these proposals as quickly as possible. I look forward very much to your discussion and thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also want to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for a very substantive and, may I say, constructive economic dialogue yesterday evening in which we discussed the European Semester as well as our strategy for sustainable growth and job creation, and also discussed issues like the recent decision of the euro area to provide a credit line for the restructuring of the Spanish banking sector. We will continue this discussion tomorrow, both in the morning and afternoon, so today we will focus on the ‘two-pack’, which is a very important discussion and decision indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about the context of this debate. At the summit later this month – as President Barroso will explain in more detail tomorrow – the Heads of State or Government will discuss the next phase of deepening the economic union. They will discuss possibilities such as a growth compact, a financial union and a fiscal union.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are, yet again, witnessing a potentially defining moment for Europe’s deeper integration. And, once again, this Commission and this Parliament have a special and joint responsibility – a unique responsibility – to prove that the community method can be and will be at the centre of the next chapter in the making of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have little doubt that the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance will be ratified by at least 12 euro area Member States and will thus enter into force. The legislation which is the subject of our debate today has a profound significance in relation to that treaty. That is why it is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">The first draft regulation, which is the subject of Mr Gauzès’s report, aims at providing more robust and coherent ways of dealing with vulnerable Member States and Member States under a programme, including enhanced economic and budgetary surveillance. I fully agree with Mr Gauzès that prevention is always much better than correction and this regulation was needed in the past two and a half years, even before that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second draft regulation, which is dealt with in Ms Ferreira’s report, aims at establishing a common timeline and common rules to allow for real active prior or <span class="italic">ex ante</span> monitoring and assessment of the national budgets of euro area Member States. This regulation was needed during the past 12 years because, once again, prevention is always better than correction, as we have learned the hard way.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals, submitted to you on 23 November by the Commission, decisively informed and shaped the subsequent discussions that led to the new Fiscal Compact Treaty. Moreover, the authors of the new treaty explicitly required that certain provisions of the treaty should be achieved through the EU’s normal secondary legislation. They welcomed these specific legislative proposals and clearly saw them as an essential supplement to the treaty itself.</p>
<p class="contents">And, of course, the authors of the treaty set out the goal that all provisions of the treaty should be incorporated into the legal framework of the EU by 2018 at the latest. So, the adoption of this legislation is a vital first step in ensuring that the articulation between the Fiscal Compact Treaty and the EU Treaties is done correctly and will set a positive precedent for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that, as colegislator, you have a choice: either to move forward in a timely way or to delay and create a legal grey area. If the treaty enters into force before this ‘two-pack’, we will be confronted with very difficult legal challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">What concerns me most is the political signal that such a scenario would send: no legal acrobatics would enable us to hide the fact that we had failed to live up to our political responsibilities, because Member States would be subject to intergovernmental treaty obligations which had not been translated into EU secondary legislation as planned. Frankly, this would be very bad for the credibility of both the EU Treaty and the community method.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to acknowledge that, in this respect, the Council has moved quickly. It agreed its mandate to negotiate on these texts within weeks of the signature of the treaty in February. As a former Member of this House, I understand and deeply respect the principles of democratic scrutiny, which means that this House cannot always be as agile as the Council. But I think – and I say this with respect – that after almost seven months for discussion, this should now be the moment to move forward from discussion to negotiation and then to decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s negotiating mandate will surely provide us with challenges in the negotiations. I have studied Mr Gauzès’s and Ms Ferreira’s reports. It is already clear that the mandate that you will give to the Economic Affairs Committee will also provide us with some challenges. However, my team and I are ready to roll up our sleeves, get down to serious work with this House and the Council, and get this legislation enacted so that we can move forward. It is in our joint interest not to be institutionally overtaken by yet another intergovernmental agreement.</p>

Our Committee believes that it is vital for EU budgetary policy to be fully in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to create jobs and facilitate growth. Furthermore, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs finds it important that while budgetary policies are being harmonised and coordinated control is being implemented, Member States should retain their budgetary sovereignty. Last but not least, we consider the provisions that propose the setting of sovereign debt ceilings in Member State constitutions to be important.

<p class="contents">We saw it as an opportunity, in the hope that Parliament’s contribution could improve them. Our committee, which is aware of the need for solidarity, was able, for example, to introduce the clause on abiding by collective agreements, to reject the macro-economic conditions for access to the Structural Funds, give Parliament a more important role and national budgets a greater role in implementing the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs incorporated these points to some extent, but generally speaking, in spite of the efforts of our rapporteur, Elisa Ferreira, whom I congratulate, I must share with you my sense of dissatisfaction, especially on the areas that were not within the remit of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs This package reinforces the economic surveillance that my group opposed at the time of the vote on the ‘six-pack’. The procedure is inflexible and applies harsh, uniform formulae to all Member States, regardless of the structure and origin of their debt.</p>
<p class="contents">After this weekend’s meetings to unblock the aid to Spain, we cannot claim that one size fits all. The Ferreira report contains some sound steps towards new governance approaches but, even with the amendments proposed by our rapporteur, I still fear that the spending needed for growth and jobs will be sacrificed to try to please the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current climate in the Council, where growth through stimulus and investment are finally being talked about alongside budgetary discipline, to enshrine in law processes that are out of step with a new political order will not help to soothe the markets and stimulate growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this week we can make another step in the right direction with the adoption of the ‘two-pack’, the proposals for which have just been explained by rapporteurs Gauzès and Ferreira.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has worked very hard to ensure that we get two effective reports here on the table. My hope now, this time, is that all the groups will take their share of the responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Ferreira report, we have been careful to preserve the core of the Commission’s proposal, to establish a link between financial stability and growth and jobs (which is a ‘both together’ scenario rather than an ‘either/or’ one), to ensure greater respect for national parliaments and to guarantee the independence of Member States’ budgetary institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we have integrated a number of key issues from the budget treaty into this piece of Community legislation, in particular, those relating to binding numerical fiscal rules, an automatic correction mechanism in domestic law and the concept of economic partnership programmes for countries in the excessive deficit procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have not accepted, nor will accept, is an attempt to weaken the Growth and Stability Pact. We cannot support that because we do not believe that we can solve the debt problem by creating even more debt and, equally, because we do not want to be complicit in making choices that will <span class="italic">both</span> burden the next generation <span class="italic">and</span> cripple the badly needed restoration of confidence in the short term. We need that confidence, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, for the purposes of further fiscal integration, to which we in the PPE Group, too, are open. Open for a debate on the merits of types of common debt issuance, such as eurobonds and a redemption fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this is about sums of money and profound reintegration of such an order that we need to be certain that the conditions and timing are right. That is why we cannot simply slide in a whole new chapter into the articles of this regulation, at the drop of a hat as it were. What we <span class="italic">are</span> in favour of, however, is the review clause, which provides the necessary openings and which we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have amended precisely for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as economic growth is concerned, we, too, want to collect the required resources. However, setting up a fund quickly in this legislative text, as large as the entire current annual budget of the European Union, without even saying where those resources are coming from, would be implausible.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the PPE Group remains consistent and will vote in the same way tomorrow as we have previously voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For us, this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we have, and I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs, Ms Ferreira and Mr Gauzès, for their work, as well as the other group representatives who helped.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not absolutely sure what Ms Thyssen meant. I hope, at least, that we can reach real agreement, that we will tomorrow have a clear majority in the vote, as was the case in the committee. We support this compromise. We have a single wish that I would like to go into. We support this compromise and it is quite important that Parliament should make its decision with a high degree of unanimity. We say this because, with this legislation – and we need this message to go out to our Heads of State or Government and our citizens, too – we are also fundamentally changing the basic conditions for economic policy and economic governance in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already done a lot, but we actually did not need the Fiscal Compact at all, as we are creating fundamental new conditions through the combination of the ‘six-pack’ and now the ‘two-pack’. If we were critical at the time of many things in the ‘six-pack’, that makes us even more in favour of the ‘two-pack’, as it corrects and adds a number of elements, so that we really have an overall package here that goes considerably beyond what we had before.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two crucial points to which I would still like to draw attention. I do concede one thing to Ms Thyssen, which is that we need to get past the debts. We can only get past the debts, however, if we also lower the interest rates. We are well aware – as demonstrated by Spain – that we will not get past the debts as long as we have this high interest burden. That being the case, the idea of a debt redemption fund is very much the right way to go. Many of us – me included – believe that we have to go further. We have to move towards eurobonds, with fiscal prerequisites, of course, which are precisely what we are putting in place with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’. Do we now give our support to the compromise on a debt redemption fund? Listening to some of what the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has to say, I have to hope that they do not go through with it, that this is not now rejected again, and that we really are able to hold on to this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is a special request on the part of Mr Monti. We should not leave Mr Monti high and dry when it comes to investments and specific, very limited, precisely defined growth investments. The situation is that we still have the Europe 2020 targets, but we often do not have the investments. This no longer applies necessarily to the national level, but often to the local level. It is therefore very important to give priority to these investments for growth as that, too, represents a considerable contribution to avoiding the debts if we have growth. To that end, I hope for broad support, a broad consensus, in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After six months of negotiations, we may have a strong Parliament position. We will vote on new rules on enforcing control of Member States’ finances but also on instruments that may help us out of this crisis. I am talking about the European Redemption Fund, an instrument that combines fiscal discipline and European solidarity, which are not contradictory terms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our responsibility to show the world that our single currency is irreversible, and that we are not ready to go back to national currencies. In this respect, the European Redemption Fund is the only realistic and achievable debt mutualisation instrument that we can get in the short run. The European Redemption Fund is a voluntary, temporary and partial debt mutualisation tool strongly related to fiscal discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">Eurobonds will be for the next crisis, not for this crisis. Talking to our citizens about eurobonds as if they were something for next month is populism. We cannot lie to our citizens, ignoring the fact that convergence in fiscal discipline and in a common fiscal stability culture is needed before eurobonds. On the other hand, doing nothing could also be morally unacceptable. While some countries are financing themselves without cost in the short run, other countries are rapidly becoming insolvent due to the increasing cost of their new debt issues. This is why I call on all Members of this Parliament who believe in the European project to vote in favour not only of the two reports, but also of the European Redemption Fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My experience was that we worked very constructively on the content of the two regulations. It was a truly productive experience. In the Gauzès report, we have used the opportunity to further define how the ‘six-pack’ will affect the various countries. Through the discussion that we had at that point, we succeeded in implementing a whole series of improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Parliament’s ideas, in future, the social impact of each adaptation programme will have to be taken into account. Secondly, in future, the social partners and non-governmental organisations will be consulted in the establishment of the adaptation programmes. Thirdly, in future, the Commission will have to provide transparency in respect of the methods used in calculating the debt sustainability of each country and in forecasting the economic outlook of each country. In the past, we repeatedly saw assumption and massaging of figures. Fourthly, there is to be an audit of the remaining debts in each case. Fifthly, and finally, democratic control is to be strengthened in future, in that the decision about who is to be made subject to stricter monitoring cannot, any longer, be made by the Commission alone, but by the Council, and subject to reverse qualified majority voting in order to avoid blocking tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">What I view as absolutely crucial is that this and other improvements put forward by Parliament in the Gauzès report will not just apply to the Member States in the future, but also to those Member States that are suffering such serious social and economic problems now: Greece, Portugal and Ireland. In that way, Parliament has lived up to its responsibility to implement improvements in the whole context, specifically in the context of what was decided here in controversial, but ultimately successful fashion, namely, the ‘six-pack’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one last thing I would like to say. It concerns something that actually falls within the scope of the Ferreira report but which is the subject of controversy in Germany at present, namely, the debt redemption pact. If Parliament is to act responsibly in this regard, that means that it must take into consideration the problem of pre-existing debt. It is not enough to respond with arguments that this does not fit strictly within the context. If the Member States do not solve this problem, the euro is heading for extinction. The pre-existing debts need to be resolved, and Parliament therefore must take this proposal forward with a strong majority. I can only call on the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), in this context, to play their part in the broad support of this amendment by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, there is the Gauzès report. After the negotiating process, I am sorry to find only a watered-down version of the ‘golden rule’ that puts the essence of the Fiscal Treaty on a slippery slope. I am happy that another suggestion by Mr Gauzès was retained. He proposes that a Member State at risk of default or suspension of payments should be placed under legal protection. Unfortunately, he did not go one step further by adding that if a Member State is unwilling to surrender its sovereignty in this way, it should be given the option of leaving the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">I was criticised as being irresponsible for tabling an amendment in this sense, but I believe it is the other way round: it is irresponsible not to consider the possibility of a country leaving the eurozone. Mr President, you can choose to ignore reality but reality will not ignore you. Following the Greek elections this weekend, the facts will come to haunt us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Ms Ferreira goes far beyond the aim of the ‘two-pack’. She confuses EU legislation with the manifesto of her Socialist Party. The rapporteur ties budgetary surveillance to a range of other issues such as eurobonds, a European Redemption Fund, a European Debt Authority, a financial transaction tax and a common consolidated corporate tax base.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a Christmas tree out of season. During negotiations, Mr Gauzès ceded too much to the left, more than many Members of the PPE regarded desirable. In voting, the left mainly abstained regardless.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Ferreira’s report only achieved a small majority. In fact, more Members voted against or abstained than voted in favour. Parliament has produced a wish-list about which it is itself divided. It will not stand in Council and rightly so. The ECR will abstain on Gauzès and vote against Ferreira. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We already have a Growth and Stability Pact; it has been in existence for a long time. We also now have a ‘six-pack’, but we continue to introduce new regulations with the current crisis as a pretext, even though it is now too late to resolve it.</p>
<p class="contents">They say that we should learn a lesson from this crisis, but Member States can also learn from it themselves. Finland, for example, suffered a severe recession in the 1990s and learnt a lot from it, and that is why the country is not in such a bad situation now as it was then. They say that there needs to be surveillance from above, but penalties imposed from above will not help. What use is a penalty to a Member State if it is already on the verge of ruin?</p>
<p class="contents">This way, we are not rescuing the economy as a priority. There is enough regulation in place. This way, we are building a federation one step at a time, and in this case, two steps at a time. We here have already heard speeches containing visions for the subsequent steps. For my own part, I can no longer vote in favour of even one step towards a federation before we have also asked our citizens if they want one, asked that question specifically in referendums, and received a clear answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The idea is to give teeth to the European Semester, which was created as a framework to provide better coordination of financial and economic policy. At the Commission’s behest, the Member States are to be forced to accept financial assistance. Through the ‘six-pack’, extensive sanction options that could be imposed on euro area countries with financial problems have already been created. The European Semester has already been perceived by the citizens more as a rollback of democracy than as a useful tool to coordinate economic policy. At the same time, the German Government is openly threatening Greek citizens with being kicked out of the euro area should they make the wrong choice in the elections on Sunday.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we not desist from such humiliating and undemocratic chest-beating? In a situation where the euro crisis has dramatically worsened once again – I am thinking of Spain, and of Cyprus – it in no way helps us to pillory Member States that are in crisis. We should at last produce some solutions! The rapporteurs for the ‘two-pack’ have developed some very sensible approaches in this regard. Ms Ferreira made reference to the debt redemption fund, which would be a worthwhile and sensible measure in order to tackle the debts. Mr Gauzès’s proposal for an organised process for national bankruptcy would perhaps also be an option.</p>
<p class="contents">It is key, however, that Europe should work together and show solidarity in order to set the eurozone back on track for growth. The strong countries in Europe must desist from their self-satisfied finger pointing at their partner countries. They need to begin doing their homework, investing in growth and taking on their responsibilities. A Merkel-style policy of cuts on one side only has simply failed as a model to resolve the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Spain appears to have even employed blackmail in order to receive those EUR 100 billion. According to Bloomberg, Spain formulated its threat as follows: ‘If you want to force a bailout for Spain, start preparing EUR 500 billion and another EUR 700 billion for Italy which will have to be bailed out after us’.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it true, Mr President, that this was said during the negotiations about whether to give EUR 100 billion to Spain? In any case, this explains why Spain will not be placed under the strict supervision of the troika. Prime Minister Rajoy pretty much declared last Sunday, 10 June, a national holiday, because Spain received EUR 100 billion. This is EUR 100 billion of hard-earned cash taken from taxpayers including from those in the Netherlands. What is more, Spain does not even have to meet the strict conditions that Greece, Portugal and Ireland have to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I would like to ask the Commission and the Council about this is as follows: what do you think about the threats that Spain levelled at the Council during the negotiations? How will the Greeks, Portuguese and Irish feel now that Spain is not required to meet the same strict conditions? Can you explain to the Greeks and the Portuguese why Spain is receiving preferential treatment? Can you explain to the Dutch and German taxpayers why Spain has been allowed to get away with years of mismanagement and why it is now being rewarded with EUR 100 billion?</p>

This frightens our citizens and I understand that very well.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have made great progress. We have a fire brigade that had to turn out for the Spanish banks last weekend. More than that, however, we need to try to get the euro house in order structurally. We have made important progress on that front, too, though we are still far from there. It is our task, as well as that of this Parliament as legislator, to contribute vigorously and resolutely to strengthening the foundations of the euro. Our group is in favour of that.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Madlener and the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), I want to say that fairytales do not exist. We cannot throw Europe overboard; what we can do is preserve prosperity and jobs for our citizens. That fairytale does not exist and that is why we need to resolutely persevere.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made significant steps towards a budgetary and an economic Union; with the ‘six-pack’, the Fiscal Compact, and – Commissioner Rehn is right – the ‘two-pack’, under which the community method is crucial. With these mechanisms, the Commission can intervene if the situation in a particular country gets out of hand. This package as a whole is important for the structural solution, for structural recovery of confidence. I hope that tomorrow, a broad majority in this House will be prepared to take responsibility for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Ms Thyssen is right. This package offers a ‘both together’ scenario, but it is also focused on sustainable growth and jobs with the crucial building blocks. I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that the Council will also respect the community method. We will dedicate ourselves to that cause.</p>

The two regulations that make up this ‘two-pack’ are aimed at promoting budgetary cooperation and preserving the financial stability of countries with serious difficulties or which request or require financial assistance programmes. The rules of economic governance have so far been unbalanced and do not provide sufficient legitimacy. More emphasis has been placed on supervision rather than on cooperation, on sanctions rather than on incentives, and on the intergovernmental method rather than on the community method.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach has proved to be ineffective. This package should rebalance it. It should rebalance it and bring efficiency to it, as well as legitimacy, thus promoting cooperation, fostering a focus on growth and employment, and ensuring greater democratic involvement. That is the intention of the amendments presented in the package.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Ferreira report makes significant progress. This is because it introduces a mandate with a road map towards eurobonds, establishing a sustainable growth instrument in the euro area – including an increase in European Investment Bank capital and bonds for projects – and the creation of a redemption fund that must be applied without discrimination. I believe that the mandate should also incorporate and identify the investments required in order to fulfil the Europe 2020 strategy, because if we want fiscal discipline, we have to talk about quality of spending.</p>
<p class="contents">It also needs to be pointed out that these reports have strengthened the effects of the economic policies of one Member State on the other Member States and the protection of fiscal income. They have also introduced the social clause and consider the role of social partners and civil society. In my view, what is missing is the role of Parliament. When there are Member States, as in the case of Spain, that have asked for the assistance programme, which are therefore going to be subject to increased supervision, I think there is a need to ensure democratic control so that its people are completely aware of the conditions being imposed on them and how the burden is being distributed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Austrian author, Paul Watzlawick, said: <span class="italic">‘Die Lage ist hoffnungslos aber nicht ernst</span>’, which means: the situation is desperate, but it is not serious’. I get the impression that the general approach here entails talking about how desperate the situation is but, at the same time, not taking seriously the need for immediate measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to praise the Commission for its efforts and its willingness to improve the proposed legislation, and our rapporteurs for the work they have done on improving them. I myself was a supporter of the ‘six-pack’ and therefore agree completely that we should be moving in the direction of discipline and structural reform. However, we believe that what is needed now is urgent reform and crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we believe that the most important point in both these pieces of legislation is the proposal for a redemption fund. The name is odd, but the point is that we need a fund that would reduce the pressure, as I have said before and will say again, especially to certain of my fellow Members, on countries that are implementing structural reforms, reforming their budgetary discipline and still having to cope with interest rates that are becoming unsustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Discipline is based on the markets. It can only work if the markets themselves reflect the real situation. At present, however, there is an unhealthy, untenable discrepancy between some countries that, in my opinion, are being unjustly punished, and others that are probably being unjustly favoured. The cohesion of the Union between European countries is at stake. That is why I call on all Members to vote in favour of the redemption fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They provide a legal basis for work that the Commission, in fact, is already doing, when it takes part in the troika in countries that are, as we say, ‘under a programme’, or when it works with Member States in the context of their budgetary procedures. I think it is better to work within a legal framework than outside one and, in that respect, these two regulations are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I must highlight the fact that the rapporteurs have really worked in a spirit of inclusiveness, and I hope that will be demonstrated by an overwhelming vote in favour tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to reply particularly to Ms Thyssen, perhaps. Yes, it is true that we need sustainable public finances. We cannot build ourselves a future on deficits and debt. That is very clear. There should be no doubt about that. That is what was said in the ‘six-pack’ and it is being said again in the ‘two-pack’, but it cannot be the be-all and end-all of our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, what we also need – in addition to that and not instead of it, of course – is a way to mutualise the debt that allows us to have interest rates that make the debt sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more importantly, we also need fiscal convergence to ensure not only that spending is sustainable, but also that revenues are sufficient to cover this spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to invest, invest and invest again so we can restructure our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Ms Thyssen, is what we wanted to introduce with the ‘two-pack’. Rome was not built in a day, of course, but even so we cannot keep saying that discipline is what we need right now and everything else will follow on later. We have to put rules of budgetary discipline in place today – and, in fact, they were brought in a year ago now. We have to start putting debt mutualisation in place today. We have to start putting fiscal convergence in place today. We should already have started investing in our future yesterday. We cannot, therefore, keep on saying we want discipline right away and everything else will follow on eventually.</p>
<p class="contents">Telling us that we are trying to bring it in through the back door is nonsense! These measures have been needed for two years, and we have not yet begun to put them into practice. That is why I should like us to make a start.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to reply to those who say that all that will cost the net contributor countries money. I should like to remind them, actually, that today the net contributor countries – and my country is one of them – ‘lend’ money and do not ‘give’ it. They receive interest on these loans, and I would add that countries such as Germany now have investors pay them to invest their money. Their interest rates are negative. <span class="italic">Bremer Landesbank</span> reckons that Germany now benefits to the tune of EUR 45-65 billion. That is immediate profit, so the cost to Germany would only be a cost if some of the loans taken out were not repaid.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, please stop saying that we are bleeding ourselves dry for all those people in southern Europe. At the moment, it is a lucrative process for the net contributor countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ‘two-pack’ should do just that: adding the secondary legislation to implement the decisions that were made by the eurozone Member States when they demanded monetary missions to Greece and others as a condition of financial assistance. We need to proceed quickly, as events continue to unfold in individual Member States, and we should not extend the scope.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework being put in place rightly allows for the different treatment that Spain will receive, separating out the concept of recapitalisation of banks from a macro-economic adjustment plan. Yet I have some concerns for those countries which were bailed out earlier and have not been given the benefit of this special treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">As the details emerge of precisely what terms the Spanish Government has managed to secure for its banking bailout, the principle of equal treatment must be followed. If a lower interest rate is justified for Spain, it must also be considered retrospectively for Ireland and its banking bailout.

It is like watching a continuous chase to try to recover a situation that has now become almost desperate. I do not believe that we can resolve this tragic situation the euro area has got itself into by putting straitjackets on Member States or even by proposing legal protections.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to keep economic and monetary union alive, we must also find tools for growth, such as eurobonds, or some form of measures that will encourage investment. The euro has brought benefits to the few and huge problems to many. Some Member States, such as Germany, should understand this situation better and accept some compromises, as other countries have done in the past. If this does not happen, economic and monetary union may also end here, and we would definitely not have many regrets. Indeed, Germany itself may end up being the country most affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been some declarations of intent, but they are very timid. I am referring, for example, to the road map towards a day when we can begin to think of ways to establish possible legislation for the hypothetical introduction of eurobonds.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that this day will only arrive when all of the euro area’s problems have been resolved and it will then be too late, far too late. We support some aspects of this proposal but, at this rate, it will all be too little, too late. To put a country under legal protection implies maintaining rates and amounts, and giving new loans priority. That is, it requires the Member States to honour their debt, but removes from them all of the instruments they could use to ensure growth and to find the resources they need to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be frank with one another: the only legal protection that exists in these proposals, and which is planned, is for the creditors, but even this will not be achieved because it is not even effective for them. As we have seen in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and now Spain, this means condemning the countries to recession, unemployment and insolvency. Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying that the deterioration of these situations and their spreading to other economies is bringing us close to the point of no return. Given the failure of complete austerity, the Commission and the German Government propose the same policy to us, but in overdose. It is this neoliberal fanaticism that is killing the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This stronger surveillance is called ‘bailing them out’. Member States will be punished or fined – given a caning, one might say. Financial penalties will be harsher and more automatic. Even though certain amendments are aimed at preventing there being nothing more than budgetary austerity by introducing growth measures, your proposals are only there to sugar the pill.</p>

We are losing our budgetary sovereignty and our freedom to choose our policies forever, with Parliament’s collusion, although the people have not been consulted.

The Member States have failed because they did not live up to their commitments – and the same applies to the Commission, which failed to monitor the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial markets have forced Europe to put in place diverse solidarity measures, namely, the European Semester, the ‘six-pack’, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and European supervision. However, nobody can relieve the nation states, their parliaments and governments of their responsibility. The communitarisation of debt fosters sloppiness and not solidarity, penalises those with higher taxes and interest rates, those who are competitive and who have done what they were supposed to do in accordance with treaty commitments. eurobonds, a debt redemption fund, blue bonds or red bonds are a mistake, as well as being expressly prohibited under Article 125 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Without treaty changes, they are impermissible. Commissioner Rehn has said that proposals will be on the table as soon as tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the responsibility of the Commission, I would like to conclude with a quotation from the former chief economist of the European Central Bank, Otmar Issing, who said, ‘How can we expect objective and effective supervision from the European Commission when it is an institution that itself repeatedly participates in initiatives that violate the Treaties or covers up problems, rendering their resolution more expensive?’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These two regulations cover, first and foremost, a very important institutional loophole, because the lack of common European rules in adjustment programme planning and evaluation to date has resulted, in certain cases, in dogmatic, inflexible approaches, which are blind to the current economic and financial situation, that make targets, if not unattainable, then very difficult to attain, and which ultimately, in conjunction with certain internal weaknesses and omissions, damage the very credibility of the adjustment programme and its chances of success.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this, I wish to extend my especial thanks to the two rapporteurs, Jean-Paul Gauzès and Elisa Ferreira, because the compromise reached in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs introduces certain such basic rules, which are currently absent from the adjustment programmes being applied – at least they are absent from the Greek adjustment programme – and which relate, for example, to the facility to modify the programme, taking account of negative secondary consequences and macro-economic and financial disruptions. I also wish to mention the Monti clause on the need to respect the rules and practices governing working relations in the Union and, of course, the obligations of the State within the framework of the strategy for growth and jobs. At this very critical juncture for my country and Europe, the European Parliament’s proposals flesh out the concept of solidarity and are the best response to the populism and accusations that Greek citizens will face in next Sunday’s elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was our experience in Sweden during the 1990s: it was not a matter of austerity for austerity’s sake; it was a matter of providing the opportunity for growth, and I believe that this is a good proposal that will give Europe that opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we now have to assess is whether these two regulations seem to be capable of dealing with the deterioration of the crisis and the potential of their legal basis. Here, the answer is clear: the Commission’s proposal seems to belong to another epoch. As Commissioner Rehn has said, the Commission proposes an addition to the ‘six-pack’ without taking into account the obvious limits of austerity policies and economic governance that are solely focused on introducing rigid constraints and without attributing any real financial decision-making powers to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has introduced significant improvements to the Commission’s proposal, especially visible in the report by Ms Ferreira, first and foremost, in the article on the debt redemption fund. However, there remain several limitations. I am struck by the deafness of rapporteur Mr Gauzès who, faced with the proposal to involve Parliament in activating the enhanced surveillance procedure, introduces a procedure similar to that used for delegated acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group, however, has responsibly decided to focus on one point, on which, however, there still appears to be some confusion. Amendment 82 is not a weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact, it is not a classic ‘golden rule’ clause. Quite the opposite: it is a tool to defend the Stability and Growth Pact, to make it effective and to ensure compliance, as well as giving a greater role to the Commission. The amendment is based on the concept of sustainable discipline and gives the Commission the task of prioritising investments for growth and employment when defining medium-term objectives and assessing Member State budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I call upon fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to read the amendment, to reflect and to prevent this Parliament from appearing to be cut off from a situation that is evolving throughout Europe as well as in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The measures adopted in recent months, or even years, have failed to convince the markets on a durable basis. There is an urgent need for the Member States to take seriously a disciplined, balanced budgetary policy. The ‘two-pack’ can help to make progress in that direction. It can provide the basis for stability and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a whole series of amendments are once again being tabled, with the aim of watering down the proposals. We do not need a watered-down ‘two-pack’, however. What we do require is a genuine act of release. This act of release could consist of two elements. The first element would be the debt redemption fund already mentioned by a number of speakers, which would help to consolidate the inherited debts and spread them out over a period of 25 years. The second element would be that we have to achieve real progress in the conversion of the euro area into a true internal financial market, in other words, into an internal market with cross-border banking supervision, a cross-border deposit guarantee fund and a uniform cross-border banking rescue and resolution regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis has caused significant disruption to basic economic growth and financial stability. As we all know, excessive debt can have dramatic consequences, and not only for the country concerned, but for entire regions, in this instance, the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should give consideration to an honest assessment of whether it is not just the reputation of the euro area which is at threat, but its very existence. The EU was taken by surprise by a scenario far bleaker than that for which it was prepared. It did not have the necessary tools at its disposal. Will this now change after the adoption of the ‘six-pack’ and the addition of the ‘two-pack’? We shall see. In my opinion, it is plain as day that anyone who builds a house by starting with the roof, and not by choosing a patch of solid ground and building the foundations, cannot expect the outcome to be good. The rapporteur supports the Commission’s proposal to step up surveillance and to take early preventive measures instead of corrective action when it is already too late. Will this be enough? We shall see, but I doubt it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now entering a phase of trialogues and I ask that this work be conducted quickly. I am aware that this has always been the aim of the most involved members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We urgently need responses to the challenges we are currently facing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Jean-Paul Gauzès and Elisa Ferreira, for the work they have done on this ‘two-pack’. With the ‘six-pack’, it could form an ‘eight-pack’ solution. Parliament helped to bring this about for this crisis. The solution is based on the following premise: there will only be sustainable growth with disciplined public finance. This is the starting point for the future challenges we are facing, the challenge of growth. Growth naturally requires political stability, social stability and European solutions. Some of these are extremely urgent; some face difficulties. We will have to amend the Treaties if we are to have a system of eurobonds. We need the will of the Member States if we are to have a redemption fund and for these things to appear as soon as possible. Once again, everything depends on time and a European solution. Shortly, we will advocate a European solution for Schengen. On this matter, we must also advocate a European solution and support the great efforts the Commission has made in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot demand a lot from certain Member States and, at the same time, give nothing back, and we cannot wait until the end of the whole affair to reward them for their efforts. It is entirely a matter of governance – modern, intelligent governance adapted to the reality and severity of the crisis facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this consistency, when we draw up our economic policies, we must bear in mind everything we have learnt and everything we know about the extent of the macro-economic imbalances and the need to correct them. That means that the policies introduced must be evaluated, in terms of timing and criteria, according to how well they address these macro-economic imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Ms Vestager, the banking union question will clearly be at the heart of the discussions at the European Council on 28 and 29 June. The message I think this Parliament can give there, particularly with Ms Ferreira’s report, is one of balance. There must be a balance between a new approach in the Council debate to the challenges of growth, of which we are one of the main axes in Ms Ferreira’s report – which I hope will be given considerable support by this Chamber – and managing the debt issue.</p>
<p class="contents">This balance between the way the debt question is addressed and the need for real growth – not merely internal market liberalisation but, above all, growth aiming at the long term and at investment – will at last enable us to give Europeans new hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

France, however, has just issued its latest government bonds at historically low rates. It has to get its economy growing again so as to reduce its deficits and continue to benefit from such rates.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, Ms Ferreira raises the possibility of proactive investment policies by proposing, like Mario Monti, to change the way deficits are calculated so as to distinguish the role of public investment. She also supports the creation of eurobonds, which are needed to curb speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the future of the euro is at stake, the conservatives would be taking on a serious responsibility if they rejected the amendments and compromises, including these two proposals.</p>

<p class="contents">The Gauzès report represents a first step towards European insolvency law, which is a prerequisite for fiscal union. Fiscal union, in turn, is a prerequisite for the implementation of political union. If we do not Europeanise budget policy, we cannot conduct a stability-oriented monetary policy. With these two reports we have, on the one hand, stronger surveillance and protection against national bankruptcy and, on the other, the monitoring of budgetary plans and a stronger right of intervention on the part of the Commission. It is a step in the right direction; things just always take quite a long time here. Let us continue in this direction since debt reduction alone will still not bring about the resolution of our crisis.</p>

<p class="contents">Today, we are talking about enhanced surveillance of Member States to which assistance will ultimately be granted or is already being granted, and monitoring of the budgetary plans of the Member States. Everyone seems to agree in theory with the Commission’s proposals as regards the need for monitoring and surveillance of Member States which receive financial assistance, so this debate has focused on the precise nature of the criteria – should we use strict criteria to monitor, or, in other words, the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact, or should we relax the criteria?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind the House that we are talking about reducing the debt of the Member States in the euro area, and not about increasing debt. I have the impression after listening to this debate that some Members are suggesting we should grant assistance and monitor it, but not put in place any criteria to ensure that it has a real impact. I would like to remind everyone that the objectives have been the same for a long time and that they have not changed. The question is the extent to which they should be implemented. The objective is 3%, and it will never change, but it is not new either; it is an objective we have had in place for a long time, but which has not been put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment relates to the debt redemption fund. We often make the point in this Chamber that some banks use clever tricks to sell money which does not exist. I am afraid that the idea behind this fund is a trick, and it reminds me of the kind of trick which boils down to pretending there is no debt when, in fact, there still is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over recent weeks, we have once again heard evidence of the doublespeak used by certain top European leaders or would-be top leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Though they are all incessantly calling for proper coordination of our economic, budgetary and fiscal policies, and this requirement even seems to be a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for the euro area to survive, once they are comfortably back at home, they consider it smart to criticise the well-balanced recommendations issued by the Commission, to go back on certain commitments or, worst of all, to stir up public opinion against these Brussels diktats, as they call them. Their irresponsible attitude would be laughable if we were not in such a terrible situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I tell you straight: our debates on stability, the necessary stabilisation of public finances or the work to be done to secure growth will be well and truly doomed to failure if the bad old habits of debt and public deficits are not done away with and if the Member States’ governments persist with their nonchalant attitude. Right now, we are playing with fire. European discipline has to apply to everyone without exception, including even the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. That demands a certain amount of courage, and public opinion in our countries is ready for it, even more so than some of their leaders would like to think.</p>

What are we discussing today? We are discussing how we want to bring Parliament and the Member States together in order to establish strict ground rules that will not go the way of all things European, which is to say that, while they may be adopted here, when it comes to application, they no longer play a major role, as we have already experienced in many, many cases – not only with the euro, but elsewhere, too. We want to establish ground rules that really oblige the Member States to do things that are urgently necessary, in order to guarantee that which states were originally created to provide, namely, guaranteeing infrastructure, education, employment, social security and many other things for the people, although not at the expense of future generations or other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore not do the other thing proposed in numerous amendments, which is to say, we should not accompany this obligation with the development of any new sources of funding that have only one purpose, namely, to reward those who have not kept to the rules hitherto and punish those who have.</p>
<p class="contents">A Europe on that basis will not work in the long term. Europe will only work if everyone adheres to the ground rules agreed. The idea of a debt redemption fund must therefore be rejected. Such a fund punishes those who kept their houses in order, to the benefit of those who did not. The idea of eurobonds must therefore be rejected. Such bonds punish those who acted properly and adhered to the rules and reward those who did not.

On these policies, we are in full agreement. In this way, we would be acting <span class="italic">ex post</span> – as the EU has failed to do in this crisis – on sovereign debt. We are therefore in agreement on these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also be sending out a clear signal that the speculation occurring – which is an international phenomenon – must be curbed. We do need a system of effective regulations. That said, this system of rules must be combined with measures to support growth and development that act on both demand and supply. On this point, I think we are duty bound to hold a debate. These are two parallel axes which can and must intersect. We must therefore put growth at the centre by implementing effective and efficient measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s debate, we must also not forget the political facts, because otherwise, we run the risk of simply kidding ourselves. This Chamber must make this its priority again, even overriding state systems. If we really believe in Europe, we need to think about the common good and the good of Europe.

<p class="contents">At present, wrongly in my opinion, two things are being presented in the public sphere as mutually contradictory. There is austerity on one side and growth on the other. So some are saying: ‘The main thing we need is an austerity policy’. Others are saying: ‘The most important thing is to talk about growth. Growth through expenditure’. However, dear friends, if we in Europe should have been able to ensure growth by spending money, there would be no crisis at all. It is therefore completely clear that spending money is not the way we shall achieve growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Stable economic growth, just like a house, requires a solid foundation. It is precisely a prudent government budgetary policy that sets this solid foundation for economic growth. We can take my country Latvia as an example. The government, by putting its budget in order, has now achieved 5% annual growth. Solid foundations, solid growth.</p>

While Heads of State attend football games as they make important economic decisions for our citizens, we are left on the sidelines. It is therefore necessary to support European measures to combat the euro area crisis, a crisis that affects our citizens, in the form of severe cutbacks, particularly in the Member States with the greatest economic difficulties and the highest unemployment rates.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Ms Ferreira in that the policies that undermine solidarity break with the EU road map, but we cannot build a constructive future on a foundation of debt and a paradigm of budgetary discipline. For example, where is the democratic control and the legitimacy in the scandalous rescue of the Spanish Government, where the sole beneficiary is a private bank? Is this an example of the European game we want to play to combat the euro area crisis? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is assumed that an attempt will be made to include the content of the Fiscal Compact in EU secondary legislation. The small problem we find with this is that the Fiscal Compact has not been ratified, nor does it come within EU fundamental law because it is an intergovernmental treaty. This shows that the Commission’s objectives, supported by the majority of this Parliament, are to be imposed on citizens by any means possible, even if they lack legal legitimacy. Is this the European citizenship that the Commission says it wishes to promote? Secondly, it is important to highlight that, as much as the text tries to hide it with words about growth and employment, the measures strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance are nothing more than an enhancement of the Stability and Growth Pact and the eternal institutionalisation of the so-called austerity measures, restricting the budgetary and economic sovereignty of the Member States.</p>

I think that you share the sense of urgency and determination to pursue our joint strategy for sustainable growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">These two draft regulations are indeed very important parts of that strategy in order to address macro-economic imbalances pre-emptively and in order to restore the sustainability of public finances, which is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and employment. Let me comment on two or three key policy issues in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First, with a view to the European Council in mid-June, we need to define the main steps towards full economic union. In that context, our guiding principle should be that, in order to move to further mutualisation, it is necessary in parallel to further strengthen our stability culture. That means, when talking about the prospect of a fiscal union, that more mutualisation of sovereign risk necessarily requires more fiscal integration before it can be acceptable to all. Moreover, more fiscal integration requires more pooling of fiscal sovereignty and that calls for a very profound debate on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">One important avenue to strengthen economic and monetary union (EMU) is to construct a financial union as an essential element of a real and genuine EMU. The main building blocks towards a financial union could include at least larger banks of systemic importance for macro-financial stability in Europe and its regions. It will call for a solid EU euro area compact, including strengthened financial supervision at European level, a resolution authority at European euro area level and a single deposit guarantee scheme at European euro area level – all these in the same arrangement covering at least the euro area’s larger financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic point here is the same as on the fiscal side: the sharing of risk in the guarantee scheme calls for substantially reinforced regulation and supervision at the relevant euro area or European level. In other words, any step in the further sharing of risk can only be taken on the condition that it is balanced by provisions to avoid free riding on the consolidation efforts of other Member States. This applies also to fiscal integration; for instance, the proposal of a debt redemption pact by the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers is no different.</p>
<p class="contents">It is often referred to as a debt redemption fund but that is only part of it; it is a pact which has two sides. This debt redemption pact proposal would balance the suggested mutualisation of debt with very strict fiscal rules for the participating Member States for a very large number of years.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is that? In order to make it rational for all participants to agree to further risk sharing, enhanced economic surveillance must ensure fiscal prudence and minimise moral hazard, which again will require a very fundamental debate about pooling of fiscal sovereignty. This principle applies to the prospective construction of both financial and fiscal union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I shall make some statements on Spain as well, as I find it is a very important subject at this critical juncture. Following the Euro Group’s positive response to Spain’s announcement that it is opting for support from the euro area for the restructuring of its financial sector, the Commission is ready to proceed swiftly with the necessary assessment on the ground, in close alliance with the European Central Bank, the European Banking Authority and the International Monetary Fund, and subsequently to propose appropriate conditionality for the financial sector in Spain. This means that system-wide and financial framework conditionality will include specific recommendations concerning financial sector supervision and regulatory requirements. In addition, bank-specific conditionality subject to State aid rules would be applied exclusively to the banks benefiting from the EFSF/ESM assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">With this thorough restructuring of the banking sector in Spain, together with the ongoing determined implementation of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation, Spain can gradually regain confidence and create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth and job creation. The only objective – and let me underline this – of this euro area decision, which the Commission supports, is to protect the savings of ordinary Spaniards and to enable credit flows to productive enterprises and ordinary households in Spain. This is indeed crucial for returning to recovery and for sustainable growth and job creation which, of course, is our ultimate objective. It is important also for the whole of Europe because this is also being done in order to safeguard financial stability in Europe as a whole.</p>

Many different points have been made, including in relation to how absolutely crucial it is to unify the attempts to again create trust in public budgets and, at the same time, create growth and jobs in European Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened with great interest to the many different contributions this morning. Unfortunately, in the time available, I cannot answer every point raised, but there will be an opportunity to exchange even more highly detailed proposals when we start the trialogue process. There is one comment I have to make though, which is that one of the things that is absolutely crucial is to regain trust in the political leadership, both in Europe and in every individual Member State. There is no way to achieve that trust via crushing debt. Similarly, there is no way to achieve that trust via budgets to which we fail to adhere. Quite simply, it is absolutely crucial that we should see sustainable public budgets and a consolidation of our budgets as a prerequisite for growth, rather than as a brake on it.</p>
<p class="contents">A strong focus on getting control over the money we use goes hand in hand with our focus on growth. It is crucial to create trust in the markets from our side, but also for the markets to hear what is said and react to what is decided. We have before us two sound, decent proposals that help to complete the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact that the Commission, the Council and Parliament very earnestly managed to get implemented. I hope that it will be possible to achieve rapid progress and thus also reach agreement. It is important that we should show that, when it comes to fundamental elements such as sticking to budgetary plans and ensuring adequately robust monitoring of whether deficits are too large, we are willing to find the compromises. It is therefore now that we can show that the community method also works when Europe is in crisis – that we can deliver another crucial contribution to strengthening our economic governance of the conditions that are important in order to exit the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for stressing the necessity of negotiating and getting the trialogue under way quickly. It is important to obtain an agreement, because once we have an agreement, we will be helping to create balance between the responsibility of each individual Member State – which they have been given by their electorates – to manage the economy and get back to the path of growth, and a European dimension, which is inescapable in order to create growth and trust once again. From the Presidency’s side, we look forward to getting the trialogue under way. The debate today has been an important prerequisite and we hope that the vote tomorrow will provide a sound basis for the trialogue to begin as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this will only be achieved if, in addition to the initiatives that focus on discipline, we can add the stipulations of equitably sharing the gains and sacrifices between the different Member States and between our citizens, as well as a sense of hope, the hope that there will be an end to the crisis we are going through. For this hope to be real, we need other initiatives which this Parliament is trying to introduce: initiatives geared towards investment, growth and controlling sovereign debt, which is the obvious Achilles heel and reflects the weakness of the economic systems of some of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you can count on us. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you can count on us. However, the agenda has to be inclusive. The agenda cannot stipulate that discipline comes before all else, nor can it make discipline the be-all and end-all of our EU proposals. Our citizens expect this from us. They can count on Parliament. I would again like to thank our colleagues, the rapporteurs, Mr Gauzès, who is the other rapporteur, and all of the colleagues who, as shadow-rapporteurs or simply active participants in putting the project together, helped to make Parliament’s project more balanced, more solid, and one which I hope will be deserving of respect and warrant discussion in the same constructive and committed spirit we have seen so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The need to limit expenditure is a key issue currently affecting the budgets of the EU’s Member States. The mechanisms included in this ‘two-pack’ – budgetary surveillance by the European Commission in cooperation with the national parliaments – will facilitate budgetary consolidation and allow particular surveillance of countries with excessive budget deficits. This solution will give the EU institutions more influence over the budgetary policies of the Member States, without infringing on democratic procedures. The draft also covers measures aimed at stimulating economic growth. Cuts alone will not be enough to put the economy back on the right track and, what is more, it will be the average citizen who is hit hardest. The draft obliges the Commission and the Member States to adopt solutions which will not stifle either economic growth or investment, particularly in the fields of education and the health service.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take steps in the near future to increase the EU’s budget. We will be able to allocate income from eurobonds or a financial transaction tax, for example, to investment and job creation. Balanced economic growth and budgetary discipline are not mutually exclusive, and Poland provides a good example of this. Thanks to amendments made to the constitution in 1997 imposing budgetary restrictions, even now, the country can still boast GDP growth of almost 4%. The resolution on the MFF will mark the start of a new era of high-quality public finances in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ‘six-pack’, complemented by the ‘two-pack’, is the badly needed ‘medicine’ to achieve further economic growth, financial stability and stronger budgetary discipline. Unfortunately, now we are learning the hard way about the dramatic effects of Member States’ excessive debt. The ‘two-pack’ is needed in order to put in place the legal framework for the work the European Commission is already performing as it is closely linked with the ‘Fiscal Compact Treaty’. Our future growth is dependent on sustainable public finances and budgetary discipline rather than on creating new debt and deficit. Austerity measures should be seen as a stable foundation for future growth in Europe as they are not mutually exclusive concepts. Take, for example, the case of Latvia – the country which, during the crisis, had the greatest budgetary consolidation (17% of its GDP) in the EU and now is the fastest growing economy in the EU27. In the long-term, stability and growth in the euro area are the most crucial factors and stimulus for other EU countries to join in the upcoming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both new legislative proposals foresee provisions for euro area Member States. Unfortunately, the experience of the past years has shown quite well that the difficulties of one Member State can have an effect on the economy of the entire EU, and we must therefore create a mechanism that can protect other euro area Member States from any negative ripple effects. We must not forget that the financial crisis affects not only the euro area but the entire EU. It must be stressed, however, that Hungary is involved in two major fights simultaneously, and we Hungarians must therefore assess the situation based on our own criteria. On the one hand, we must address the serious consequences of the faulty economic policy pursued over the past eight years and, on the other, our country is severely affected by the crisis afflicting the euro. Therefore, one of the most important provisions of Hungary’s new Basic Law is the incorporation of budgetary limits. The aim of this public finance rule is to prevent our country from again falling into debt. Our primary task is to ensure the economic recovery of our country, which requires a continuous reduction in our sovereign debt. In this regard the new constitution represents a new beginning for Hungary. Thanks to the results of this renewal, Hungary is now able to stand on its own two feet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 2009, it has been impossible to reduce unemployment rates as a result of the far too little recovery in the labour market.
