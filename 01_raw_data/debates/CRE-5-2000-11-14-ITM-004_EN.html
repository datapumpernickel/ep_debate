Data collection is not a painless operation and different types of database exist: confidential databases, CID databases, services databases – in short, there is an enormous amount of power. I would stress that in entrusting this huge power of monitoring the European databases to a monocratic body – notwithstanding the total respect and confidence which we have in the Guarantor – we would appear to have momentarily shifted our focus from the central concern of the human person which, in respect of the power of information technology, must be provided with a reference framework of guaranteed rights and freedoms. In my opinion, the proposal to establish a collegiate body would have responded better to this need. However, when we come to discuss the power of information in the future, we must realise that more widespread control, and the consequent provision of a greater guarantee for the human person, is a necessity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To this extent, the creation of an “independent supervisory body” is a positive move.</p>
<p class="contents">However, none of the key questions of safeguarding personal rights and freedoms has been dealt with in a truly explicit fashion and the text, which is often technically confusing, lends itself to divergent interpretations. What is more, it does not go so far as the French legislation on computer technology and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Other proposals should have been included. It should be made mandatory to officially declare the existence of all databases; there must be a ban on merging databases (particularly in the fields of private life, health, social situations, etc.) in order to prevent gigantic databases being created; and, also, employees working with personal data must be given the means to withstand pressure from their employers by the establishment of a code of ethics and a conscience clause of the type that journalists have.</p>

European citizens are worried about the protection of their privacy, and those worries are not unjustified. Every day, enormous amounts of personal data are captured, sorted and processed. Such is the case in connection with credit card payments, tracing the movement of mobile telephones, storing telephone connections, surfing on the internet, processing other data taken, for instance, from forms previously filled in etc.</p>
<p class="contents">On the EU level, the threat of possible abuse of personal data is being countered by two directives, namely Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Directive 97/66/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither of them applies to the EU institutions. And yet there is a need for a set of data protection rules, for the institutions not only process internal data (such as data relating to their autonomous activities, budget and staff reports) but also data collected from citizens in the performance of EU duties (e.g. granting subsidies, investigating competition cases, public tenders, statistical research and studies, data relating to the preparation and implementation of legislation).</p>

This Charter refuses to include such basic rights as the right to a decent retirement pension, the right to a minimum wage, to decent housing, to health care. What is more, exemptions are possible to the article prohibiting children’s work before they have finished their compulsory schooling. This is a serious state of affairs when it is known that, in a number of European countries, an intolerable number of children are working, being exploited and being denied the right to a proper education. The text does not offer any additional protection and gives governments and the wealthy classes further arms to attack in these areas. The right to strike, for example, is acknowledged only with the proviso that it is limited “in accordance with national laws and practices”.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter therefore has no binding force upon countries whose legislation does not go quite so far as the minimum contained in the Charter. In countries whose legislation is more favourable to workers, however, the Charter may be cited to oppose the national legislation in courts of law. Instead of pulling human rights and social rights up to a higher level, the Charter will enable actions that will effectively reduce them to the lowest common denominator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The claim that this is the first time reference has been made to social rights does not stand up: there are references to social rights in international conventions such as the international labour conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we note that:</p>
<p class="contents">- Article 15 states that "everyone has the right to engage in work" but does not recognise the right to a paid job,</p>
<p class="contents">- Article 16 recognises the freedom to conduct a business, the first international text to do so,</p>
<p class="contents">- Article 28 allows employers to take anti-strike action (lock out) and sideline workers organisations in negotiations with employers,</p>
<p class="contents">- Article 3 leaves abundant scope for every form of genetic experimentation,</p>
<p class="contents">- Article 14 recognises the right to education but interprets it simply as being a right to free attendance applicable only to compulsory education.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter has diminished, not extended people's rights, for obvious reasons. Those who dreamed up this Charter are banking on using this weighty document to pursue their aggressive policy against everything the working classes have fought, sacrificed and died for over the past 150 years. If the Charter is adopted at the forthcoming summit in Nice, either by incorporating it into the Treaties or simply by proclamation, it will be a step backwards. There is no doubt that its ultimate purpose is as a precursor to an impending European Constitution which, in turn, will be the jewel in the crown of the EU's attempt to become a federation in which the institutional arrangements are such that decisions are taken by the minority of strong members but apply to everyone, the main purpose being to serve the interests of private monopolies in the European Union, at the expense of the workers and the people in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware of the fact that the Charter may represent a step forward on certain issues for some countries. However, for most countries and in comparison with international provisions already in force, it represents a step backwards. Our aim must be to progress, not to go from bad to worse.</p>

Moreover, the members of the SOS Democracy Intergroup have notified me that they fully endorse these principles. I should now like to list my reservations concerning a number of specific articles. I previously had occasion to table amendments on these in the course of my work as a member of the Convention. These reservations may be classed in five main categories:</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Articles trampling on State competences</span>. Article 2(2) provides a typical example, “No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed.” This declaration does not fall within any sort of European jurisdiction. Its inclusion in the Charter, like the inclusion of many other similar articles, casts doubt on the accuracy of Article 51(2), which states, “This Charter does not establish any new power or task for the Community or the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties.” Of course, if the Charter were to be made binding, then Article 2(2) would also thereby become binding, with far greater power than the European Convention on Human Rights, from which a country is still entitled to opt out.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Articles establishing new obligations without justification.</span> Several articles go further than the existing law. Article 19(1), for example, states that “Collective expulsions are prohibited” but does not specify that this ban may be suspended in the event of war or serious internal public order disturbances. Admittedly, Article 52(2) provides that “Insofar as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention”, but this phrase is far too vague. We have just heard it stated that collective expulsions are prohibited in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another new obligation, as Article 21 adds further instances of non-discrimination to those already laid down under Article 13 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community. Article 21(2) goes so far as to prohibit discrimination based on nationality within the scope of application of the Treaty Establishing the European Community and of the Treaty on European Union, which goes beyond any existing text.</p>
<p class="contents">As a third example of this, Article 45 states that “Freedom of movement and residence may be granted to nationals of third countries legally resident in the territory of a Member State”, even though the law to this effect, as contemplated by Article 62 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, is not currently in force, and perhaps never will be if the conditions are not met.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Articles setting unlawful constraints upon still developing situations</span>. This applies particularly to the economic and social rights listed in Chapter IV of the Charter. Article 29, for example, states that “Everyone has the right of access to a free placement service”, but this is a statement that refers exclusively to the current circumstances, which may be assessed differently at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Articles failing to recognise the natural laws of life in society</span>. Even though the countries of Europe currently find themselves in an alarming demographic position, the Charter deals extremely lightly with the problems of the family. There is no statement, despite our requests, to the effect that a family is made up of a man and a woman raising their children, and that that is the basic unit of society. Article 24, on the rights of the child, even fails to say, once again in spite of our requests, that every child has the right to live with his or her parents. At the same time, the Charter is far too reticent on the existence of national communities and their right to frame their own regulations. For instance, the new requirement for non-discrimination on grounds of language, found in Articles 21 and 22, contradicts the French Constitution which stipulates that the language of the Republic of France is French.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Articles obfuscating or distorting the Charter</span>. I have already mentioned Article 51(1) which states, despite all evidence to the contrary, that the Charter in no way modifies powers or tasks defined by the Treaties. In point of fact, the Charter contains so many contradictions that, some day, someone will have to have the job of unpicking the tangle. In the same vein, I have mentioned 52(2) which claims that the meaning and scope of the rights in the Charter shall be the same as those in the European Convention on Human Rights. The fact is that this approximation is very hard to determine, as it is impossible to tell, when reading the Charter, whether one is dealing with an article which is supposed to be complying with the Convention, or an article which is deliberately distancing itself from it. Finally, let me also mention Article 52(1), which indicates that limitations on rights may be introduced if they “genuinely meet objectives of general interest being pursued by the Union.” Were the Charter to become binding, a phrase such as this would put extreme limitations upon the sovereignty of States.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, we regret the fact that the preamble to the Charter did not put the document in perspective by pointing out that the European Union is an association of nations and that citizens have the fundamental right to have the decision they have taken democratically at national level respected. As I stated in the debate prior to this vote, my hope is that if the governments meeting in Nice wish to adopt this Charter as a political statement, they will preface it with an introductory statement to this effect and pointing out the basic jurisdiction of national parliaments over citizens’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu, Bonde, Camre, Deva, Hannan, Helmer, Ribeiro e Castro and Sumberg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">in writing</span>.<span class="bold"> –</span> SOS Democracy rejects the Charter of Fundamental Rights on three grounds. First, that it is unnecessary. Second, that it is undemocratic. And third, that it is likely to restrict, rather than enhancing, the freedom of Europe's peoples. We shall offer a brief explanation of these three objections in order.</p>
<p class="contents">Ratifying the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms would be one of the most ambitious steps ever taken by the European Union. Before doing something of such magnitude, we should ask the question: where in Western Europe is the monstrous violation of human rights that this document would address? We are dealing, after all, with 15 modern democracies, not with 15 Rwandas.</p>
<p class="contents">Every Member State is already bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN's Universal Declaration and a host of lesser accords. Why does the EU, as such, need to muscle in on this territory?</p>
<p class="contents">No one has yet answered that question. Indeed, Roman Herzog, president of the drafting convention, has gone out of his way to claim that the Charter will not create any new rights. If so, it seems strange to enact so great a constitutional revolution for such small purported gain.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights may not be under immediate threat in the EU, but accountable democracy is. The Charter will involve the European Court of Justice in a number of political decisions, in fields as diverse as employment law, extradition policy, immigration and the family. To the extent that no one has elected the judges, this represents a diminution of democratic government.</p>
<p class="contents">More than this, the Charter will oblige the ECJ to strike down national legislative acts, or even provisions of state constitutions, in several new areas of policy. Since the ECJ, on the basis of the far more restricted text of the existing European treaties, has already displayed a worrying tendency towards judicial activism, this problem is likely to be especially acute.</p>
<p class="contents">Even those who accept the case for a written EU constitution should hesitate as they contemplate some of the Charter's provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of greatest concern is Article 52, which provides for the rights referred to elsewhere in the document to be set aside where they conflict with the "general interest recognised by the Union". This reintroduces the concept of "<span class="italic">raison d'Etat</span>" which the Council of Europe has spent the last half-century seeking to eradicate. The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny. In Nazi Germany, for example, this provision existed under the so-called "Enabling Act".</p>
<p class="contents">Less dramatically, but no less important, the Charter is badly drafted. Take, for example, Article 21, which prohibits "any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation". Taken literally, this article would mean that a socialist party would not be allowed to discriminate against conservatives who wanted to run as its candidates, or that an opera company would have to offer soprano roles to men. How such vaguely drafted provisions will be used in the hands of an activist court is anyone's guess.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights are already respected in the EU, and safeguarded by national constitutional provisions according to the different customs of the Member States. The Charter now provides a mechanism to circumscribe or override these rights, without even pretending to offer any new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a proud boast of many Europeans that we are free to do anything which is not expressly prohibited in law. Yet now it is proposed that we be "given" our rights by European judges. SOS Democracy rejects the notion that we should depend on the EU to bestow our own freedoms upon us. In the words of Aldous Huxley: "Liberties are not given: they are taken".</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The debate on this Charter has been eagerly applauded by EU federalists who wish to see it as the beginning of a constitution for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We nonetheless see a great danger in this Charter. It is in danger of undermining the Council of Europe’s work on human rights and of leading to a situation in which human rights are dealt with in different ways in European countries in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are voting against this Charter because we do not want it at all. That does not mean that we are opposed to human rights as such.

<p class="contents">The consensus method adopted by the Convention members has produced, as is generally the case when unanimity is enforced, a minimal Charter characterised by significant omissions and ambiguities. The original idea behind the Convention was to have a text adopted by consensus which could subsequently be made binding by the fifteen Member State governments when it was incorporated into the Treaties. In the end it was a fool’s bargain that was struck: the text is actually neither strong nor binding.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of Europe have scant need of a formal declaration on the fundamental rights they are entitled to because these are recognised elsewhere in international conventions and in national law. I do not think that an outcome of this kind is going to convince many people of the value of developing the European Union. Let us move on to other matters. The Charter is an unsuccessful exercise. Politics is being smothered by too much symbolism and an excessive insistence on unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">If citizens are to feel involved in the European Union, its policies and institutions, then it is up to the Members of Parliament in particular to disclose more of the critical decisions, the contradictions, the divergent interests and projects driving the economic and social operators within the European arena. Everyday topical events, from maritime transport to animal meal, show us that the markets and economic operators must be much better regulated and controlled and that established short-term profit-making interests must be opposed. We need better European legislation to improve the quality of life for all and to improve social welfare systems.

Enhanced with a “Charter of Fundamental Rights”, Social Europe would at long last take on a social character.</p>
<p class="contents">But nothing of the sort has been achieved. This Charter represents a social step backwards as regards democracy and freedoms, falling short of the terms of the Treaties currently in force. Great pressure had to be exerted before the right to join trade unions and the right to strike were at last included. Except for a few general comments, women have the right to “marry” and “found a family”, while immigrants have the right not to be subjected to “collective expulsion”.</p>
<p class="contents">Social rights simply do not feature. There is no right to work, just the “right to engage in work”; there is no right to social protection or accommodation, just “the right to social assistance and housing assistance”; there is no right to a retirement pension or a minimum income; there is no ban on redundancies, just the “right to protection against unjustified dismissal”. In fact, the fight against social exclusion is relegated to the level of assistance, instead of imposing a requirement for basic rights binding upon employers and states. Yet, on the other hand, the Charter of course gives the right to property and the freedom to conduct a business more than their due.</p>
<p class="contents">For all the above reasons, this Charter must not be incorporated into the Treaties of the European Union, and we cannot accept the text as it is currently worded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that only have two options, my decision is unequivocally to vote in favour of the step forward which this Charter represents, however small that step forward may be in terms of the content and scope of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all we should take another look at the approach adopted. While the Convention method is a valuable one, and productive in terms of drawing up a basic text that is seeking a broad compromise, all the same nothing can justify depriving the European Parliament, the physical representatives of the peoples of Europe, of the opportunity to amend and enrich the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet when a historian looks into the way in which the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen or other similar international declarations were drawn up, he perceives the extent to which parliamentary debate and the amendment process were able to lend inspiration, significance and also ambition to these fundamental texts which are still powerful today.</p>
<p class="contents">At this time when debate in the institutions of Europe is being undertaken concomitantly with the Charter being adopted, all those men and women who, like myself, would like a European constitution and consider that this Charter may serve as the bare bones for the preamble to such a constitution should demand that the European Parliament be enabled to vote on the content, as part of its normal parliamentary business, which is basically deliberative.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this institutional debate, it is essential to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties of the European Union so that the rights that have been declared can be guaranteed for all and the state policies required to implement them can be developed either by the Member States or by the European Union itself, without conflicting with the existing legal texts. It must be acknowledged that the law of free competition and the single market too often prevails over all other requirements and effectively flouts social rights and fundamental rights. We have seen too many declarations that were not followed up in practice. This is therefore the first priority: we must give this Charter real legal force.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the actual content of the Charter is ambiguous and inadequate on some counts. In the first place, there are discrepancies between the German and French versions which raise major questions about the references to “religious” or “spiritual” values. Personally, I am convinced that secularism is a liberating factor for the modern world. I deplore the ambiguity of these terms and also the lack of a clearer reference to secularity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the right to work is not directly stated. Anyone can see that a provision stating that “every person has the right to work” is really not that ambitious. The difference between not prohibiting access to work and taking action to make it possible to work is more than just a shade of meaning. The Charter should have clearly stated the right to work, and indeed the right to housing, which was also expressed in a roundabout way, affording little protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter must be improved, and the European Parliament must propose a strategy enabling it to be updated and enriched. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, I decided to abstain for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="contents">1. The Charter sets out important fundamental rights. However, in its present form, it fails to do justice to the demand for social justice, as I understand it, in several important areas. It does not include the right to work or the right to housing. Similarly, the social responsibility of ownership has been left out. It has already been assumed that the Charter might form the basis for a European constitution. That makes including fundamental social rights even more important.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The Charter is the outcome of the work of a broad-based convention which sat in public. That is, without doubt, an improvement on how documents of such fundamental importance are usually drafted. Nonetheless, it does not substantiate the EU's claim to be a union of peoples and their citizens. If the Charter is to be an expression of the common values of the people of the European Union, those people must be given an opportunity to debate it. It should not therefore be decided and proclaimed at the Council summit in Nice; on the contrary, the summit should prompt a European debate on the Charter. That would give us a chance to restore a Europe of the people and of broad civil involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The Charter contains some lofty claims but imposes no concomitant obligation and cannot therefore be enforced by the citizens of Europe. The citizens' Europe we are striving for must establish such recourse.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons I abstained from voting during the plenary session of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In future, will its clauses have a merely symbolic value or will they become binding for Community institutions and, consequently, for the European public?</p>
<p class="contents">We are very familiar with the position held by the majority in this Parliament. In this catalogue of rights, the devotees of European federalism see the embryo of a future European Constitution, which the Member States’ national constitutions will have to accommodate. We understand their position when they try to give a qualitatively diverse political meaning to a text on fundamental rights, which is not only vague and all-encompassing, but is also going to be of arguable usefulness in an EU that has no serious shortcomings, either in the legal status of its rights or in the way in which these rights are defended and implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately the prevailing tendency of national governments seems to indicate the sensible path to take, which is to see the Charter as having power that is merely political rather than binding. The great political debate on the Charter will therefore take place firstly between national governments and then, eventually, when this Parliament is confronted with their decision. Meanwhile, as I said at the beginning of this explanation of vote, the only approach I could adopt was to abstain from voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaker after speaker, with a few exceptions, referred to the need for a Europe with constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="contents">These statements confirm the concerns expressed within my country that this Charter is intended to be the preamble to a European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently our Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, clearly stated that the European Charter of Fundamental Human Rights should remain a political, not a legal document. Members of the Irish government have recently raised questions regarding whether Brussels threatens Irish identity and Mr Ahern, whilst affirming Ireland's EU membership as fundamental to its prosperity and economic success, firmly resisted any rapid movement to a more federal – centralised – Europe, as it would go well beyond what most Europeans currently wish for or are prepared to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of Ireland's national position and in tune with the wishes of my constituents, I must vote against this Charter of Fundamental Human Rights which, despite being a simple political statement at this time is, by all evidence, intended to be the preamble to a European Constitution which will take precedence over the constitution of my country and the will of the Irish people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I did so primarily to denounce the anti-democratic way in which it was produced. From start to finish, the framing of the Charter gave rise to a series of takeovers by force:</p>
<p class="contents">A semantic appropriation, at the outset, regarding the name of the body drafting the Charter. Established as “a body” by the Cologne Summit, it declared itself a “Convention”, a name with unfortunate connotations of 1793 when the French Revolution degenerated into the Reign of Terror under another “Convention”.</p>
<p class="contents">An appropriation of parliamentary authority. The Court of Justice is going to be able to impose the terms of this text, whose definitive version was finalised by a Praesidium operating in a far from transparent manner, upon the citizens of our countries, even though it will not even have been ratified by our national parliaments, who, nonetheless, have exclusive jurisdiction over human rights issues! As for the Members of the European Parliament, they were not only refused the right to table amendments to the text of the Charter, but were also forced to vote on the Charter as a whole, which runs counter to the most basic democratic rules.</p>
<p class="contents">A takeover instigated against a whole raft of fundamental rights which, worryingly, were discarded from the text. So, for example, the absolutely basic fundamental right of the child to live with its father and mother, even though such a provision was expressly and insistently requested by a number of “Convention” members, was not adopted. The basic right to a nation, which was also demanded and which is also fundamental, was also censored. Any references to the religious heritage of our nations, even though this is explicitly mentioned in the majority of the fundamental texts governing our States, including France, making reference to the Supreme Being, and even though such references were included in the initial text of the Charter, were eliminated following pressure from several sides but particularly, it appears, from the representatives at the highest level of some Member States, in the name of an obscurantism which mistakes the exclusion of any religious reference from the state sector for legitimate secularism.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, the haggling that this type of process inevitably leads to resulted in our weighing the notion of Europeans’ “religious heritage” against the promotion of “free enterprise”. No surprise as to what won the day. The limitations of the rule of consensus applied in this sort of context may be gauged by observing the Ubuesque and frankly grotesque choices it gives rise to.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately there is nothing European about the text of the Charter. As it stands, it could be adopted by just about any country in the whole world. The lot of processes of this nature is to produce texts which necessarily boil down to the lowest common denominator. The value of the content of such an exercise, quite apart from its illegitimacy, given that the European Union has no jurisdiction in the field of human rights, cannot clearly be seen since, in Europe, our freedoms are protected remarkably well by the founding texts of our nations and by the European Convention on Human Rights. The method used, the cuts made and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of the text, on the other hand, shed a harsh light on the new totalitarian agitators at work at the very heart of the process of European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These texts have two points in common. Firstly, they are mutually complementary, extending Europol’s competence, setting up a Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit, improving reciprocal assistance in judicial matters between Member States and defining more clearly the conditions for the fight against money laundering which is the result, or the cause, or in any case a necessary component in a great many very serious crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, these texts are all based on initiatives by Member States, coming under either the third pillar of Article 67 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, where the Commission does not have the monopoly on the right of initiative. Let me point out in passing that seven of the reports presented during this part-session have been in response to national initiatives, proving that where this system is implemented, it is proving to be very productive. Moreover, it is developing forms of cooperation that give greater respect to national sovereignty, as is shown by the initiative of the French Republic dealt with in the Roure report, which manages to reconcile mutual assistance in judicial matters and respect for the key interests of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We supported these initiatives in general, except where the European Parliament amendments were tending to introduce too much of a federalist bias. We do, however, deeply regret the fact that a fifth text, the Ceyhun report on the two initiatives by the French Republic seeking to step up controls on illegal immigration was referred back to committee. The arguments put forward by the European Parliament are completely fallacious. The fact is, this House wishes to interfere with everything but draws the line at supporting the decisions which nonetheless lie at the heart of the responsibilities of States in order to protect their own peoples. Fortunately, in this field, the European Parliament still has only a consultative role until the Treaty of Amsterdam is fully implemented, yet it is still finding occasion to abuse this role by putting the brake on reasonable decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament had already pinpointed the omissions in this directive, and the Commission recently tabled a proposal taking Parliament’s comments into consideration. The Council’s common position has not been officially recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">The report under discussion today is a direct result of the commitment made at the European Council in Tampere, in October 1999, to combat this scourge of money laundering which amounts to between 2 and 5% of the world’s GDP every year.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency made this one of the priorities on its agenda, and has therefore planned a set of legislative measures to create a legal framework broad enough to encompass the crime of money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had proposals, firstly, to extend Europol’s competence to cover money laundering – the Karamanou report – and, secondly, for a raft of measures to improve international cooperation in the field of mutual assistance in criminal matters – the Roure report. These two reports were put to the vote today, and I voted in favour of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marinho report now seeks to extend the principle of the mutual recognition of national measures for the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime, established by the Joint Action 98/699/JHA in 1998, to decisions in the pre-court phase, especially those enabling the competent authorities to take rapid action to obtain evidence and seize easily transportable assets.</p>
<p class="contents">These proactive measures are absolutely essential in order to combat this phenomenon, which has continually grown and taken on an international dimension. As Conclusion 51 of the Tampere European Council states, “Money laundering is at the very heart of organised crime. It should be rooted out wherever it occurs.”</p>

Special action against money laundering was proposed in Tampere in 1999. The European Council, noting that serious forms of crime increasingly have tax and duty aspects, called upon the Members States to provide full mutual legal assistance in the investigation and prosecution of this type of crime and for the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering. It was accepted that the principle of mutual recognition should also apply to pre-trial orders, in particular to those which would enable competent authorities quickly to secure evidence and seize assets, which are easily moveable.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this initiative the French Presidency proposes the adoption of a framework decision for the approximation of criminal law and procedures on money laundering (e.g. tracing, freezing and confiscating funds).</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this report and the French initiative will undoubtedly assist in the fight against money laundering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The drugs and arms trades, illegal waste dumping, leaving consumers non-plussed with poor quality products, banking secrecy and tax havens undoubtedly contribute to the much championed economic growth. Yet they clearly run counter to the interests of human beings and the conservation of our environment. The right to property appears almost to be sacrosanct. That was the case a century ago, and although there was a crack down, it is now back in full force. Therefore any move to improve our chances of depriving those who profit from illegal financial practices of their gains, is a step in the right direction. This subject has also been seized on with a view to enhancing cooperation between European police forces. It sometimes seems as though this objective takes precedence over the fight against white-collar crime. In practice, such cooperation could primarily be deployed, once in a while, for purposes other than the fight against money laundering. This has an adverse effect on the rights of citizens who do not commit such crimes. Therefore the best solution would be for banks and other enterprises to place their books fully in the public domain, and to develop democratic control over the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Crime is one of the greatest concerns of our constituents and many strongly support criminals being put under lock and key. We must be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime so that from Manchester to Madrid, our citizens are safe and are afforded full protection from criminals throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Money laundering feeds the trade in drug-trafficking. Existing EU law is clearly not enough to stem the tide of the reported USD 590 billion which is laundered world-wide every year. We welcome the French Presidency's initiative aimed at improving cooperation between national authorities responsible for tackling money laundering and laying down uniform penalties. All Member States should treat money laundering as a criminal offence carrying a minimum sentence of four years' imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">Further measures are being voted on by the European Parliament this week in our efforts to crack down on international crime. We are looking to extend the remit of Europol – the European Police Cooperation Unit – to cover serious international crime. We also want to remove legal barriers which prevent the extradition of suspected criminals accused of money laundering or other related offences involving illicit funds. This will be an important tool in allowing criminals to be tried across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">These reports are crucial if the single market is not to become a free market for criminals. The last thing we want is that the single market allows criminals to enter the single market unseen by the back door. These measures drafted by Socialist MEPs are an important step in combating international crime and I urge the House to support these reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I saw an extremely long queue of pensioners and elderly people. One of them, the last in the line, recognised me and asked me: ‘Why is this queue so long?’.

We also support the future establishment of a convention to help combat organised crime and money laundering, and the various measures proposed in order to achieve those purposes. The idea of creating an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe is, obviously, an aspiration that we share.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the strict limitation of the reasons for which the Member States may refuse to provide judicial cooperation solely to “essential interests,” thus excluding the notions of sovereignty, public order and national security in force up until now is a step forward, but is still inadequate. This is mainly because we still find it unacceptable for a State to be able to invoke a “general interest” in order to be able to deny judicial cooperation in criminal matters. This shows, once again, that the Member States have a long way to go in understanding the meaning of shared sovereignty. Moreover, I should point out, as a Member representing Basques and Catalans, that there continues to be an emphasis on cooperation between States, without taking into account that in the EU other police forces operate that are not State bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">This report and, in general, the area of freedom, safety and justice in Europe, is based on democracy and on the rule of law that should reign in the EU. Therefore, what most concerns me about the future of legal cooperation in the EU is that currently some States are proposing criminal reforms that are bordering on the violation of human rights. As you will be aware, the Spanish government has initiated a reform of criminal law to make sentences tougher for certain types of crimes. Specifically, this special legislation is considering sentences of up to ten years in prison for children of 14 years of age, not to mention other measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that Europe needs to construct the area of freedom, security and justice that we so often cite in our speeches. We will be the first to support it. However, I would like to draw your attention to the possible reforms of criminal law that could take place in various Member States such as Spain, for example, with the Partido Popular in power – which is taking advantage of a certain situation – because these reforms are still a concern for the Europe of freedom and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I voted against this document because I was astounded to find that the explanatory statement of the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, clearly affirms that the procedures for implementing this programme, which has distributed EUR 665 million, have been irregular. I regret to say that it informs us that some of the members of the committees responsible for allocating the European funds for research in the sectors of hunting and fisheries also benefited from this research. I therefore feel that we should be much more careful in carrying out our financial activities in respect of research programmes than we are at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
