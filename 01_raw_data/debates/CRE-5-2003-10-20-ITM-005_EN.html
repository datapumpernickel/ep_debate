Unfortunately, there are some risks linked to bathing in natural waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Bathing waters may be contaminated by bacteria which originate from households, hotels or maybe office buildings. Agriculture may also be a source of contamination and cattle and livestock can pollute rivers and lakes. As a consequence, where they are placed at risk bathers may contract gastro-enteritis, ear or eye infections, or even more serious illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">To reduce the risks related to bathing, a bathing water directive was introduced in 1976. This directive has performed particularly well, and nowadays almost 95% of Europe's bathing waters conform to the quality standards it laid down, as opposed to only 60% ten years ago. Still, we have to look to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The current bathing water directive is based on health and hygiene standards from the 1960s and these have since evolved. Social standards have also changed and these days public information and involvement have become cornerstones of good governance. The legislative-style approach at the heart of the 1976 directive is outdated, since it is based only on monitoring and on measuring, not on the proactive and sound management of bathing waters.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just a few of the reasons why the Commission organised the long and thorough public and stakeholder consultation and came up with a new proposal for a bathing water directive which seeks a common and comparable level of protection for all EU waters and all bathers, whether in major tourist resorts or in traditional local bathing sites.</p>
<p class="contents">This new proposal supports the concept of beach management and public information and participation, but most of all it stands for stricter health standards, thanks to which our children will be able to bathe in safer waters, reducing risks of illness linked to bathing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an inflexible directive based on obsolete data. However, we have to admit that this old directive is popular among Europeans, and indeed, the Commissioner was right to point out that it has been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clearly thanks to this old directive that much of the bathing water that was polluted not so long ago is now much cleaner. The proposal for revision, submitted by the Commission, is more flexible; it takes the inflexibility out of the existing directive and is, as such, an improvement. Of the nineteen parameters that were required for measurement in the old directive, only two remain, which is actually adequate to achieve the result that is required.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1976, which is before the European Parliament was directly elected for the first time, our thinking about the environment, but also about issues such as subsidiarity, has, of course, fundamentally changed. We should, therefore, question whether the Union should, in fact, decide about what the quality of bathing water should be, whether Europe is better equipped than the Member States to do this, and whether there is a cross-border effect.</p>
<p class="contents">During the initial discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I called these aspects into question and I have to say that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy answered 'yes' to all of those questions and affirmed that it is necessary to uphold such a directive and to improve it. My own group does not agree with this and has therefore tabled an amendment. In any case, this forces us to revisit this question of subsidiarity. Moreover, the committee itself was also somewhat confused. After all, in the directive, reference is made to the interests of tourism, but this also touches upon an internal market directive, while surely, as everyone knows, we are dealing here with a directive that should actually protect public health. However, the legal basis of the directive is the environment. In short, there is confusion all round. In actual fact, I am wondering whether it is not simply the case that we are keeping this directive, not because of a need, but simply because it is there.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of information is crucial. There is no doubt in my mind too that here lies an essential European task, namely consumer protection and information which should be more easily accessible to bathers and users of bathing water. This can be done via the Internet, but I myself do not always have my laptop on the beach, so alternatives will need to be sought to make it obvious to bathers whether the water is clean or not. In this context, the system of smileys, for example, proposed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, strikes me as excellent. It should be up-to-date information, that is, not last year's information, but current, weekly information, because this would actually be of some use to bathers.</p>
<p class="contents">This information must be universally accessible. We could copy the example of the blue flag. Although this is not an EU initiative, it is nonetheless a well-known, popular and effective system. The drawback of the blue flag is that it is only introduced upon application and as such, cannot be found in bathing sites that have made the conscious decision not to apply for it. In addition, blue flags cost money.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether the quality of bathing water will improve purely on the basis of this improved information. Take the blue flag as an example, and see how it upsets bathing sites when they lose their blue flag. Would this not have a better effect than tightening the standards all the time? The proposed higher standards are, in my view, rather open to question anyway. Both the EU's own scientific committee and the World Health Organisation take the view that it is, in fact, impossible to establish scientific standards at international level, given the huge national differences. As a result, the higher standards are somewhat questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I feel sorry for those governments who say that they are in favour of higher standards as long as they do not need to adhere to them. I understand that this is also an argument that is heard in different quarters in the Council. I think this is wrong. If they say that they want stricter standards, fine. But they should, of course, adhere to them too. Those stricter standards mean that, for example, in the United Kingdom, or in my own country, the Netherlands, 30% of the bathing water that is still considered good would then become 'bad'. What will the Commission do then? Will we be inundated with infringement proceedings? Will we be closing beaches? Are we not more likely to run the risk that such beaches will simply no longer be designated as bathing water, while people continue to swim in it?</p>
<p class="contents">The public health effect is therefore not achieved by prescribing higher standards. As far as this is concerned, we would have also preferred a cost-benefit analysis by the Commission. Where, for example, are all those sick tourists now on which these higher standards are based? According to scientists, these sick tourists should be around, but we have not seen any of them, not even a glimpse. The question is whether we have found a solution to a problem or whether we have created a problem for a solution that was there all along. It remains, of course, to be seen whether the new Member States can meet these old standards, never mind the new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that I am pleased with the compromise tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. It leads to better information to bathers and to other recreational users, better bathing water quality and also to deregulation and simpler legislation. Together with the improvements introduced by the Commission, I think that, on balance, we will arrive at improved legislation after all, on the understanding, of course, that Europe should legislate in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year, at the onset of summer, the Commission draws up, on the basis of the 1976 directive, the survey of bathing waters. Not only does the European public take note of this information, but over two million visits are also made to the relevant websites. It is an established fact that bathing waters have become substantially cleaner right across Europe. In 2002, despite positively diluvian rainfall and flooding, as much as 98.5% of Europe’s coastal waters complied with the directive’s specifications. There are several reasons why it makes sense to revise the directive after over a quarter of a century. Scientific and technical knowledge have expanded at breakneck speed, any revision is to draw on the experience of up to twenty-six years of applying the directive in practice – dependent on the length of time the country has been a Member State of the European Union, the water framework directive is to be harmonised with the bathing water directive, protection of the health of bathers is to be further improved, and, last of all, the simplification of the existing laws is worth striving towards.</p>
<p class="contents">My group shares the Commission’s intention to improve the quality of bathing water. Bathing should be promoted as a sensible leisure activity, as should the use of bathing waters for tourism in all our Member States. It is evident from what is now many years of experience that the greatest dangers to human health when bathing are presented by faecal matter finding its way into bathing waters as a result of inadequate treatment of waste water or from stock rearing. The new rules are intended to reduce from 19 to 2 the number of parameters to be measured and to treat intestinal enterococci and <span class="italic">Escherichia coli </span>as leading indicators; these two standards are to be made substantially more rigorous, but, by way of contrast, chemical parameters are disregarded and are no longer to be measured, as they are governed by other directives. Samples are to be taken less frequently if a constantly high level of water quality is found over a period of three years. The quality of bathing water is to be ascertained on the basis of changes over the past three years and no longer on the basis of one single year, so one-off eventualities – such as poor weather conditions – will be less markedly apparent. These factors would also reduce the costs involved in implementing the directive in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group also sees it as important that the provision of information on water quality should be improved, and that it should be more extensively disseminated via the media and the Internet. With that in mind, we endorse the Commission’s objective and also the amendments tabled to that end. Our amendments, however, are intended to bring about objectivity and simplicity and, above all, to avoid further increases in costs; hence, we do not want leisure activities to be included, and the management policies required strike us as every bit as over-the-top as the newly-introduced bathing water profiles<span class="italic">.</span> These measures will help make matters simpler in so far as they dovetail with the water framework directive; otherwise, our group takes the view that the principle of subsidiarity requires that local and regional circumstances be taken into account and dealt with in a flexible way. Some of the Commission’s proposals already run counter to these considerations, but a number of amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy even more so, and so we want to vote against these items. I see it as important that all the Member States have gathered a great deal of experience, and I take the view that we should stop trying to reinvent the wheel.</p>

I should also like to say thank you to the Commission, which I think has come up with a very balanced proposal for the new bathing water directive which takes account of developments over the last 26 years. I think it is right to limit the number of parameters, and I also think that the correct limit values for bacteria content have been found.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we in the committee have adopted some improvements, and I should like to draw attention to a few of these. We have secured a sound context in the shape of the water framework directive and, above all, we have ensured that there is reliable, comprehensible information for people, including bathers, about the quality of bathing water without our rushing into having enormous flag displays on our beaches. I also think it is right also to include other leisure activities, such as windsurfing, in the directive. A lot has happened in the 26 years since the first bathing water directive was drafted. I think that the new directive has been designed in such a way, and with such a code of practice, as to enable the individual Member States reasonably to administer it.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing I want to emphasise is that a majority of us in the committee reached the view that the bathing beaches or bathing waters concerned must be those that attract large numbers of bathers so that, in this case too, we support the Commission’s definition of what kind of bathing waters we are talking about. I think that this rule too is one that the national authorities will be able reasonably to administer.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to warn against two of the amendments tabled. The first is Amendment No 19 on transitory contamination. It is a proposal whereby the authorities would now be able to disregard water samples, even if they revealed contamination and health hazards, if the same authorities simply choose to characterise the contamination as transitory. The arrangement would mean that bathers would be in danger of being told that the bathing water in question was of good or excellent quality, even if the water were in reality contaminated. This would be an impairment of the directive, and I hope the proposal is not adopted. I understand that transitory contamination is partly a Scottish problem, and I think that, if there are problems on some Scottish beaches, these should be solved in Scotland, rather than have the reduction in bathing water quality extended to the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal to which I wish to draw attention is Amendment No 76 concerning the definition of bathing water. It is a definition that would lead to the authorities having to go out on a daily basis to count the number of bathers on the beaches. There would have to be more than 100 bathers a day for at least 20 days a year. I think this amendment should be rejected for a number of reasons. First of all, it would involve giving unduly detailed direction to the Member States in a way that would be entirely contrary to the principle of subsidiarity. Secondly, it would, in my view, be practically impossible to administer. Who on earth would count the bathers every day out on the beaches of Europe. I would say that, if this proposal is adopted, we shall simply be a laughing stock throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The water is better and cleaner in the Netherlands and in the rest of Europe. A new bathing water directive is now before us with less red tape, with only two parameters left, but with stricter standards, which is to be welcomed. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has struck sensible compromises. Mr Maaten, the rapporteur, wanted, and still wants, to abolish this directive. Fortunately, the Liberals are on their own with this view. Europe is more than a market and currency. The Netherlands will need to make an effort to comply with both the old and the new directive, and take action instead of moaning. Thanks to the warmer climate, people will swim more frequently and other types of water recreation will also be introduced. The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are good, except for Amendment No 19. For the sake of a few hundred Scottish sheep, there is a huge loophole in legislation. Intensive farming in the Netherlands also suffers from the spread of disease during heavy rainfall. In the Netherlands, the cows became ill and measures were taken. This should be our response, and not an enormous loophole in what, let me add, is also sound legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The old directive took account of pollution levels that, fortunately, no longer exist. Ninety to ninety-five per cent of bathing water complies with the standards. It is time we moved the bar up a few notches and looked for new challenges. Accordingly, I support the tightening of the standards and do not back the rapporteur's proposal to weaken them. After all, even with these new standards in place, 1 in 20 bathers fall ill, so the standards are certainly not too high.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal also contains less successful features, one of which is the definition of 'bathing water'. Water becomes bathing water when a large number of bathers are in it. It is not clear what constitutes a large number. The Spanish costas are peopled by tens of thousands of bathers, the Finnish lakes by a few individuals. Yet, both must fall within the scope of the definition. The Commissioner could perhaps explain how this should be done in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Attention still needs to be given to how the public are to be provided with information. The Commission's website is, in itself, a good initiative, but who takes their computers with them to the beach? This is why the placing of signs with information at the relevant locations – although labour-intensive in terms of maintenance – is the best solution, because it will reach the highest number of bathers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">He states, namely, that proactive water policy has a positive impact on the well-being of recreational water users, and I could not agree with him more. He also ties this in with a better provision of information for the recreational water users. I think that the directive should definitely be revised in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Casting my mind back, however, I notice that we still have problems with the old bathing water directive. I still remember the nightly debates in the Dutch Lower Chamber, when we discussed the introduction of the then directive. It has to be said that, at present, infringement proceedings are still pending against the Netherlands by the European Commission, because the quality of our inland bathing waters is not up to standard.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also major discrepancies in Europe. In the Netherlands, there are 557 designated inland bathing waters, in Great Britain only eleven; there are nine in Ireland and four in Greece. Stricter quality is now being enforced – I have nothing against stricter quality – and Parliament would like to extend the directive's scope to include all forms of recreation. However, if we want to protect all recreational water users who ingest water at European level, then I think we are going one step too far, even if I would want to give these tourists, these recreational water users, these bathers nothing but the best quality.</p>
<p class="contents">With these higher standards, I think that many of our bathing waters will no longer receive the 'bathing water' label, at any rate not in the Netherlands. I think, then, that we should all take another good look at the amendments and ask ourselves how much we would exactly stand to gain from them. Things have to improve, we need better information and more streamlined legislation, but I think that the introduction of higher standards at this moment in time, given the proceedings that are still pending, is taking matters too far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question remains as to how we take account of the fact that bathing waters and bathing facilities vary from one European region to another.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission proposal a bathing site falls within the scope of this directive when a large number of people go there. It has already been said here that it is quite difficult to say what a large number actually means: a large number where there are a lot of people, or a large number where, for example, there are 20 kilometres of beach per inhabitant and public right of access? How, moreover, do we define a bathing site and ensure that attending to measurements and water quality does not become too bureaucratic? My friend, Torben Lund, here thought it absurd to have a proposal that defines a bathing site according to how many bathers go there, and according to which the authorities must define it as a bathing site. In my view, it is just as absurd for the Commission to take Finland to court because measurements have not been carried out there with respect to some beach that everybody knows to be clean, and where the quality of the water is even known to be excellent, just because the definition of a bathing site has these problems associated with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this kind of flexibility is brought to the directive in the proper way, but at the same time I hope that these issues of public health with regard to the citizens of Europe are also taken proper account of in this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are the kinds of questions that arise from the Maaten report on the proposal for a directive concerning the quality of bathing water.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that neither public health nor tourism are Community competences, but remain the competence of the Member States, does Europe have to legislate on this matter and on what basis? In my opinion, the only argument in favour is that the public is better informed. But why make the microbiological thresholds more stringent while not providing for any threshold for chemical quality? It is also important to underline the difficulty of compiling an inventory of all sources of pollution, particularly in estuaries, which are located at the outlets of very large catchment areas drained by rivers.</p>
<p class="contents">Why extend the directive to water sports and other recreational activities? Is the intention, in the long term, to ban surfing, windsurfing, kayaking and rowing because the water is deemed to be unsuitable for bathing? These activities are often enjoyed in places other than in bathing water and sometimes out of season. Why centralise the data on the Commission site, which seems to be costly and of limited benefit? Who takes their computer with them on holiday to find out whether they can bathe within microbiological safety limits? Local radio and the traditional display signs, which are easy to update, are, in my view, quite sufficient to inform the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal to define a beach as a place usually visited by more than 100 bathers for at least 20 days during the bathing season is bordering on the ridiculous. Who is going to be counting? As usual, of course, no one is mentioning the cost of the measures or the substantial economic impact that a ban on bathing would have. It is not up to the directive to set out the cases in which bathing will be prohibited, as this decision should be the exclusive competence of the Member States. Even if it does make waves, we should respect subsidiarity, all the more so when the WHO has just published a practical guide to bathing water which could serve as a reference for the Member States. That is why we will be supporting the proposal to reject the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should bear in mind that it is a bathing waters directive, not a recreation directive, so we should not venture into the deeper waters of boating and deep sea diving: we should instead restore it to what it started off as – a bathing water directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also right that we look at seasonal bathing and do not try to cover the whole year. We should look at places where bathing actually takes place and where that is so designated by a Member State. It is sensible to simplify the two key tests relating to public health – on gastro-enteritis and e-coli. It is important too that there be flexibility where temporary and atypical pollution takes place. That is an improvement that has come from the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be careful to give proper attention to the cost/benefit analysis because some quite large sums of money are involved – the cost to my country would be EUR 8.8 billion, albeit over 25 years.</p>
<p class="contents">We should bear in mind that public information is important if we are going to have public confidence, and the blue flag has gained that confidence: we should be careful not to damage it. I am pleased we have not gone for the multicoloured flags. I gather that we are now going to consult on smiling faces: if we end up with the happy, smiling face of Mrs Wällstrom looking down on Brighton beach, I am sure that will be a boon to mankind, but it must stand alongside the blue flag.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the question of radioactivity is perhaps not one for this measure, as one of the amendments suggests. There are, after all, rocks with natural radioactivity close to beaches and we do not want everyone to have to go swimming with a Geiger counter in their swimming trunks, or indeed swimming trunks that turn black if they meet any radioactivity! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is critical for me as a Scottish representative in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">In south-west Scotland, the Irvine and Aire river valleys are particularly susceptible during times of heavy rainfall – in flash floods during the summer months, for example – to failing to meet the micro-biological standards for good quality during those few, rare days. This does not mean that beaches in Britain are hotbeds of pollution. It means we need flexibility in measuring and sampling to deal with these natural occurrences.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 19 introduces a two-part system of management action. Its purpose is to bring the Commission's proposal into line with the approach adopted in World Health Organisation guidelines for recreational use. The guidelines acknowledge that the tighter standards proposed by the WHO would be breached under some circumstances, i.e. heavy rainfall, and include an allowance to discount samples during these periods, provided that management measures are in place to protect bathers.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment encourages authorities to take preventive action where possible to protect bathers from exposure to pollution. The Council of European Municipalities and Regions has also backed Amendment No 19, and local government wants to see bathing water quality improve by introducing more flexibility into bathing water rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sampling frequency recommended by the Commission is not, however, sufficient and undercuts the current arrangements in Denmark. The bathing season is set at three months in Denmark. The Commission’s proposal would mean the number of samples we take each season falling from ten to two. In the quest for clean bathing water, it would clearly entail a reduction in safety.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, with pleasure that I am able to observe that quite a few of the amendments tabled by the liberal rapporteur, Mr Maaten, disappeared in the course of discussion by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Mr Maaten’s jolly proposal concerning definitions of bathers and bathing water and a colourful range of star-spangled flags on the beach has fortunately disappeared. It saves Parliament from becoming still more of a laughing stock in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s report gave rise to 124 supplementary amendments by fellow MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but the many amendments to Mr Maaten’s proposal also show how a political group can waste a huge amount of MEPs’ time.

Not only with tourists, either: the local people also bathe on their beaches, something they did not do 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this means that the citizens of Europe aspire to having the same quality of bathing water, regardless of the country or location they are swimming in. I therefore believe that the Commission is right to propose – and of I believe it is extremely timely – this greater control of bathing waters, better information for users and also improvements in the quality of those waters in cases where it is advisable or necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between risks of various infections and water quality has been demonstrated beyond all doubt. If, therefore, by means of this directive we can contribute to reducing the risk of contracting infections or other types of illness, our efforts will have been worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, however, I believe that here also we must apply a cost-benefit analysis and not try to use a sledgehammer to crack nuts. In this regard, there are certain aspects of certain amendments to this directive which I believe to be entirely out of context and unnecessary. One of them is the issue of physical and chemical parameters: they are not important in terms of water quality; only microbiological parameters are important. The rest is an aesthetic issue, but not a health issue. Introducing these parameters would enormously complicate the application of the directive and, furthermore, would make the framework directive which already deals with these issues redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to information, I believe it is absurd and unacceptable to indicate the specific languages in which the information must be provided. I believe that each Member State will indicate the language or languages appropriate for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on another issue which has been debated, in relation to parameters, I entirely agree with the use of those parameters indicated by the WHO and I fully support my group’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sandberg-Fries (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the proposal for the new bathing water directive that we are now discussing unfortunately has the same fundamental defect as the previous directive, namely a very vague definition of what is meant by bathing water. One consequence of this has so far been that the Commission has been able to come up with its own interpretation of the concept, ‘a large number of bathers’. It is thus unsatisfactory in terms of legal certainty for the new directive not to contain simple and clear information, either.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also noteworthy that the directive does not take any account of the extremely varied conditions that apply in different Member States. In Sweden, we have, for example, 1932 miles of coast and 95 700 lakes with a surface area in excess of one hectare. Furthermore, we have the legal right of access to private land, which in principle means that everyone residing in our country has access to these bathing waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for Amendment No 76 means yes to a simple, clear and, so too, legally certain definition. Nor should there be a negative effect upon Member States with basic conditions different from those in the countries of northern Europe. It should thus be possible to apply the directive throughout the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I thank Members for their comments, which I read as support for the basic philosophy and structure of the proposal. Actually, both Parliament and Council also confirmed their support in negotiating the Sixth Environmental Action Programme in 2002. I also thank Members for not bringing into question the health standards which the Commission has proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept narrowing the scope of the directive via Amendments Nos 5 or 76. What counts is the importance of a bathing site for a local community. People in northern or non-tourist regions also have the right to bathe in safety. The Commission therefore disapproves of limiting the scope for bathers to one hundred per day and restricting the scope for watersports to one hundred metres.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission appreciates that many MEPs have attempted to improve the integration of the water framework and bathing water directives, the Commission cannot agree with all amendments concerned. Amendments Nos 3, 4, 16, 21 and 33 are unacceptable because they create redundancy between the two directives. Good chemical status is already covered by the water framework directive and we do not have to duplicate that. In some cases, waters can be of excellent quality for bathing without having a good ecological status.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission accepts in principle Amendment No 32, which extends the bathing water profile by adding elements such as hydrological characteristics in relation to the water framework directive. However, it must be kept in mind that the scales of both directives are very different. The water framework directive applies to river basins, whereas the bathing water directive has a very local scope.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the basis of good bathing water management is found within a well documented and updated bathing water profile. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept amendments like 43 and 44, which reduce the knowledge and control of bathing waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes Amendments Nos 8, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20, 34, 35 and 36 concerning bathing water management, public participation and information to the public. However, the Commission would prefer to leave to subsidiarity the choice of symbols and logos depicting bathing water quality and therefore does not want to take on board Amendments Nos 21 and 27.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 19, I would like to say the following: the Commission is open to a certain amount of flexibility on bathing waters which suffer from predictable and manageable short-term contamination. However, flexibility should not undermine the credibility of the directive. Bathing waters which suffer from occasional and short-term events should be identified as such to the public. It is also important for the evaluation of EU bathing sites that no bathing water remains in conformity if the pollution is neither properly identified or mastered. As regards Amendment No 19, the Commission rejects the levels proposed by paragraph 2, the unlimited exclusion of samples in paragraph 3(a) and the almost unconditional conformity as proposed in paragraph 5.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that some amendments aim to increase the risks people will face when bathing. Amendments Nos 62 and 66 both increase the risks of illness from 5% to 9%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the need to adapt legislation to technical and scientific progress and welcomes Amendments Nos 28, 29 and 30 on the revision and adaptation of the directive. In this context, the Commission has just launched a call for proposals under the Sixth Framework Programme calling for projects on virus detection techniques in bathing waters.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission can accept, to a greater or to a lesser degree, 32 amendments of the 76 amendments tabled. I therefore look forward to the results of tomorrow's vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Maaten. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
