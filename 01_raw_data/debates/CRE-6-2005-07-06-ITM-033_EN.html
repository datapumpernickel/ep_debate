However, it is not enough to have an action plan: it must still be implemented. That is why the Commission adopted proposals for implementing this plan in July 2004. These proposals comprise a regulation establishing a voluntary licensing scheme for imports of timber and a recommendation for a directive on a mandate to negotiate partnership agreements with timber-producing countries. The Council is currently examining these proposals, and I hope that an agreement will be reached this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we have released EUR 17 million to finance pilot programmes relating to the fundamental aspects of the action plan, in particular to encourage independent monitoring of logging operations, to strengthen local civil society and to encourage the private sector to follow the broad political guidelines set out in the action plan. We have also released EUR 3 million to support the international and regional dialogue on improving forest governance and combating illegal logging. A technical assistance programme costing EUR 15 million is also expected to start in Indonesia in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also endeavoured to develop a common approach with the Member States of the European Union. As part of our joint work programme, bilateral agencies of European lenders are currently holding informal consultations on FLEGT partnership agreements in potential partner countries, including Ghana, Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Malaysia and Indonesia. That should make it easier to hold formal negotiations on partnership agreements once we have a mandate to negotiate on behalf of the Community. In the Commission we are also analysing the feasibility of having additional legislation to support the FLEGT action plan, in other words something rather more coercive and proactive.</p>
<p class="contents">The evaluation is in progress and is taking place in close collaboration with the Member States, since many of the potential measures are clearly matters of national competence. The options evaluated include public procurement policy, money laundering, stolen goods and anti-corruption legislation, in addition to the feasibility of practical aspects of the new legislation on monitoring imports of illegally logged timber. I hope that this work will reach a conclusion during the course of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say a few words about the calls for a unilateral ban on imports of timber of illegal origin. Personally, I perfectly understand the interests behind these calls. However, a unilateral ban on importing illegally logged timber into the European Union would not, it seems, provide our customs authorities with an instrument enabling them to confirm the legality of the timber. To achieve this, we need the full and complete cooperation of the exporting country, which is why the Commission has proposed a voluntary system based on partnerships with the producer countries. These partnerships will combine a whole raft of governance reforms in the producer countries with measures to stop timber of illegal origin from being imported into the European Union, in particular a licensing system for imports. This approach would enable us to deal with both the problem of supply in the producer countries and that of demand on our own markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is in order to keep him alive. He is a priest living in Acre in Brazil. He and his mission seek to protect the local communities from the loggers. Some of his mission have been murdered and he tells me that he expects one day to be killed himself. Those are the lengths that illegal loggers will go to for criminal gain at the expense of the environment, local communities and even human life.</p>
<p class="contents">In Papua, Stone Age communities are exposed, their health contaminated, their cultures destroyed by loggers bulldozing their greedy way through rainforests. The European Union is still one of the largest importers of illegally sourced timber.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we have lost most of our ancient forests and woodlands, to the detriment of our environment and our native species. It is not too late to protect the less developed parts of the world and thus protect the two-thirds of the world’s land animals and plant species that live there. But we need to move fast. Papua New Guinea has already lost 65% of its rainforests. Globally, 10 million hectares are lost every day. Since 1970 an area of rainforest the size of France has been lost in the Amazon. Twenty million people in the Amazon and 12 million in Africa are at risk, not to mention the great apes and other species of mammals and birds found nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998 the G8 agreed that action was needed. In 2003 the FLEGT was designed to help developing countries to stop illegal logging and to reduce the trade in illegal products, particularly those that come into the European Union. But it is not yet being implemented. The Commissioner has helpfully told us what action is being taken. I would say to him that every day we delay, lives, livelihoods, environments and species are being lost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, I think that this evening’s topic also relates to development and even, as Mr Bowis said, to life and death. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this morning we had a long debate about poverty. We talked about how we can resolve it and about governance issues. Illegal trade is a key factor in bad governance. As we have just heard, the European Union is one of the biggest importers of illegal logging. When the governments of developing countries do not get any revenue, do not get their duties, that is money that could have been spent on the Millennium Development Goals. This is a very important issue in terms of both development and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the Commission is taking action. I am glad that the FLEGT is going to be implemented, but I am not sure that it goes far enough. I am not sure whether any voluntary measures go far enough. You said something, which I did not catch, about some kind of <span class="italic">encadrement légal</span>; I am not sure what that means. We need something more than voluntary systems and something more than a trade measure. We need something that is an environmental measure, using the proper environmental parts of the Treaty. We also need something which can be debated in the public domain. We do not want something done through trade, with Parliament only having an opinion; we want codecision on this very important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">You are a relatively new Commissioner. You have inherited this dossier from your predecessors. I hope that you will bring forward proper legislation under the environmental heading and tackle this very important development issue, which is vital if we are ever to make poverty history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Illegal logging has not, until now, been given the priority it deserves in the Commission or the Council, despite the fact that half the logging in vulnerable regions is illegal and that every year an area of rainforest the size of Belgium disappears.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution deals comprehensively with actions that can be taken to stop illegal logging, but the most important thing is that some action is taken. This is a case of the best being the enemy of the good. We do not need further delay while we argue how far action should go.</p>
<p class="contents">Voluntary partnership agreements are a good place to start. Developing countries will need support to get the necessary certification systems in place, but such support is already available as an element of development cooperation, as the Commissioner has just indicated. It is widely believed that voluntary partnerships will not put a stop to all illegal logging.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, therefore, that the Council and the Commission will clearly flag up right now that further action is anticipated down the line in order to deal with the refusniks who are not prepared to go down the path of voluntary agreements. However, there are several things we can do from the European side to make voluntary agreements a success. Twenty per cent of timber in Europe is purchased by governments, so Member State public procurement policy has a huge role to play. By insisting that governments purchase only legal timber, Member States can wield an enormous carrot, pulling producer countries towards certification. So far, unfortunately, only five EU Member States have moved towards a public procurement policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we can make use of consumer power. Over 70 European timber firms have already signed up to a declaration committing them to trading only in legal wood. They are not being altruistic. They know that consumers do not want to buy furniture from illegal sources and that people are quite prepared to pay a little bit extra to make sure that their tables and chairs have not added to the destruction of the rainforest. I hope, therefore, that we will have no more delay. Let us get on with implementing the FLEGT action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ilda Figueiredo, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I have noted your answer, but am compelled to express my disappointment at the slow progress of the process of implementing the Forest Law Enforcement, Government and Trade (FLEGT) Plan. Wood logged illegally in various parts of the world, such as tropical wood from the Amazon Region and Africa, is known to be traded here in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This sometimes leads to serious civil unrest and even, as previously mentioned, to people being killed. I was in Brazil recently and had the opportunity to talk with various Brazilian social organisations. They are extremely concerned at this state of affairs, and indeed the government and other authorities have expressed similar concerns. I therefore feel that measures must be taken as soon as possible to put a stop to this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole process has far-reaching consequences, both for the countries illegally exporting this wood and for our own countries. Consequently, dozens of EU businesses have drawn up a document calling for measures to prevent the continued import of illegally logged tropical wood. This practice must be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects are not only social but also environmental. We are playing a part in jeopardising the survival of key forests and biodiversity; we are having a direct influence on the climatic conditions, the people and the employment situation in both the producing countries and the importing countries; and, in so doing, we are damaging the businesses that act legally and destabilising international wood markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad goal for the regional or inter-regional bilateral agreements set out in the EU’s action plan on forest law enforcement, governance and trade, which the Commission tabled in 2003, was to contribute towards sustainable development. It is therefore impossible to understand why progress has been so slow in implementing the various undertakings under this plan. I cannot understand, for example, why a planned study into legislative options, which was to have been presented by the middle of 2004, has not been carried out; why detailed measures intended to ban imports of illegal wood and wood products, regardless of the country of origin, have been shelved; and why a network has not been set up between customs and administrative and legal authorities to facilitate the exchange of information on the illegal wood trade.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial that the Commission table a detailed legislative proposal – and it says that it is drawing up such a proposal – that provides more information and that alters the legal basis of the regulation. Parliament can then discuss this proposal and make a positive contribution to this whole process. The political will must be there if we are to put a stop to this illegal trade, which facilitates corruption and money laundering. Urgent action must be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We look, first of all, for you to get this legislation which, as you said, was approved by the Commission on to the statute books. It is now two years since the Commission gave the approval, but where is it? It is not stuck in this Parliament, that is for sure. We have no say over the matter. It is stuck in Council. That logjam needs to be unblocked.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the UK Presidency will give you support in making sure that happens but, if there are Member States which are standing in the way, which are making life difficult, then we look to you to name and shame them. Let us have these NGOs putting pressure on them. As Mr Bowis said, people are dying to save the forests and some Member States are just showing reluctance to get a sensible, positive measure of this kind up and running.</p>
<p class="contents">And where were the Commission’s resources? Minimal resources were being devoted to this behind the scenes. I am told by some people that you have about one person devoted to making this legislation happen. That is pretty minimal. Please wave the flags, say you need more.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month you met a delegation of Members of this House to discuss the possibility of introducing legislative options. I know that you are not yet convinced, but you explored some very interesting ground then. You said you might be able to put some proposals to the Commission in September. Can you still stand by that statement? And have you considered the possibility of introducing legislation as a back-up means, to use your own words, as a ‘carrot and stick’ to encourage countries to sign up to voluntary agreements with the threat of a more difficult regime to follow?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there is nothing more to be said, except that we all know that the forests are disappearing at a huge rate. The best we can possibly hope for is to slow that pace of destruction, but we simply cannot stand by. We need you to help us focus our efforts, produce results, and we want to give you as much support as we can in achieving that objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will return in September with proposals and with a new attempt. Like you, I find it regrettable that implementation is being delayed. We have already debated this problem at length. Nevertheless, I have been doing some investigating: in its FLEGT action plan, the European Union sets out its commitment to analyse the available options for supplementary measures, in particular the feasibility of legislation to monitor imports of illegally logged timber into the European Union. The progress of this work has been monitored very closely by Parliament, which has invited the Commission to propose legislation of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, let us be quite clear: the analysis of these options has been delayed, but it is now in progress. It is true that we also lack the human resources to deal with this dossier, particularly given that it is extremely difficult, but we are rather short. A further reason for the delay, which is not so easy to remedy, is that this analysis remains a delicate and somewhat controversial subject between the various services of the Commission, which have expressed significantly divergent opinions on the best way to proceed. I am trying to bring some order to all of this, so that we have a clearer picture.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that the Commission is committed to reviewing and analysing the feasibility of additional legislation to support the FLEGT action plan. I will attempt to relaunch this discussion. I have already said that this work was held up by delays connected with confirmation of the active participation of the Member States - you are clearly aware of this, as you have spoken of it yourself - and by our decision to concentrate our scarce resources on implementing the voluntary approach set out in the action plan. The evaluation is in progress and is taking place in close collaboration with the Member States, since many of the potential measures are matters of national competence. The options evaluated include public procurement policy, money laundering, stolen goods and anti-corruption legislation, in addition to the feasibility and practical aspects of the new legislation on monitoring imports of illegally logged timber. I hope that this work will be completed during the course of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hall, you said that we should quite simply ban illegal timber. I agree with you, but we also need to find a system that will enable us to check that legal timber is not illegal timber. In other sectors triangular trade does exist. I have even requested a report from the Joint Research Centre in Ispra on this subject. I assume that you are familiar with the problem. You should be aware that, during a very short mandate as Commissioner for Research, I went to that Joint Research Centre, where I saw some very interesting things: for example, that is where they produce the satellite maps that can show, virtually down to the nearest square metre, the crimes that are being committed under the gaze of this satellite; they also show reforestation, the quantity of trees lost, and so on. These are the kinds of technical and technological resources that we should perhaps consider implementing in order to address your concerns. There should not be any problems within the Commission, but I will need to convince a number of Member States to agree to go down that path and to use the means at our disposal, in order to be more coercive.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the legal base, the Commission considers that the voluntary import licensing system should be implemented on the basis of Article 133 of the Treaty, on commercial policy. Parliament and certain Member States do not share this view and suggest that Article 175 of the Treaty, on the environment, would be a more appropriate legal base. Why has the Commission retained Article 133, or commercial policy, as the legal base for the regulation establishing a voluntary licensing scheme for imports of timber? The Commission believes that this legal base is the most appropriate, inasmuch as the regulation seeks only to regulate trade in timber products between the European Union and the partner countries. Personally, I think the Commission is right; I also believe that Article 133 is the most appropriate. However, do not see this as a religious war. The most important thing is to be aware of your legitimate concerns - which I fully share - that you expressed to me during our meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter is therefore not closed; I promise you that I will bring all my leadership to bear on it. Obviously, I cannot promise you that I will succeed, but I will do all I can to move this matter on in the direction that you want, as I share your concerns in this regard. I will ask the Research Centre to consider what techniques might be used, for example to do what you say, because that would be a big step forward. The establishment of some kind of certificate of origin would in itself constitute major progress. We will still need to convince the Member States, but I promise you that I will return in September with some ideas on the issue. I cannot promise you any more than that at the moment, but things are moving and I will also try - although this is not entirely in my hands - to strengthen the taskforce responsible for this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
