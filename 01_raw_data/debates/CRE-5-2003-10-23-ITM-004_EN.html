<p class="contents">In general, Mrs McKenna, we agree with your analysis of the guidance programmes for fleet capacity, known as MAGPs in our jargon, and MAGP IV in this case. You also know that we applied the lessons from this to the reform of the common fisheries policy in order to make up for the shortcomings you highlight, which had become evident to all.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree, too, with your recommendation that the export of fishing vessels to third countries should no longer be financed: as you are aware, we suggested this in our reform proposal. The Council postponed the application of this a little further than we would have liked, but the main thing is that from 2004 exports of fishing vessels with public aid will no longer be authorised.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not share your judgement regarding the new fleet management tools, which were determined as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy: you seem to believe that these new tools will not bring a reduction in the overcapacity of the Community fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment briefly on the two main advances of this new management policy. The first is the system for the entry and exit of fishing vessels – which is an innovation that neither the industry nor the Member States were too happy to accept – and this system will be combined with the ban on replacing fishing capacities that have been withdrawn with public, national or Community financing. That will result in a gradual reduction of our fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">The second measure involves the systems to limit catches. This is obviously an essential component of the plans for the recovery of fish stocks and by limiting catches we will strengthen the efforts to reduce overcapacity. Our analysis is therefore very much in line with your own and is based on the weaknesses of the past. We believe that the measures adopted during the recent reform of the fisheries policy will allow us to respond, to a large extent, to the concerns you have expressed in your report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, this report deals with the Commission's review of the multi-annual guidance programmes. Technically it covers the period up to 30 June 2002, but since Parliament is not going to do a report on the final situation as at 31 December, I will make some comments on the situation up to that date.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the fourth generation multi-annual guidance programme, a series of programmes dating back to 1983. They tried to exert some control over the size and distribution of EU fleets. They have lasted for 20 years altogether. Considering that their objective was to achieve a balance on a sustainable basis between resources and their exploitation, and in the light of the advice coming from ICES over the past few days, it can be safely concluded that they have been a resounding failure.</p>
<p class="contents">To its credit, the Commission has proposed a far more comprehensive and important cut in fleet capacity than the Council was ever able to accept. For example, the agreed objectives for the Member States' combined fleets were so modest that the Community fleet as a whole was already smaller than the overall objectives, even before the MAGP IV entered into force. Some fleets required no reductions at all. Yet at the end of the programme in December 2002 only five of the 13 countries had met the objectives for all the different fleet segments.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain, often criticised this House, was one of them. Clearly the Member States did not have their heart in the exercise. Now the MAGPs themselves are being scrapped. While we recognise that they were ineffective and cumbersome to administer, at least they had the goal of reducing fleet capacity. What has been put in place in the so-called reform does not even do that. Each Member State has been allocated a certain capacity for fishing vessels in tonnage and kilowatts, but there is no requirement for that capacity to be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner himself said, only if public money is used is there any requirement to reduce capacity. As fish stocks are decreasing in abundance faster than the fishing fleets chasing them, the future does not look bright for either the fish or the coastal communities and the people depending on the fishing industry for a living. This is going to cause a major socio-economic crisis. It is looming on the horizon. As Mr Stevenson has said, they are going to suffer endless hardship. But that is going to be the case if we do not realise what the problem is and how to address it.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Lamy is Commissioner for trade, he may be interested in knowing how the EU engages in free trade with fishing vessels. During the period 1998 to 2001, at least 746 vessels were exported to third countries. The number could be many times greater but since most of the vessels had left the fleet, the Commission has no idea what happened to them. They were simply decommissioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Of those 746 vessels, at least 38 were directly exported to known flag of convenience countries. There are even examples of shipowners being funded by the FIFG to export to flag of convenience countries. Even Mr Lamy would have to admit that it is difficult to have a more liberalised trade than that!</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem with the management of the MAGPs by the Commission relates to the waters beyond the European Union. A couple of years ago, the Commission allowed a rather large vessel, the <span class="italic">Atlantic Dawn</span> to join the Irish fleet, with the consequence that another vessel, the <span class="italic">Veronica</span>, was exported to a flag of convenience country, Panama. This was supposedly because the fish of Mauritania are or were plentiful. Earlier this year the Commission did a similar favour for the Dutch. This time they allowed the equivalent of three '<span class="italic">Atlantic Dawns'</span> into the Dutch register to fish the same fish off Mauritania. But the Commission's own scientific advice says that there should be no increase in fishing effort there, so I cannot see how this can be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a major problem with rewarding the law-breakers. In the case of the <span class="italic">Atlantic Dawn </span>that vessel was illegal. What did the Commission do? It helped make it legal. It has made an illegal situation legal. It has done the same with the Dutch. It has now legalised an illegal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It sends out a clear signal to anyone else who wants to do this: basically break the law, ignore it, and the Commission will help you at the end of the day. That is the wrong signal to send out. It is clear that the Commission bends over backwards to accommodate shipowners of these huge supertrawlers. These are not the little coastal communities that will be affected, these are the huge business ventures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am appalled at Commissioner Byrne who also bent over backwards to help the owner of the <span class="italic">Atlantic Dawn</span>, the world's biggest pelagic trawler, to get that fishing licence. I believe it was a breach of his duty as a Commissioner to act in the interests of an individual businessman from his own country. That should also be investigated. I would like to know how many more Commissioners are bending over backwards to facilitate specific business interests against the interests of the Community as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make a somewhat political remark: she belongs to a group that regularly calls for civil disobedience in a great number of spheres, but I notice that she is now very law-abiding. As soon as an entrepreneur does something wrong – something that is not quite compatible with the rules – a punishment must be imposed immediately. I think that that is a good discussion in itself: it is possible to discuss even with the European left on which issues we should or should not follow the government. I digress.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that it is right that the multi-annual guidance programmes be laid to rest. Four generations of MAGPs have failed to produce anything; this is not the way to approach the common fisheries policy. Indeed, I have opposed this approach ever since I joined Parliament, and I am pleased that the Commission recognises that, and also the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must not stand still. It is clear that there is an excess in capacity, and something must be done about it. There are more means than just reducing the size of a fleet, however. By this I mean the use of ‘days at sea’: we can limit the number of days spent at sea. In addition, quotas can be better monitored by means of the joint management of these by producer organisations. There are a good few possibilities, and, indeed, I wish to ask in this regard that the Commission maximise the use of the existing possibilities in its policy before resorting to further new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I should like to pledge my support for the Commission’s policy in this matter, as it is important that we establish a better grip on fleet size, possibly even with regard to going over from smaller to larger vessels in our fleets. With larger vessels it is often possible to put out to sea on more days, and sometimes that does not result in greater tonnage, but does lead to more actual fishing. In this regard, that very instrument – days at sea – coupled with a reduction in the capacity of fleets, could indeed be a very effective instrument for achieving a very productive approach, and also sustainable fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, our group can endorse the general thrust of this report, including after the amendments, and I await the Commissioner’s response with interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards Mrs McKenna’s comment regarding the additional authorisation granted to the Netherlands for 2003, I would respond that the Commission did indeed accept an increase in their pelagic segments, subject to the condition, however, that they respect the commitments we have all made in this non-Atlantic zone, with a view to ensuring that the quotas laid down are not exceeded.

<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to demand full compliance with MAGPs by all Member States. Condoning anything less would amount to rewarding those who infringe Community legislation. We fail to understand how the behaviour of certain Fisheries Ministers continues to be tolerated. I refer to those Fisheries Ministers who agree to provisions in Council but then fail to comply with them or refuse to make data on compliance available.</p>
<p class="contents">Fisheries resources, the Community’s fisheries sector and the regions that depend on fishing would all be better off if the CFP pursued a long-term socio-economic approach that was not full of contradictions. There is no point in awarding subsidies for ships to be built only then to pay to have them scrapped. It would make more sense to allow them to be exported to third countries, in the context of cooperation between the Community fisheries sector and those of developing countries. The Group of the Party of European Socialists is committed to a long-term policy that combines adapting the fleet to resources with maintaining a sustainable level of fishing. We want a future both for fish and for fishermen.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
