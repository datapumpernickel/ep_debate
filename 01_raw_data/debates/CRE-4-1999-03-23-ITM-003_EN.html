<p class="contents">On the one hand institutional uncertainty is at a peak given that this Parliament is to be dissolved on 13 June. From July therefore the budget procedure will continue potentially with a rather different Parliament and speakers who will not necessarily be the same. Uncertainty has also been created by the resignation of the Commission which will therefore have to prepare its preliminary draft budget in a state of political weightlessness. I must thank Commissioner Liikanen for respecting his obligations. As he is here I hope that he will speak, even though he has resigned, because the Commission is still responsible for preparing the preliminary draft budget. It is therefore right that he should speak.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also very great uncertainty about the institutional conditions. We do not know whether there will be any financial perspectives. We do not know whether there will be an agreement on Agenda 2000. We do not know whether there will be an agreement between Parliament and the Council on the overall management of the systems. In other words, we do not know whether the next budget will be an annual budget based on Article 203 or a budget under the future financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is very difficult to establish satisfactory and precise priorities for Parliament. We have stressed two key issues: rigour and the concentration of priorities. We want a rigorous budget on several levels and we want a concentrated budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In Category 3, which is of particular interest to us, we are stressing the need to concentrate efforts on decentralised information measures, the reception of refugees and the financing of Eurodac. We want the ‘greening" of the budget to be extended to new areas. We also want the Commission to use this budget to prepare the ground for extending the powers of the European Union in the fields of public health and consumer protection. Finally, with regard to the research programme, we want a balance to be achieved between the system"s funding requirements, the need to keep within the overall budgets agreed and the provision of sufficient margins in the area of internal policies. The Fifth Framework Programme for Research must not dominate all the other spending under Category 3.</p>
<p class="contents">In Category 4, we are happy to concentrate aid on the poorest countries, as requested by the committee responsible. This is our aim in terms of priorities. However, yet again everything needs to be clarified. The crux of our message is the rigour which we want to apply. We consider that considerable efforts need to be made with regard to management.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in Category 1, the management of the agricultural appropriations needs to be more rigorous, without ignoring the principle of adequate funding. In Category 2, it must be possible, by reforming the nomenclature of certain funds, for expenditure to be managed not according to the distribution of administrative services, but according to the objectives of the Structural Funds. We therefore call for the nomenclature to be reformed accordingly. Above all, effort is required in Category 5.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a problem of management here. We want to see the gradual dismantling of the Technical Assistance Offices. We also want the staff requirements for the work involved to be reassessed. In particular, before 30 June, we want the Commission to come clean and clearly indicate how many staff it needs to perform its tasks. We must have a clear answer here in order to identify the Commission"s precise requirements so that the budgetary authority can decide and weigh up, in full possession of the facts, the tasks to be completed and the resources to be provided. This is the message of rigour and clarification that we want to press home.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Müller </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the attention that has been devoted to the European institutions over the past few weeks perhaps adequately reflects for the first time the political importance now attached to the decisions taken by the EU institutions. This implies tasks that go far beyond simply seeing new faces take over. The people – as also the staff of the institutions – now rightly expect us to undertake structural reforms, and in saying ‘us" I am specifically including the Council and the European Parliament. Today the people expect a modern administrative management that makes the public administration as effective as that of the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Five Wise Men"s Report focuses on the concept of responsibility. I too believe this is the key to the need for reform. In future we need first and foremost a clearer attributability of success and responsibility, not just at Commissioner level but indeed also at official level, not just in the Commission but also in the European Parliament. That is why I, together with my colleague Jean‐Louis Bourlanges, suggested looking at experiences gained in the individual Member States or regions in relation to budgeting, or what is called activity‐based budgeting, and supporting the Commission in its efforts to that same end.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that this is also in the interests of colleagues in this House and all the other institutions. Decentralised and transparent responsibilities produce a stronger motivation, as shown by a variety of experience in the Member States and regions. The attention currently being paid to our institution in relation to its carrying out its control function reflects another responsibility we have to live up to. We all know that we still have quite a lot of homework to do. For instance, if Parliament"s budget estimates for the year 2000 provide for a sum of EUR 3.8 million just for setting up a supermarket, that means that here too, as I and the Committee on Budgets are suggesting, we must carry out our control function. Facilities that are not connected with the institutions" activities should not be financed with subsidies from Parliament"s budget but should be self‐financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to the budget deliberations I had asked the administration to calculate the possible budgetary costs of the European Statute for Members that is still pending before the Council. This gave figures of EUR 60 million in compulsory expenditure and EUR 45 million in non‐compulsory expenditure. By budgeting for these resources, we should show the Council in the year 2000 that we are serious about the statute; and if I rightly understood Mr Verheugen yesterday, the German Presidency is endeavouring to have this statute adopted before the end of the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to another sensitive subject, namely the voluntary pension fund for Members of this Parliament. This is a quasi‐private fund and its management decisions, such as fixing the contributions and the benefits, are taken by the Bureau. In the past, incidentally, that also contributed to the familiar deficit. Irrespective of my critical attitude to the fund as such, of which you are aware, I would urgently request that you all join the all‐group reform alliance and at least allow for the institutional separation of Parliament and the voluntary pension fund, as set out in Amendment No 6. For the rest, colleagues on the board of the fund take the same view.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, on the question of Members" declarations of interests, we should also go on the offensive, or to be more precise, on the Internet. The Commission collectively accepted responsibility for its omissions because Parliament assumed its control function. In two months" time the voters will be assuming their control function over us. So let us do all we can with a view to the 2000 budget to signal that we are building up a modern, efficient, transparent administration in the institutions!</p>

To put it quite simply, we want to see adherence to the results of the legislative process for the fifth framework programme of research and the full assertion of Parliament"s rights. We fought for that during the conciliation procedure. The negotiations were tough. It was a question of what is known as the guillotine clause, which concerns the effects of the financial perspective on the overall financial framework of the fifth framework programme of research. Here we managed to assert Parliament"s rights in full, and of course we will also insist during the coming budgetary deliberations that Parliament is fully involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of energy, we are yet again seeking to ensure that the responsibility the European Union has assumed in regard, for instance, to reducing greenhouse gases, is also covered in budgetary terms. Declarations are one thing, their political implementation, their reflection in budget headings, are another, and that is what we must do. By adopting a framework energy programme we have created the necessary legal conditions, and of course what we want is for this to be adequately reflected in the budget. Those, in a few words, are the wishes of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy for the 2000 budget and I hope Members will find their way to supporting them during the further procedure.</p>

This is actually the very essence of the European Union"s identity which has solidarity as its central theme, and it will also help to put the European Union in a stronger position in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Development and Cooperation unanimously wishes to point out to the Commission that the prospects of enlargement and the Structural Fund and CAP reforms must on no account be allowed to result in the European Union abandoning or disengaging itself from this field. The priority given by the Commission to countries geographically close to the Union must not lead to a reduction in appropriations for the ACP countries. The Development Committee regards the reduction of poverty as a priority, which is why a larger proportion of spending under Category 4 needs to be allocated to the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim here is an ambitious one as it involves halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015. In this respect, we would urge the Member States to comply in full with the United Nations" recommendations to increase their development policy contributions to at least 0.7 % of their GNP.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore reaffirm our desire to see the EDF incorporated into the budget and to see unused appropriations reallocated to low‐income countries, for example through the PHARE, TACIS or MEDA programmes. We want to see adequate humanitarian aid and we will also continue to fight for certain thematic lines such as the environment, tropical forests, equal opportunities, anti‐personnel mines, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to regeneration and reconstruction, the lack of coherence and the scattering of resources caused by allocating appropriations by geographical region should prompt us to reorganise the budget lines. Finally, we fully support the work of the NGOs and hope that line B7‐6000 will be given adequate payment appropriations. We will seek to ensure that the small NGOs are not penalised in relation to the large NGOs in any new arrangements which the Commission might make.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wholeheartedly endorse the comments made by the rapporteur on Category 5 regarding the staff shortages in the Commission in particular. I must emphasise that the problem is particularly crucial with regard to DG VIII and ECHO.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wynn </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of our Group on both reports. First of all, can I turn to Mrs Müller's report and thank her for the work that she has done. We do not always vote for her text or her amendments; but she knows that like most groups in the Budgets Committee, we are aiming for the same objectives. We just have different ways of getting there.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I say that the rapporteur's sentiments and the sentiments of the committee are summed up in the first paragraph of her report, paragraph 1, where she calls on the institutions and committees – and I stress the words ‘institutions' and ‘committees' not ‘organs' as Mrs Müller's amendment seeks – to produce a strategy to enhance efficiency by improving transparency, motivation, mobility and further training. That is what we are looking for from guidelines. Some of the other comments were not necessary, and that is why we voted against quite a few paragraphs within this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to be critical of the fact that Mrs Müller as rapporteur has tabled eight amendments. This is not a prerogative of the rapporteur who is the servant of the committee. She should be presenting the committee's report to Parliament and not tabling amendments in the name of her group.</p>
<p class="contents">All the amendments she has tabled fall into two categories. There are those which have already been defeated in the Budgets Committee which, of course, we will vote against because we voted against them before and there are some entirely new ones. The fact that we have had no debate on these new ones, once again means that we will vote against them in the plenary. I would hate to think that these amendments were being tabled just as a political ploy or for a press release, because they call for the citizens of the Quartier Leopold to be able to use the facilities within the Parliament such as the shops. Now, I would hate to think that we were going to be criticised for not supporting the people who live around here. Apart from that, they are not guidelines and should not be in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to Mr Bourlanges' report and thank him for the work that he has done. It is not the text we would have written but we will be voting for it, as he knows. Paragraph 2, as he said in his speech, sets out Parliament's priorities, especially in relation to job creation. That has to be at the forefront of all our minds. But there is also a reference to the ‘BATs'. This is an issue which will not go away and which will be at the forefront of everyone's conversations and strategy for the 2000 Budget and beyond. But, of course, if we achieve what we are seeking with the elimination of the ‘BATs' where the Commission can do the work, then Council and ourselves have to recognise the possible consequences of such a move.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us on to Category 5. If Category 5 does not grow by 1.5 %, then 4, 000 jobs will be lost between the Year 2000 and 2006. We still have the problem of 850 unfilled vacancies within the Commission. That is why the Interinstitutional Agreement is so important and the work of Mr Colom I Naval and the other people on the trialogue which met this morning. It is so important that we get an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We vote on this report before Berlin, and we assume that there will be agreement in the Council on Agenda 2000 and between the Council and Parliament on the Interinstitutional Agreement. If not, then the Recital C and paragraph 1 of the Bourlanges' report will certainly have to be taken note of. It is not unlike the situation in 1994, I have to say, or for the 1994 Budget, where we went right through to December before we knew what the final situation would be. Let us hope that we can get this concluded well before December.</p>

The new one on public access to a supermarket was not tabled in my name; it was tabled by a member of my group. Secondly, the press conference I held was given together with Jean‐Louis Bourlanges in order to present the report and in the Committee on Budgets we decided the precise amount relating to the supermarket by a majority. That means I only told the press something that formed the basis of the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Budgets.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elles </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr. President, our rapporteurs have always given us excellent introductions from the Committee on Budgets. Mr Bourlanges has rightly underlined the uncertainty which we face in this budgetary procedure. I must admit, having been on the Budgets Committee since 1984, that we have become used to uncertainty in our budgetary matters We reject budgets; we go on to twelfths; we have a whole range of negotiations with the Council, but actually somehow through all this period we managed to keep the show on the rails. I am certain our rapporteur will do that in these difficult circumstances, particularly as we have never had to be guided without having a European Commission in place. I welcome the fact that the Commission, although not in office, has taken the trouble to be with us and will no doubt be speaking in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments in speaking on behalf of my Group for the European Parliament Budget and then for the Commission Budget. I would like to say to Mr Wynn that we will be supporting most of the amendments that Mrs Müller has put on the Agenda. These have been discussed in committee. We felt that they were reasonable and therefore they deserve our support. In particular, I regret that the Council is not here today because I would have liked to find out from them the chances of having the statute for Members and for assistants which are mentioned in the report and on which we need decisions by the European Council as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the budget of the Commission, it is clear that we have once again a rigorous budget in front of us. The Commission, the Council and ourselves have had rigorous budgets for the last few years. This will be no exception. Indeed, the priorities too will be fairly similar to those which have been put in the draft budget of the Commission. The real issue of this 2000 Budget though will be on the administrative expenditure and the follow‐up to the Wise Men's Report. What are the resources which will be needed? What are the real needs? What are the programmes that the Commission is going to be running? This is a debate we will no doubt have later in the year, but at this stage I would like to conclude that so far as our Group is concerned, we will be looking at this particular aspect of the budget in a much more critical way than any other.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr Chairman we live in the age between the ages as Reinhold Niebuhr said, and other colleagues have made that point very clearly. It is very welcome that two experienced colleagues like Mr Bourlanges and Mrs Müller will be guiding this Parliament and the next Parliament through the difficult period of the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two specific comments. First of all, the coming period will be less concentrated on new monies as was the case in the past and more on the management of existing money. It is, therefore, very important in this period of uncertainty that the Parliament itself indicates that it is fully aware of its central responsibility on this point. Over the last five years we in Parliament have made enormous progress in the quality of implementation and the involvement of other committees than the Budget Committee. The other committees' involvement is essential for the future if we are going to meet our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">A better institutional balance is, of course, absolutely essential. It is perhaps again ironic that today, the day before Agenda 2000 is being discussed and also the whole financial structure, the Council is absent. We must continue, and I hope that the new Parliament will pursue this point. Essentially, we need an interinstitutional agreement but not at any price. Therefore, the open situation which Mr Bourlanges indicated – that perhaps we may have a budget according to Article 203 – needs to be underlined.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mrs Müller's report is concerned, the essential point is the activity‐based budgeting, as she indicated. I welcome that Commissioner Liikanen underlined that earlier. We must highlight the contradiction in the Council today. On the one hand the Council wants cuts and, as Mr Wynn has said, this may lead to enormous cuts in personnel. On the other hand, we see from the Committee of Wise Men, the essential contradiction that if we leave things to BATs we will have problems of management. That contradiction will be focussed on by the Parliament throughout the coming period. I hope and trust that Mrs Müller will be a good guide for this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Chairman, since it is probably my last budgetary debate here I would like to say how much I hope that the new Parliament will continue to make progress under the good guidance of our two colleagues who have been appointed for the Year 2000.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Giansily </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the 2000 budget procedure begins, I have to say that I am deeply concerned about the total uncertainty that surrounds the current situation. We still do not know whether the Interinstitutional Agreement will be renewed and whether new financial perspectives will be established for the 2000‐2006 period. What is more, as has just been made clear, the rapporteur himself does not know the answers to these questions. To paraphrase Sacha Guitry, I would say that the Council is hesitating, the Commission is dead and the rapporteur does not seem particularly courageous.</p>
<p class="contents">What causes me particular concern is the more or less stated aim of the majority of the Council delegations whose primary and perhaps only concern is to pay as little as possible to Europe. This means a budget of zero growth or financial stagnation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of an agreement on the new financial perspectives, it is clear, as the excellent Mr Bourlanges has described in detail, that the financial framework for the 2000 budget must be established by adjusting the ceilings for the various headings, pursuant to Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 29 October 1993. This means that the budgetary authority must comply with the amounts already earmarked for the pilot schemes and preparatory actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the 2000 budget must be another austerity budget, maintaining budgetary discipline while at the same time guaranteeing that the necessary resources will be available to implement the European Union"s policies, as pointed out by the rapporteur, in accordance with Article F(3) of the EU Treaty. Therefore, whatever the current difficulties, it is right and even advisable that the joint budgetary authority should prepare a responsible, rigorous and effective budget for the year 2000 in line with the EU"s political commitments and according to the spirit and letter of the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately I do not believe that the Council understands this, and if we enthusiastically approve the guidelines defined by Mr Bourlanges, we are just as vigorously denouncing the lack of political responsibility and Community solidarity shown to date by certain Council delegations. I was particularly shocked by the content of ‘<span class="italic">La Tribune</span> ", published yesterday in <span class="italic">Le Figaro</span> and written by Ms Hewitt, a British junior minister, which was quite simply a call for the CAP to be dismantled through renationalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although at this stage the Council"s priorities for the 2000 budget have not been identified – these particularly depend on the results of the Agenda 2000 negotiations – it seems clear that the aim of most of the delegations is to ensure that Community expenditure does not develop more than national expenditure. We seem to suffer permanently from the Fontainebleau syndrome.</p>
<p class="contents">This concept is clearly out of step with the EU"s development plans, and we would be entering a very difficult procedure with an uncertain outcome if we tried to prevent an abstinence budget being imposed which ignored the objective requirements of the EU"s policies and was entirely subject to the electoral whims of the finance ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">We are realistic and we accept rigour but, unlike the Council, we want to see progress combined with respect for rigour and for the political commitments made by the Heads of State and Government and also for the agreements to which the Council itself has signed up. To forget all that would be to forget Europe itself. Finally, with regard to Mrs Müller"s excellent report which is less affected by uncertainty, our group will support this as amended in committee.</p>

The strategic approach to restructuring this budget must focus on internal and foreign policies because they account for a large share of compulsory expenditure and multiannual programmes. So I very much welcome our joint call for an increase in the share of development policies in the Community budget. But we must bear in mind that the development impact of each euro must be enhanced with a view to sustainability, and here I mean both ecological and economic sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">More emphasis must now be laid on good governance as a condition for granting any aid that goes beyond emergency aid. We must look more closely at the macro‐economic impact of our food aid and put the interests of the agricultural budget in second place. I would remind you of our debate on aid for Russia. And as the World Bank notes in its report on ‘Assessing Aid", development aid should where possible be multilateral, which means it should also be shifted from the Member States to the Union. But if we are to remain credible, we should also say where we are prepared to economise, which in my view should primarily be in relation to the disputed KEDO project. But we must also radically rethink the export promotion programmes, not just with a view to creating European added value but also against the backdrop of the question of whether this should be an object of common European action in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">How willing are we in fact to be serious about what we have been demanding for days, namely concentration on the essentials? I very much hope that with the dialogue on Jean‐Louis Bourlanges"s report and priorities we will be able to take a major step forward in regard to development policy.</p>

From this point of view I wish to compliment the Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, on both his presence and his work. He has cooperated very constructively with the Committee on Budgets in the past few years, even though we as a Parliament must examine our collective conscience – something we have not done sufficiently, judging by what has happened in recent weeks. In this sense, the Bourlanges report gives the thumbs down to one of the guiding principles of this House, the Budgets Committee and our whole mind‐set in recent years: the belief that the number of measures and activities could continue to rise, while promising public opinion zero growth, and that everything could be constantly improved on the basis of the same statutory internal and personnel resources. For the first time now, these guidelines do not stress that principle which, in my opinion, was one of the causes – perhaps the main one – of so many negative developments. I therefore welcome a new approach which ought to guide us in future years and which the Council President, Mr Fischer, stressed very responsibly yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just say one word on the Müller report: in the committee we adopted a well‐balanced and coherent report. This is the line which our group will pursue, by supporting the report as it emerged from the committee.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Dam </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> On the Bourlanges report, Mr President, one of the biggest problems as regards the year 2000 budgetary procedure is the enormous scale of monies still unspent. To tackle this as quickly as possible, the rapporteur is suggesting that 50 % of the payment appropriations should be included in the budget for 2000. If we add the expected ‘fresh funds", this will give us a budget of EUR 95 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside the question of whether the Council is likely to welcome so big a budget, I do not think this is the answer. How is it, I would ask the rapporteur, that payments can fall so far short of commitments? You mention the restrictive budgetary policy in recent years. But is that the real reason? In recent years, the budgetary authority has saddled the Commission with a mountain of commitments. Is it not rather the case that the Commission"s services are unable to manage it all? Given the findings of the Committee of Wise Men, I fear that it may be. So a forced increase in payment appropriations for the year 2000 is not the right way. It is asking for trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution should instead be sought through sensible self‐restraint. The commitment appropriations must be matched to the Commission"s capacity for implementing them. Europe must confine itself to policy areas where acting together as a Union is beneficial. Programmes which cannot be managed efficiently must be scrapped, and quickly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Samland </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Budgets. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, either the 2000 budget is the first budget under a new financial perspective or it is based on Article 203 of the Treaty on European Union. We will find out in the course of tomorrow and the day after. We had a trilogue this morning and discussed the question of the minimum requirements for the trend of categories 3, 4, 5 and 7 that we will set as the condition for a possible interinstitutional agreement. In that respect, we must always view what Mr Bourlanges has just said against the background of the ‘both‐and‐also" or ‘either/or" alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">If we chose the ‘either/or" alternative and did not have an institutional agreement, then as we made quite clear in the trilogue this morning, in economic terms we would have more money available than we would if we did conclude an interinstitutional agreement. The situation is quite clear: only if the national budgets constantly showed a deficit of 0.9 % and growth remained below 1.5 %, only then would we have a situation where the expenditure arising from half the ceiling rate was lower than the expenditure under a financial perspective yet to be agreed. I am addressing these words more to the Council, which is not here, than to Members, for the Council should know exactly what the financial resources in categories 3, 4 and 5 will look like when it decides the question tomorrow and the day after.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another point I want to make in this connection. I believe Mrs Müller has already raised it. Should what the Council is currently discussing in relation to staff costs and administrative costs become the basis of the budget for 2000 and the following years, the freezing of the budget would mean that the European Union would have to lose 3 880 posts in all. These would be distributed between Parliament – a loss of 420 posts, the Commission – a loss of 3 000 posts, the Court of Justice – a loss of 182 posts, the Court of Auditors – a loss of 58 posts, and the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee – a loss of another 220 posts. Just to make it clear: if you talk about freezing the administrative budget, that will cost 3 880 posts.</p>
<p class="contents">So we cannot on the one hand say that we want steady growth in these programmes and on the other hand say that we will freeze or even reduce administrative costs. Lest there be any misunderstanding, I do not mean that we should say that we want to increase the costs and employ more staff; instead, I am saying that freezing money would mean losing jobs rather than creating additional ones. For this reason Parliament will be called upon to create the corresponding appropriations in this area also.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say something about the backlog. The backlog this year is partly because in connection with Community expenditure the public is concentrating increasingly on payments and less on commitments. But our budget is split into two components, namely the commitments we enter into and the payments which are then graded accordingly. The reason these resources were not paid out does not lie with the Commission, as the previous speaker said; it is a problem connected with the Member States or the non‐Member States, namely the Central and Eastern European countries, for it is they that correct or regulate the flow of resources into the Structural Funds, into research policy or foreign policy programmes through their activities. Whether intentional or not, a backlog has occurred here accounting for more than 40 billion. We cannot reduce that simply by saying we will dump it onto the budget, for then – and you are quite right here – we would find ourselves in the situation of having growth rates for the 2000 budget that were beyond good and evil but had nothing to do with the actual trend of expenditure but only with the burdens of the past that we are dragging along behind us and that we now have to slough off. That is why we are in favour of Mr Bourlanges"s proposal to divide this into two parts rather than having it in a single budget, in order to distinguish between growth and the burden of the past that we have to deal with.</p>

In two days" time, we shall have the debate and the decisions of the European Council on Agenda 2000 and the financial perspective. I hope these decisions will be taken, because as you know, there has been indecision for quite some time now. Personally, I am one of those who believe that policy cannot be made without money, but such a view has now sunk to the status of heresy in the European Union. Be that as it may, speaking as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy on the budget for 2000, I would like to recall the three basic points made by the committee in respect of the new budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we draw attention to the need to guarantee sufficient payment appropriations, so as to avoid liquidity problems for the programmes being carried out under the Structural Funds, and this should be done in relation to Agenda 2000 and the new structural programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are asking for outstanding commitment appropriations under Category 2 for 1998 to be incorporated into the 2000 budget, so as to comply with the Edinburgh agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the committee calls on the Commission to show some degree of flexibility when extending the programmes being carried out under the Structural Funds, where this is justified, which will allow the Delors 2 package to be implemented effectively and in full.</p>
<p class="contents">In the motion for a resolution, there are two paragraphs concerning Category 2, paragraphs 12 and 13, which are extremely important and which raise crucial technical issues. However, we in the Committee on Regional Policy believe that the motion lacks the proper political direction and the necessary political vision that we wish to see for the Structural Funds in 2000.</p>

I would sincerely like to thank Mrs Müller and Mr Bourlanges accordingly. I would like to focus on just two questions. The EU Staff Regulations must be revised and the responsibilities of officials clarified. The observations which the Committee of Independent Experts, the so‐called Committee of Wise Men, made regarding personal lack of responsibility must be taken seriously, and there must be an end to all this hiding behind one another"s backs amongst the authorities in the EU. The increase in the number of staff employed must be strictly controlled, and this is a point on which I disagree with the Committee of Wise Men. We can achieve much more with staffing levels as they are at present, as long as the Staff Regulations are flexible about the sensible use of resources. Along with the review of the Staff Regulations we should also clarify how financial administration is monitored. Administrative responsibility for the justification and approval of expenditure must be delegated. We have to emphasise the importance of the responsibility for how revenue is used. Only in this way can the importance of personal responsibility be underlined and payment settlements be speeded up. As it is, I support strict budget policy, which is in line with government budget policy in the Member States.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Dührkop Dührkop </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I must first thank Mr Bourlanges for his work on the guidelines for the budget for 2000. Parliament generally gives its approval at this time of the year and makes a start on the annual budgetary procedure. I am sure the House agrees that on this occasion the guidelines are being produced against a background of almost complete uncertainty. Indeed, if the debate could be postponed until Friday we might be in a better position to make specific decisions. Nevertheless, the guidelines are not usually concerned primarily with figures but rather with setting the priorities of the House with regard to the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to focus on two specific aspects of the guidelines for the budget for 2000. To start with, I must draw attention to a matter of grave concern which Mr Samland, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, has already mentioned, but which is worth highlighting again. It is nothing new, as it was discussed previously in connection with the budget for 1999, and it involves the relationship between commitments and payment appropriations. This is specifically mentioned in the Interinstitutional Agreement, which refers to an equitable balance between commitments and payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in recent financial years, as Mr Samland also pointed out, payment appropriations have not been increased in line with commitments in order to ensure that the budget has been strictly controlled, although this has not been the case. We are now faced with what has become known as ‘the burden of the future", that is, the burden acquired during the current year plus, in some cases, a backlog of credit to be cleared. By the end of 1999, this could amount to more than 200 % of the commitments undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur on putting forward a proposal to deal with the situation. Nevertheless, I wish to make it quite clear to the Member States that the time for making false economies is over. This considerable backlog must be at the forefront of our minds as we prepare the budget for 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am sure the House agrees that the budget must be rigorous, Mr Bourlanges. However, I do not agree that rigour is an end in itself, and I never will. Rather, rigour must be a response to sound and efficient administration, whilst also guaranteeing the resources required to implement the Union"s policies, as stated in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to repeat what I said earlier: the average European expects the Union to find a way of meeting our expectations. It is not merely a case of balancing income and expenditure. Through the Member States, the people of Europe have transferred certain competences to the Union. They have even surrendered some of their sovereignty to ensure that the Union is in a better position to respond to their needs.</p>
<p class="contents">My own view is that the Union"s budget is on quite a different level from that of the Member States. It complements a Member State"s budget, but should not be compared to it. This certainly does not mean that the European Parliament will fail to act and cooperate responsibly during the financial year in order to smooth the path of the euro for the Member States. What it must mean, however, is that the Union"s policies respond to the wishes of the people of Europe.</p>

Firstly, I totally agree with Mrs Dührkop Dührkop that rigour does not mean austerity. Rigour indicates a desire to match resources to objectives. This is not actually the main priority, but when it comes to priorities we should not forget that we are currently discussing a budget in which one third of the legal bases are uncertain.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as I did not have time to say this earlier, I too must quickly emphasise the importance of the payment arrears problem. Several speakers have mentioned this, including the chairman of the Committee on Budgets. I must also stress the desire of this House to see this issue resolved, but not to the detriment of future commitments and real payments corresponding to real commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">My third observation concerns the technical assistance offices, the TAOs. I only had time to say that we favoured their gradual dismantling, but I must clarify that this does not mean their total dismantling. We realise that certain TAOs are necessary because they carry out temporary or technical work. What we do not want are the TAOs which only serve to make up for the Commission"s staff shortages. We therefore want many of the TAOs to be dismantled but not all of them, just those which are not operating correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President, for allowing me to clarify these three points.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, when the Commission resigned it decided to continue to carry out its essential legal functions and obligations. The budget is a legal obligation for the Commission. If no Commission is nominated within a certain period then this Commission must present a budget to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, I shall make a few comments on what the rapporteur and some other speakers have said. Firstly, the Commission is very happy about the rapporteur's idea of bringing the other parliamentary committees closer to the budgetary procedure. It is very important to increase control of the quality and the sectors in the budget. So, it is good that the committees responsible for a certain area have direct discussions with the Budgets Committee. Secondly, the Commission is also happy that Parliament has confirmed its commitment to the procedure of the amending letter on agriculture between institutions. This has been one of the major innovations during this parliamentary period and it is important that it continues in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission agrees with the preoccupation of the rapporteur as far as the famous RAL, <span class="italic">reste à liquider</span> , the backlog, is concerned. It is very important that it will be directly presented in next year's budget. It will show what comes out of that budget, what payments have not been made and which are due to commitments in the past. We will follow in our budgetary presentation the wish of the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on BATs, I was going to say much the same as Mr Bourlanges. We should not simply say that all technical offices are out. That would easily lead to a situation that very temporary technical tasks had to be done by the permanent European administration. That could be very expensive and very impractical. It is, of course, very clear that the whole review of the budget question, which was started last year when the first decisions of the Commission were taken and where the preparation for the vademecum for BATs continues, is of major importance. I hope this vademecum can be presented to Parliament by the new Commission as one of its first acts. We are making the technical preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the resources, the broad exercise which the Commission is embarking on should be coming to an end by the spring. It is continuing in the services and I hope that in the context of the budgetary procedure we can give more information about its results.</p>
<p class="contents">On activity‐based budgeting, I must say that the profound reform of the budgetary procedure so that we can always treat the operational and administrative requirement at the same time is activity‐based budgeting. This idea was launched by the Commission this year and the Commission decision was taken on the basis that the budget for 2001 will be based on activity‐based budgeting. It will mean transparency. It will mean a procedure for operations so that all the requirements are attainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you all know, the Berlin summit is starting tomorrow. There are big questions to be decided but I will only comment on one of these, which we have already mentioned a few times. It is the question of administrative expenditure. The Commission proposal aimed at stabilisation of the staff at the levels of one year ago. The Council majority position has been the stabilisation of administrative expenditure which would lead to a reduction of 4 000 civil servants in all institutions with 3 000 in the Commission. We cannot accept this. The Commission has presented proposals for a reasonable reinforcement of the staff in the financial perspectives. Every 1 000 officials will cost EUR 100m in the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard yesterday that the presidency was more open than previously to this idea but it is very important that the Commission and Parliament work together to get such an interinstitutional agreement that reasonable but strictly controlled staff increases can be guaranteed for the forthcoming period.</p>
