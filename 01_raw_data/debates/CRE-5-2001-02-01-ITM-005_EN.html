<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">O’Toole (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I want to first talk about why this report is important and in doing so I picked at random a number of published authors: the works of Michel Tournier, Leonardo Sciascia, Italo Calvino and a man in my own country, Caryl Philips.</p>
<p class="contents">A couple of shelves at home house this work of rich linguistic diversity, of rich form, rich culture and rich history. They fashion the way in which I think about and look at the world. The canvas upon which I work has been painted by these authors who are enjoyed by many people. Books for me are principally about access to choice, access to ideas and access to opportunities. I grew up in a pretty humble background, in a poor area with impoverished expectations and poor prospects. But from the day that I entered a public library, books became my liberation as they have been to so many others. I am very grateful to the authors and publishers of those books for giving me that liberation and it is now my duty to ensure that experience is passed on to others.</p>
<p class="contents">What then is the report about? Quite simply, I want to ensure that as we fully enter the electronic age, the framework which operates in Member States for books, whether it be protecting intellectual property rights, tax regimes, the regulation of demand or grants, continues to operate in the new age. Books have always been recognised as more than simply a commodity and in an increasingly commodified world this is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic publishing covers four specific areas: electronic books, printing on demand, Internet bookshops and publishing on the Internet. We need to make sure that we have the policies to operate a fully comprehensive canvas on which all of these developments can take place.</p>
<p class="contents">So what do I want to see in this report? Firstly, we need to encourage the huge growth and development of these industries and the widespread use of electronic media in Europe. We need to have affordable access to these media for all Europeans and the educational provision to make this possible. We should continue to foster linguistic and cultural diversities through the use of electronic publishing and we should facilitate the easy transformation of traditional publishing industries into the e-publishing arena.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for this to happen, we need to ensure that the appropriate policies are in place to pursue this growth and to ensure that there is choice and access for all. Therefore, my report calls for a number of things. The EU institutions have a very important part to play in ensuring future growth. First of all, the Commission can establish a comprehensive policy to develop this sector. Secondly, we can all promote policies that develop and encourage literacy and combat the digital divide.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can and should develop training and vocational programmes and support mechanisms for SME development in this particular sector and we should work with Member States to build safeguards for the rights of authors and the interests of publishers, and ensure that workers in the industry have the opportunity to develop their capacity in the new age.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should ensure that the current VAT rules applying to books be monitored and mirrored for electronic publication. All of this is within our grasp and with this I commend to the whole House, as it almost is, my report with the hope that it provides us with a route map that will allow everybody to enjoy the benefits and the fruits of the emergence of this new sector.</p>

Ignorance or a lack of skill in the field of the new technologies and in the field of the written word and knowledge will inevitably lead to new forms of illiteracy with all the human, social, economic and cultural costs that this entails.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Noise</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the euphoria about the role of the new technologies in the Union’s development and in rapidly combating unemployment that has dominated international meetings, and which reached its apogee at the Lisbon Summit, should at least be sensibly tempered, because the European institutions need to reflect thoroughly on subjects such as those addressed in this report. It is not, however, simply a question of considering issues such as books, electronic publishing, printing on demand and other such matters. In my view, it is crucial that the work of the various parliamentary committees, directorates-general and leaders, at both European and national level, who are involved with these issues, reach a useful and effective form of coordination. It makes no sense to adopt divergent or even perhaps contradictory measures for policies on electronic publishing and books, copyright or e<span class="italic">-</span>learning. The definition and coordination of guidelines for such policies are increasingly suffering from the fact that there are at least two approaches: the growing support of qualified experts, which gives politicians skills in an area in which they are not generally proficient, and opting for legal provisions that will be able to adapt rapidly to developments in technologies and the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, electronic publishing should not be treated as the same as the traditional book with regard to taxation and the application of VAT. It lacks a system of its own and we must therefore bear in mind that the traditional book contains a different set of values and is, by its very nature, a different type of product from the simple digitised file that is an electronic book. Finally we propose that a European Year of the Book and Literacy should be designated and that, every year, 23 April should be declared European Reading Day. These measures would contribute to the fight against illiteracy, to the policy of safeguarding the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European peoples, to the creation of incentives to acquire knowledge and to deepening people’s sense of citizenship. For these reasons they deserve our applause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of us who love books, both as readers and writers, must rethink our relationship with books from square one. A revolution has taken place which makes books even more interesting, even richer, even more indispensable to each and every one of us. At the same time, however, it means that there is vital need for us to develop European and national policies to address the problems caused by new methods of production and distribution. To the question of whether books should be protected from uncontrolled market forces we say yes, given the huge cultural importance of books and reading in our society, which we must strengthen as much as we can.</p>
<p class="contents">The new prospects for spreading information and enlarging the reading public via the Internet are accompanied by the problems of intellectual property and the status of authors and the risk of large swathes of the population being left with no access to the new media. A lack of equal opportunities for the computer illiterate, rural areas and minority groups may prove to be fatal, especially where it compounds the considerable degree of illiteracy which already exists. The problem is so serious that there is even talk of yet another threat to social cohesion, a threat which needs to be dealt with promptly through decisive policies on the part of the European Union. But all the Member States should facilitate access for the young to books and encourage them to read during their education, because it is they who represent the future of the European Union and there can be no future without books, be they in hard or soft copy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why this report is excellent. I would like to thank the rapporteur for all the work and the research she has carried out. It is a field which is continually changing.</p>
<p class="contents">In the publishing world, however, not only is production important, but so is consumption. Reading is a form of consumption which needs to be encouraged effectively. People have to make choices constantly about how they use their time. This is why I, together with my fellow Member Mr Graça Moura, tabled an amendment concerning the issue of a European day of reading. We proposed 23 April, as it is Shakespeare’s birthday and the anniversary of Cervantes’ death. It therefore covers the whole of Europe. There is already a UNESCO day of reading in many countries. But I grant the Commission the freedom and wisdom to select another date.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there is no supply without demand. In order to give an extra boost, Mr Garça Moura and I have also asked for a year of reading, preferably within the foreseeable future, but that might be pushing things.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is market forces. A book sector which is synonymous with a multiform and cultural diversity must be protected, where necessary. Fixed book prices and reduced VAT rates, as applied in various Member States to paper printing, must also apply to the electronic alternatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the positive side, we all know that the individualisation of supply and demand is one of the opportunities presented by electronic publishing. We take it for granted; but we may equally take something else for granted, something that has been receiving less attention, namely the fact that the book-publishing chain will change out of all recognition, with publishers and bookstores assuming a more central role, because electronic publishing will completely transform the distribution system. These are the good points.</p>
<p class="contents">On the negative side, access to reading material will be twice as difficult as it is now. Let us not fool ourselves. Of course, new digital technology offers an opportunity to democratise book reading, but it may also create an additional obstacle to literacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude, Madam President, by appealing for vigilance regarding the protection of copyright, since electronic publishing poses a particular threat in that respect, which is ultimately a threat to the creation of literary works. In this context, I must also draw attention to the need for regulated pricing of books in Europe for the same reasons, namely to safeguard the creation and distribution of literary works. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the report quite rightly emphasises, books play, and will continue to play, a vital role in extending the influence of our diverse European cultures, and indeed the remarkable growth in the number of published titles testifies to the wealth, the vitality and the diversity of these cultures. So it is only natural that we should have opted for an initiative designed to promote culture, an initiative which takes increasing account of the role of books as indispensable carriers of our cultural heritage. This, incidentally, is a feature of the cohesion policy we are pursuing through the Structural Funds. Are you aware of that, ladies and gentlemen? Let me give you some examples. Thanks to Community support, the number of libraries in Greece will double between now and the year 2006, rising from 526 to 1170. Over the same period, EUR 38 million will be devoted to the development of archives, libraries and reading under the operational programme on culture in Portugal, more than half of which will be financed from the European Regional Development Fund. The same thing has been happening in the domain of competition policy, where great emphasis is being placed on the value of books to the people of Europe. This is reflected in our cultural initiatives too. When we discussed the Culture 2000 programme, Parliament emphasised the major role that should be assigned to activities for the promotion of books and literature. The first year of implementation of the programme shows that this wish has been fulfilled. Mrs O’Toole’s report invites us to broaden our horizons and to consider all aspects of the technological revolution with a view to preserving the range of European publications in all its diversity, seizing new opportunities, dealing with any risks, guaranteeing access to knowledge and, last but not least, guaranteeing the rights of creative artists. The digital revolution constitutes both an opportunity and a risk. But that is very well expressed by Mrs O’Toole in her report, so I need not dwell on that point. Allow me to make just one remark, which relates to the risk of exclusion that could emerge if we do not pay special attention to the needs of disadvantaged people. Digital technology can do nothing for culture and education unless it is accessible. Madam President, I refuse to accept that there must inevitably be a technology gap between generations, between social strata, between those who are ‘switched on’ and those who are not, between those whose life and work will derive maximum benefit from digital technology and those for whom such technology will remain an object of fear and a threat to their place in society. I believe we must do everything possible to close this digital divide rather than merely declaring (a) that it exists and (b) that we cannot do anything about it. On the contrary, we certainly can do something about it. That is the civic duty and the social responsibility of everyone of us here, in Parliament or in the Commission. Besides, Madam President, I believe that globalisation, if it is harnessed, and digital technology need not automatically destroy national and regional cultures. It is certain that the cultural industries will be radically and rapidly transformed to incorporate the new reality of the information society. So we must guide these momentous changes rather than merely watching them unfold and allowing ourselves to be left behind. We must be in at the start of their development to ensure that digital technology is able to offer new access routes to published material as well as a rich diversity of such material.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our first initiatives, financially modest but exploratory in nature, is the establishment of a cooperative network of publishing houses. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the area in which the Commission has its most important role to play, and I was determined that the proposal for the implementation of the Culture 2000 programme in the year 2001 should provide for specific support for the realisation of several projects involving cooperation between authors and publishers. If the experiment bears fruit, we shall launch more initiatives for the promotion of the publishing trade in its role as a carrier of culture. I believe that this opens up a new path which has not yet been adequately explored and that we have a key role to play here as a source of inspiration and innovation. Besides the specific initiative of the culture programme, I can name a host of support activities through which we are helping to ensure that the book publishing and distribution trades achieve their own digital revolution; in this way, we are pursuing the very aims that our rapporteur has set out. The e-learning initiative, which I launched in May of last year, relates to the infrastructure of the education system, because any future action in that field depends on a sound educational infrastructure. The services of the Commission have prepared a detailed programme for the implementation of the e-learning initiative. The Commission is also funding pilot projects and will continue to do so, especially under Minerva, part of the Socrates programme, which is devoted specifically to the use of technology in education and which, along with the Leonardo programme for vocational education, is one of the cornerstones of our activity. In addition, the development of partnerships between the public and private sectors can also remedy shortfalls in the provision of training. The Commission’s e-Europe action plan, for its part, is designed to ensure that the information society also serves to further the aim of social integration. Access to the Internet, to multimedia resources, will be made available in many public centres, including centres in disadvantaged areas, by the end of 2001 and to all school pupils by the end of 2002. Another focal point of our efforts is the development of services which help to provide content in the fields of e-education and e-culture. The e-content programme has just been adopted for a four-year period with the aim of encouraging the creation and use of digital content. The market can also be stimulated now, thanks to our collaboration with the European Investment Bank and the creation of a venture-capital fund for multimedia businesses. The promotion of multimedia content is the aim of this collaboration between the Commission and the EIB, which has agreed to step in with funding for the cultural industries. We have opened up a new avenue here which bodes well for the future, for this future that digital technology holds out to us. This prospect, ladies and gentlemen, also merits greater commitment on our part and should be given a higher profile. I personally agree with the idea advanced by several of you – Mr Graça Moura, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mrs O’Toole – who have advocated the organisation of a year of books and reading. For various reasons, it is not possible to devote a special year to books and reading, but I believe we should sit down together and think about a books and reading day or week or month, which could be staged some time after the start of 2002. We shall not look at any specific dates or format just now, but do let us discuss this together, so that we can select the best possible option for inclusion in the Culture 2000 programme. I am very receptive to the idea of discussing this with interested parties in the framework of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport with a view to finding the solutions that will best serve the interests of books, reading and cultural diversity. As Members of the European Parliament will appreciate, technology is no more than an instrument, but it could be a very valuable instrument in our bid to maximise the potential of our European cultural heritage. And so I thank Mrs O’Toole and the Committee on Culture for their work and the important contribution they have made to the pursuit of this goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
