<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal for a Council regulation concerns the prolongation of the fisheries protocol which has been in force between the EU and Senegal for the period of 1 May 1997 to 30 April 2001. The prolongation concerns two periods. The first period is from 1 May 2001 until 31 July and the second from 1 August 2001 to 31 December. After several rounds of negotiations starting in Brussels in January 2001 no agreement was reached between the EU and Senegal on the renewal of the current protocol. Last June, Senegal suspended negotiations until October in order to gain time to analyse the fisheries issues and their effects. Breaking off the negotiations did not have the same negative impact as it had at the end of 1996 when all fisheries were suspended. This time there has been no suspension and good sense has prevailed on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">According to estimates by Senegal's research institute, which was carried out in 1996, the available resources at that time would permit catches of some 465 000 tonnes. However, recent scientific analysis has shown that, in spite of the satisfactory utilisation rates in this segment, coastal demersal resources have plummeted and have forced the small-scale and industrial fleet to fish in neighbouring countries. Of course, sustainable fishing is one of the leading principles of the common fisheries policy. Signals about the critical state of some fish stocks must be taken into account by both parties when negotiations are resumed.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the date of resumption of negotiations, the Senegalese Government is carrying out a new study to determine the country's present fisheries potential. Since the question of durable management was one of the breaking points at the negotiations, the Senegalese Government will make use of the results of this study later this year in negotiating with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries possibilities and the financial contribution from the Community have remained unchanged. The compensation to be paid by the Community for the eight months of this year will be calculated on a pro rata basis, meaning that the compensation for the period 1 May until the end of the year will be two-thirds of the yearly sum of EUR 12 million. That payment has to be made by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, as does the Committee on Fisheries, that it is important for Community fishermen that this agreement be renewed after 31 December of this year when the current prolongation expires. The renewal of the protocol is now more important than ever in terms of fishing opportunities, after the failure to reach agreement with Morocco. I am not trying to compare the opportunities in Senegal with Morocco, but the fact is that there are other opportunities there. We cannot compare them because the protocol with Morocco would have involved EUR 500 million over a four-year period. When, therefore, we consider the recently signed agreement with Mauritania, costing EUR 430 million over five years, the Senegal agreement is very modest in financial terms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of all these considerations, I can recommend this report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must also recognise the sensitivity shown by the rapporteur in not presenting amendments so as not to interfere with the result of the negotiations currently under way, although he indicates that the results of those negotiations will have to be analysed in line with the considerations expressed in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">I almost entirely agree with the considerations, but I would like to expand on the rapporteur’s reference to the lack of utilisation of the agreement by pelagic trawlers. The rapporteur refers to the fact that, in the Northern agreements, criticism has been made of the existence of ‘paper fish’ or ‘paper quotas’ and that also, in this case, payments should only be made in exchange for real fish.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that these situations are in no way comparable. In this case, fishing opportunities really exist and, being a Southern agreement, any interested Member State could chose to make use of them, just as in other categories of this same agreement entry has been granted to fleets that are not traditionally present in the area, such as those from Italy or Greece. If these opportunities are not taken advantage of, it will be because certain States have not been interested, but I doubt that with the non-existence or non-continuation of the agreement with Morocco, these opportunities will not be utilised in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Northern agreements, however, no Member State can fish. It is prohibited, even if a State is interested; and you all know that certain fleets are interested in being able to fish within these quotas which are already paid for. And we must also remember that, in this particular case, we are not talking about ‘paper fish’ because, as I have already stated, the fish really exist, unlike the cases of certain Northern agreements, where the state of resources is so poor that real fishing opportunities are not available, and which, by the way, are much more expensive than the agreement with Senegal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are grateful to the Government of Senegal for their willingness to allow our fleet to continue fishing until the parties have reached a new agreement. Fortunately, this time, the fleet has not been docked as it was five years ago. In the interim, the Commission and the Senegalese Government have reached a new fisheries agreement, which will be the subject of another debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The catches the Community fleet can benefit from are the surplus resources which the local fleet cannot fish. Fishing relations between Senegal and the European Union are wholly satisfactory to both parties. We must not forget that fish products account for 30% of Senegal’s exports and these exports are mainly sent to Europe. Furthermore, many of the landings of the Community fleet take place in Senegalese ports.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be wonderful if, in terms of what we are discussing here today (the coherence between the common fisheries policy and development cooperation policy we all want to see), the Commission could help the Senegalese authorities, and other developing countries, to manage their fisheries resources better, especially – as we have already said – in areas where there are young and spawning fish, which are in such need of it.</p>

On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to begin by adding a few remarks on the financing of the fisheries agreements concluded by the EU with third countries. We have proposed that fishermen should make a greater contribution to the financing of these agreements. It would be of benefit to themselves, but it would also, at the same time, be in line with current developments in the direction of a structure more in keeping with a market economy. It is gratifying that the Commission has begun to prepare evaluation reports on the previous protocol. The evaluation of existing agreements is an extremely valuable tool for improving the fisheries agreements. These must, of course, be to the advantage of European fishermen, who do in fact benefit from them, but also be to the advantage of local fishermen in the countries concerned with which the agreements have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement should relate to the surplus resources that cannot be caught by local fishermen. Sustainability must be ensured. That is the EU’s responsibility. The fisheries agreements are exceedingly important to certain regions of Europe in which, in addition to jobs in the sector itself, there is a range of additional businesses dependent upon fisheries. We should focus more upon the degree to which third countries make use of subsidies for the development of local fisheries and ensure that the development aid we provide is used in the best way possible and, especially, to benefit local fishermen. These agreements are important to the Community, especially in the light of the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco was not renewed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner to congratulate the Commission on the fact that, in the interim, we have been able to extend this agreement until the end of the year, which has allowed European fleets to continue fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to say to Mr Fischler that I am naturally concerned about the repercussions of this agreement for the fleets which, after the failure of the negotiations with Morocco, are in a truly delicate situation. All of this has its place within the framework of the debate we have held today on development cooperation and respect for the resources of third countries, certainly, but also in the knowledge that there are fishing opportunities which have not yet been utilised.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement that has been reached with Mauritania – on which we must also congratulate the Commission, and on which our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher is also working hard – has broken the curse that was stopping us from signing agreements and, therefore, the agreement with Senegal must come to fruition.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Commission is working seriously and has meetings arranged for 20 and 23 November. I urge it to work as quickly as possible and I also urge this Parliament to deal with it with the urgency it deserves, because it is of great importance in terms of the situation of the European fishing fleet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that you agree with the Commission’s proposal. This will enable the Community’s fishermen to continue their activity in this region while – as the Senegalese side wanted – a further study of the fisheries sector is prepared. The extension of the existing protocol also enables us to pursue negotiations for the multi-annual protocol without undue pressure of time and to bring them to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this agreement is a very important agreement for us. At EUR 12 million a year, the amount of money involved is considerable, and in purely mathematical terms it means EUR 8 million for the eight months extension. Apart from the considerable amount of money, the advantages for Senegal are not least that the agreement secures a major part of the raw materials required by the Senegalese fishing industry because EC vessels have to land part of their catches in Senegalese ports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable to accept the present amendment because it is, as you know, a fundamental component of the Community’s external fisheries policy that the costs of fishing rights should be met partly out of the Community budget and partly by the ship owners. That is included in all the negotiating guidelines for fisheries agreements. The financial compensation payable is specified in the agreements themselves. This is paid by the EU, while the ship owners have to pay the licence fees.</p>
<p class="contents">May I conclude by saying that the next round of negotiations for a new agreement or a new protocol is due to take place on 20 to 23 November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
