The Commission"s proposal calls into question the Community Customs Code as defined in the original Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress the importance of the Community Customs Code for third countries, in particular the former CEECs. This code serves as a reference and a model for many countries in urgent need of operational customs legislation enabling them to integrate into the world of international trade. In terms of commercial policy, although the customs tariff is losing its importance as an instrument for the protection of certain industries, it is still used to support competition policy. Anti‐dumping and countervailing duties are applied in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Community Customs Code. With regard to agricultural policy, the code"s customs procedures are used to manage the export refund arrangements. The new WTO rules depend on the code. In terms of external trade statistics, the Single Administrative Document provided for in the Code Implementing Provisions remains the instrument on which the gathering of statistics is based.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this essential role of the Community Customs Code, our group cannot understand the Commission"s proposal to eliminate or minimise the role of Member States in the procedure for implementing the Community Customs Code.</p>
<p class="contents">As an example, in the current regulation Member States may reserve the right, on their territory, to make customs declarations by direct or indirect representation in order to preserve the role of the customs agent. In this new proposal, the Commission limits this right to the indirect representation procedure. If this measure were adopted, the role of the customs agents would be significantly limited and a large number would disappear. The new provisions therefore seem to favour negative changes with a reduction in customs control by Member States, the elimination of jobs for customs agents and therefore an increase in the opportunities for fraud and a reduction in the Community preference.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the customs procedures and the placing of goods under a customs procedure, the Commission is proposing a system of exceptions for all companies making declarations electronically. The very principle of protection by Member States will be diminished because these electronic documents will eventually be sent directly to the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, from the two examples which I have just given, you will understand why our group is using its vote to oppose any change to the Community Customs Code which would lead to a reduction in Community preference and in the role of companies and national authorities in the customs process. I am surprised that, under the pretext of administrative simplification, the Commission is proposing to weaken the principle of Community preference together with a <span class="italic">de facto </span> reduction in controls which risk leading to an increase in fraud, particularly on the eve of new negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.</p>

In May 1998, the Council said that there should be limits to the commercial risk borne by importers in the EU, and it instructed the Commission to do something about it. Strangely enough, the Commission has done nothing about it, or at least this is the impression given by the proposal it has put before Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We supported Amendment No 13, which makes what we regard as a very welcome change to Article 220(2). We should like to see this phrase included in the text, since an importer that has acted ‘in good faith" should not be liable for the consequences of fraud or administrative errors committed by the exporter or the customs authorities. We would urge that this should be considered at a later stage in the decision‐making process.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think it is realistic to fear that changes to the Community Customs Code will mean that the European market is flooded with cheap products. Finally, we feel that the European single market must not be a ‘sealed fortress", particularly for less developed countries. Looking after number one is a morally repugnant maxim to follow in external trade policy, and we must also take account of the problems which the developing countries are currently wrestling with.</p>

The simple reason is that we have a problem with human rights violations in Uzbekistan, which in our view are not compatible with the clause in the preamble stating that the protection of human rights and democratic principles are prerequisites for the Agreement. That is why we abstained. We want a close relationship, but we feel that this P.A. can only become effective if Uzbekistan genuinely succeeds in establishing a stable democracy. Yesterday the Commission failed to convince us that this could be achieved solely by means of this economic agreement. It was also at a loss to answer the questions we raised, and as a result we feel that this is not the right time to ratify this Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">A further problem in our eyes, which is still not being taken into account in connection with the important question of whether to recognise Uzbekistan as a safe third country, is that there is no free access to the courts there, hence a basic condition for recognition is lacking. This is part and parcel of the Agreement, but the basic conditions are not being met. Therefore we were not able to agree to the ratification procedure at this point.</p>

Commercial relations and human rights cannot be separated from the other aspects. The Council must therefore be clearly invested as soon as possible with exclusive responsibility to ensure the coherence of all foreign policy actions of the European Union, whether these involve the CFSP, external commercial policy, human rights or aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note that we still have no way of assessing the efficiency of actions conducted within the TACIS programme. A programme cannot be regarded as efficient simply because of a significant level of take‐up of its appropriations. This efficiency can be measured only through an analysis of results for which we are still waiting.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission report on social protection in Europe calls on Member States to strengthen their efforts to promote gainful employment. It regards the provision of medical and hospital care as a mere commercial commodity and insured people as consumers who must limit their demand. It proposes measures to modernise social protection and to adapt systems of social protection to changing circumstances by means of privatisation of health provision and pension cover.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, while it contains some positive findings and puts forward relevant measures, accepts in its entirety the new social protection framework. It addresses existing problems of the financing of systems of social protection from the standpoint of their impact on the competitiveness of the European economy, thereby lending support to those who call for a reduction in spending and for partial privatisation of social provision.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the assessment contained in the report that the strengthening of market mechanisms in the area of medical and hospital care must not result in a two‐tier health service, we wish to say that privatising a part of medical and hospital care and strengthening market mechanisms in the sector will lead, <span class="italic">de facto</span> , to the creation of a two‐tier health service. Those with high levels of income will have no difficulty in paying high levels of contributions to private, profit‐making schemes, while the overwhelming majority of working people will be restricted to minimum, low levels of provision. The situation in Greece is typical, where we see that the NHS is being consciously downgraded and stripped bare, while the private sector is being shamefully strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">We are categorically opposed to attempts – in the name of cost reduction – to further reduce the level of pension provision from state social security services and to reduce pensions which provide a minimum survival income, which will benefit private profit‐making pension schemes to which those people will turn who want to improve on state subsistence pensions. The recent announcement made by the President of IKA that the setting‐up of a new supplementary insurance fund is being studied, which will function along purely private lines and which will be based on the principle of a direct link between the level of contributions and the level of provision, with the possible direct participation of private insurance capital, is giving rise to grave concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject the new model of social protection which is being prepared. We know that these choices are a direct consequence of the unpopular austerity policies imposed by the convergence criteria and the stability and growth pact and which exacerbate the problems of financing the state social security system and will eventually lead to its demise.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that in the short term, the most fundamental way of addressing the problems of the state social protection system is to boost full‐time, stable employment by promoting productive investment, especially in labour‐intensive sectors. This can be achieved by providing support in terms of financial and tax incentives for SMEs which absorb the greatest share of overall employment, and by reducing working hours without reducing wages.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that there are solutions – other than the ones put forward – to the immediate financial problems of social security organisations, such as the strict enforcement of existing provisions of social security legislation regarding contributions, combating the evasion of social security contributions and undeclared work, taxing profit‐making movements of capital, and the abolition of exemptions in the taxation of income from movable assets and derivatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Side by side with the working population, we are fighting to maintain and strengthen the state social security system of social protection, to broaden and improve the quality of provision in order to bring it in line with the objective of a high level of unified state social protection.</p>

<p class="contents">This is just one of the enormous problems that the introduction of the euro has caused, problems that have been swept under the carpet for purely ideological reasons without any proper debate. Nevertheless, I totally reject the idea of harmonising social security at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">In Belgium, we know what it means when two nations are required to share the same social security system. The automatic financing mechanisms produce the very opposite of solidarity, a sort of organised robbery. This may sound harsh, but it is true.</p>
<p class="contents">We are heading in this same direction at European level, only worse, because experience with the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund has taught us that local and national authorities are, by definition, not very careful with ‘European" money. So spare us this pressure for European harmonisation. We need to understand that the greatest progress and the best forms of social security are achieved within clearly defined limits. We can always create other forms of Community or extra‐Community solidarity, but that is something else entirely.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
