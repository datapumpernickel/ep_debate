We have regular reports of the continued use of the death penalty and inhuman and degrading treatment in prisons with reports of the use of torture. Those concerns are particularly true in Tibet, where we continue to receive many reports of violations in particular against Buddhist monks and people who follow the Buddhist faith.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Hong Kong, we strongly support demands for the provision of universal suffrage within the territory. I would note, however, that in far too many countries in the world the demonstration on 4 December of tens of thousands of people in favour of such universal suffrage would not have been permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have a problem. Paragraph 14 of the resolution – on which we have asked for a split vote – invites the Dalai Lama to address Parliament in what would be seen as his capacity as a head of state. I do not believe it is our place to make such a momentous change to our one-China policy in the middle of an urgency debate. I personally have met and talked to the Dalai Lama on two occasions. I have no objection to his being invited to the Committee on Foreign Affairs or anywhere else. However, I and the PSE Group will not be able to support this resolution if that paragraph remains in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Again and again, we come up against the problem that the Dalai Lama is treated as a separatist, even though he has always explicitly supported the ‘one China’ policy, does not support any secessionist movements, and even though his own requests for negotiations on autonomy are couched in the most pacific terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make is that monasteries are now being used as places where pressure is exerted not only on monks, but also on the general population, in an attempt to re-educate them, and it is because this sort of thing is unacceptable under any circumstances that I ask you to vote in favour of this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again we are here, this time to seek to highlight the ‘patriotic education’ campaign conducted in Tibetan monasteries. Last month five Tibetan monks were arrested in Drepung Monastery. We hear they have also been tortured in detention. But what is their crime? Their crime is that they refused to sign declarations denouncing His Holiness the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist.</p>
<p class="contents">Public education began as a tool of repression in 1996 in China, but it has escalated since 2005. The Chinese Government is attempting to brainwash the people. This is not public education, it is a suppression of human rights. No doubt the Chinese will again say this is an internal matter for China, but the international community cannot sit idly by when peace-loving people are subjected to this kind of treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to know in particular what happened to the young Tibetan monk Ngawang Jangchub, who died in October during a ‘patriotic education’ session. The Chinese Government must listen to our calls for respect for human rights. If it does not, the least we should do – and I mean the least we should do – is maintain our EU embargo on trade in arms. Unlike one of the previous speakers, I would like to see the Dalai Lama coming here and addressing Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His death resulted from his interrogation by cadres of the campaign for so-called ‘patriotic education’.</p>
<p class="contents">The object of this is that critics of the regime should be brought back into line by means of drastic physical and mental re-education measures. Over 10 000 monks and nuns in Tibet have been obliged to undergo brainwashing since 1996, something that constitutes a flagrant breach of freedom of opinion and religion. The intention is that threats, periods of detention, and torture should induce the inhabitants of monasteries to denounce the Dalai Lama, in writing as an enemy of the state and a separatist. Mrs Lynn has already described how, on 23 November, Chinese security forces occupied the Drepung monastery near the capital, Lhasa. When they arrested five senior monastics, 400 monks mounted a peaceful demonstration for their release. The police and special units responded promptly to this by sealing the monastery off from the outside world for days on end. Are human rights resolutions adopted by this House a matter of indifference to the Chinese? It is evidently not enough for them that the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, and the Council should intervene. Or are they no more than footnotes to the loudly-heralded dialogue between the EU and China? Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, let me remind the House of our debate in October, on which occasion we demanded, as a matter of urgency, an improvement in the conditions under which the highly regarded Lama Tensin Delek Rinpoche were being held, which were putting his life at risk, in order to make it possible for him to receive a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, has just published the results of his inspection of Chinese prisons, labour camps and police stations. He confirms that torture is taking place, and that prisoners and persons regarded as suspect are being mistreated. The effect of the Chinese system of re-education through work is that people can be sent, without a court having passed sentence upon them, to a camp for up to three years. That is a manifest offence against their personal integrity and against the dignity of every human being. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution achieved nothing, however, as Tenzin Delek Rinpoche is still being detained and tortured, in spite of his poor state of health. It merely demonstrated the extent to which human rights are violated in China.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese authorities are currently implementing a policy of ‘patriotic education’, and forcing Tibetans to sign declarations in which they reject the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader and acknowledge that Tibet is part of China. Anyone who refuses to sign such a declaration is threatened with persecution and arrest. As Members of this House have stressed repeatedly, Tibetan monks are at particular risk. These extraordinary ‘patriotic education’ sessions have already resulted in the death of one monk in unknown circumstances and the arrest of five others. What is more, the 7 000-strong Drepung Monastery has been occupied by the Chinese Special Forces since 25 November, and hence completely cut off from the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the situation in Tibet, it is clear that the international community must continue to exert pressure on China to improve the conditions in which prisoners are held and to abolish the use of torture and the death penalty. In addition, the Tibetan people must be supported in their fight for life and a continued national identity. It is also worth mentioning in passing that only a dozen or so of the over 3 000 Buddhist monasteries that were once found in Tibet are still in existence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hope that we will finally achieve our goal by adopting yet another resolution, we must do everything in our power to ensure that the Chinese authorities put an immediate stop to such blatant violations of civil liberties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are calling for the abolition of the system whereby the Chief Executive is chosen by a committee made up of about 800 Hong Kong residents selected by Beijing. To be fair, however, such a system is arguably better than the previous system whereby the ex-British colony was administered by a governor appointed by the Queen of England. I cannot recall the European Parliament passing any resolutions at that time condemning Britain for imposing such an undemocratic system on the people of Hong Kong. Then again, what right does this House have, even today, to criticise British colonial policies? It dared not do so in the past, and I expect it would not dare do so now concerning Britain’s occupation of approximately 300 square kilometres of Cyprus as a colony, where thousands of Cypriot civilians are governed by an administrator appointed by the Queen of England.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I become too controversial for my honourable British colleagues, let me finish by saying that in this resolution we call for the setting of a timetable for the election of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive by universal suffrage. Nevertheless, we should, in the near future, pass a resolution calling for an end to Britain’s colonisation of Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that, in 30 months’ time, the world’s young people will gather in Beijing for the Olympic Games and that the Chinese Government intends to take advantage of this event to celebrate its pseudo-democratic model, I would modestly suggest that we should allow our athletes to bear a message of peace, democracy and freedom so that they can be the champions of the Tibetan cause, otherwise we will do a great disservice to everyone in that part of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When Hong Kong was handed back to China, the formula of two systems in one country was devised. People laboured under the illusion that, for Hong Kong, this would mean that, unlike in the rest of China, a parliamentary democracy on the basis of universal suffrage and a multi-party system could exist. It was thought that it could thus be a trial area for future developments in the rest of China.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know what those two systems come down to: capitalism under the control of the governing party in the largest part of China, and capitalism without that control in Hong Kong. There is a lack of democracy in both cases. The situation in Hong Kong, where a small selected group has been given the responsibility of self-government, is of course preferable by far to the situation in Tibet, where violence, intimidation and re-education are the instruments employed by the central authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Although my group has not been among the signatories of the resolution, I am prepared to endorse it. Moreover, I should like to remind you that the Dalai Lama has already addressed this Parliament’s plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 23 November, officials from the Public Security Bureau closed one of the oldest Tibetan Buddhist monasteries on the orders of the Chinese authorities. They arrested one of the most senior monks, and four others whose fate is unknown. A policy of ‘patriotic education’, which amounts to indoctrination, has been introduced in the country in order to boost support for the Chinese Government among the Tibetan monks, and to combat the influence of the exiled Dalai Lama. Tibet has been brutally occupied by China since 1950. The Tibetans have not given up their peaceful fight for freedom, however, even though at least one fifth of the country’s inhabitants have died of hunger, been tortured to death or been executed. Nearly all of the country’s monasteries, which once numbered over 6 500, are in ruins.</p>
<p class="contents">The Holy Father John Paul II reminded us that the seeds of destabilisation, rebellion and violence are inevitably sown when human rights are neglected or even abused. There is an urgent need to restore people’s awareness of the dignity of every human being, made in the image and likeness of God, so that it can be used as a sound foundation for freedom, justice and peace on earth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Government of the People’s Republic of China, however, even imposes strict controls on religious practices and places of worship. It limits the number of monks and uses exile as a punishment, especially for anyone who is not suitably submissive. Yet notwithstanding the massive scale of the tragedy in Tibet, it is worth noting that the problem of human rights violations, which is an issue that has already been raised in this Chamber, affects the Chinese nation as a whole. The people of China have been repressed for years, and all manifestations of civil independence in the country are stifled. There is detailed documentary evidence of the methods and instruments used to inflict torture on prisoners and of the brutal treatment they receive, even if they have merely voiced their discontent. Such practices are proof of the cruel barbarity that prevails there.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in China in recent times can be described as a highly explosive mixture of Communism and capitalism. The laws of economics have become the only driving force behind development in the country, and there is no longer any place for human rights or moral standards. While it may well be the case that those in power are responsible for human rights violations in individual countries, we should not forget that the moral relativism of the Western world is also partly responsible. Adamant claims are made that this latter promotes human rights, and yet companies from more or less every country in the world find it hard to resist the huge consumer market and the cheap workforce, especially in the ‘reeducation through work’ camps. The prospect of enormous profits helps them to shut their eyes to the tragic situation of prisoners, and to the fact that the materialistic civilisation that is emerging is heading for disaster, at the same time creating poverty and hell on earth for some and paradise for the rich.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling for the international community to stop treating China as if it were a giant labour camp and a cheap workforce, and for human rights to be respected not only in Tibet and Hong Kong, but throughout China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are always paying lip service to human rights, but we do not act on the basis of what we say. The European Union and most Member States are more interested in China’s economic potential than in having human rights respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Just think of the European Council’s attempts to lift the arms embargo against China or the way in which European trade missions get in each other’s way in China these days. I was also embarrassed when I heard a while ago that the Belgian Government had denied the Dalai Lama access to its territory, because this could be harmful to our contacts with Communist China.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently debating the situations in Tibet and Hong Kong, but we could also debate the threats to Taiwan or the existence of the lao gai concentration camps in China.

These issues are very high on the agenda of our dialogue with China.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also welcomes and supports the General Affairs and External Relations Council's conclusions of 12 December, which voice strong concern over China’s human rights policy – in particular, with respect to the rights of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">On 12 December, the General Affairs and External Relations Council also approved the Commission’s negotiating mandate for a new partnership and cooperation agreement with China. The mandate also stipulates that a partnership agreement with China will contain a standard clause on human rights. I wish to stress that, for many years, we have not concluded agreements with other parties without such a human rights clause.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Hong Kong, the European Union supports democracy throughout the world as the best means of creating legitimate, stable, accountable and transparent government, of protecting rights and freedom, and of upholding the rule of law. It supports early and substantial progress towards the ultimate goal of universal suffrage in Hong Kong, as set out in the basic law, in line with the wishes of the people of Hong Kong. It is important that we maintain pressure on China to work towards universal suffrage in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the situation in Tibet, the European Union has put Tibet very high on its agenda with China. It has, in particular, mainly focused its attention on the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. The present situation in the region, which we follow very closely, raises grave concern, especially with respect to the exercise of religious freedom. We are worried to see that the local authorities have imposed a strict framework setting limits on the exercise of this freedom, and we deplore the recent cases of detention of monks and, in particular, the blockade of the monastery of Drepung in Lhasa.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that a solution compatible with both Chinese sovereignty and respect for the Tibetan population will be found soon. In our view, to reach this ultimate goal, there is no alternative but a peaceful process based on dialogue. We have called for years, and will continue to call, for the establishment of such a dialogue. We, therefore, fully support the process which has been taking place over the past years between Beijing and the representatives of the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="contents">We firmly believe that only such a direct dialogue can be conducive to a lasting solution of the Tibetan issue. In our view, the opening of a direct dialogue should not be made subject to any precondition. On the other hand, the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of the climate of confidence that appears indispensable, if a solution is to be reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
