As a Member of this House, I then rub my eyes in astonishment when I see President Chirac of France referring to the figure known as Turkmenbashi as ‘Father of all Turkmen’ and ‘my best and great friend’. He did this on 13 October on the occasion of the presentation of the new French Ambassador’s letters of credence in Ashkabad.</p>
<p class="contents">In his letter to President Niyazov, President Chirac also expressed the desire to consolidate and deepen the warm relations between France and Turkmenistan. Apparently, in Paris, oil and natural gas interests take priority over everything. Just compare that with our resolution. What was that we were saying about a single European voice?</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the Member States of the European Union are discussing the undeniable fact of the Christian tradition of the Occident, sincere Christians in Turkmenistan are having to fear for their lives daily. It is their certain knowledge and solace that God is watching over His church everywhere. That does not alter the fact, however, that we have a political responsibility towards their oppressors.

Well, there is nothing just about life in Turkmenistan, but justice for the Turkmen people is what this debate is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">President Niyazov renamed himself. He renamed the days of the week. He named the months of the year after his national heroes, starting with himself and his mother. He has built lavish palaces; he has erected statues of himself while his people remain impoverished. From 1985 he has ruled as a tyrant. Since 1999 he has been president for life. In November last year the worst repression of all followed an attack on him.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkmenistan has become a land of torture and imprisonment, of death in custody, of intolerance towards political and religious views. The press is muzzled, human rights organisations are barred and opposition is driven abroad. Our resolution lists names, and we demand the release of those names, the end of ill-treatment in those cases where they are actually still alive, and access to them for the Red Cross. But they are the tip of an iceberg that needs to be exposed. I trust that the Commission will do just that.</p>
<p class="contents">Our delegation on Central Asia covers all the countries of Central Asia and Mongolia. Last May we were in Uzbekistan, the beautiful and historic country of Tamburlaine. We were made welcome and we saw some improvements in human rights and a willingness to open doors. But two days after we left Mr Ruslan Sharipov was arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">Ruslan Sharipov is a journalist who wrote about police and government corruption. He was arrested on charges of homosexual conduct, criminalised in that country under Article 120 of the criminal code, in contradiction with the provisions of the ICCPR ratified by Uzbekistan. On 28 August masked men kidnapped and severely beat his public defender, Surat Ikramov.</p>
<p class="contents">In September Mr Sharipov got out by letter allegations of his ill-treatment and of how he was threatened in prison by police and prison officers. In September the charge was reduced, but only reduced. He should never have been charged. He should be released now, and I ask the Commission to intervene in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">While we were in Uzbekistan, we also met the British Ambassador, Craig Murray. He is a fearless diplomat who told us the truth as he saw it. Perhaps he was unwise to do so, but he was right to do so. At a meeting in Tashkent on 17 October he said: 'I believe that people are born with an instinct for liberty and that freedom and democracy come naturally to people everywhere once they are given the chance'. Well, the British Government did not endorse or commend him. It summoned him home for treatment. I ask the Commission to issue a diplomatic 'habeus corpus' challenge to the British Foreign Secretary: restore a good man to his post and the gainers will be the Uzbek people and their leaders, but also the good name of British diplomacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been quoted by other fellow Members, Turkmenistan is ‘one of the worst totalitarian systems in the world’. The situation in other Central Asian countries is perhaps a little better, but there, too, the human rights situation is abominable. Does that mean that Europe should ignore Central Asia? My answer is ‘no’, and for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the strategic goals. Ignoring that region will not do. It is not in Europe’s interests to let those countries, which export corruption and instability as well as oil and gas, remain ‘rogue states’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second reason, too, which is the necessity – already mentioned by some fellow Members – of doing business regarding the large quantities of oil and gas in that region. To some politicians, however, and sadly also some fellow MEPs, that means that we have to do business first and foremost, and that we should just mention human rights, but on no account focus attention on them too much.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past, when, on account of our need for oil from the Middle East, we kept quiet about the human rights violations in Saudi Arabia. It is true that Europe needs oil and gas, including from that region, but that also means that those countries need us, and this provides us with the opportunity of giving priority to the human rights situation – to improving it, in particular – in our dealings with those countries, and only then speaking about oil. Referring to EU policy in Kosovo I would say: ‘standards before oil’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are both members of the delegation on Central Asia, and it is partly thanks to him and his great commitment that we are able to put this kind of issue back on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin with Turkmenistan. I am still rapporteur for a new cooperation agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan. Parliament, along with the Commission, has stated that it does not actually want to conclude that agreement, nor does it want to discuss it. There is every reason for this. As Mr Bowis and other fellow Members have already stated, it is perfectly clear, looking at the current situation, that that regime is unacceptable. At the same time, however, we have to think about what we can do for the people of Turkmenistan. We believe that Parliament must make an urgent appeal for the Red Cross to be able to visit the prisoners again in any event, for us to be able to resume good contact with the NGOs, and for those NGOs to have some freedom once again in those countries. We must stand up for the people – including politicians and human rights activists – who are currently incarcerated. We must stand up for freedom of belief. It is too absurd for words that only a certain form of Islam, and only the Orthodox Church, still have some degree of freedom, or in any event still enjoy a measure of protection, while all the other groups, both Christian and non-Christian, lack that protection. This is unacceptable, because people and religion belong together.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to a number of the other countries mentioned, I should like to point out that, in spring of this year, we also discussed a resolution on Kazakhstan. That led to intensive talks between our delegation and parliamentary delegations from Kazakhstan, and improvements were introduced on a number of items. We are still finding ourselves disappointed on many counts, however: legal procedures, freedom of the press, and also freedom of organisation. I hope that these first steps that Kazakhstan has made in the right direction are not the last, but instead that further pressure, including on the part of the European Union, will lead to improvements in the situation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a passionate plea for a new cooperation agreement with Tajikistan. Fortunately, the Commission is currently preparing an agreement for that country, too, which is an extremely good thing, because we must keep close to these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bowis has already described the situation in Uzbekistan, and I have nothing to add.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves Kyrgyzstan. The present resolution rightly levels a number of criticisms, but, at the same time, we have here a country that deserves our warm support, because it is trying, with ups and downs, to build a democracy, despite having no resources and no oil. There should be criticism where criticism is due, but, even more importantly, support where support is due. I also wish to express to the Commission my hope that, in coming years, when it comes to Central Asia, the European Union will perhaps give a little extra support to a country such as this, in particular, which has no oil and no resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our analysis is therefore the same: the situation is serious in relation to respect for human rights. In spite of this situation, however, it is important to maintain dialogue with Turkmenistan in order to avoid totally isolating the country, which in our opinion and in the current circumstances would probably be even worse from the point of view of respect for human rights, which we promote.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other countries of Central Asia – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan – which you have just mentioned, at both EU level and Member State level, we continue to stress that the international commitments concerning human rights must be respected, and we do this within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the bilateral relations between the Union and these countries, we do the same, and we have done so publicly for all of these democracy problems in Central Asia by cooperating with other international bodies working with us on this issue, be it the United Nations, the OSCE or the Commission on Human Rights. Therefore, we fully and completely share the concerns that have just been expressed and are set out in the motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
