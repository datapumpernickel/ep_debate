<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, since the Slovak Republic was founded on 1 January 1993, and particularly since Slovakia presented its candidature for accession to the European Union in 1995, relations between your country and the European Parliament have developed steadily and fruitfully, paving the way for mutual understanding and the building of ties of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The change of government in 1998, and then your election as President of the Republic in the first presidential elections to be held in Slovakia using direct suffrage, in May 1999, are events that have had a very positive influence on enhancing relations between us and making them more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Since you were invested in Bratislava, having served your country in various roles, including as mayor of the town of Košice from 1994 to 1998, the Slovak government, led by Mr Dzurinda, the Prime Minister, has turned its policies towards the prospect of accession to the European Union. Under your Presidency, Mr Schuster, democracy has been established and consolidated in Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki European Council of December 1999 took the decision to open the negotiations for accession, which began in March 2000. The opening and progress of negotiations between your country and the European Union demonstrate, and I am particularly pleased to see this, that Slovakia has fully mastered the ‘catching up’ principle, because it was at the request of the European Parliament that this principle was established at the Helsinki European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakia has now decided to place itself, as you have just said, Mr President, at the vanguard of the accession process. I want your country to know that it has the support of the European Parliament. It can count on a totally constructive attitude towards this accession being achieved as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall now ask you to address our Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schuster,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Slovak Republic</span><a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, only a short while ago I paid my tribute to the memory of Louise Weiss, an exceptional person, initiator of the idea of European unification, journalist and politician who gave the opening address at the first session of the European Parliament in 1979 – ten years before the fall of the Iron Curtain. Louise Weiss was connected by ties of deep friendship with one of the most noted personalities of our history, a Slovak politician of European-wide standing – Milan Rastislav �tefánik – politician, diplomat, scientist and astronomer who made France his second home.</p>
<p class="contents">Louise Weiss said in her address to the European Parliament that it was the happiest day of her life. Today, I have the exceptional and great honour to speak to you at the plenary session of the European Parliament, representing the most important political parties of the Member States of the European Union and for this opportunity I wish to thank you. This is the first time that the Slovak language has been spoken at your plenary session. It is my deep conviction that, in a not too distant future, it will become one of the official languages of the European Union. Just as, geographically, my country is an indivisible part of the European continent, its history, culture and traditions are an inseparable part of European history. Shutting my country out behind the Iron Curtain was nothing more than an artificial move by the holders of power on the political chessboard of history. It is therefore natural that we should link the future of Slovakia with Europe. Europe that is unified and prosperous, peaceful and attractive. Our common Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You are performing your work for Europe in a truly momentous period. Your term coincides with the taking of historical decisions on enlargement which, and this is my deep conviction, represents the most important contribution to the stability and prosperity of our continent in its modern history. We owe you our respect and gratitude for promoting this process. The citizens of Slovakia will always bear this in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union is among the key priorities of our foreign policy. However, I view accession also from the broader perspective of the development of our society and of Europe. Slovakia's progression towards the European Union means that the country is returning to the culture and civilisation where it belongs both by its history and its system of values. This is the general framework in which the Slovak Republic defined its foreign policy priorities right from the outset, when it set out to obtain full membership of the European Union and NATO. In 2000 Slovakia gained membership of the OECD and is one of the most hopeful candidates for NATO membership when the Alliance decides to enlarge.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased to note that around 70% of our population of more than five million people support accession to the European Union. What is even more important is that this percentage includes the supporters of the strongest opposition parties, because these political parties too, currently in opposition, built their political programmes on the integration ambitions of the Slovak Republic. The right course of Slovakia's security policy whose ultimate goal is membership in the North Atlantic Alliance, through active participation in the European Security and Defence Policy was confirmed by the security strategy document adopted by our legislature. The fact that this document was adopted with the support of an absolute majority in Parliament, demonstrates that both the ruling coalition and the opposition pursue the same strategic principles when it comes to the future orientation of the Slovak Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the President of a young democratic country, I cannot fall victim to the feeling of self-satisfaction with this rare political consensus. Ever since I assumed my presidential office I have been trying to impress not only on the political leaders, but also on all those who are not indifferent to the future of Slovakia, that the direction of the country must not depend on a momentary euphoria or on the fleeting political preferences of those in power. This is the reason why I and a group of experts are drafting a medium-term and a long-term vision, which should be adopted as a constitutional statute by the National Council of the Slovak Republic with the support of the broadest possible political spectrum. This document – may I call it a State doctrine – should define in very clear terms and at the highest legislative level the future orientation of Slovakia to the European and transatlantic structures. It would convincingly dispel the doubts with which I am often confronted during by trips abroad in my discussions with the friends and observers of Slovakia who ask: "What changes can be again expected in the foreign policy orientation of Slovakia after the next elections?"</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, we are pleased with the public support for the integration ambitions of Slovakia. However, we cannot ignore the worries or mistrust among citizens of the EU Member States who fear that the enlargement of the Union could have undesirable consequences. I can understand their concerns – they are natural and human. At the same time I have the impression that these worries are often conjured up artificially. It is not our wish to disturb what has been achieved in the integration process in past decades. We have to jointly focus on two areas. We – in the applicant countries – must thoroughly prepare for membership and, together with the EU members, we should alleviate the doubts concerning enlargement. And we must work together to strengthen European solidarity and the feeling of togetherness. Europe is not only a map. I am convinced that the basis for its permanent revival is an ongoing honest dialogue with the citizens of the unifying Europe. The entry of each new country will enrich the common house by its spiritual, cultural and historical heritage. We want to contribute to the enlargement of the common market but at the same time we want to be a contribution to the economy and thus contribute to greater stability and security for all of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You are familiar with the fact that the Slovak Republic was not invited to open accession negotiations in 1997 in Luxembourg because of its failure to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria. This was not a good situation for Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament was the first to respond to the new situation in the Slovak Republic through its Resolution of October 1998, which acknowledged the changes in the style of government of the country and its new orientation after the elections. I would like to take this opportunity to state how highly I regard the relations between the European Parliament and the Slovak Republic which, especially during the last two years, have gained a new momentum. The relations between the European Parliament and the National Council of the Slovak Republic have also intensified thanks to the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Committee which I personally highly appreciate. Parliamentary democracy is also greatly strengthened by the joint meetings between the President of the European Parliament and the presidents of the parliaments of applicant countries. The next such meeting is to be held in a few days in Bratislava.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakia was invited to open negotiations on accession to the European Union in 1999 in Helsinki. Today – after 17 months of negotiations – we note great progress. I am convinced that by the end of the Swedish Presidency we will provisionally close negotiations on more than half the chapters. At this rate our country has a chance to catch up with the countries that had started negotiations earlier, and to complete accession negotiations by the end of 2002. We make no secret of our hope that the citizens of the Slovak Republic will also cast their votes in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The path of integration is interspersed with exceptionally lively political discussions and, sometimes, disputes. We are happy that we have got rid of the one-sided monologue of political elites we knew in the past. This path is not a smooth one, but the prospect of future membership of the European Union multiplies the sorely needed pro-reform energy. I want to assure you that we have no shortage of this energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2000 was the year of the "economy". We continued implementing the reforms launched by the Slovak Government after its coming to power in 1998 with a view to restoring stability at the macro-economic level. Structural adjustment brought improvements in the effectiveness of the corporate sector. However, if I want to take a realistic view of the economy of my country, I must consider it from the point of view of the everyday life of people, their economic possibilities. And here I realise – as confirmed in my direct contacts with the citizens of my country – that economic reforms can have painful consequences for the socially weakest groups of the population. I am convinced that the current – and the most difficult – phase of the reform will soon bring its positive effects. In this respect, I feel that the Slovak Government may have lost some time when, during its first year in power, it was too absorbed with pointing to the mistakes of the previous government and pronouncements of the need to eliminate their consequences, rather than immediately and constructively tackling all the problems, especially in the economic field. It is too late to say now that if the style of government had been more flexible right from the start, today the citizens could enjoy the fruit of all those sound economic steps. This too is the reason why in every political or professional discussion on the subject of economic and legal reforms I stand up as an advocate of the reforms, even though I always view them in terms of their benefits for the majority of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, 2001, is the year of "legislation". In February the Slovak Parliament passed the long awaited amendment to the Constitution, compatible with the constitutions of EU Member States. The amendment has put in place the legal prerequisites for the integration of Slovakia. The amended text explicitly provides that the Slovak Republic may delegate the exercise of some of its powers to the European Union through or on the basis of an international treaty. The amendment also lays down the precedence of legally binding acts of the European Union over the laws of the Slovak Republic. Moreover, it sets out the procedure for the transposition of legally binding acts into the national legislation in the form of laws and government ordinances. Other necessary steps include the taking of measures for implementing public administration reform, completing structural reform, strengthening the banking sector and building a modern state administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The national legal system of the Slovak Republic is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. Through its Constitution and the ratified international instruments on human rights, the state guarantees the enjoyment of rights and freedoms to all citizens without any distinction. However, unemployment and the adverse economic situation in some regions of Slovakia have created serious problems for dealing with the issue of the Roma national minority. In my opinion, finding effective solutions in this area is one of the most important tasks of society as a whole. The serious attention given to this problem by the government is expressed through the Government's Strategy for Addressing Roma National Minority Issues and the set of measures for its implementation. I take the view that this is not a problem of Slovakia alone, but a broader European problem whose solution is very complex and requires a partner-like approach. The visit to Roma settlements in Slovakia by Commissioner Günther Verheugen exemplifies the commitment to a common approach to dealing with the Roma issue, which is one of the key areas that will require our attention in the future. During my years as the mayor of the city of Kosice, situated in the region with higher concentrations of the Roma population, I learned the basic precept – effective assistance requires active involvement of the Roma themselves in the solution of their problems, otherwise the efforts will be wasted. The Project on Eliminating the Disproportions of the Roma National Minority, launched on my initiative, envisages the participation of the representatives of individual Roma groups in its implementation. The first experience gained indicates that the level of legal awareness and democratic thinking – even among educated Roma – has been marked by decades of a paternalistic approach by the state to the Roma community whose members find it difficult to exercise their powers. This is why I believe that this issue will still have to be addressed by the generations that come after us. I have also brought my initiative to the attention of the Presidents of other Visegrad Group countries; we agreed to adopt a common procedure with the President of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the individual approach and the assessment of the countries on their merits. This is the reason why we internally are striving to make the Slovak Republic take its place among the first countries to enter the European Union. We make no secret of our ambition to do it together with our neighbours – the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, our partners in the Visegrad cooperation process. This cooperation, which strengthens our good neighbourly relations, is being positively received both at home and abroad. Not only does it enhance the atmosphere of regional European allegiance, but is also an important element of integration. In this connection, on my initiative and in cooperation with the President of the Republic of Poland, several cross-border cooperation projects were launched under the patronage of the Chancellery of the President. Because of their positive results I plan to extend similar projects also to other border regions – those with Hungary and the Czech Republic. I attach great historic significance to the creation and functioning of the Visegrad grouping whose aim is to encourage close cohesion of an mutually beneficial cooperation within the central European region as the basis for its future integration into economic, political and security structures. These common objectives of the V-4 countries contribute to the development of Europe as a whole and to expanding the zone of stability to the entire continent. The idea of the accession of Visegrad countries to the European Union as one group has logical implications for the definition of the Schengen-type border whose length will depend on the map of the enlarged European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When speaking about the future of the European Union, the discussion on which was launched in the wake of the Nice summit, I would personally prefer to speak about the near future and the distant future. It would not be easy to mix everything together and to try to resolve all the issues facing the European Union by 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the opinion that the candidate countries should be given a chance to effectively contribute to the exchange of views in the preparation for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference. It is personally hardly conceivable for me to see the prospective members of a family left standing at a closed door during the discussions on important matters that concern everybody, older members, newer members and prospective newcomers, especially if the latter are expected to enter the family within the time horizon in question.</p>
<p class="contents">We all, both members and candidates for membership, want a stronger Europe. We may agree with many, although not all the opinions. Thus, it would not be appropriate to delay the process of enlargement on the ground of what I consider to be unjustified worries about the enlargement bringing the threat of "dilution" of the European Union, or endangering the possibility of the continued political integration. I am convinced that the Slovak Republic and other candidate countries are no less prepared for further integration than some current members.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective must be to further build the European Union as a political community. I agree with the words of the President of the European Parliament Madame Nicole Fontaine according to whom we cannot continue building the European Union in "closed circles". At a certain stage of development, several issues may emerge and require solution, while it is not always possible to resolve all of them. But the process must continue and the system must remain open.</p>
<p class="contents">An important part of the entire European integration process is the building of the European identity. National identity plays an important role in the life of individuals, because it is the means for their self-identification and affiliation with a certain group. As the President and a citizen of the Slovak Republic, I have no worries about the loss of sovereignty after our accession to the European Union, because in an integrating Europe, a sovereign country is one that takes part in the decisions that concern the development and direction of the European Union. The entry of the Slovak Republic to the European Union will be the real completion of sovereignty of our country.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The future of Slovakia lies with the European Union which will become the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking to you as a European to Europeans, facing a unique challenge and immense responsibility. Let us turn the ideal of common spiritual values and historic experience into the reality of a unified and prosperous Europe, attractive to all citizens of its countries and serving as an example for other regions and continents.

Your tribute was extremely moving.</p>
<p class="contents">You have reminded us that your country is a part of the living reality of Europe, not only of its historical and geographical reality, but also its cultural reality. I can tell you that we in the European Parliament have always been convinced of this. Indeed, the European Parliament has watched the process of Europe’s reunification with great enthusiasm. The Treaty of Nice, which was concluded in December of last year, even if people’s appreciation of certain parts of it varied, at least had the merit of opening up the way to enlargement, to the reunification of Europe, which all of us here are delighted to see.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard your great determination to pursue difficult economic reforms, your determination to adapt your legislation, your determination to resolve the problem of minorities, which you know is an issue close to the heart of our Parliament, and lastly, your determination to join us as quickly as possible. I must tell you that I, or rather we, felt that we broadly share the same great objectives for the future, the same concept of the European Union. Discussions have already begun, as you mentioned, and are expected to conclude in 2004. You may rest assured, Mr President, that Parliament’s desire is, of course, to see the applicant countries closely involved in these discussions. You said that you would assume full responsibility, which is indeed great. We clearly heard your message and I can tell you that you really do have the full support of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we look forward to hearing the beautiful Slovak language very soon in our Parliament. Thank you once again.</p>
