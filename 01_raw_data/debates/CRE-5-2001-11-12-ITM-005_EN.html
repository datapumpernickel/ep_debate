<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maij-Weggen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="bold"> </span>– <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, this week marks the provisional end of the discussion on the ‘public access to Parliament documents’ Regulation. Technically, this Regulation is entitled ‘access to documents’, but it ended up with a different name in the vernacular. In May, after months of negotiations with the Council and Commission, we were able to bring the Regulation to a successful end. This was an important moment for me personally, because I have fought for more transparency in the European Union for years.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Resolution, each of the institutions, namely the Commission, the Council and Parliament, must ensure that the Regulation has been incorporated in the institutions’ own rules of procedure, work instructions and meeting procedures by 3 December. For our Parliament, this meant that we needed to check out our Rules of Procedure to establish whether more improvements were needed. We often feel that the Commission and the Council fail to come up to the mark in this area, but we have noted that there is room for improvement in one or two areas in our Rules of Procedures too. When I use the word ‘we’, I would like to make it clear that I also want to include my fellow rapporteur, Mr Cashman, with whom I have worked closely. The assessment was made in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but also in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. That is logical because both committees had worked together before. I thank Mr Cashman very much for the constructive manner in which we have always managed to enter into consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the proposed changes to our Rules of Procedure for which we are asking your backing? First of all, what matters is the right of all citizens in the European Union, in other words, including those of third countries, to access EP documents. That right may have been in place for European citizens, but this was not the case for citizens from third countries registered in the EU. On that score, therefore, we need to broaden the scope. Moreover, this corresponds to the ‘Freedom of Information Act’ of the United States. We are therefore not doing anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the definition of documents which are eligible for access must, according to the Regulation, be widened compared to the current Rules of Procedure. It should include all parliamentary documents, including the preparatory documents, such as working documents by rapporteurs or by parliamentary delegations. There is no need to include MEPs’ personal correspondence or the groups’ internal documents, because these are not official parliamentary documents. The European Court of Justice has made statements to this effect, which we should, and want to, observe, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The third requirement in the Regulation for which our Rules of Procedure do not provide, is the requirement to register all public documents and to include all documents by name and number in this registration. Furthermore, this registration must be available and accessible on the Internet. That will require the necessary efforts to be made and that is why the institutions have until June to achieve this. We must wish our team and the deputy Secretary-General all the best for this task, for it is quite a job to organise the whole system. We will have a look in June to see whether everything has turned out well.</p>
<p class="contents">A fourth requirement for which our present Parliament does not provide, is access to the Minutes of the Parliament’s Bureau. That cannot be such a big problem because these Minutes become public after a certain time anyway. The only difference is that our Rules of Procedure did not make it compulsory before, and now this obligation has to be stipulated in the Rules of Procedure. In fact, my advice would be to publish those Minutes even earlier than is now the case. After all, our entire Parliament knows what is being discussed the afternoon after the meeting anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we still maintain the system of closed meetings in our Parliament when delicate matters are discussed. Our proposal is to leave those meetings <span class="italic">in camera</span>, but to verify the Minutes against Articles 4 and 9 of the Regulation. Anything which does not fall within this must be made public via the Minutes. I hope that this could persuade the committees not to have the meetings declared closed unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point concerns the conciliation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the event of disputes. Parliament must be involved in the conciliation, and it appears to us to be the best solution if a Vice-President of the European Parliament were to be appointed especially for this purpose. We would also like to see this laid down in the Rules of Procedure so that it is clear who is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">This concludes the most important changes to our Rules of Procedure. At the final vote, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs backed these amendments by a large majority. There are not that many and I therefore believe that we can bring this to a good conclusion here as well. Four additional amendments have been tabled, including one by my group and three by the Greens. I do not have much of a problem with that of my group, but we should take another good look at those by the Greens, for it makes no sense to go beyond what is stipulated in the Regulation. As we should have dealt with this when we were discussing the Regulation, I am tempted to say no to these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, this Regulation and change to our Rules of Procedure are very important because they grant our citizens more access to internal documents of our Parliament and of the entire European Union, which improves transparency. Public confidence, which is very much needed, will also increase as a result. I welcome this and that is why I hope that we can approve these Rules of Procedure on Tuesday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have heartily enjoyed the way we have worked together on this and I am pleased to say that the work in her report represents our joint work. I also accept what she has said on the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I speak further, I should like the services to rule whether Amendment No 17 from the Green Group is admissible, because it seeks to rewrite the regulation. It calls on Parliament to adopt criteria for the definition of sensitive information and documents. Now the definition of sensitive documents is contained in the regulation, Article 9, reference to Article 4(1)(a).</p>
<p class="contents">I should again like to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen for her consistent approach to transparency and openness. It is absolutely right that we adopt changes to our Rules of Procedure so that we not only conform to the regulation on access to documents but can also begin to be held accountable by the citizens whom we purport to represent.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, now that Commissioner Barnier is here, it is important for me to refer to some of my concerns about the entry into force of this regulation on 3 December 2001. When the regulation enters into force, the citizen's right of access to institution documents will no longer be a discretionary concession but a fundamental right, rooted in Article 255. As no other legal basis on access to documents is provided in the Treaty, the regulation on Article 255 will be the framework for all other secondary legislation and for the internal rules of the institutions, which should be in conformity with it. The Commission, therefore, has the responsibility to present formal proposals to repeal or amend secondary legislation which is not coherent with the principles and limits defined in Article 18(3) of the regulation. This is extremely important if we are to bring this regulation into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, on the wider definition of institutions and the bodies and agencies, the Commission is mandated by Recital 8 and by the joint statement to review the rules of agencies and, where necessary to propose amendments as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of the Interinstitutional Committee – and all of these points are relevant if we are ourselves adopting changes to the Rules of Procedure – the Council presidency has said that it believes the Interinstitutional Committee should operate at secretary-general level. This differs from the opinion of President Prodi and of Parliament. Though I hesitate to say this, it is nonsense to suggest that secretaries-general should sit in this Interinstitutional Committee. The whole point of political presence is political accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Maij-Weggen has done an excellent job on this and now is the time for the Commission to ensure that the Treaty is respected and that the regulations flowing therefrom are brought before Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, we are debating Article 255 of the Treaty as reformulated in Amsterdam, and also an important article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Article 42.</p>
<p class="contents">After the agreement reached by the Council and Parliament, we need to incorporate the principles promoted by the aforementioned Articles of the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights respectively into the Rules of Procedure of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen most sincerely on her excellent work; her report, in addition to the amendments she tabled, was adopted in committee with 25 votes in favour to one against. I would also like to congratulate Mr Cashman. I think that a good relationship was maintained between all those involved, and I also believe that all of the proposals tabled by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have been taken into consideration by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, in the vote that is going to take place tomorrow we shall be transposing a political principle of fundamental importance and incorporating it into our Rules of Procedure. In doing so, we will be including a fundamental principle in the interests of the aforementioned transparency and openness into the set of rules that regulates our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my group is going to support an amendment it has itself tabled, not by pure chance, but because it is a good amendment. Furthermore, we will support Mrs Maij-Weggen’s proposals. I trust that the result of the vote will be sufficient, that is to say, more than 314 votes, for these proposals to be incorporated into the Rules of Procedure of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the European People’s Party, I would like to once again congratulate the two rapporteurs for the great work they have done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is to this banal sentence that we can reduce the foundation document of the European Transparency Initiative, called into being by a very wide range of parliamentarians and people in public life across Europe and only now beginning to become effective on the basis of Regulation 1049/2001 and the adjustments which we in this Parliament are now making to it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still different conceptions of what we want transparency to be like. I, myself, want the European transparency formula to be an American-Swedish hybrid, with unlimited access to almost everything, with not even a registry, and with a real possibility of watching over and permanently examining what we do in Parliament, and especially what is done in the Council, where the really important decisions are taken. This Parliament does not yet, unfortunately, have the majority required for this. It can be argued that the European public, in all its diversity, is far from ready. There is also room for the argument that, if an Italian or Austrian citizen writes to one of the EU institutions, and his letter is promptly recorded in a public registry, he would certainly not have reckoned with that and might react differently from a Swede, who would treat it as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we must, in any case, carry on along this road, especially now that events around the world make the definition of European values an issue. Transparency is definitely one of them. What we now have in front of us is a step in this direction. Mention has already been made of the deliberations in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I would like the Greens to come up with a substantially clearer explanation of Amendment No 15 than has been produced to date. I would personally have no problem whatever with the production of necessary documents in the context of budgetary control, or indeed with what is demanded at the end. But if it only scores an own goal, it would be better to leave it out.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cashman has already said all that needs to be said about Amendment No 17. Amendment No 14 meets with our group's undivided approval. It represents an improvement. Even the deletion of the restriction to ‘permanent’ committees in the first part of Amendment No 15 is only to be welcomed. We must all be aware that there can be no democracy without transparency. We still have plenty of work to do before that is achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to the extremely strong alliance for transparency which existed, and still exists, in Parliament and in which Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman have played a significant role, we finally succeeded in getting the Council and the Commission to endorse a proposal reflecting this House’s desire for as much transparency as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation we adopted is deficient and unclear in certain respects but constitutes a first and <span class="italic">very</span> important step forwards in the fight for greater transparency in the EU’s work on behalf of its citizens. We also decided to review the regulations by January 2004 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way as we did then, we must now take the lead in the work aimed at taking a further step forward. Transparency and public control are the bases for a democratic form of government and a prerequisite for people’s being able to follow, and participate in, public decision-making. The opportunity to access EU documents creates greater confidence and legitimacy, two things in short supply in the EU at the present time, unfortunately. When we adjust our regulations, let us not therefore make them too complicated. Let us interpret Article 255 as generously as possible and the concept of a ‘document’ as broadly as possible. There are exemptions in the legislation, in Article 4, but let us not leave the way open for new interpretations of secrecy or of classification of documents as top secret, and let us not construct unnecessary bureaucracies, either.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for people to be able to obtain documents to which they are entitled as soon as possible, as well as for documents to be available on the Internet. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party tabled amendments along these lines in the committee, but they were not adopted. I hope that they will nonetheless be adopted in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports this report because, for us, transparency and public control are efficient and democratic, not bureaucratic and unnecessary. Through progressive and extensive regulations in Parliament governing transparency, we can show that it is we who are there for the people, and not the other way around. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to echo what Mrs Malmström has just said about the urgency of transparency and openness, especially in Parliament and I would like to endorse Mr Cashman's remark that this must be taken as a political responsibility. We, as elected politicians, are responsible to our electorate for ensuring that all proceedings are as open as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, I should like briefly to mention the amendments in the name of our Group. I hope Mrs Maij-Weggen will accept the first one, extending the rules to cover all committees. I only have limited experience of being a vice-chairman of the recent Echelon committee, but I see no reason why special committees and committees of inquiry should not be bound. The further extension later in the amendment that broads out the range of documents from Members which count as parliamentary documents is helpful as well. I hope that will be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of political responsibility, it seems to us that for some questions the Conference of Presidents would be a better organ to decide matters than the Bureau, in the sense that in the Conference of Presidents people are representing their political party, whereas in the Bureau people are supposed to speak for the Parliament as a whole, rather than putting forward a political case.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third amendment suggests that we need a parliamentary definition of sensitive documents. Mr Cashman has challenged the validity of this. We think that within our rules, there is room for an expanded definition in relation to parliamentary documents. We will check that and withdraw the amendment if, on reflection, we think we have gone too far.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should like a split vote in relation to the adoption of security rules for the EP to leave out the words ‘on the basis of a proposal from the Bureau’ which would again push the responsibility back on to the Conference of Presidents. However we very much appreciate the spirit in which Mrs Maij-Weggen has put this forward and we are grateful for her willingness to look carefully at our amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliaments must be transparent. It is very sad that the more we open our glass-houses, the less people seem to look into them. The media need to help in this as well. If this Parliament is to be transparent it must be reported, as well as open. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is everything that is not included. The main problem is that the Commission and the Council do not supply Parliament with documents from the phase during which legislation is prepared, and that is, of course, the phase in which people have an interest in participating so as to influence the content of the legislation. Our rapporteurs and committee chairmen can often get hold of the relevant papers. Members of the executive can, more often than not, obtain what they need from their political friends in the Commission or the Council’s delegations, but such documents are not, and will not be, available to all MEPs or to the public. Nor does the report make any change to the disgraceful framework agreement which the majority of Parliament has entered into with the Commission and which divides MEPs into first and second class Members according to whether or not they have access to confidential information.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be relevant to distinguish between rapporteurs and ordinary MEPs, but the distinction is not made according to who has need of the confidential information. It is all right to impose tough sanctions on MEPs who breach confidentiality, but it is contrary to the principle of equality, and thus unlawful, to regard committee chairmen as especially eligible, while a rapporteur with the same need does not have access in the same way. Moreover, it is completely insane and contrary to every parliamentary tradition that Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control, the ombudsman and the EU’s own Court of Auditors are never in a position to check all the documents concerning the Commission’s discharge of its office. This, too, is something which Mrs Maij-Weggen’s otherwise quite excellent report does nothing about. Nor are those of us who are to approve the enlargement agreements able to obtain the screening reports, even if they do not, in fact, contain anything other than an analysis of the gap between existing EU legislation and the candidate countries’ arrangements for transposing the EU regulations into their own legislation. This situation will scarcely be changed when the regulation regarding public access to documents comes into force. We are still in the dark ages when it comes to transparency, but even a small step in the right direction must be endorsed, so it will be the green button I press tomorrow in order to encourage Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen to continue working for greater openness in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you for your commitment and congratulations on the success you have achieved in making us more open. I certainly do not see myself as groping in the dark, as Mr Bonde put it, but I do think we are on the road towards the light.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow's resolution will also be our invitation to the citizens of the European Union to put our openness to good use, to look in on us, to, if you want to put it that way, take a look at the cards we hold, even to see behind the scenes. Openness makes little sense, of course, if nobody is interested in the work we do. We do not wish to complain about the lack of interest on the part of our citizens and voters, but we would like to seriously urge them to avail themselves of this new openness on the part of the European Parliament, as today's technology makes things conceivable which a few years ago would not have been possible. With the click of a mouse, they can see the original texts we discuss in this House. Even if press reports on Europe are sometimes incomplete, the interested citizen can nonetheless look straight in on us with the help of the Internet. That is an opportunity, and because of it we strongly support this report.</p>

They already deserve our congratulations on their work on the original legislation, Council and Parliament Regulation 1049/2001, where their work was crucial in securing that positive result. Now they are coming back to translate that into our Rules of Procedure to ensure that our work is transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is arguable that the European Union is in some ways already more transparent than some of our Member States. It certainly does not reach the highest standards set by some of our Member States, but we are moving in the right direction, although of course it is still not perfect. However we will review it in a few years in the light of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the package of amendments to our Rules of Procedure tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I can say on behalf of my group that we will support the thrust of what the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall listen to the arguments that are being put forward in this debate and then review our position again, but our group is leaning towards accepting Amendment No 14 from the PPE-DE Group, the first half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts/ALE Group, and possibly Amendment No 16 from the Verts/ALE Group. We are opposed to the second half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts/ALE Group, which is entirely unworkable and would raise a number of practical problems if it were adopted. As Mr Cashman explained, we question whether Amendment No 17 from the Verts/ALE Group it is admissible, and I welcome the fact that Mr MacCormick was doubtful about that. I gather it may well be withdrawn and I would welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the position of our group, subject to the arguments we are listening to now. However, whatever happens to those particular amendments, I am quite confident that there will be a successful outcome in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite clear that Parliament must get its own house in order after the agreements we have had vis-à-vis the Commission. Access is important but too much lip service is paid to access. I thought that at the beginning Mr Corbett was being rather congratulatory. I agree with him that we are moving in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to bring to Parliament's attention the specific problem that the Committee on Petitions is still experiencing with access to documentation. I know the problem here is largely the Commission, but it impacts on Parliament. A number of European citizens have petitioned this Parliament about problems with Lloyds of London. A very detailed questionnaire was sent to the British Government. Only Members of the Petitions Committee have been allowed to see that questionnaire; no other Members of Parliament. Even Members of the Petitions Committee, behind closed doors, are not allowed to have any legal advisers, or political advisers, and are not allowed to take copies.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody in Parliament has been allowed to see the reply from the British Government. Mr Bolkestein said that he cannot reveal this information because it could be subject to legal action by the Commission against the British Government. The British Government reply was that they would not let us see it because they regard it as an informal communication at the request of the Petitions Committee by the Commission. Twenty-one detailed questions to the British Government and the British Government says that it is an informal communication!</p>
<p class="contents">We want some clarity here, so that we know precisely what we do and do not have access to. At present, Members, committees and Parliament itself cannot do their jobs properly because of excessive secrecy. I would certainly urge that a representative – the chairman of the Petitions Committee – should be on the Interinstitutional Committee so that citizens know that the Members of this Parliament who look after their interests ensure that this secrecy does not go any deeper than it does at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is also an important time for you, because Parliament’s adoption of the report by Mrs Maij-Weggen means that as of 3 December, you will be able to apply the regulation on public access to documents. The Commission believes that this regulation represents a very significant step forwards in achieving greater transparency and accountability on the part of the institutions towards Europe’s citizens. The efforts made by Parliament to ensure that the regulation was adopted within the time limits imposed by the Treaty, a point that I also highlighted during a previous speech, clearly indicates the importance that your institution also attaches to transparency in general, and to the public’s right of access to documents, in particular. You will, therefore, allow me to acknowledge and draw attention to the effort made, and to express my gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Watson, but also to you, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and to Mr Cashman, who has done a great deal of work with you, Mrs Maij-Weggen, on these issues. I would also like to tell you that the Commission is finalising a draft decision on the implementation of the regulation of 30 May. This decision will be adopted during November by the Commission, which will annex it to its own internal Rules of Procedure. The Commission will also be in a position, therefore, to implement this regulation within the required time limits, and this will guarantee that the public can fully exercise its right to access these documents.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, it is natural for the Commission to pay particular attention to the approach that the European Parliament used to amend its Rules of Procedure. This approach will be a very useful source of inspiration for the Commission’s own internal rules, as I think it is important that the institutions follow a similar approach in applying these important rules. The way they are applied must, of course, respect the spirit of the Rules of Procedure. This is the main thrust of the message that the Commission wishes to give to you today, whilst we, of course, fully respect your autonomy in how you choose to amend your own rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to make a very brief comment about a point that Mrs Maij-Weggen raised in her report, which concerns the framework agreement between our two institutions, and reiterated the different nature of the two acts – firstly, the regulation of 30 May 2001 and secondly, the framework agreement that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, we believe that there is no obvious incompatibility between these two documents, since Annex III of the framework agreement regulates the forwarding of confidential documents to Parliament which cannot, in any case, be forwarded to the public, due to the exceptions laid down by the regulation of 30 May. What happens in practice should naturally reflect this legal interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, however, like to confirm the Commission’s very clear intention to faithfully apply all the provisions contained in this framework agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
