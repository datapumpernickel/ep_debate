<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cashman (PSE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – In November last year, I presented my report on public access to the EU institutions' documents, a subject which, as I said then, I consider crucial to the lives of the people we represent and to the future of the Union. I am happy to say that I stand before you today to ask Parliament to endorse a compromise text, as this House requested of me in November 2000. I, Hanja Maij-Weggen, my ex-co-rapporteur, and all the draftsmen of opinions and some shadows for the other Committees embarked on a series of meetings with the Council and the Commission, latterly called trialogues, in order to reach this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">All the various versions of the compromise text during the trialogue processes were discussed in public meetings. Indeed, the trialogue process, it can be argued, has been more transparent than a conciliation process, in which only final texts of negotiations are published. The negotiations were not always easy and, contrary to what some believe, the distance between our institutions in January was great, but we fought hard to maintain what we considered to be essential elements to ensure the rights of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the text does not go as far as we would have liked. I am the first to admit that, but it was a priority for me and my co-rapporteur Hanja Maij-Weggen to complete the dossier in line with the Treaty deadline, so that the institutions could not be accused of failing to deliver for the citizen under Article 232 of the Treaty. The standpoints of the three institutions were difficult to reconcile in such a short space of time and even the Council, under the wonderful Swedish Presidency, found it difficult to achieve a political consensus, or at least a qualified majority, within itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we have a text which improves on and consolidates the status quo and delivers to the citizen, within the time frame set in the Amsterdam Treaty, a comprehensive and practical framework for access to the institutions' documents. It is by no means a step backwards. We have established a self-evolving text which, I am sure, will be improved upon in the course of time. The compromise text revolutionises the rights and procedures for access to documents of the institutions and sets in motion the enshrining of freedom of information in the EU and in Member States' national legislation. It is the first common framework for the three institutions which recognises the citizen's rights so that the citizen no longer relies on the goodwill of each Institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to documents regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable, stimulates greater efficiency and enhances democracy. The text would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of the Swedish Presidency. I would like to take this opportunity to also pay tribute to the remarkable work on this dossier that they have contributed and to that of my co-rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and Graham Watson, Chair of the LIBE Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there are some cases when documents from the institutions should not be released into the public domain. Indeed, it is part of our responsibility as deputies of this Parliament to protect the security of our citizens and the institutions. MEPs have a responsibility to ensure the vital interests of the Union are protected by improving its internal security, whilst at the same time balancing the citizens' rights of access. This new regime means that every document is considered on a case-by-case basis without blanket exceptions and documents concerning security and defence are by no means excluded from the Regulation. Under this compromise text, the Council is obliged to repeal or amend the Solana Decision of August 2000 so that it conforms to the principles of this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is assumption in favour of access to the public for all documents in all areas of the Union's activities and access will only be denied to those in areas which directly relate to a listed exception. It has to be shown that such an exception is necessary and the disclosure would cause harm. The exceptions are therefore discretionary, not mandatory. If access is refused to the citizen, the citizen must be given the reason for refusal and there is recourse to the Ombudsman and the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Virtually all documents will be placed on a public register. Documents from third parties will be accessible for the first time and agencies or bodies created by the institutions will also apply the Regulation. If a document is excepted, or parts of the document are excepted, those parts of the document which are not excepted will be made public, and the exceptions will only apply for a limited maximum of thirty years, except in some cases. Finally, each Institution will produce an annual report outlining where the Institution refused access and the number of sensitive documents not recorded in the register, thus ensuring a continuing review by the European Parliament, and the Commission will also report by January 2004 on the implementation of the principles in the Regulation, thereby offering another opportunity to refine and develop access. Finally, this is not the end of the beginning. This is one small step on the road to access to documents and ensuring that the European Project is accountable to its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maij-Weggen (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mrs Lejon, Commissioner, today is a joyful day for the citizens of the European Union. After years of sabotage and delay, there is now a Regulation before us which addresses public access to the EU institutions. This European Parliament has pressed for this to happen for years. Since 1979, I have been one of the MEPs who repeatedly put the need for public access on the agenda, even when I was allowed to sit on the European Council of Ministers. Indeed, public access is directly linked to the democratic content of an institution and guards a government body from underhand politics, nepotism and financial irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">When this proposal was submitted by the European Commission last year, it left a great deal to be desired. The French Council proposal, which appeared subsequently, was not acceptable either. In November, our Parliament tabled its proposal with a huge majority. Since then, intense negotiations have taken place among the three institutions. In this respect, Parliament was a great support for the Swedish Presidency. This coalition, which has, step-by-step, brought the Council and Commission closer to Parliament’s position, has proved to be very fruitful.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome was a considerably improved text in which Parliament’s key points were adopted. I would like to quote seven as these proved crucial to our positive stance vis-à-vis this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Article 4, the most important article, which articulates the limitations of public access, has been cut down to size and the limitations are tied down to conditions. A reason for secrecy should be given at all times, and there is an opportunity to appeal to the Ombudsman or the European court. In the case of huge public interest, documents are to be disclosed nevertheless. That was a key element for our Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the term “document” should be taken in a broad sense. Electronic mail also falls under this heading.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a register will be introduced after all, in which all documents need to be included with attendant details and which must be published on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Union’s agencies, such as the European Environment Bureau, the European Trade Mark Office and Europol, will fall within the remit of the Regulation. This will happen in the near future thanks to a new act which has now been promised.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, national legislation which goes beyond this Regulation – and this is a sensitive area for the country that I come from – should not be hindered by this Regulation. This is clearly stipulated in recital 16. I should like to see it explained accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, the rules which Mr Solana imposed last year in August without any consultation now fall under this Regulation and will also be verified against the same. The Netherlands has already noted that the appeal at the Court of Justice can then be withdrawn, and I believe that the European Parliament could follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, an annual report will be drafted, and the Commission will need to compile an evaluation report with proposals for improvement before 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this Regulation now perfect? No, quite a few areas could be honed down further, such as the handling of documents of third parties, and the registration of secret documents, as well as a number of other issues. However, in our opinion, it is better to grant approval now and to tighten the rules in two years’ time, should this prove useful and necessary. If we were to overhaul the Regulation now, we would end up in a long-term codecision procedure. Moreover, we are familiar with this procedure: the Council could put us out of action if the European Commission were not to lend us their support. I am not expecting the Commission to do this, but you never know.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains for me now is to express my thanks to my fellow MEPs who have helped us over the course of last year to achieve this result. I should first like to thank Mr Cashman. He has done a sterling job, but that is also true of Mr Watson, Mrs Hautala, Mrs Cederschiöld and of the other draftsmen of opinions. I would also like to thank Mrs Dean who, as Parliament official, has carried out much of the work on our behalf. I should also like to thank the Swedish Presidency, of course. I am convinced that, without the cooperation with the Swedish Presidency, we would not have achieved the result that is now before us, one that can withstand any criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should be acutely aware of what is at issue: democracy, transparency and the rights of the citizens. That is the most important aspect, that is what this is all about, and this Regulation constitutes a step forward in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, the only true point of comparison is this: will we be improving the situation as it is now by means of these new rules?</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to take into account the fact that the Ombudsman and the Court of Justice have, over the years, been improving the rules in force on public access to documents and making them much more specific. For this thanks go to all those active NGOs and individuals that have refused to believe that the institutions can deny them access to certain documents, and that have sought to appeal against such negative decisions. When to this we add the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam guarantees the right – in its broadest possible sense – to have access to documents of the Union institutions, we could say that the existing basic framework is quite demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the matter in hand, it is my opinion that the acceptance of this compromise raises certain questions. The European Parliament should have insisted on using its powers to repair the defects of this compromise. I will most probably be accused of being a fanatical transparency activist, but I refuse to accept this and I refute the charge. I simply want to describe to you now how I think Parliament should have bided its time and continued the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is worth mentioning that these talks during the Swedish Presidency have been going on <span class="italic">in camera</span>.<span class="italic"> </span>The European Parliament should really be very careful about when it becomes involved in an accelerated codecision procedure such as this, as it tends to forsake the issue of transparency to a considerable degree. Parliament has often been able to bring pressure on the Council of Ministers to make improvements to their proposals in accordance with its own objectives through various stages of the codecision procedure. With regard to restrictions on time, it is a fact that the institutions – including Parliament – wasted quite a lot of time, which could have been successfully spent in the successive stages of the codecision procedure, where Parliament often makes considerable gains towards the end.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I have found that the Swedish Presidency has perhaps created a sort of Stockholm syndrome, and that Parliament’s negotiators maybe took the claim that only Sweden could bring this matter to a creditable conclusion too literally. I myself have no reason to doubt that Belgium, for example, would rate as well as anyone else in the transparency stakes, and that it is learning all the time to respect the issue more and more. I therefore believe we would easily have been able to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to illustrate certain problems with this Regulation by showing you a small object. This is a Russian wooden doll. This one possibly has a rather ugly face: perhaps it should have a more beautiful one as we are talking about transparency. Let us imagine that this doll is the Regulation on transparency in question. When we open up the doll we find new dolls inside. This is just how these rules work. Inside the regulation on transparency there is also a sort of shadow regulation that the Council has managed to smuggle in, saying that there is a whole pile of documents labelled as ‘sensitive’, which are covered by quite separate rules from those we have written into the paragraphs of the Article relating to transparency. When it is being said here that this Regulation on transparency repeals the so-called Solana Decision I can state that this is not the case at all, but in fact there are more new rules to be found in it, helping to ensure that the Solana Decision is incorporated in this Regulation in a new form. And, at the end, who do we find but Mr Solana himself! This is thus a question of these sensitive documents making it possible for the Council of Ministers in particular to conceal a large number of documents. I think it a pity that the European Parliament did not challenge the Council of Ministers a little more forcefully on this issue. For that we would have required rather more time, rather more transparency and some measure of public debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament’s part-session for today and tomorrow is an important event for the institutions and Member States of the European Union. Above all, however, the meeting is an important event for the citizens of Europe. At this meeting, Parliament will have the opportunity to take a decisive step in the work on bringing the European Union closer to its citizens. For the first time in what will soon be the EU’s fifty-year history, the adoption of Treaty-based rules on public access to Parliament’s, the Council’s and the Commission’s documents is within the bounds of possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the European Parliament for its energetic and persistent work on establishing new and better rules on transparency. In the process, I have had the great satisfaction of meeting a number of you personally, and I know what major contributions many of you have made on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Far too many citizens in today’s EU find the administration of the EU’s institutions dusty, old-fashioned and unduly bureaucratic. To overcome this, we need a modern, effective and efficient EU in which people’s participation and access to documents is the obvious basis for all the work done.</p>
<p class="contents">There are different ways of improving transparency in the EU’s institutions, but far and away the best and most effective way is to have generous rules concerning access to documents, combined with open registers. Such rules increase public confidence in the institutions and make it possible for people to participate in the decision-making process. The air is cleared when everyone knows that all the documentation concerning the decision-making process can be inspected and, as a rule, is also accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament emphasised the importance of greater transparency in the EU’s institutions early on. Parliament’s resolution from January 1999 described its significance by saying that the trend towards greater transparency and public scrutiny of documents is of fundamental importance if the EU is to be successful in the future, because it helps clarify the EU’s political choices, promotes a more extensive and better balanced input into the political process, reduces the level of corruption and abuse of power and generally promotes a greater acceptance of EU decisions among the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my conviction that the European Parliament’s resolution set a standard for the implementation work which has now been completed and which the Commission in particular was forced to take into account when it devised its proposal for a Regulation. For example, Parliament’s statement made it impossible in practice to exempt documents received by the institutions from the requirement that they be publicly accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking here today as a representative of the Council, but I am also a cabinet minister in the Swedish Government. When the treaty concerning Sweden’s, and a number of other countries’, membership of the EU was signed in Corfu in June 1994, the European Council stated that the new Member States were at the forefront of open government and public access to documents and it welcomed the further stimulus that the new Member States could provide on these issues. Sweden has tried to fulfil these hopes, partly by taking the initiative, during the previous intergovernmental conference, to incorporate fundamental rules concerning transparency and public control of documents into the EU Treaties. As the country holding the Presidency during the first six months of this year, we believe that we have an obligation to do everything in our power to head up the work on implementing those rules which were in fact incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam established people’s right to study the European Parliament’s, the Council’s and the Commission’s documents. It means that people are entitled under the Treaty to be given access to these documents. The new rules now to be discussed by Parliament will be much more stable and have much more of an effect than the current rules, which the institutions can change or even repeal unilaterally whenever they wish.</p>
<p class="contents">The work over the last few months has been very intensive. All the parties involved have invested an enormous amount of time and resources in establishing sound rules on transparency. Parliament’s representatives, in particular, have campaigned vigorously and persistently for such rules. I particularly wish to thank the committee chairman, Mr Watson, the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen, and Commissioner Barnier.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of reasons why both Parliament and the Swedish Presidency have put such intensive effort into pressing on with the negotiations. First and foremost, there was a political commitment to have the new rules on transparency ready by May of this year. We consequently have an obligation to do everything that can be done to fulfil these expectations. Ultimately, it is the EU’s credibility that is at stake. The Council and Parliament must show people that efforts really are being made to establish sound rules within the period promised.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, new and better provisions are <span class="italic">needed</span>. As standards, the rules with which people have had to be content until now are of low status because they are founded upon the institutions’ internal rules of procedure and have major gaps in them. For example, the rules do not include documents submitted to the institutions. Nor is there any right to obtain parts of documents. Of the institutions, it is as yet only the Council that has set up a public register, and the current rules mean that obtaining documents is time-consuming. Another example of gaps in the current rules is the fact that the list of reasons for secrecy is not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal on which Parliament is to adopt a position is a clear improvement upon the current legal position. It is a proposal of its time. In many cases, documents will be accessible directly via the Internet. The European Parliament has been demanding this for a long time, and this demand is now met in the new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also be possible, just as before, for documents to be handed over upon written request. The time which the institutions now have in which to respond to a request has been cut back. Access must be provided as soon as possible, and no later than within 15 working days. The institutions are obliged to give citizens all the help they need in order to acquaint themselves with documents.</p>
<p class="contents">In those cases in which international law may allow still greater public access to documents in certain areas, for example the right to environmental information under the Århus Convention, the proposed new rules will not prevent this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another improvement is that the new rules apply to <span class="italic">all</span> the institutions’ documents. No exception is made for certain categories of document, for example documents relating to defence or security issues. This improvement is also a result of the European Parliament’s initiative. Naturally, the new rules on this point are designed in such a way as to guarantee secrecy in those cases in which this is justified for defence or security reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise text on which Parliament has now to adopt a position therefore constitutes progress towards a citizens’ Europe and progress for democracy. The new rules will markedly improve citizens’ access to EU documents. I am convinced that, in the long term, the new rules will also mean significantly positive changes to the institutions’ administrative culture and to officials’ relationship with the general public. Through the new rules, the European Union will gain increased public confidence and acquire increased democratic legitimacy. Access to the institutions’ documents is the lever that is required if these objectives are to be attained.</p>
<p class="contents">As the country holding the Presidency, our task has not been to import either Swedish or other Member States’ national rules on the public accessibility of documents into the institutions. Rather, our task has been to combine the best in the various Member States’ administrative cultures and historical experience, taking account of the institutions’ own experiences and need for special adjustments. This is a task in which, in the Council and together with the Commission and representatives of Parliament, we have succeeded, and it is now up to Parliament finally to adopt a position on a text which is the result of 15 months’ hard, intensive and ultimately fruitful negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">However good the new rules may be, they must be adapted little by little to new requirements. It is therefore excellent that, in the course of the negotiations, the European Parliament should have taken the initiative to include a provision whereby the new rules are to be monitored and evaluated. According to the proposal, the Commission must by 31 January 2004 at the latest – in good time for the next parliamentary election – present a comprehensive report on how the rules on transparency have operated in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who has followed the dramatic negotiations of the last few weeks knows that the proposal for a Regulation, which has come about through the way in which all the institutions concerned have accepted responsibility, is balanced on a knife-edge. I am convinced that this part-session has the potential to go down in history as the meeting at which Parliament took advantage of a unique opportunity to bring the European Union closer to its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an historic decision because it is not now the Member States at an Intergovernmental Conference but the institutions themselves which are taking responsibility for the future of the European Union. The very fact that the institutions managed to agree about an issue on which it was uniquely difficult to negotiate but which was crucial to public confidence in the EU – and to have done so within the period promised in the Treaty of Amsterdam – provides hope for the future, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the European Parliament to decide. I am convinced that future generations of Europeans will remember what happened on 2 and 3 May 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of clear rules for public access to documents is absolutely essential, both in terms of the proper functioning of the Community institutions and also, as has just been mentioned, in order to reinforce the institutions’ democratic legitimacy in the eyes of the European Union’s citizens. The Commission therefore believes that the draft regulation before us today is of particular importance and significance.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lejon, I would like to say how pleased I am to see that following many months of intensive work, the representatives of the three institutions have managed to draw up a text, which I believe is both clear and balanced, and which been approved by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of this Parliament, the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Member States and the Commission itself. It is now the task of Parliament to deliver a completely independent opinion on the outcome of this work.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, Mr President, I would like to express my most sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and the co-rapporteurs, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mrs Hautala, Mr Watson, the Chairman and the members of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms, for the work they have carried out over 15 or 16 months and for the receptive and tenacious attitude that they have shown.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to praise the efforts of the Swedish Presidency, and you yourself, Mrs Lejon and your whole team, which has tried successfully to reconcile differing points of view, which, as we know only too well, is not always an easy task, and for having made the draft regulation compatible with the various administrative procedures in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteurs stressed earlier, the draft regulation represents a major step forward compared to current practices and, as a result, it brings the Community system a step closer to the system used by the Member States that are the most advanced in the field of transparency. Naturally, ladies and gentlemen, the text is probably far from perfect. It is very likely that not everybody will be pleased with every aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard Mrs Hautala use a symbolic expression earlier, involving Russian dolls. Mrs Hautala, I do not think that you will find Mr Solana if you open all the boxes. In my view, Mr Solana’s standing and personality are of a much higher level and far more important than your description of them earlier. It is true, however, that once you have started to open the boxes or the Russian dolls, and you notice that there is something inside, it will then be difficult to stop yourself. To this extent, the picture that you painted is probably fair and symbolic, on this point in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission believes that this text does indeed strike a fair balance between the specific characteristics of each institution and the practices within the Member States. In this respect, it does, in all sincerity, represent the best possible compromise. The Commission, therefore, officially accepts all the amendments tabled today by the rapporteurs and which were approved on 25 April 2001 by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms, chaired by Mr Watson. I hope that the European Parliament will also support the opinions and recommendations made by your rapporteurs, so that we can adopt this regulation and effectively implement it as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the documents created and held by each institution, as well as the volume of the documents processed, does indeed reflect their specific characteristics and their roles, which are both different and complementary. Out of the three institutions, the Commission is by far the one which handles the largest amount of documents. The nature of these documents varies greatly, due to its variety of tasks, ranging from initiating legislation to acting as Guardian of the Treaties and guarantor of Community law and to ensuring respect for Community law. The Commission is, therefore, perfectly aware of the fact that the main responsibility for implementing the regulation on public access to documents will fall on its shoulders.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because of this two-fold objective, which is, on the one hand, to ensure the public has the widest access to documents and, on the other hand, to ensure the respect of Community law, that the Commission has carefully considered which system to use with regard to the sensitive issue of infringement proceedings. The Commission wishes to state here in Parliament, and will also state to the Council, that, in a spirit of compromise and as proposed by the rapporteurs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen in particular, the Commission can accept that infringement proceedings are not included in the derogations specified in the regulation, since it believes that this approach would not have an adverse effect on the fulfilment of its responsibilities in ensuring respect for Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in implementing this regulation, we are doing the institutions and citizens of the European Union a good turn. I would like to assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the importance of this text and is committed to implementing it diligently and efficiently, not only because this is our duty, but because I am deeply convinced – and it is in this spirit that I myself worked alongside you and the Council Presidency from the moment Mr Prodi entrusted me with this task – that this text will considerably enhance the democratic legitimacy of the EU institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal was prepared jointly by Parliament, the Council and the Commission within the framework of what has been termed tripartite collaboration. This new Regulation is a step towards a more open and more democratic EU in as much as the work of the bureaucrats is to be subject to public scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">The point of departure must be that all documents are to be accessible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, there are exceptions to this main rule, just as there are from the Swedish principle of public access to official records, but the number of exceptions has been significantly reduced in comparison with the original proposal and is now limited to what is absolutely necessary to protect mainly military and security interests, commercial secrets and information about the private lives of individuals. Every document must be examined on its own merits, and a new examination must take place in response to each new enquiry from the public.</p>
<p class="contents">A document may only be withheld if making it available would harm some aspect of the public interest. In previous proposals, it was enough that releasing a document <span class="italic">might</span> harm the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">To make things easier for the general public, there must be a register listing all documents, and both the register and the documents must, as far as possible, be available on the Internet. These are some aspects of the progress that has been achieved in the course of the tough negotiations of recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still critics of the compromise. They should consider that most EU countries do not have anything approaching the Swedish principle of public access to official records and that a number of these countries think that the issue is incomprehensible and its significance overrated. To vote against the proposal because 100 per cent of what was desired has not been achieved would be frivolous. Is it sensible to go hungry just because a three-course meal has not been offered?</p>
<p class="contents">The demand for the proposal to be overhauled before the European elections in 2004 is a prerequisite for public support. This will facilitate a subsequent improvement of the text in the event of political opposition, so that the electorate can influence the issue, partly by the way in which they vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The result that has been achieved has been presented as a victory for the Swedish Presidency and, because transparency has been a key issue for the Swedish Government, it would have been a clear failure on the Government’s part if it had had to hand it as a gift to the forthcoming Presidency. I should nonetheless like to add something to that picture – not take the victory away from the Swedish Presidency, but nonetheless supplement the picture. The Prime Minister, Mr Persson is known for being a proponent of the intergovernmental model, on the basis of which citizens exercise little control. A theoretical, but relevant, issue in connection with the debate on transparency is that of how the result would have looked on the basis of Mr Persson’s intergovernmental model. How much control would the public have exercised then? The Commission’s and the Council’s original proposal was completely unacceptable from the perspectives both of transparency and citizenship. The answer has been given: Parliament is the institution which has stood up for transparency and which it has been possible to use as a lever during the negotiations in the Council. Without Parliament’s hard fight for more transparency, and without the codecision procedure, no such commendable result would have been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by extending heartfelt gratitude to Mr Cashman, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Watson, Mrs Hautala and Mrs Malmström, as well as to Commissioner Barnier, who has made a major contribution in the Commission, and, finally, to the committee secretariat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, as shadow rapporteur, I should, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, first of all like to thank the rapporteurs for the high level of commitment they have shown in their bid to reach a compromise with the Council and Commission on the Regulation, which is informally referred to in the Netherlands as the “Euro-WOB”. Given the huge resistance on the part of a number of Member States, it was clear from the outset that the negotiations would be tough. Needless to say, I, like many MEPs, including Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen, would have liked to see more disclosure on a number of scores in the proposal, but to many Member States, that appeared to be a bridge too far.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise receives our unqualified support, as it represents in our eyes the result which is most viable. The agreement is a considerable improvement on the Commission proposal and on the existing regulations. For example, I was unable to consent to the far too extensive and exhaustive list of often vague reasons on the basis of which access to documents could be denied. But under heavy political pressure from both Parliament and a number of Member States, this list has been cut down considerably, with a ceiling put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very satisfying to see that Mr Solana’s rules of last summer, by means of which entire categories of documents were excluded from public access by definition, are being rescinded by the new disclosure regime.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also have been unacceptable to me if the European disclosure regime were to prejudice existing national legislation. Fortunately, that is not the case. Another bonus is that documents drafted in the preliminary phase of legislation and policy are now expressly made public.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I regret that as a result of the heavy resistance of a number of Member States, among others, certain points were not included in the compromise. For example, I would have preferred it if confidential documents originating from third parties, such as NATO, or a Member State, were to fall entirely within the scope of the European disclosure regime. Instead, permission from the third party involved is now required for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in my view, all documents should have been included in the public register, where now an exception is made for confidential documents. The European Parliament will need to closely monitor how the institutions involved will give substance to public access in their day-to-day practice. This is why I greatly value the annual report on the implementation of the disclosure regime. If in the evaluation in January 2004, it appears that the Regulation does not guarantee sufficient disclosure and that the percentage of sensitive documents is too high, then it is up to Parliament to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say to those MEPs who wish to vote against the compromise that they cannot adopt a clean-hands policy in that way. The implications of rejecting the current compromise would be that the European citizens would remain deprived of a clear, European disclosure regime for the time being. The Swedish Presidency, in tandem with a number of Member States as well as Parliament, has bent over backwards to reach a compromise before 1 May. It very much remains to be seen whether the next presidencies will deal with this issue with just as much drive, and there is also the risk that further negotiations will not have a beneficial, but rather a detrimental, effect on the Regulation. That is why this is the right time for me to adopt this compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we compare the present situation with that of a year ago, we are definitely making progress. Last year, the European Commission had tabled a weak proposal, taking existing practice as a point of departure. That was not acceptable to us. Last summer, we also witnessed Mr Solana’s coup d’état, who, in one fell swoop, declared all documents under his remit to be secret. It is certainly thanks to Parliament’s persistent pressurising that there is now a better proposal before us, and I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs warmly on this. I am all the more pleased, because the liberal group has been closely involved in the negotiation process: firstly by tabling a number of amendments, also in the later stages, in order to keep the pressure on; secondly by supplying no less than three draftsmen of opinions and thirdly, as already mentioned, by the commitment of the liberal Committee Chairman, Mr Watson, in the final and deciding stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we will be voting for the Regulation, but I will not make a song and dance about it. It is a fact that the compromise proposal still contains weak areas, such as the grounds for exception, the documents of third parties in Article 4, the secret documents of Article 9, and I could mention a few more, but the improvements definitely outweigh the weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal’s mainstay is disclosure, barring exceptions, and that is a huge step forward for the Brussels bureaucracy. In addition, we can identify a number of liberal touches in the compromise: the agencies in recital 8, the exceptions which do not apply in the event of a predominantly public interest in Article 4, the register of Article 9 and the annual report of each institution, listing refusals in Article 17.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I am keeping it low-key. This is not a story with a happy ending, but we accept the compromise because the best is the enemy of the good. Whoever now votes against, now that a compromise has been reached with the Swedish Presidency, will be wasting an opportunity, for as Mr Van den Berg stated a moment ago, other presidencies will not be prepared to go that far.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, tomorrow’s vote is not the end of the story, it is only the beginning. The European Commission’s evaluation in January 2004 will certainly need to lead to adjustments.

<p class="contents">My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, accepts that there are exceptions to disclosure. For example, a European defence policy could yield certain operational information which does not belong on the streets. But all documents must be recorded in the register, and it must be possible to test exceptions against strict criteria, in the last instance by the Court of Justice. That may be the procedure for normal documents, but unfortunately, special treatment has been agreed upon for potentially too large a group of special, sensitive documents, and I hear very little about this. The documents which are rubberstamped as “sensitive” are identified by a select group of officials within the institutions themselves. It is not necessary to include sensitive documents in the register, and the Court of Justice cannot verify whether this decision is justified. Should a clever citizen find out that the document exists after all, the same officials will decide on the application. And to cap it all, with regard to documents which do contribute to the decision-making process of European policy but which originate from outside, the author has a veto regarding both the inclusion in the register and the disclosure of the document. The Court too has to accept this veto.</p>
<p class="contents">Sensitive documents constitute a black hole in this agreement on disclosure of information, and the right to information simply becomes an act of goodwill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If any way of characterising this result is to be found, then this is probably the most honest.</p>
<p class="contents">The process concerning transparency and public access to documents has, of course, been conducted for a long time behind hermetically sealed doors. This is in itself a major problem because, in tackling such an essential area as public access to, and scrutiny of, documents – which is fundamental to our having democratically active citizens able to influence the decision-making process – it is crucial to involve people, partly in the debate as to how the rules are to be designed, and perhaps, in addition, to go so far as to listen to some of people’s objections.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have a result which, in some respects, can be lived with, which in other respects is good but which, on a number of points, is unfortunately a retrograde step in relation to the current situation which is, of course, the result partly of a number of rules, partly of the practice of the courts and partly of intervention by the ombudsman. One of the areas in which, in my view, there is a major problem is that of internal documents which are not clearly defined in this proposal and which can be kept secret if it is thought that publication will have a decisive influence on the decision-making process. All right, but is that not precisely what transparency is all about – enabling people to have a decisive influence on the decision-making process? I think it is a problem that Member States can demand that documents be classified and, in addition, decline to register them at all, without there being clear rules as to when and why the Solana documents, as they are called, are not generally exempt, but that the rules governing what may be exempt are so loose as to be largely meaningless. There is, of course, no doubt about the fact that these rules will be of decisive importance to the rules in all member States, but large parts of the rapporteurs’ presentation have been vague and it has been very difficult to get clear information about the whys and wherefores. I doubt if there is a single document that cannot be accessed under the current rules but which it will be possible to access under the rules now being discussed. I doubt if it will be possible to extract so much as one more document from the EU system than it is possible to extract today.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the European Parliament has played a difficult role in this, and I think it is also transparently obvious that the European Parliament’s own interests have, from time to time, unfortunately overshadowed the public’s interests. By far the best thing about this proposal is that we nonetheless have a chance to look at the rules again in 2004, and I think we have some detailed and substantial work to do before then. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Control, public scrutiny and democracy are different sides of the same issue and, against that background, I essentially agree with the criticism forwarded to all my fellow MEPs from five distinctive organisations. The conclusion is that this proposal is really worse than nothing. Many aspects of the rules concerning sensitive documents are absurd, and administering these exceptions is a bit like selling elastic by the metre, as a Danish humorist once put it. It in any case requires a firm character and a significantly more democratic turn of mind and basic attitude than that which the Commission and the other institutions of the EU are used to exhibiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 5 undoubtedly involves a deterioration in the current rules governing public access to, and scrutiny of, public documents as practised, for example, in the Scandinavian countries. Moreover, there is another thing which really surprises me, in addition to my fellow MEPs failure to understand the reality of the situation and to the praise forthcoming from the large political groups. It is a source of surprise that not one person has raised the question of whether what has taken place is in accordance with the Treaty. These negotiations have taken place in the strictest confidence, with all the small groups excluded. The negotiations have been conducted by my fellow MEPs, Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen, and by the brilliant chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Watson, from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. The major groups have gone through this process without the rest of us being involved at all in these negotiations. All we can do is vote for or against. This, I would point out, contravenes the basic rules of the Treaty which presuppose that there are three independent institutions which play their part. There are also rules relating to the conciliation procedure and so on, which ensure that the small groups are heard. What we are concerned with here, moreover, is a matter concerning public access to documents. It is quite simply a farce in terms of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate the basic principles of that opinion, which are still valid today. We highlighted three main points, the first of these being transparency and openness, which are a fundamental requirement for any system of democratic control. These principles require an administration to be legitimate, efficient, responsible and meaningful for the public. Furthermore, they provide protection against arbitrary actions and the abuse of power. In addition, they contribute to the exposure, punishment and prevention of irregularities and fraud, phenomena that the Commission in particular has been very much subject to in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The second main point is the statement that documents produced by the institutions should be made public as a matter of principle. Any necessary exceptions to this principle should be justified. This has now been firmly established. Furthermore, I believed at that time that it was not appropriate to draw up an extensive catalogue listing existing legal provisions, which would only lead to doubts and disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The third main point is the public's desire for their rights to be respected in practice by guaranteeing the existence of an accessible registry, as is being requested now, and also, by means of the Internet, to respond swiftly to requests for documents and to justify any refusal of such a request, and last but not least to use the language of the applicant. I would also like to see a coordinating body facilitating all this. We shall see how this works in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that the basic requirements have been established, even if not in full as yet. That can be covered in the revised version. I also believe that the framework agreement should be revised to bring it in line with the requests we have made about openness and relations between the institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first question one might ask oneself is whether, in Parliament’s view, this is the best proposal that can be achieved. The answer is no. There are details in this document about which we have reservations and which we could wish were better. That applies, for example, to the issues surrounding documents of a sensitive nature. Reservations might also be entertained about the way in which the process has been conducted and about the fact that it has sometimes been conducted behind closed doors, as has been the case, on the whole, where the conciliation procedure is concerned. Even though discussions have taken place, the procedure is not especially open.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question we must ask ourselves is whether this proposal constitutes progress, or even considerable progress, in relation to the situation we have at present. My answer is an unqualified yes. It constitutes substantial progress in relation to the present situation. I really cannot understand those who say that it is a retrograde step. Is it not progress that all incoming documents are now to be made public, as is not of course the case at present? Is it not progress that, in principle, all documents will have to be registered in a way that they are not at present? Is it not progress that the secrecy rules which we have, which we recognise must exist and which exist in all those countries which have made the most progress of all in this area, are relatively few in number and, moreover, quite out in the open? The answer is an unqualified yes.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an individual requiring access to a document will only have to wait for a short period of time while the matter is administered. Documents must be more readily available on the Internet, and the administration period must be a maximum of fifteen days, meaning that the process is relatively quick. If the individual is not satisfied with the result, there must be a right to appeal and have the decision reviewed. That, if anything, surely constitutes progress. Moreover, the national rules must apply in those countries which have better legislation than that now being proposed. The proposal is not, therefore, a retrograde step for those countries which have more open legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">All this does constitute substantial progress. It would therefore seem very odd if this Parliament were to vote against a proposal just because it does not go the whole hog, for we are nearly there and have the opportunity to carry out an annual audit. Moreover, a review will take place in a few years’ time. It is quite clear that we in Parliament must vote in favour of this proposal. People want the institutions to be more open. This proposal constitutes a clear improvement when it comes to transparency and, in addition, to democratic administration within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like too to thank the rapporteurs of other committees for their considerable contribution. If the House approves this tomorrow, credit will be due to all of those, including Mrs Hautala, who helped in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposed new regulation is an important milestone on the road to abolishing unnecessary secrecy in government. Other speakers have outlined its direct benefits to the citizen, but to me tomorrow's vote must mark the beginning of a change in the culture of the European institutions from secrecy to openness. Many of us would have liked wider rights and fewer exceptions. Some argued that delay would give us a better deal, but the overwhelming majority on my committee decided not to make the best the enemy of the good, believing that this proposed regulation gives us a framework for progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must now be vigilant in making sure the law is put into practice. Some external critics have attacked us for not insisting on the naked civil servant. These proposals allow public officials a fig-leaf, but little more.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office, in particular, Ambassador Lund, for their willingness to grapple with this issue, to respect the deadline set by the treaties and to build a majority in Council. It is fitting that freedom of information legislation should be adopted under the presidency of a Member State which has long standing rights for citizens in this area, thanks to the farsightedness of an eminent former legislator, Mr Chydenius.

The reason for this lies in the wording concerning documents of a sensitive nature. This makes it possible in future to classify not only sensitive military documents as secret, but also more general documents concerning security and perhaps other policy areas too. The wording concerning sensitive documents is too general and too vague.</p>
<p class="contents">When, subsequently, it is a matter of which documents are to be classified as secret in a Member State such as Sweden, is it not the Commission which will in future decide this? In that case, it is a substantial infringement of the Swedish constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I agree with what has been said about the procedure itself, namely that it is extremely difficult to understand how, as part of an informal process I would characterise as very dubious, the negotiations concerning such a sensitive and important subject could have taken place between the committee, the Council and the Commission but not been subject to scrutiny by ordinary Members of Parliament and the general public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some areas, it is downright worse than the EU’s existing practice. Moreover, the very negotiations concerning the proposal have been a display of lack of transparency. The normal parliamentary process has been set aside, and significant parts of Parliament, including our group, have been excluded from influence.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for national rules on transparency is <span class="italic">not</span> guaranteed by the proposal. National rules are subordinate to an EU Regulation. Paragraph 14 of this Regulation also specifies that the Member States must be loyal to the contents of the Regulation. Furthermore, Article 5 states that, in cases which are not clear, Member States must ask the EU’s institutions for guidance in order to decide if EU documents are to be handed over. Nor is it the case that the Swedish principle of public access to official records is guaranteed by this proposal. On the contrary, it is the EU’s Court of Justice which has the power to decide in the event of conflicts arising in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There are extensive and partially unclear exemptions from the rules concerning access to documents. Whole areas such as security policy, internal documents and documents from the Member States are exempt in practice. What are called ‘sensitive documents’ do not even need to be shown in the registers. These exemptions substantially undermine the improvements made by the proposal, for example the demands for registers, time limits and access to electronic documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s access to classified documents has also been dealt with in these negotiations, at the same time as the public’s right of access to documents. It is an unfortunate confusion of different issues which ought not to have happened.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot see how the advantages of this proposal significantly outweigh the disadvantages. This is not the time to conclude this work, for it is not complete. The conciliation ought to continue as normal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At present, we in practice operate with common minimum rules governing transparency. It is possible for those countries that wish to do so to go further.

The Member States will now be obliged to conform to the common rules and consult the EU authorities before they make documents available. We are now to be given common maximum rules on transparency. Just look at recitals 9a and 12, which exclude better national legislation, and Article 4a of the Regulation in which the Member States are obliged to consult the EU. See also recital 5a concerning the actual decision-making process, recital 7 concerning countries’ right to classify documents, recital 9 concerning personal information which, for example, makes it more difficult to know who sits on the 1 500 committees, and Article 6a, Paragraph 3 which excludes sensitive information from the registers. See the text on euobserver.com, if you do not have it in your briefcases.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and the new ceiling are accompanied by a new procedure in which three opponents of transparency such as France, Spain and Germany are able to block progress on transparency, even if the whole of the European Parliament and twelve national parliaments are in agreement concerning a little more transparency. At present, progress can be made by means of pressure from the ombudsman, decisions by the Court of Justice or a simple majority in the Council of Ministers, that is to say eight out of fifteen countries. From tomorrow, any progress will require 62 out of 87 votes in the Council, and the Court of Justice and the countries in favour of transparency will not be able to help us obtain clear rules in the Regulation. It would be in the greater interests of transparency if we were to defer the decision today and see how the Council and the Commission are to interpret the new rules. The various forms of progress have, of course, been decided upon ...</p>

That needs to be stressed here today. However, I shall be pleased if this regulation means we can ensure that not just Members of the European Parliament, but all citizens of the European Union are given real access to all documents. I hope at least that we as Members will derive some benefit from this. If the transparency called for in this regulation actually becomes a principle of the institutions of the European Union, then we will have taken a great step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">If there are now to be some exceptions to this, then I regard that as positive. It is positive that there are only a few exceptions, but it is also positive that these few exceptions exist. I say that because the few exceptions exist for reasons of security and in order to protect the right to privacy. That is important in this context, because it means we have achieved something – we have managed to strike a balance between total openness and transparency on the one hand and the security interests of the Union and its citizens and protection of the right to privacy on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who is against secrecy being observed in these few exceptional cases has to be against the security interests of the European Union and also against protection of the right to privacy. So we should maintain this balance here and certainly not abandon it.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, what has not yet been decided is how the register will subsequently be designed and how the actual process of access will be arranged. One wise fellow Member mentioned in today's debate that there are two ways of treating people as stupid – one is to withhold information from them, which, thank goodness, has now been overcome, and the other is to flood them with unstructured information. Both of these are bad and we do not want either. That is why we are calling for the setting up of a structured register which is easy to understand and which also takes into account the need for genuine transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I hope that this regulation will actually lead to a new approach in the institutions of the European Union, so that it is not just a question of committing words to paper without overcoming the existing difficulties that we are all aware of. There must be a genuine guarantee that there will be a review after a relatively short time. We need a review in 2004 to highlight any shortcomings in what appears to be a very positive system, and, should it be necessary, to take further steps to ensure that the principle to which we are pledging ourselves – the transparency of the institutions of the European Union – really is thoroughly implemented.</p>

You talk about a crowning achievement, a historical decision, a milestone. It reminds me of Faust – Gretchen would have liked to record this day. <span class="italic">State Watch</span>, which is what this is about, the European Federation of Journalists, and so on say that rather than enshrining the rights of citizens, it undermines what we have been discussing today and will be voting on. It says that the current code enshrines the rights of Member States, albeit in different form. If I interpret this, it reminds me of Goethe, of Faust, again: "I hear the message well, but I have little faith." Maybe an attempt is being made to find a compromise position, perhaps today is not such a historical day. But receiving the EU's proposal here is rather like getting to see a new car. "Now you can have a look!" they tell us. We certainly will.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not long since the European transparency initiative was launched, an initiative taken so as to provide as many of Europe's citizens as possible with access to as many documents as possible, including those relating to Council meetings. Will we now get to see what documents really exist and which ones are sensitive? What does sensitivity mean? We are all very sensitive. How will you interpret sensitivity? Will you tell us that we can look at the car, but the motor is sensitive, the seat is sensitive and the steering wheel is sensitive? Or will we get there and see the whole car? I believe that there is room for optimism when you look at the example of the United States. It took decades until the Freedom of Information Act was passed, and even they started off by just having a first look at the car. But I hope that the Presidency and their successors will not come to us in future and complain about money, and say that it is too expensive if we ask for detailed information. There is money available for that. In the USA, the Freedom of Information Act costs USD 40 million every year. The bill for the American Government's public relations is USD 1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the opinion of our rapporteur, Mr Cashman, who is to be congratulated. He says that this is something that will develop by itself. We are relying on it developing by itself up to 2004. I believe that we should not be holier-than-thou about this, but that we should make a start here in this House when it comes to transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In future, the work would be driven by transparency and public scrutiny, and the mistakes of the Santer Commission would not be repeated. A very great deal of the general debate in 1999 was about transparency and public scrutiny. Quite a few of us voted for making the EU more open. Openness and public access to official records are necessary elements of a democratic and efficient administration, and if people can follow the decision-making process in the EU’s machinery, then there will also be an increase in confidence. We also know that there is a crystal-clear connection between a high level of transparency and a low level of corruption in an administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation we are voting on tomorrow is a compromise between Parliament and countries in the Council of Ministers which are sympathetic towards transparency. It is a step forwards in many ways. It provides the people of Europe with unifying legislation concerning the way in which they are to obtain access to documents. It lays down important principles, a fact which quite a few of my fellow MEPs have touched upon.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we Liberals are also sorry to see that it is deficient in a great many ways. It contains a rather ambiguous clause concerning what are called sensitive documents that are to be dealt with under a separate system. This is an unfortunate rule which may be interpreted arbitrarily.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, there is a certain lack of clarity as to how the Regulation would apply in relation to national law if conflicts were to arise. In some Member States, including Sweden and the Netherlands, there are more far-reaching rules governing access to documents. In Sweden, the tradition of transparency goes back to my fellow Liberal Party member, Anders Chydenius in 1766. What happens if a document is secret in Brussels but in the public domain in Stockholm? The Government and Swedish Prime Minister have said that, in a case like that, Swedish law applies, but can that be relied upon?</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency bears considerable responsibility, namely to ensure both that Dutch legislation and, above all, the Swedish Constitution are not undermined and that no self-censorship is practised by Swedish authorities either.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, an obvious fear in the Commission and certain Member States that people will be given too much information. Those of us who believe in transparency must constantly fight to demonstrate that the opposite is the case. Public scrutiny is not dangerous. Rather, it is democratic and efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group views this Regulation as a compromise involving a certain amount of progress but also containing certain shortcomings. We shall vote in favour of it tomorrow as a first step on the long journey ahead of us in terms of opening the institutions of the EU up to the people. Further efforts are required in this regard, and we shall test the limits of the legislation. We shall also take the lead in establishing still better rules in a couple of years’ time for, in spite of everything, transparency has the future on its side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The monarchy did not govern the country by laws, however, but by exceptions to them. The principle which prevailed in tsarist Russia now holds true for the system of public access to European Union documents. The documents are publicly available, but their secrecy is assured by derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">The documents pertaining to the common foreign and security policy are better kept secrets in the EU than Freemasons’ rituals, and the Worshipful Master of the EU Lodge is NATO. It has a monopoly over EU documents but has no connection with democracy. A culture of secrecy has been built into the EU, one that Parliament also helps to support.</p>
<p class="contents">Last summer, a majority in Parliament approved a framework agreement with the Commission on the subject of public access to documents, one that places the various Members of the European Parliament in unequal positions. As a result, more than twenty Members brought an action against Parliament and the Commission for infringement of basic provisions in the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. I wish to express my regrets to my Swedish fellow Members, but this wretched compromise has to be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is encouraging to see that Parliament is managing to leave its mark on an increasing number of negotiation procedures of this kind. But I am not thrilled with the end result. The procedures are not particularly wonderful. I do not welcome the secret negotiations, as a result of which the small groups and interest groupings have hardly been able to play a role at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now being confronted with a text whose adagio is in fact “like it or lump it”. We are having to ‘like’ a great deal in terms of content, especially the classification of confidential documents represents quite a big step backwards for Parliament. Many phrases are so vague that they could be interpreted in any which way in practice. For example, the claim by the rapporteurs that the national disclosure regulations have been safeguarded springs to mind. If that is the case, why has a section dedicated solely to this subject been deleted from the text of the Regulation?</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it was too much to expect that a regulation on access to documents, with which only a few Member States were familiar, could be made applicable in its entirety to the whole Union. The southern Member States do not have such regulations, so we cannot blame them for showing signs of cold feet.</p>
<p class="contents">It is utopian to believe that we will always reach the ideal policy at European level. The range of opinions on the desired transparency is unfortunately too wide for that to happen. At European level too, we increasingly notice that certain limits are reached in the Member States. The most achievable result is then a compromise which, in fact, satisfies nobody. This is a reality which we must accept. In the European Union, we must accept the Member States’ own backgrounds and cultures, even if this does not always suit us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me be clear. This report does not go as far as I would like. For that matter, it does not go as far as some of the pioneers in this area, in some of the NGOs, would like, like Tony Bunyan of Statewatch. It does not go as far as I hoped, but it does go further than I expected, as Parliament and the Swedish Presidency dragged the Commission and Council far closer to our position than they ever expected to be.</p>
<p class="contents">To accept what is offered here is to take a window of opportunity that is not guaranteed to remain open indefinitely. We recognise that some documents should and must remain confidential and classified, but what must not happen is that legitimate reasons of security, public safety and public protection are used to hide the merely embarrassing and misjudged. We welcome in particular the annual report that will detail the number of documents not listed from each institution, which will hopefully stop institutional creep from taking place, as year after year they add further and further categories of documents that will remain secret. We welcome the assumption of access and hope it proves just that.</p>
<p class="contents">These processes will increase transparency, improve accountability and give citizens rights to access documents. It does not give us freedom of information, but merely freer information. The latter, however, is a goal well worth achieving. The annual reports and the promised follow-up report in January 2004 may well prove that this report, this agreement, is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning. As my friend Hans-Peter Martin said, it took decades for the Freedom of Information Act to become law. Nevertheless, it is a political pleasure to be here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim is, in fact, to achieve transparency, and we are striving to make this transparency as fully effective as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is about our believing in the words we write. I would call upon everyone who has contributed to the decision to ensure that the words are given their intended meaning. Otherwise, people will become even more mistrustful.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a compromise and made certain gains. I am extremely pleased that we have succeeded in introducing more good administrative procedures for the handling of documents than I had believed we would. It is also important that the exceptions are more limited than those proposed by the Commission. It is interesting to see what was dispensed with. What was also interesting was today’s statement from Commissioner Barnier to the effect that the infringement proceedings must be public, which means that we are entering a new era in the European Union. Citizens will be able to monitor the Commission’s activity in a completely new way.</p>
<p class="contents">Many images have been used today. I agree with Mr Watson – without whom we should not have come so far – that we have obtained a powerful searchlight to use on documents, instead of the pocket torch we had previously. We have acquired a powerful tool. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will use that tool in the way cited by my colleagues and, in this, we are counting upon the help of the ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">There are shortcomings, but they are not as serious as our opponents maintain. We must respect the meaning of the words. We must also make sure that the Commission stops misusing the protection of personal data, something which has recently happened again.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now a question of going further, beyond what emerges from the reports about what has happened. It is about freedom of expression for employees and about ensuring that future discussion of the EU deals with transparency in a broader perspective, for transparency must apply to all the institutions and involve more than making documents publicly available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new rules are a stage in the cultural revolution that is needed if the EU is to develop into a modern, efficient and democratic form of cooperation which citizens in fact have confidence in. What we have here are marked improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">As a starting point, all documents, including internal documents, are included, and they must be registered. The exceptions to this rule are few but well-founded, and the rules governing the lodging of complaints have been tightened up on. Many here today have criticised the present compromise, and in the case of a compromise there will always be something to criticise. This must not, however, overshadow the fact that this is a good compromise in which the EU is setting a standard for transparency unknown in many of the EU’s Member States. Transparency does not come about through legislation alone, however. It also depends upon a culture of transparency. Transparency ought not to be perceived as an inconvenience for the administration. Transparency is an advantage, not only for democracy but also for the authorities to which it extends.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I want to call upon the Commission to take the spirit of this proposal seriously, not only the wording of the Regulation but also the recitals. The Commission should forget the lack of public access that characterised its first proposal and straightforwardly adopt the new proposal and the new spirit. The Commission has a big responsibility for ensuring that those who at present maintain that the new rules are no better than the existing rules are proved wrong. In three years’ time, practical experience must constitute a sufficient argument, and this is what we shall spend the next three years acquiring. We must see how the new rules work. We must make sure that countries which are sceptical come to see for themselves that transparency is beneficial to democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When a conciliation is entered into, not everything that may be wished for is obtained. Such is life. The proposed compromise is assessed and a judgement arrived at as to whether, despite its shortcomings, it is better than nothing. A decision for or against is then made. That is because there are no other possibilities when no further progress can be made at the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise reached in the negotiations concerning public access to EU documents is in no way what I would have wished for at the start of the negotiations, and it contains weaknesses, as has already been pointed out. For example, there are too many exceptions and too much uncertainty concerning the exceptions that are to apply. However, it is the first step in the right direction, and it means that, in a few years’ time, we can take the next step. Above all, it reflects the EU’s desire for greater transparency. I can well understand why the compromise has been called a victory for the willingness to negotiate. The Commission’s proposal was far from what we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party had looked forward to and far from what we in the Nordic countries might have wished for.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Nordic countries have good traditions of administrative transparency and, naturally enough, we took these as our point of departure. Over and against us, there was a long list of countries which do not have the same traditions, countries in which public access to official documents is scarcely known, countries in which there is no legislation in this area at all. In other words, our points of view were worlds apart. We Danes have a special love-hate relationship with our Swedish neighbours. We often find them self-satisfied and overly correct, but as a rule we are, of course, just envious. When it comes to administrative transparency, every country, including Denmark, has a lot to learn from the Swedes. We therefore have fewer reservations about voting in favour of the compromise when we see that Swedish colleagues in our group, together with the Swedish Presidency, are able to recommend a vote in favour. We shall carefully monitor the implementation of the result that has now been achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Kessler might want to do the same at the end. I must say that I was greatly perturbed by Mrs Frahm’s intervention, because she claimed that the proposals represent quite a step backwards, and that is simply not true. Maybe we need to have a one-to-one on this, but I think that you cannot make a claim about this proposal which simply bears no relation to reality. I do believe that we must be extremely careful that the small delegations do not feel excluded. All rapporteurs were from the largest and larger delegations, and we might need to consider how we could also involve the smaller delegations in those activities more in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must say that, in my opinion, Mrs Hautala’s example of those Russian dolls was not all that appropriate. If there is one country which is currently showing how to ruin disclosure, then it is surely Russia with the media campaigns which are taking place there at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my last observation relates to the fact that the debates show up the cultural differences. Hardly any representatives from southern European countries have spoken. You are southern European, and Mr Barnier is French, but that was it. Let us hope that this debate also strikes home with our southern European MEPs, for those countries might need public transparency more than anyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate and vote on the first draft report was held on 16 November 2000. The rapporteurs were given a clear mandate by Parliament for discussion with the Council. The European Parliament's Conference of Presidents also gave their clear political support. The mandate given under Rule 69 of the Rules of Procedure was, and I quote, "to table amendments seeking to reach a compromise", in order to adopt the Regulation in a single reading and within the date set in the Treaty to implement Article 255.</p>
<p class="contents">The series of trialogue meetings, discussions between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, took place from January to March 2001. All, and I repeat all, the various versions of the compromise amendments were discussed in the LIBE Committee and following the trialogue meetings. The process has been considerably more transparent than the conciliation process and these compromise amendments were agreed on 25 April in the LIBE Committee. At no time has any group, or any individual, been prevented from putting down amendments to put their influence into the procedure. Things move on. This Union has moved on. Post Nice, we have a security policy. It is right that we operate properly and responsibly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
