<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a number of points on the issue of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, a matter which has been at the heart of the Italian Presidency’s work regarding the African continent throughout these six months.</p>
<p class="contents">The most urgent task would, in actual fact, appear to be stabilising the continent, in other words preventing or eliminating armed conflict, where it is present. Indeed, everyone agrees that only by creating conditions of peace and security across the board can we promote development. Without these conditions, the eradication of poverty, the promotion of human rights, high-quality employment and environmental protection are empty dreams or short-lived achievements. There is to be no bartering of development for peacekeeping operations – we simply need to adopt an integrated approach. The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, made this quite clear when he said at the African Union Summit in Maputo that a comprehensive approach is needed which focuses in turn on peace and security, human rights and democracy, reconstruction and development.</p>
<p class="contents">The first people to become aware of this were the African Governments themselves, which, already in the programme document for the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, stated that war and underdevelopment are two aspects of the same problem and fuel each other. On the basis of this hypothesis, they have set up the necessary bodies to prevent, manage and resolve their crises, in particular the Peace and Security Council and the joint committee of the largest African States.</p>
<p class="contents">The new political element which must be stressed is this new determination on the part of the Africans to shoulder their responsibilities in the field of peace and security too on the basis of the principle of ownership. This is an attitude which the European Union has consistently encouraged and supported with measures seeking to strengthen African capacity, at both pan-African level and subregional level, through ECOWAS, IGAD and SADC.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this changing political situation, the Italian Presidency has worked actively to encourage a European response that would be able to meet the challenge. To this end, we promoted, first and foremost, a theoretical reflection on conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, through a research seminar organised in Rome on 28 July. We reinvigorated the EU-Africa dialogue, which had come to a halt after the postponement of the Lisbon Summit, through two troika meetings, the second of which was held on 10 November in Rome. This reinvigoration focused principally on the issues of peace and security, on which substantial convergence with the Africans was recorded. Lastly, we implemented ongoing measures to support the peace processes underway in Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, North Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and so on. We sustained constant diplomatic activity, which took the form, not least, of a series of numerous EU Ministerial Troika missions to Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the results – the short-term results, at least – are largely positive. The real-time management of the Liberian crisis, both at political and diplomatic level and at financial level, contributed decisively to bringing the conflict to an end, to the conclusion of a peace agreement and to the establishment of the current transitional government.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same region, now that the recovery of Sierra Leone has been consolidated, it is Côte d’Ivoire which is facing the greatest trial. Côte d’Ivoire is the real driving force of the region’s economy and it is in this country that the most important battle is being fought out. The progress made thus far is appreciable. The creation of a national reconciliation government, the adoption of an amnesty law, the agreement of 4 July 2003 between the national armed forces and the rebels, are significant stages in a process which needs to be completed by the quartering and disarmament of the troops and the extension of the State’s administration to the whole territory until the presidential elections scheduled for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has done and is continuing to do everything in its power to ensure that a way out of the present <span class="italic">impasse </span>is found, that reunification becomes irreversible and that the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements is completed. The declarations of 22 September and 9 December, the mid-October visit of a European Ministerial Troika and the work of the European Union representative in the Monitoring Committee are evidence of this. Thanks to the rapid intervention of the French armed forces and the ECOWAS troops, it was possible to avoid open conflict. However, the need remains for a more substantial United Nations peacekeeping force, within which African troops can continue to operate. This is the request made by ECOWAS at New York, and this request must be supported by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">These references to specific conflict situations make one appreciate the determination displayed by the Africans to manage their conflicts, on the one hand, and, on the other, the huge amount of work which needs to be done in order to strengthen operating capacities, particularly those for which subregional organisations are responsible. In this sense, the EU-Africa partnership can only evolve into tripartite cooperation between the European Union, the United Nations and Africa, in which each component complements the others.</p>
<p class="contents">The Artemis operation – the first European-led military operation to take place outside the training ground – showed the effectiveness of a rapid intervention with trained, well-organised forces, which can stop a crisis situation of conflict and then allow a larger United Nations force with an appropriate mandate to address larger stabilisation tasks. The forces of the subregional African organisations too can play this role of rapid intervention to resolve a crisis with a view to being replaced by the slower, better-organised United Nations machine. This could be the case in Burundi, where the first wholly African peacekeeping force is currently operating, which could be replaced by the United Nations within a year from now.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus far, we have mentioned specific measures carried out by the European Union under pressure of crises and humanitarian emergencies. The most remarkable innovation is, however, the creation of a Peace Facility – allocated EUR 250 million and financed by the EDF – decided by the Council of the European Union on 18 November 2003. In this way, the European Union is giving itself a dependable rapid-intervention instrument which ties in with the strategic partnership relationship linking the European Union to Africa and with the principle of African ownership. The peace facility will make it possible, with all the guarantees provided by decision-making procedures, to fund a specified range of activities which are part of peacekeeping operations carried out by African forces. The request for this submitted by the Maputo African Union Summit thus met with a response from the European Union which made good the commitments and promises so often reiterated.</p>
<p class="contents">For at least a decade, along with the United Nations, we have been urging Africa to take control of its future and, with the support of the international community, to break the vicious circle of conflict and poverty. Now that the African leaders themselves have taken up the cry, as is shown by the new philosophy which underpins the creation of the African Union and Nepad, implementing the promises with appropriate decisions becomes a matter of political credibility. If wisely implemented, the Peace Facility could prove to be one of the most important instruments for the future of relations between Europe and Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to stress that, in the field of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, substantial developments in planning and operation have been mapped out. We are trying to establish these developments through the revision of the base document, on which the overall action of the European Union in the sector has been based thus far: I refer to the European Union Common Position concerning conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa of 14 May 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The operation we have launched, which is underway, calls on us to integrate the current common position, updating it, first and foremost, with a reference to combating terrorism and organised crime, which are fuelled by situations of conflict; therefore, with a firm reference to the role of civil society and, within civil society, the role of women; then, with particular focus on the economic dimension of the conflicts themselves and, in this regard, on the unlawful exploitation of natural assets; lastly, with a reference to the very serious situation of what are known as ‘failed States’, or territories with no control or public institutions which can exercise the necessary authority and provide basic services.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an ongoing operation, which we entrust to the future Irish Presidency and which will firmly establish the European Union’s overall approach to the major issue of conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission shares Parliament's concerns on the political situation in Côte d'Ivoire. Even if some progress has been made in the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement, the current deadlock has to be broken.</p>
<p class="contents">The new forces have been boycotting the Council of Ministers for two months and this boycott, as well as the mutual lack of trust, makes it impossible to launch the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration process which is a prerequisite for the reunification of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still severe violations of human rights and the Commission is also very concerned about the humanitarian situation. Since the outbreak of the conflict in September 2002 the Commission has provided EUR 7.24 million for emergency relief operations in Côte d'Ivoire and it will continue to provide humanitarian assistance in 2004 in the framework of the global plan for coastal West Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is actively involved in the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement, both financially and politically. Since the beginning of the crisis on 19 September 2002, it has issued nine declarations and has repeatedly urged all Ivorians to work in harmony for the reunification of the country and the preparation of peaceful democratic elections in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In Abidjan the Commission, as well as the EU presidency, is a member of the monitoring committee of the Marcoussis Agreement. The 10 signatories of the agreement recommended the creation of its international committee in order to ensure its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has been quite active. Since its first meeting at the end of February it has met more than 50 times, but still its action has been criticised by all 10 political forces apart from President Gbagbo's party, the FPI.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions should quickly take place between all members of the committee on how to improve its efficiency. To restore its credibility the committee should undertake a thorough rethinking of its current role, not only to act as an arbitrator but also primarily to work in a more open manner in order to create more confidence as to how its work is viewed.</p>
<p class="contents">A kind of duty reporting to headquarters should be established, with minutes from the meetings to improve its transparency with regard to the institutions represented within this committee. It has been too inward-looking in the way it has functioned and changes there could be productive.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is most important is to ensure that the political players in Côte d'Ivoire really understand the need to create a spirit of coexistence and compromise. They must make an effort to get along within one nation. Without that attitude it will be very difficult to create real progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Union's capacity in conflict prevention, management and resolution is concerned, efforts are being undertaken to define a relevant common strategy. The main aspects of this entail strengthening regional integration through support to ECOWAS, reinforcing coordination with the UN and enhancing national and regional political dialogue. All this is something we are directly engaged in and we do what we can in all these relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiatives of the African Union on peace and security, as well as actions against the illicit exploitation of natural resources, will be taken into account as part of this process. I find it quite correct that Parliament is looking at these aspects in this kind of situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Mrs McKenna's amendments to suspend the fisheries agreement with Côte d’Ivoire because of inconsistencies in EC policies and because it is not possible to control national waters, I would like to make the following point.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has suggested extending the fisheries agreement for one year, taking into consideration that, with this agreement, Côte d’Ivoire will continue to benefit from targeted actions for scientific research, control and surveillance. The activities and the training of the Fisheries Ministry and investment in the Côte d’Ivoire economy, mainly through the three tuna factories, are guaranteed only if the agreement is extended.</p>
<p class="contents">Bankruptcy of the tuna canneries, currently generating 5 000 direct local jobs and more than 30 000 indirect jobs, would create a great deal of unemployment and could possibly lead to social unrest in Abidjan. It would also mean that the port of Abidjan would be definitely doomed as a fish-landing port for probably several years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that a failure to extend the agreement would have far-reaching negative consequences and could only deepen the current crisis in Côte d’Ivoire, so I would not recommend pulling this element into a situation which is already problematic enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Six political groups in this House are sponsoring a resolution, which we will certainly approve this very morning, in which we essentially call for the strict application of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement as the surest way of re-establishing the Rule of Law and the peaceful coexistence of all the parties in conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with the Commissioner, Mr Nielson, who has just stated that all efforts will be doomed to failure if the conflicting parties do not show clear signs of goodwill to achieve those agreements and live in peace together.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that this lack of vocation or capacity for agreement amongst them seems to me to be the most serious obstacle we are facing in terms of achieving peace in Ivory Coast.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago this Parliament visited the country and spoke with representatives of the whole of civil society, the authorities and the opposition. What we saw was not in every case a good example of a will to resolve the crisis. It is well known that the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement was not accepted with satisfaction by significant sectors of Ivory Coast society. When Mr Gbagbo returned to Abiyan, he was received with huge protests against the agreements which he himself had accepted – then he told us that he had not signed them, using a kind of double language which seemed to me to be unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the government itself, some of the ministers representing what we could describe as the ‘rebel sector’ gave a clear demonstration of what it means to be a rebel. Their words were not at all friendly towards the other part of the government, to which Mr Gbagbo belonged.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gbagbo himself, who was very friendly and very pleasant and who, during a meal which we were invited to in the presidential palace itself, explained to us his view of the problem, he said things in the presence of many of us who were there – no less than 10 or 15 people – which I believe do not point in the right direction, such as, for example, that he had to strengthen his army and that he had plans to buy certain military materials in the countries of the East. We believe that this is the completely wrong direction.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other examples, such as the ethnic issue, which, as we say in the resolution, is not at the root of the conflict and is probably not its only cause. But I must say that this issue of ethnicity and Ivory Coast citizenship was brought up in all our conversations – several dozen of them – during which every one of our interlocutors spoke about the problems caused by the thousands, hundreds of thousands of people originating above all from Burkina Faso who create problems and who are victims – themselves, in many cases – of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we must continue to make every effort to ensure compliance with the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, establishing greater coordination between all the parties with the DAC, the United Nations and the European Union. Having seen what we have seen, and in view of what I have summarised briefly, I cannot be very optimistic about the immediate future of that country which is so in need of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There remains, as others have said, an extremely worrying reluctance on all sides to work together, to co-exist, to cooperate and to work for reconciliation. That was absolutely clear when we were there and it remains the case.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be an end to impunity and, as the Commissioner said, a much clearer determination is essential to achieve demilitarisation, demobilisation and then rehabilitation in that country. Mr Prodi visited Côte d'Ivoire in November and he made serious pledges on these issues. This Parliament would like to see those pledges turned into real and immediate financial assistance as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO still needs more support in order to do its essential work of implementing the accords. This is the key to bringing peace, as is the need to put in place humanitarian assistance, protection for civilians and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of African Union and our ACP obligations, Commissioner Nielson suggested an extremely welcome and innovative way in which we can support Africa's own efforts to manage conflict. My understanding is – and I would like clarification on this because it was not clear from what the Council said – that certain Member States want to use the peace facility, which is well worked out, to fund directly sub-regional organisations, apparently without consulting the African Union, or even seeking the endorsement of the African Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For me this is an incredible proposal and one I would like to hear explained this morning. Would the Council agree that the European Union must give sustainable long-term support to the continental peace efforts that have been made and give assistance to the architecture which has been put in place to build security on the continent by the African Union?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council believe that the Member States would agree to support the declared wish of all African Heads of State that finance be managed under the African Union's authority and in no other way? I would appreciate some clarification as to where we are at the moment on the extremely important proposal for which Commissioner Nielson was responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was one of the countries in Africa held up as an example of stability and economic growth. Little by little, Côte d’Ivoire fell into a cycle of violence, chiefly since the introduction of <span class="italic">ivoirité</span>, or Ivorian identity, a concept that is in fact comparable with apartheid. It is absolutely clear that the ruling political class, the President included, is capable of anything in order to reinforce its power, and, and in so doing, does not even balk at taking the path of ethnic cleansing. The parallels with the events of ten years ago on the eve of the genocide in Rwanda are alarmingly great.</p>
<p class="contents">There is of course no immediate alternative to the Marcoussis Agreements, but Mrs Kinnock is right in saying that these may well have to be evaluated and the necessary adjustments made. At any event, the main problem is their enforceability. The international community must no longer stop at lip service. Commissioner, the European Union must consider all possible initiatives and instruments, including deferring aid to Côte d’Ivoire<span class="bold"> </span>until the government is prepared to implement the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements consistently and in their entirety.</p>

We have condemned the concept of ‘ivoirity’, which has tainted the electoral legitimacy of Laurent Gbagbo, but we have also condemned the military rebellion, which is unacceptable in a democracy. We were sceptical about the signing of the Marcoussis peace agreement, which showed every sign of having been dictated by the former colonial power. As might have been expected, it was not viable and led to the resignation, in September, of the rebel ministers in the government of national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although progress has been made in recent months, new confrontations over the last fortnight have weakened the chances of relaunching the peace process. Now, the violence in the north, as well as in the cocoa belt, and the abuses by the so-called patriotic forces are leading to ever-increasing human rights violations. We request that these cease without delay and that the government and the rebel forces stop exploiting demonstrations which, in reality, are not at all spontaneous. We demand that investigation procedures be put in place to punish those responsible for the abuses. We condemn just as vigorously the assassination of the French journalist Jean Hélène, and we ask that an international inquiry be set up in order to bring those responsible to justice. We call for genuine negotiations to be resumed with a view to bringing the conflict to an end. It is only by taking account of all the political forces in the country and of the balance between these forces that it will be possible to find a peaceful and democratic solution, leading to the relaunch of a peace process that must include the disarmament of the militias, together with free legislative and presidential general elections under international supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is to be achieved, the European Union’s policy of prevention must tackle the structural causes, that is to say poverty, the unequal distribution of wealth, social injustice, the oppression of minorities and the disorganisation of the state. Alongside this, the EU must adopt a coherent trade and development policy in order to guarantee aid to the African economies and, in particular, to the African population. In this context, we call upon the Commission not to extend the fisheries agreement with Côte d'Ivoire for as long as implementation of development cooperation within the framework of the Cotonou agreements remains suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we would signal our commitment to respect for minorities, which is an indispensable basis for the peaceful settlement of these conflicts in Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in Côte d'Ivoire is a typical example of tension based on social and ethnic differences. The murder of the French journalist Jean Hélène, the correspondent for Radio France Internationale, reveals the depth of the crisis and disdain for the Marcoussis agreement. This agreement, together with the Cotonou agreement, offers a very good framework for crisis settlement and respect for human rights and the rules of democracy. Nonetheless, generally when we talk of democracy and peaceful coexistence in an area in which violence is a daily reality, we need to take account of two serious factors.</p>
<p class="contents">First, traditional and local approaches to conflict settlement. Viable solutions depend to a large degree on the ability of local society to build up a relationship of trust and cooperation between opposing groups. Experience has shown that solutions based on local values and mediation techniques have far more potential to bring about lasting peace. That is why we also need to incorporate local perceptions and practices into international mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, serious account needs to be taken of the role of women in conflict settlement and the reconciliation process and I am grateful to Mr Antonione for mentioning this. This issue has repeatedly preoccupied the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and we have processed relative positions on the role of women in peace processes. Analyses have also been carried out by the UN and, within the framework of the Greek Presidency, there was a related report and conclusions by the European Council in Thessaloniki. The Council and the European Commission therefore need to take account of this factor and to reinforce the initiatives of women in peace processes through the budget; EUR 250 million would be a respectable sum.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I should like to mention that on 10 December, which was International Human Rights Day, the Manο River Women’s Peace Network was awarded the UN prize for human rights for 2003. This is an organisation, consisting of women from the three countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, which played a crucial role in preventing hostilities between the three countries by forcing the political leaders to return to the negotiating table, thus earning the praise of the Secretary-General of the UN in April 2002. I mention this in order to stress the importance of the role of women, which is often disregarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These confrontations, between Côte d'Ivoire soldiers and unidentified armed men, are again giving rise to fears that the peace process in Côte d'Ivoire will be blocked.</p>
<p class="contents">These events are suddenly taking place at a time when the ex-rebellion forces had decided to announce their imminent return to the institutions of the government of national reconciliation. Unfortunately, we observe how the proliferation of militias is a very dangerous consequence of the conflict. Many witnesses’ accounts, collected by the Human Rights Watch organisation, report multiple abuses committed with total impunity by pro-government militias.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the country was preparing to take a decisive step towards peace, this new eruption of violence – and this in an extremely troubled context – is again preoccupying the defenders of the Linas-Marcoussis agreements. These agreements, let us remember, were aimed at bringing the hostilities to an end, ensuring a return to peace and stability and preserving the territorial and ethnic integrity of Côte d'Ivoire. In the light of the Linas-Marcoussis agreements, the current priority is the need to pursue the process of disarmament and of rehabilitating the forces present in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Côte d'Ivoire Government and, above all, President Gbagbo, must ensure that people’s rights and freedoms are protected and bring the hostilities to an end without delay. Otherwise, we could be led to request the suspension of aid to Côte d'Ivoire, aid that, as we are well aware, is indispensable to the people of Côte d'Ivoire. Indeed, we fear, Commissioner, that EU aid is unfortunately used in large part for purchasing arms. Let us therefore be prudent, rather than naive or complicit in a further genocide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is always the problem and risk of indirect consequences of supporting a government in a difficult situation like this. But we are very cautiously doing the right thing by not turning our backs on the country, but instead finding areas where we can do something meaningful, also bearing in mind that there is a legitimate government in the country. We have used the Cotonou system to organise dialogue and to establish benchmarks along the way leading back to normalisation, and we are linking and conditioning our support to the Marcoussis Agreement and the process there.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already addressed the specific aspect of fisheries. Let me say a few words on the peace facility in response to Mrs Kinnock and Mrs Karamanou. I very much welcomed the conclusions of the European Council last week relating to the peace facility. It was clearly stated in these conclusions that the Council recognises the importance of this peace facility and it also makes the point quite clearly that the financing of these peace operations will create a noteworthy and important impulse in strengthening the capacity of the African people to create and preserve peace on the whole continent. So there was no reference whatsoever to any ways of doing this other than what is implicitly referred to here as an all-African effort. It is the case that we foresee, and the African Union and the Commission also expect that regional organisations should be used as implementing agents for handling individual cases. However, it is clear from the whole architecture of the proposal that decision-making is supposed to be the responsibility of the African Union. This is also the prevailing view in the discussions that are taking place inside the EU. This is very important, because stability and African ownership of this process is the key to success.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to the next steps in the chain of implementation, to take place shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mrs Karamanou that the peace facility would not cover the cost of supporting women's organisations or other activities like that. It is very important that this facility should only cover those actions relating directly to peacekeeping or peace-building activities which cannot be funded by other sources. That is what is new in this and why we are moving into a new area of activity and a new method of funding and decision-making. All this is new for good reasons, and we have to be very careful not to overlap with what can in fact be funded through other sources, otherwise the opportunity would be wasted.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remarks on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire and what we are trying to do: we are not in a situation where we have cut off or frozen spending. We have not suspended the Cotonou working relationship, but we have to adapt to the situation. We are gradually trying to move forward and link it to a process of reconciliation. In fact, the country strategy paper and the national indicative programme, totalling EUR 298 million, were discussed by the EDF Committee on 20 November and we will try ensure that the implementation of this is linked to the implementation of the Marcoussis Agreement. We will include interventions such as promoting security of land tenure, and good governance will also be an important element, along with support for the 2005 presidential and parliamentary elections. This is a very sad case, but we have to be stubbornly optimistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
