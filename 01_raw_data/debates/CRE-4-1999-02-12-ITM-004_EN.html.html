<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kestelijn‐Sierens </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a Commission report on efficiency and accountability in European standardisation under the new approach. The new approach for the field of technical harmonisation was introduced in 1985 and is based on four principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the European legislator sets out the essential health and safety conditions which products must meet before they can be placed on the market. The standards institutes then draw up the technical specifications which the manufacturer needs in order to manufacture products to those requirements. There is, however, no obligation on the producer to produce on the basis of the standards. Lastly, the authorities are required to associate products that comply with the harmonised standards with a ‘presumption of conformity" with the essential conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Economic Affairs Committee judges the new approach to be a good one, above all because the harmonisation of legislation is restricted to the essential conditions. This is a policy matter and separate from the compilation of technical specifications, which is the business of the standards people. In other words, every man to his own trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The market‐oriented character of the new approach contrasts too with the mandatory nature of the legislation. No one is forcing the manufacturer to comply with the technical specifications. A new approach makes flexible legislation possible, which can be rapidly adapted to keep pace with technological progress. More efficient and more transparent standardisation work is the province of the independent institutes CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, but the reviewing of progress and the process of checking that the institutes take account of deadlines remains a crucial responsibility of the Commission. At regular intervals, the Commission has to remind the standards institutes of their duty of responsibility, using cost‐benefit analyses. It can also benchmark the standardisation process vis‐à‐vis our main trading partners and study market effects. Lastly, and we attach great importance to this, it can take the Member States to task when it comes to transposing the European standards into national standards if they record a poor performance on the internal market scoreboard.</p>
<p class="contents">We are against a merger of the three institutes, for the simple reason that this would dramatically impair efficiency. Nor am I sure that the use of formal voting is desirable at an early stage of the standardisation work with the aim of speeding up the process. After all, the new approach requires the involvement and mutual trust of all the partners, namely the national standards institutes, small businesses, employers, employees, consumers and the environmental groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important factor is the extent to which national bodies recognise each others" technical approval or declarations of conformity. For many manufacturers this is a real problem, especially in the building materials sector. In effect, they cannot export their products to all the Member States. So the Commission needs to tighten up the procedures for dealing with infringements of the principle of mutual recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, firms need to have a clearer idea of whom to contact if they have complaints about the mutual recognition of test results. A unit at the Commission? Or is there another solution, Commissioner? The European Parliament has already said that the parties concerned, namely small businesses, employers, employees, consumers and environmental groups do not have the funds or staff to keep abreast of everything happening in the standardisation field. So I suggest the Commission looks at whether they might get more help from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is not just a problem at European level; consumers are involved, for example, in only seven Member States. I think something needs to change there. The Commission is asking CEN, CENELEC and ETSI to have an independent assessment made of the way in which the European standardisation process is funded. I support it on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must ensure that standards institutes in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are involved more closely in the work of the European institutes, and that the parties concerned in those countries are able to count on aid from the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the main observations of Parliament"s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. My thanks to honourable Members for their interesting and useful contributions to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two more questions for Commissioner Bangemann. The first concerns closer involvement of the parties involved in standardisation. As I said earlier, it is a matter of money. I should like to ask the Commissioner if he has any concrete proposals which will allow small businesses and other organisations to take a more active part in shaping the European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the problem of harmonising plugs and sockets. I deliberately did not cover that in my report. But the question comes up regularly and questions are asked about this. As we all know, the debate has been going on for 30 years. I would like to hear from Commissioner Bangemann if there is actually a solution – is it a matter of money, or technology? Is there actually the political will to do anything about this? These are my two questions to the Commissioner.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we want to move from an internal market to a domestic market, and for that we need principles, and an important determining factor here is standardisation. Standardisation is an economic instrument which will guarantee us freedom of movement for goods and services in future too. But we want modern legislation. We want the new approach, and specifically in the area of standards we have seen that it is necessary to reflect together on how we can secure better procedures. The story of the tractor seat has shown that it makes better sense to opt for the new approach, that is to say to let the standards institutes in the individual countries operate independently of one another. I think it is important nevertheless to have legislation – a directive – for this area in order to provide a political framework.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a clear division here between the legislator on the one hand, who does not want to have to compose weighty tomes full of rules which are often difficult to understand – we want legislation which is lean and efficient – while on the other hand there are the voluntary and independent standards organisations where manufacturers and users quite simply meet and discuss areas which they know extremely well and where they can decide very precisely what it is they want.</p>
<p class="contents">We had a good example here in the House with the bus directive, the so‐called European bus. We had 142 pages of proposals, and Parliament managed to trim this proposal down to three pages. There is no reason why buses in Europe should all look the same, from a hot and dusty village in Sicily to the rush hour in London or the distant wastes of Finland. We think the legislator should really confine himself to specific points here, to a few requirements which have to be observed throughout Europe, while the rest should be decided on freely within standards organisations, so that here too there can be competition which does not hamper innovation but ensures that good products get on to the market safely and fast.</p>
<p class="contents">A further part of the system is the CE symbol. I think the CE symbol gives us a guarantee that existing legal provisions are not being flouted. But in addition we need to have voluntary symbols of conformity which are designed to ensure that subsequent production is monitored by independent bodies.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kerr </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Madam President, when my group told me that I had 1 1/2 minutes to speak on normalisation and standardisation this morning, I was worried that it was part of a New Labour process to apply standardisation to candidates across Europe. But I discovered, to my relief, that it is in fact a very good report by my good friend, Mrs Kestelijn‐Sierens, which I commend to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a serious issue which I want to raise on the report and I hope Commissioner Bangemann might respond to it. He may remember a constituent of mine, Simon Hossack, who wrote many letters to the Commission and I tabled many questions on his behalf. He was an inventor who had produced a very ingenious device which made any electrical apparatus standard across Europe. He found that it was impossible for him to market this device because the standards committees were dominated by the big plug manufacturers of Europe who were perfectly happy with the situation where a variety of different plug forms across Europe were allowed to operate because this allowed them to retain their market share. By refusing to allow his device the standards committees prevented him from entering the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Commissioner Bangemann as a good free‐market deregulator would not approve of this and I hope that he will take account of this in making sure that the standards committees are fully representative of all the people in the Community, including new people who want to enter the market, as well as the existing large monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner Bangemann, I voted to sack you last month and I will vote to sack you again next month, so you can give me a very short reply.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blot </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, like the rapporteur, I think the Commission"s report on European standardisation under the new approach is broadly satisfactory. It wants harmonisation of the legislation to go no further than is essential for safety and health. The machinery of standardisation is based essentially on consensus between the professionals and the institutes. The report does not prohibit manufacturers from making products which do not meet the standards, and the responsibility thus lies with the market. There is of course one sector where problems remain, that of building materials. But the general line adopted seems to be satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it would seem opportune to mention here the problem of standards being used for protectionist purposes on markets outside Europe. I am thinking of the USA and Japan. The subject was not strictly speaking considered in the report, it is true, since the report dealt only with the functioning of the internal market, but I think it needs to be looked at by the European institutions. In fact, the subject is not unrelated to the setting of internal standards for Europe: the external and internal aspects cannot be separated. There is no reason, for example, why these internal European standards should make it easier for American imports to come in, unless there are reciprocal arrangements over the setting of standards in the USA, product for product. So the European standards institutes cannot disregard the policy pursued on the other side of the Atlantic. I should like to see this too being taken into consideration in the future.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR GUTIÉRREZ DÍAZ<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> My thanks, Mr President, to the rapporteurs and those honourable Members who have spoken. I shall try to deal briefly with some of the questions raised.</p>
<p class="contents">We follow the work of the three European standards organisations with close attention. We meet with them at regular intervals. The last time was just two weeks ago. We talk about problems, for example the issue of transparency and efficiency, and we try to make the overall procedure as efficient and helpful for consumers and industry as possible. Misconceptions will always arise, for example the misconception that our standards might create technical barriers, or alternatively that if we allow other countries such as the USA and Japan to use our standard, the Americans and Japanese will not reciprocate. All these are misconceptions of the principle which underlies our standardisation work – and the work in the USA and basically in Japan as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I must repeat that, with an eye to the charge of protectionism levelled against us by the Americans. We are not accusing the Americans of some kind of protectionism; it is the Americans who constantly accuse us of it, the latest example being UMTS. This is quite untrue, because – and I say this once again most emphatically, since it is the essence of this policy – with a few exceptions which are necessary for reasons of safety or security, there are no standards which are mandatory. No standards which are mandatory! In other words, anyone – including this ingenious inventor with his universal plug – can market his products. He does not have to comply with a standard. He can market a product which is constructed quite differently.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want, especially with interoperable systems, is that a standard agreed on by the parties concerned, including consumers, trade unions and so on, should also to some degree be attractive, so that people accept it. The attraction is basically that the manufacturer of a product – without any need for recognition by other Member States – can make the claim that this product meets the requirements of the European Union. That is then the CE symbol and it gives him an advantage, if you like. That is the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to your individual points. Firstly: we already fund small and medium‐sized enterprises and their participation. We have no objections at all to transparency. Anyone with a legitimate interest is free to take part in this process. It may be a little longer as a result, but it is altogether possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should say for the benefit of the rapporteur, Mrs Kestelijn‐Sierens, that we have taken numerous initiatives involving potential new Member States of the Union, and with great success. CEN, CENELEC and ETSI work very closely with the standards organisations of these countries. We fund this work under PHARE and other accession‐oriented financing programmes. So in principle all that is being done.</p>
<p class="contents">One last comment regarding plugs: since the standards organisations are supported by business and industry and their work is funded by business and industry, it is perfectly understandable and obvious that in the current situation – which is not a problem for manufacturers, only for consumers – business and industry are not unduly interested in hearing that we ought to have standard plugs throughout the Union. So they do nothing about it. Member States too – and we could of course resolve this by political pressure, admittedly not for reasons of safety, but certainly very much in the consumer interest – are totally uninterested in applying a standard of this kind unless the standard adopted is the one already used in their own country. Thus Denmark would be very keen to see Danish standards becoming European standards, and so on. But that cannot of course be the right answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The right answer can only be to devise a European standard that is fully consistent with modern technical requirements. We would then treat this standard the same as others; it would not be mandatory, but would bring certain advantages to the manufacturer. If everyone manufactured their plugs to this standard, this would then mean not only that future plugs and sockets would look like that, but also of course that all existing plugs and sockets would then have to be converted, and you can imagine how much all that would cost. That is why neither business and industry nor the consumer is all that keen on changing things. But this report goes to the Council as well as to Parliament, and we shall be discussing it again with the Council. In effect, this is a clear example of something on which there has been no European standardisation, although it has nothing at all to do with the work we do, and do successfully. The way we go about the work of standardisation is the best in the world. To quote just one example: GSM, the second generation of mobile phones. With this standard, European manufacturers have captured two thirds of the world market. If we complete UMTS, the third generation, successfully – and work is still ongoing because there are a few problems with intellectual property rights – if we succeed in this, and American and Japanese firms have also been involved with the work right from the start, we shall probably capture a bigger share of the world market than we did with GSM. So we have no need at all to be modest about standardisation. We are the world leader here!</p>
