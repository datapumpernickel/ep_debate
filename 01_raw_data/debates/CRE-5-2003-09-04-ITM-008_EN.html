<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fernández Martín (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the world today is more interdependent than ever before. Problems are shared problems: poverty, hunger, military conflict, immigration, transmissible diseases, ecological disasters and the like. Efforts to solve them must be coordinated and shared by all.</p>
<p class="contents">Here the question of development aid has become more important than ever. Now is exactly the right moment, to my mind, for the Commission to have produced its communication to the Council and to Parliament, which we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">The report I am presenting today, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation<span class="bold">,</span> is the fruit of work and contributions from political groups and from my fellow Members, for which I am particularly grateful and appreciative.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the European Union and its Member States constitute the world’s leading donors of government development aid. The traditional mechanisms of the European model have not, however, allowed the desired aims of cooperation to be achieved with complete success. It is difficult for us to ensure that the results are monitored or to assess them accurately, because the implementation of the programmes and projects is dispersed among both national cooperation agencies and fixed procedures which tie the receipt of aid in different ways to the acquisition of goods and services obtained by means of that aid in the donor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">According the World Bank’s figures, released here in this Chamber during a speech by the bank’s President, Mr Wolfensohn, the untying of aid would result in a reduction of transaction costs by up to 25%. We therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative, which may help to enliven the debate on this issue. That debate is currently being conducted among Member States and multilateral organisations. They are far from reaching an agreement which would be binding on all parties, and on the main donors in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced of the need, in this debate, to uphold the idea that aid priorities should suit the interests of recipient countries. That idea would seem almost too obvious to any observer, but it is not currently being put into practice. As a result, some European countries play a significant part in cooperation as official aid donors, but the money they make in return for delivering that aid exceeds their own contributions to the aid programmes, sometimes by a long way. This practice is known to all of us, I believe, and it is clear proof of a degree of cynicism among the donor countries – in other words, our own countries. We must make an effort, therefore, to try and remedy this state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, events do not take this kind of turn through a deliberate and evil desire for them to turn out badly, but for a whole range of reasons which cannot be gone into here. The main thing is that we use the experience we have acquired to push for these ideas to be implemented, bearing in mind certain considerations, such as those mentioned in paragraph 4 of our report, in order to ensure that our objectives are achieved and certain undesirable effects avoided. In other words, for example, it would be helpful if the Commission were to bear in mind the need for horizontal and geographical or regional budget lines to be treated equally, so as to introduce and guarantee open, transparent calls for tender, which do not always come about. These calls for tender will apply to all Member States and candidate countries, all developing countries and all developed countries, on condition that they are reciprocated by third countries and approved by the recipient countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by making express mention of a request made by many developing countries and NGOs. That request is that priority be given to the award of contracts to local suppliers or service providers in both the recipient country and neighbouring countries in the same region, on condition that provision is made for sufficient training to ensure that the projects are brought to a satisfactory conclusion rather than left frustratingly unfinished. The reasons for this are many and plain to see; it would be almost too obvious to list them, but they can be summed up by evoking the desirability of contributing to the development of local markets in those countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This issue may appear to be very technical and difficult to address, but it can have quite an impact in the field concerning the effectiveness, the value for money of our aid and also the dynamics of the cooperation with our partner countries – exactly in the way Mr Fernández Martin has made clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the work he has done on this subject. His report reflects broad agreement between us. We have achieved consensus in Council on the untying of Community aid, and with the resolution on the table now in Parliament we can start working on implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will focus on concrete proposals to change the different relevant legal instruments. The proposal to implement changes in the existing regulations will fall under the co-decision procedure and therefore Parliament's role in moving this forward will be fundamental. I look forward to discussing it with Parliament during the course of this coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue our work on establishing the facts relating to untying. One of the problems is that it is very difficult to find concrete, reliable data on the impact of untying. We will begin a study on this before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">We will try to convince other donors who are still reluctant to join us, particularly through the work of the OECD ’s Development Assistance Committee and its new Working Group on Aid Effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">While welcoming the Council’s agreement on the untying of Community aid, I would like to express disappointment at the reluctance of some Member States – and especially that of one Member State – to commit themselves to untying bilateral aid. This has two dimensions; one is the well-established discussion as to whether or not official development assistance and the procurement there is part of the Single Market. This is an internal EU discussion. In the Commission's view the answer is clearly 'yes', the public procurement directive does indeed cover development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries that have been doubting this over the years, including my own, clearly no longer doubt this. However, one Member State still maintains a different view. My reply would be 'okay, we will meet in Court'.</p>
<p class="contents">The other element where a discussion is more open and more legitimate is what Member States do in the broader global discussion in the framework of OECD about the untying of aid. There we have an agreement to untie aid to the group of least developed countries. The volume of what has been agreed on corresponds to about 2% of global ODA – not a big deal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is complying, and in fact over-achieving, in relation to what it has to do in order to carry out this agreement. But we take a different view: one reason being that we do not want to discriminate between least developed countries and the rest. We are ready to untie all aid and we have legal obligations vis-à-vis the ACP countries, for instance, which means that as a group, they have access to bid on everything relating to all seventy-eight countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparation for the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development, the Member States committed themselves to continue discussions on the further untying of bilateral aid. The Commission recognises that we need both to increase the volume of aid and its effectiveness through measures like those we are discussing today. I am really pleased to have the signal from Parliament and I look forward to moving this forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have to insist on some reciprocity, because this issue is also about taking care of trade interests opening up on our part, if, for instance, the United States is not doing the same thing. It is clearly not something we have a mandate to do. Our policy is now clear we want to go for the big solution on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he said, we now live in a world that is totally interdependent, and the problems of one country are problems for all of us, problems such as poverty, hunger, disease, ecological disasters and crime. It is our joint responsibility to resolve these problems and to work towards a consistent and coherent strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Development aid can play a pivotal role in working towards solutions, but only if it is free of trade commitments. The proposals we have in front of us are a positive step towards achieving greater effectiveness of development aid. Untying aid is a direct way of increasing that effectiveness, but we need to acknowledge and recognise, as the Commissioner has made clear, that among certain Member States tying aid is still common practice. We must therefore take immediate action to address the inadequacy of our current practices. Commissioner, may I say 'more power to your elbow!' when you see the recalcitrant Member State in court, because we cannot have one Member State playing a different game from the others. We have, as you say, a single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the need for reform. It will lead to increasing transparency and accountability. It is a complex process, and we welcome the intention of the Commission to bring forward the legislative proposals and the changes to existing legislation, hoping that this will not result in more bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress that this untying of aid from trade is not a final step, but it is one means of increasing the effectiveness of granting aid. The main purpose of granting aid is poverty reduction. So it is not an isolated concept, but part of an ongoing debate which will be pursued to some extent in Cancun next week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also ask Commissioner Nielson to convey my thanks to those involved in drafting the Commission communication. The text is clearly written and big-hearted in its tone.</p>
<p class="contents">The practice of tying aid may in theory even turn development aid completely on its head, with the donor benefiting and the country intended as the recipient becoming poorer than ever. Although this extreme paradox, which is well-known in economic theories, is not necessarily very easily possible in reality, it is nevertheless a reminder of the sort of reduced effectiveness and perversions of aid which still occur and are furthermore permitted in real life.</p>
<p class="contents">Estimates by the World Bank and the OECD of savings made through increased effectiveness are of the order of 25%. Our rapporteur estimates that the net benefit of untying could be the equivalent of as much as USD 5 billion in terms of cash. As we know how even small sums of money can work wonders in development cooperation, an increase of several billion euros of that sort is staggering. The European Union’s willingness to take the initiative in this matter is significant as the EU and the Member States are responsible together for half the world’s development aid. Reduced effectiveness in development cooperation is therefore by no means a trivial matter when measured in real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to implement the conclusions arrived at in Barcelona swiftly. It should be self-evident that simple market economy principles dictate that the EU Member States should untie donor aid. The key competition principles agreed in the EU will work to the advantage of the developing countries in this. Then local sourcing and sourcing from other developing countries will also be possible, as we have already seen, resulting in a multiplier effect on the effectiveness of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the benefit in terms of welfare achieved in the developing countries, the liberalisation of procurement will also be important within the EU, because the practice of tying aid which still goes on in many Member States also distorts competition among the Member States themselves and is against the rules on competition in the EC Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among the latter are many intergovernmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a strategy document entitled ‘Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Cooperation’. This publication discredited the practice of imposing conditions on development assistance, showing it to be incompatible with the new guiding philosophy for initiatives in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, that philosophy has gradually taken on a definite, solid form through a series of important declarations and resolutions, such as the DAC’s recommendation, approved in May 2001, demanding that aid to the least-developed countries should be untied.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, the international community adopted the Monterrey Consensus at the International Conference on Financing for Development in March 2002, committing itself to supporting initiatives designed to phase out conditional aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication of November 2002, entitled ‘Untying: Enhancing the Effectiveness of Aid’, the Commission responds to just those promises made at Monterrey. It goes even further than the DAC’s resolution, since it extends the need to untie aid to all developing countries, not just to least-developed countries. It also extends the untying of aid to all aid sectors, including food aid.</p>
<p class="contents">All these recommendations are still gaining ground, under pressure from lobbying by the general public and by NGOs. They have not, however, made a great impression on a large number of countries, which are continuing to grant tied aid, either openly or covertly. This is unfortunately also true of various EU Member States. The result is a significant discrepancy between the policy advocated by Parliament and implemented by the Commission on the one hand, and the policy put into practice by some Member States, such as Spain under José María Aznar, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It comes as no surprise that the report presented by Mr Fernández Martín, a <span class="italic">Partido Popular</span> deputy in my country, should list a series of initial misgivings about the progressive approach urged by the Commission, an approach favourable to the untying of development cooperation policy. In the rapporteur’s favour, however, it should be said that he showed understanding and flexibility by accepting the amendments tabled to his first proposal, which have yielded substantial improvements in his final text.</p>
<p class="contents">That text includes a motion for a resolution approved by the Parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation. We will be reasonably happy to vote for it, since it favours the complete untying of development aid, both European Union aid and aid granted by each and every one of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to Mrs Korhola's comments, it is true that many years ago the World Bank and UN stated that up to 25% of development assistance was wasted from the point of view of the recipient countries because of tying to the donor countries. This figure is not acceptable to the Commission because we have open competition between the 15 Member States, and adding a sixteenth does not really change the name of the game in terms of ensuring competitiveness when we are tendering. Therefore, the dynamics of this mainly revolves around a classical case of a single bilateral donor country tying or not tying. For the Commission, the dynamics of this, economically speaking, are not fantastic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that as a result of access to ACP countries, these countries have the right to bid on anything we tender relating to them. About 25% of all tenders are now being won by ACP bidders. This is good and is part of what Mr Fernández Martín talked about as being important to attain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is true that food aid and the transport of food aid has – at the insistence of the US and via the decision in the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD – been excluded from what should be covered by untying of aid. This is very sad and this is why we specifically refer to that problem as one of the elements in the broader topic of the untying of aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
