<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, when it comes to small arms and light weapons (SALW), we all know that the world is faced with many regional conflicts where weapons of this kind, sometimes even used by children, are creating extremely dangerous and destructive situations. That is why the European Union is backing the Secretary-General’s call for the development of long-term strategies to end the scourge of the illicit proliferation of small arms.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations programme of action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects is one such strategy. It was adopted on 20 July 2001 and the European Union is actively seeking to apply the recommendations it contains at national, regional and world levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation and of the excessive build-up and uncontrolled spread of small arms lie at the heart of four of the five major challenges identified by the security strategy adopted by the European Council in 2003. Small arms and light weapons in fact help to exacerbate terrorism and organised crime and are a major factor in the unleashing and spread of conflict and the collapse of state structures.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European strategy underlines, conflicts in which weapons of this kind are by far the principal instrument have cost the lives of nearly 4 million people since 1990 and have forced more than 18 million others to leave their homes or their countries. The increased access by non-state players to these stocks of arms has changed the nature and duration of conflicts. It is a situation that risks compromising our own security and the European Union needs to cooperate closely with its international partners in responding to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore very actively preparing for the second biennial meeting of states to consider the implementation of the United Nations programme of action on small arms and light weapons, to be held in New York in mid-July. In connection with preparations for this important event, the Presidency has compiled a list of subjects that should be given priority in the competent international fora. This list, which is awaiting approval, includes in particular the illicit brokering of small arms, control of transfers, verification of end use, the link between security and development, the management of weapons held by the military and security forces, the creation of machinery for implementing the UN action plan, the possession of small arms by civilians, transfer to non-state players and technical assistance for the submission and presentation of reports.</p>
<p class="contents">More particularly, the European Union stresses the importance of creating a group of government experts immediately following the 2006 conference that will examine the programme of action; the group will consider further measures to strengthen international cooperation to prevent, combat and eradicate illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of our key priorities is to negotiate an international instrument for the identification and tracing of such weapons. The open-ended working group responsible for negotiating this instrument has the European Union’s full support. At the two meetings held by the working group of diplomats and experts up until now, the European Union and the other parties have explained and confirmed their priorities on the different aspects, in particular the type of instrument, its scope and definitions, the marking and tracing of small arms and ammunition, registration and international cooperation. The European Union notes the progress made at these talks, while regretting that the participating states remain divided on the two big issues of the type of instrument and the inclusion of ammunition.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union itself is working to see the adoption of a legally binding instrument to complement the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms. It is also insisting that this instrument should include suitable provisions on ammunition. After all, only a steady supply of ammunition enables illicit small arms and light weapons to continue to wreak havoc. If we can prevent trafficking in ammunition, however, we will be able to silence the weapons themselves. If the working group reaches a positive outcome at its final session in June 2005, the EU will do all it can to see that the instrument comes into force quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is also very active in this field, both internally and through its bilateral aid to third countries. In the EU itself, the Council adopted the Code of Conduct on Conventional Arms Exports in 1998. This makes for improved exchanges of information between Member States and strengthens mutual understanding of their export control policies, including requirements for an end-user certificate or appropriate documents or a form of official authorisation issued by the country of final destination, which must be meticulously checked. As you know, the code of conduct is currently being revised; it will cover virtually all activities closely or remotely connected with arms transfers. So far as assistance to third countries is concerned, following a few limited common actions, in 2002 the European Union adopted a common action and on that basis launched specific actions involving projects for the collection and destruction of weapons in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Balkans. In the matter of those weapons, the Council is willing to report to this House periodically and to work closely with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the renewed attention being paid to this issue and we are looking forward impatiently to taking part in the biennial meeting of States to be held in New York in July 2005. We are very grateful to the European Parliament for taking the initiative of drawing attention to this forthcoming event. The Commission will be studying the proposals made in the Parliamentary resolutions very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise that the build-up and spread of these weapons aggravates conflicts, feeds terrorism, hampers reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of conflicts and reduces the prospects for sustainable development. It is therefore essential that we tackle these questions through multinational partnerships combining preventive and responsive measures and it is also essential that we use the United Nations instruments to that end. The effectiveness of the fight against the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons depends on communication and cooperation between states.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission favours a multilateral approach and has committed a number of its services to different projects in this area. It is important to stress that, if an answer is to be found to this problem, action must be taken in several directions, ranging from development aid proper to reform of the security sector, by way of the actual destruction of these weapons. Some of these areas are matters of Community competence, others unfortunately are not.</p>
<p class="contents">In its violent conflict prevention programme, the European Union recognises that by endeavouring to eliminate small arms as a source of destabilisation and conflict it would make a major contribution to preventing renewed acts of violence. The European Union is trying to achieve this through international cooperation, financial and technical assistance programmes and effective arms control. Through the European Development Fund, the Commission is financing a number of actions involving the demobilisation of ex-combatants and their reintegration into society and the collection and destruction of these arms.</p>
<p class="contents">In a very large number of cases, these actions are implemented through specific demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration programmes. In other cases, however, the reintegration of ex-combatants has been included in broader programmes for the development or rehabilitation of post-conflict areas. These programmes seek to bring about an overall improvement in the economic and social structures of the areas affected by a conflict by helping to reintegrate former combatants and their families into civilian life.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of questions relating to the cross-border transfer of these weapons are currently being examined for next year’s conference. In particular, a treaty on the arms trade is being discussed. The Commission will be actively involved in the debate on these subjects that will be held in the Council. It would be premature to discuss these points in detail at present, since some of them will have to be examined in depth by several commissioners. The European Union has also on several occasions called for legally binding instruments on arms brokering and the marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons at the United Nations conference and the follow-up meetings on the illicit trade in small arms in 2001 and 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all agreed that small arms have to be prevented from getting into the wrong hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Europe, in the European Union, the state has a monopoly on the use of armed force, and that is of enormous benefit. Circumstances here are different from those in the United States, where this is not understood in the same way. What that means is that the use of small arms is reserved to soldiers and police officers, with special arrangements being made for those engaged in hunting and in shooting as a sport. It is vitally important that every single weapon here in this European Union of ours is actually registered, or in other words that its origin is known.</p>
<p class="contents">A problem arises when these weapons find their way into countries outside the European Union, and this is what makes it so important that the code of conduct on the export of arms, as it stands at present, should be further tightened up and that we prevent, in so far as possible, at least the supply of weapons to the trouble spots where, in fact, this extraordinary number of people are killed. To do so will involve developing a tracking system, in which every single purchase or sale of such weapons is recorded by being entered in an international register, thus making it possible to trace a specific weapon back to its origin and to its manufacturer, and to determine who was responsible for it being sold and who for it being passed on. For this, international agreements are needed, and that is what makes it especially important that we, in this House, should play our part in actually taking these projects – set in motion by the United Nations – further and bringing them to a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in Europe’s interest to limit small arms for our own security, to protect foreign investment and to promote development. That means integrating small arms into Europe’s security development and governance programmes. It is not simply a question of supporting ad hoc disarmament, demobilisation and reconstruction programmes as part of our crisis management response, we have to mainstream this into broader development assistance programmes and include it in our political dialogue with all other countries and regions worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">As a follow-up to the EU security strategy, it means developing a comprehensive EU disarmament and arms control strategy. This should integrate with civil society initiatives, just as NGOs should be able to contribute actively to the UN biannual meeting of states in July.</p>
<p class="contents">It means, as we say in the resolution, new impetus for the UN consultations on combating illicit brokering. Here in the EU, our Member States have only to consider applying these controls to our citizens operating outside of the European Union. Yet these brokers deliberately travel overseas to ply their trade. I would have liked, this afternoon, to have heard a commitment from the Luxembourg presidency to strengthen the common position to make it mandatory to control EU nationals involved in arms brokering, wherever they are based.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it means limiting the supply of arms overall. Action by the EU to control the proliferation of small arms in fragile states is undermined by our role as major arms exporters. Good as the EU code of conduct is, strengthened as it must be, German armaments used in Burma arrive there only because they were exported via Ukraine, which is not bound by our EU rules. It shows why regional agreements alone are not enough. That is why I welcome the commitment from my own government in the United Kingdom and from the Finnish Government, as well as the recommendation of the High Level Panel of the United Nations to champion an international arms trade treaty. Arms transfers must be subject to legal controls, not just in the EU, but across the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because today, as has been pointed out, these are the real weapons of mass destruction, not just because of the millions of victims they cause every year, but because of their social and political consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of control of pistols, revolvers, assault rifles, grenades, machine guns and similar weapons has had dramatic consequences for the security and integrity of millions of people throughout the world. In some countries, such as Brazil, Colombia or El Salvador, it is estimated that violence involving this type of weapon is responsible for the loss of 10% of gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of civil society and in particular the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), in July 2001 the United Nations held a conference in New York during which an action programme was adopted to prevent, combat and eliminate every aspect of the illegal trade in small and light arms. Next July, the governments of the Member States of the United Nations will meet again in New York for the bi-annual meeting on the implementation of this action plan, and the review conference is scheduled for a year later.</p>
<p class="contents">The action programme urges the governments to control the production and sale of this type of weapon, to mark pistols in order to facilitate their identification once they have been sold, to penalise the production and possession of illegal weapons, to identify and destroy surplus weapons and to establish final use certificates for export and transit, amongst other measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2001, considerable progress has been made, particularly in the field of national legislations. It is still necessary, however, to develop and implement general recommendations. Within this context, the European Union and its Member States must continue to lead the debate. The current process of reviewing the code of conduct offers a good opportunity to do so. </p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, in general terms, I am optimistic, especially since the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, not just today, but on other occasions, has insisted on the need to go further and urge the governments to produce a legally binding text on brokering and transfers of small arms. Nevertheless, other data makes me a little more wary, such as, for example, the fact that few European Union countries have expressed support for the establishment of an international treaty on the arms trade. So far, only Finland and the United Kingdom have expressed firm support for the idea, although Spain has also made comments in this regard, and we would therefore like more details to be provided. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is urgent that we provide real impetus for the establishment of an international treaty on the trade in weapons which should be possible immediately after the review conference on the United Nations action plan in July 2006. This is not just necessary, but clearly of vital importance.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Businesses are manufacturing them, brokers are putting them on sale, governments and individuals are buying and selling them and people are dying: at the rate of one a minute. With those words Amnesty International has recently launched the Marking and Tracing project, a treaty under which States undertake to adopt measures for identifying all weapons and ammunition with a serial number that cannot be falsified nor destroyed. This represents a necessary step in preventing the illegal trade in arms. For as long as arms remain unidentifiable, States and businesses will always deny responsibility for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should actively support this campaign. From 1999 to 2003, Italy, for instance, as the second most important small arms manufacturer in the world and the first at European level, sold, in defiance of legislative decrees, EUR 36 million of arms to countries involved in armed conflicts, EUR 3.6 million to nations under embargo and EUR 128 million to countries condemned for human rights violations. On the other hand, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council control 88% of the global market in arms.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, it is essential that the European Union adopts the treaty on arms brokering drafted by a group of NGOs and Nobel prize winners, and launches a convention on arms brokers that, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, makes any activity with the aim of transferring arms between third parties subject to state authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must improve its code of conduct on the transfer of arms, clarifying the circumstances in which it is possible to refuse an authorisation to export arms, extending checks to all military equipment, forcing individual States to bring in legislation in compliance with the code of conduct and to publish an annual report on their respective arms exports.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot forget that it is precisely small arms that are responsible for nearly the entire sum of deaths in conflicts taking place across our world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This commitment — which we all have an interest in making — is demonstrated by two areas of work: firstly, to put an end to the lack of control of the arms trade and, in this regard, we must insist on the need for mechanisms allowing for control from the point at which the weapon is manufactured until the point it is used, that is to say, we must achieve international control. Secondly, it is fundamental and very important — as other Members have said — that we prepare the conditions to ensure that at the 2006 meeting we can make progress and achieve a genuine international treaty to regulate every aspect of the arms trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans must continue to offer an example. It is very important that, in the debate we are holding on the code of conduct, we ensure firstly that it become more restrictive and, above all, binding on every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">If we all work in this direction, I believe that Europe will be able to make a modest contribution to putting an effective end to this lack of control, which leads to the majority of the suffering of many populations and to many territorial conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, therefore, very much hope that we can combine our wills in this way so that, within no more than two years, we can put an end to this scourge of humanity.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are fairly readily available on the market at relatively low cost, and are far too often an obstacle to sustainable development and reconstruction processes. It is right that we should examine our own consciences, for in my own country, important arms exports have been set up to conflict areas in the past. Commissioner Michel is well placed to give you a full account and his assessment. Let me remind you of the supply of arms to Nepal or the Democratic Republic of Congo where, since August 1998, more than three million people have been killed. The President-in-Office, Mr Schmit, talked about cutting off the arms supplies. That is why the Tanzanian project and the construction of an arms factory deserve our undivided attention. This project must be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">I would repeat with great emphasis the political request made by fellow Members to the Presidency-in-Office to ensure that a political pledge is made that an international treaty on the trade in conventional weapons is drafted. This treaty on arms trade should come about with the support of the 25 Member States without delay, if at all possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, the strengthening of the control mechanisms within the European Union itself to make it easier to trace the route taken by arms, since this information helps us to uncover, spotlight and identify the existing and growing export trade in this type of arms. Secondly, the idea of an international treaty. There are in fact a number of exporters sending large quantities of small arms to all parts of the world, and those exporters are not necessarily Member States of the European Union. Some industrialising countries have in fact become exporters in this field, and the only way of effectively controlling exports of this kind, which underlie the regional conflicts to which several speakers have alluded, is to have much stronger international commitments and also a sounder and more effective system of control.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must in my opinion take the initiative with such a treaty and support the Secretary-General’s efforts to that end, because we want to play a part there. As someone has said, and Mr Michel knows this, we want successfully to conduct a peace mission across part of Africa in particular, and peace will only have a chance if we can manage to break the supply lines for such weapons, since they are often the weapons of the developing countries, the weapons of the poor. As I said, they often put weapons into the hands of child soldiers, and that is one of the most horrible things you can imagine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that preventing the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is a European Union priority objective. Equally obviously, it must also be a priority objective of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly regrettable that the European code of conduct is not binding. At any rate, it is not binding in every country, and I can tell you from personal experience that it only takes one country to refuse an export licence and other European countries are quick to present themselves as candidates to fill the unplaced order. We should not deceive ourselves. In my country, for example, the law now makes provision for this scenario, and there is normally a requirement, but obviously it needs to become the norm. Also, even if we had a binding code, that does not mean that the European Union’s outside competitors would abide by it. Having said that, I am of course the first to want to make such a code mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three considerations I would like to mention. First, traceability is a very important aspect, since it enables us to trace back the entire route the arm has taken. I would also like to draw your attention to a new perspective that may be interesting. Research is being carried out in Europe today, not only to ensure that the arm can be traced, but even to disable it remotely. Research in this area is already well advanced and I believe we should support initiatives of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention a number of projects and actions being conducted by several of our Member States. Some of them, for example, are suggesting to populations who own weapons and are prepared to hand them in that they might exchange those weapons for bicycles. I can tell you that this is the kind of action we should also be encouraging in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Another consideration is this. I am quite familiar with the African problem and I can assure you that it is not the European Union that is supplying the largest number of small arms to Africa. I accept that we must show the way and that we must even beat our breasts from time to time, but all the same we should not end up believing that all those arms came from the European Union. Most of those arms do not come from the European Union, they come from other countries and in particular from the unused leftovers of certain armies. I could name some countries, but I will not. But it is obvious that some know, and that they know very well, whom I am talking about. That is therefore nevertheless a very important factor.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the treaty on the arms trade, which introduces compulsory national-based approvals for all international arms transfers and puts in place effective machinery for permits and licences, we do of course support such measures and I hope that in a few months’ time we will have made that kind of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The explicit restrictions on arms transfers where there is a breach of obligations under international law, in the case, for example, of breaches of UN arms embargos, of customary law, of international treaties between the contracting parties or where there is a failure to observe international prohibitions on certain weapons, such as anti-personnel land mines, the restrictions, too, on transfers based on use where, for example, it is brought to a contracting party’s notice that the arms being transferred are likely to be used in complete violation of international humanitarian law or of human rights for the commission of genocide or crimes against humanity. These restrictions are all manifestly important aspects of this treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the present text remains very vague in a number of areas. Its main purpose is to get a sufficient number of governments to agree on the principle of an international legal instrument on arms transfers. The NGOs are trying to create some momentum around the idea of a treaty before tackling the details. The treaty has been conceived as a framework convention that may be added to by protocols concerning, among other things, arms brokering or manufacture under licence. As always in such cases, however, maximum pressure will be required to get all states to subscribe to it, because if it is always the same States which subscribe and the same other States which do not, discouragement is bound to set in.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, given that reference has been made to my personal experience, I would like to end by saying that it is sometimes difficult to judge whether an arms export licence should be granted or not. In fact, in some cases, Mr Staes, where, for example, the army or police of a country that is perhaps not necessarily a democracy asks for access to arms or to buy them and that same government, that same country, is faced with really very dangerous rebels who, for example, make use of human shields when attacking police stations or schools, it is extremely difficult, as a responsible politician, to make a choice. What I am really trying to say is that you never have the choice between a good and a bad solution, you always have the choice between two bad solutions. I do know what you are referring to and I can assure you, to answer your question, that if I had my time over again I would take exactly the same decision, because in my heart of hearts I do believe that was the decision I had to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
