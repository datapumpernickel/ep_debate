If incineration can be carried out with strict emission requirements and the efficient use of energy, then the incineration of waste represents a satisfactory means of disposal. We are using a resource that is virtually comparable with a biofuel, and thereby helping to combat global warming. And compared with the dumping of waste, we can also help to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas methane.</p>
<p class="contents">As is pointed out in the report, it is obviously very much better to sort and recycle or reuse waste. However, it is important for there to be careful studies of what is best for the environment, since research of this kind often shows that, in spite of everything, incineration can be the best alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, the manufacture of pulp has traditionally used wood residues for burning in the manufacturing process. In my opinion, this particular use should be exempted from the rules governing the incineration of waste. It forms part of an industrial process for which such rules are not really appropriate.</p>

I have just one minute"s speaking time, so I will confine myself to one specific point, namely the requirements which a new incineration plant has to meet. I think it is important that new incineration plants must be kept a minimum distance away from densely populated areas, and I have tabled an amendment suggesting a minimum of two kilometres.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country we face the proposed plant at Drogenbos near Brussels. The limits for particulates and cadmium have already been exceeded, and still the government has given the green light to construction of what will be a new source of pollution. The Commission has already brought an action against Belgium for infringement of the directive on environmental impact assessment. My country"s policy on incineration plants is anything but exemplary. Proceedings are also under way on irregularities in the implementation of existing directives on incinerators.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this debate as an opportunity of asking the Commissioner firstly how these infringements are being dealt with, but above all how things stand with the complaints about Drogenbos. I should be grateful if the Commissioner could provide some answers to these questions today or, failing that, as swiftly as possible.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Madam President, I do not support the integration of the two directives – namely on municipal waste, waste oil, solvents and clinical waste, as well as other non‐hazardous waste – into one composite European piece of legislation. Agreeing to the integration of the two directives would amount to allowing hazardous waste to be burnt in plants intended for household waste, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">For more than 20 years European policy in respect of waste management has been based on the principle of treating hazardous industrial waste and household and similar waste in a different way. Each category of waste should be subject to treatment which is specific to it. From an Irish perspective, we generate over 42 million tonnes of waste each year. In the light of Ireland's strong economic growth, we must ensure that resources are invested in alternative waste‐management schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of waste disposal must not and cannot lie in the continued search for more landfill up and down the length and breadth of our country. Investment in a clean environment in my country will in the medium to long term justify any additional expenditure incurred and the European Union will support any innovative measures in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government is presently putting together a national development plan outlining our economic and social investment priorities for the seven‐year period post−1999. Included in this plan must be a comprehensive and integrated proposal that deals with the issue of eliminating the use of landfill sites in Ireland in the medium to long term. The facts speak for themselves in this regard: only 8 % of all municipal waste is recycled in my country. This figure is simply too low. The cost of disposal of this waste would drain the resources of our local authorities in terms of landfill sites, transport and manpower, and there is also the loss to the economy of the valuable materials which were dumped. For example, it is estimated that over 70 million polyester bottles are sold in Ireland each year and the improper disposal of even a very small proportion of these could make a significant contribution to environmental litter. Recycling rates for polyester bottles of up to 70 % have been achieved in Germany and the Netherlands to date. Recycling saves on energy, raw materials, waste‐disposal costs, import bills and the need for landfill sites. As a people we need to develop a recycling mentality, which is now commonplace in all the European Union Member States.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Madam President, it is very regrettable that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has voted to allow even higher levels of dioxins than the Commission had proposed, when you consider that dioxins are one of the most toxic substances known to man. In a number of cases, women who live near incinerators were told not to breast‐feed their babies because of the amount of dioxins in their breast milk. It is an extremely dangerous situation that we have here. The Greens want to see a lot of improvement on this report before it is accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The last speaker is a member of a political party in Ireland that is in government. They have done nothing about the waste problem in Ireland. Until now they have landfilled massive amounts of waste; basically, pushed it away so that it would not be seen. Now they are talking about incineration. It is clear that incineration of waste is not the solution. They are not coming up with ways of reducing the amount of waste: separating, reusing, recycling. Incineration means you have to encourage waste production to make it viable. It does not mean that you get rid of waste. You are incinerating it but it does not vanish into thin air without any consequences. You have serious dioxin emissions. You also have extremely toxic ash left afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government really needs to get its act together. Incineration is not the way to deal with our waste, as landfill was not the way in the past. We have to look at the real options of dealing with waste: reduction, reuse, recycle. Unless the Irish Government does that it is only going to encourage more production of waste to keep the incinerators viable. That is not acceptable to the public in Ireland.</p>

On the one hand, we have endless discussions about the competitive disadvantages that result for industry, particularly for the disposal industry. On the other hand, it is exceptionally difficult to revise the limit values for highly toxic substances downwards. Yet some countries, including Austria, have proved that it can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland"s excellent report is certainly a corrective to the Commission"s draft. In future, however, we will have no choice but to get involved in the basic discussion on the design of all production processes from the manufacture of a product to its final disposal. The closest attention must be paid to ensuring that any products and resulting compounds whose disposal can have serious consequences, particularly illnesses, cannot be produced or put on the market in the first place.</p>

I would nevertheless like to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report and particularly on the patience he has shown, given that both these reports were in committee for a long time. I also believe that we still need waste incineration plants because we are still a long way from a circulation economy in which everything that is produced can be recycled or buried underground. If we need such plants we must ensure that they affect our health as little as possible and that they protect the environment as much as possible. For this reason I also believe that it is necessary to have more stringent limit values for emissions and to bring the limit values for the various types of incineration closer into line with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we can expect someone living near a co‐incineration plant to put up with different air quality than someone living near a municipal incineration plant or someone who does not live near an incineration plant. So we must look to improve the values here. I tried in committee to take a step in this direction by means of a number of amendments. I would also like to comment on the combining of the two directives, which I believe is right and for which I would like to express my support. In my view the fact that the same limit values apply for the incineration of hazardous and non‐hazardous waste is not a step backwards in environmental terms; on the contrary, I believe that it makes the values for municipal waste incineration plants more stringent. I also believe that it may make it possible to change the way in which hazardous waste is transported in small countries such as mine, where waste from Bregenz, which is closer to Paris than to Vienna, has to be brought to Vienna. I would welcome that.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Porto </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, the initiative now before us concerns a subject which raises particular passions in Portugal. We have with reason seen a very negative reaction in our country to the attempt by the Portuguese Government to allow two major national cement companies to co‐incinerate toxic waste.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can be unaware of the need to solve the current problem. However, this cannot be solved at any price as it is essential to have a process which is 100 % safe and correct, both technically and legally.</p>
<p class="contents">To a certain extent which the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, is trying to determine, we must aim first of all to prevent, reuse and recycle waste, as other Members have said.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that some waste still needs to be incinerated and the use of existing installations is only permitted if there is an absolute guarantee that human health is not at risk. This safeguard must be particularly borne in mind in the case of cement kilns. This is why we are fully supporting Amendment No 36 which rightly requires more than the Commission"s proposal in Annex II.1.1.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also not acceptable, as underlined by the rapporteur, that some countries have less stringent regulations and therefore attract waste from other countries. This is currently the situation with the cement works in Belgium which attract waste from Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. This would have been the case with Portugal in relation to Spain if the Portuguese Government"s initiative to encourage the national cement works to also burn the waste of their neighbouring country had gone ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The following amendments, for example, must also be applauded: Amendment No 25 which deletes the provision that continuous measuring may be authorised instead of periodic measurements, and Amendment No 30 which specifies a more stringent requirement in Article 12 on the provision of information to the public on possible damage. However, having said this, we must be particularly careful to ensure compliance with competition rules, perhaps by using rules with this specific aim, so that highly profitable contracts are not awarded without the necessary transparency, as has happened before.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is any doubt about the danger of co‐incineration – its effects are difficult to identify and only perhaps become apparent in the long term – we must ensure that the waste is incinerated in special incinerators, away from any population centres, as has just been said. Although these incinerators are expensive, their price is justified. They could be set up as joint ventures between neighbouring countries in order to share the costs. This must happen in the Iberian Peninsula, in view of the scope provided by Portugal and Spain.</p>

However, mixing the two categories of waste creates great confusion, prevents hazardous waste from being traceable, and makes it very difficult to monitor and carry out controls, and we know that the processes for certain types of hazardous waste are highly specialised. In addition, it leads to serious risks for the quality of the environment and safety. Indeed, in Europe we have already witnessed the catastrophic effects of mixing hazardous waste and household refuse in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason why we are against merging these two directives is that we do not believe that the protection of the environment has been the prevailing concern, but rather an economic interest. The overcapacity of the kilns for household refuse in some countries tends to encourage these countries to allow household refuse to be mixed with hazardous waste. We might therefore end up in a situation where hazardous waste will be processed as cheaply as possible, under conditions where it is not properly controlled, and where the transfer of waste within the European Union increases with all the risks that this entails.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, it seems to me that this is a step backwards in relation to the precautionary principle and the Union"s environmental practice. While we congratulate Mr Blokland on persevering in his efforts to convince Members, we cannot agree to the merger of the two directives.</p>

<p class="contents">I believe we all agree that there must be stringent guidelines for limit values for waste incineration. However, a number of amendments pursue very ambitious objectives that I cannot support, as we must realise that they involve huge costs. That would in turn create a new incentive – with record cases of avoidance and criminal offences – because waste disposal would then be extremely expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment further on the issue of the different types of waste. In this area too we have witnessed significant abuse in the past because we did not have a uniform definition of waste, and because of the different definitions we were constantly faced with cases of avoidance. In this respect I must say that in my view the idea of combining the two directives into one is not bad because it is much easier to work with one law than to have to comply with two different laws, and because it different rules and different interpretations. In other words, I am in favour of a single directive but I am not in favour of all the strict guidelines that have been suggested, as these are not feasible. On the other hand, it is high time that we had a clear policy on waste disposal, and I believe that we have created a good basis for this. I am keen to see the outcome of tomorrow"s vote, and I am also interested to know the Commissioner"s views on the various amendments.</p>

I have just one observation to make. Parliament has, quite rightly, presented its own addition to the Commission"s proposal, stating that the directive should seek to impact on the common aim and hierarchical structure for European policy on waste: waste prevention, recycling and reuse, and its exploitation as an energy source. However, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has approved the suggestion that untreated wood should not come within the scope of this directive, from which people might get the idea that it is only ‘virgin" wood that is being referred to, but we would not even be able to burn or exploit sawdust or chips. In my opinion, however, this is good quality biofuel, and there should be no sort of restriction on its use.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Howitt </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, let me be clear: I support new regulation on incinerators tonight, not simply to protect people living nearby from suffering from the cancers and the birth defects which British and Japanese research have demonstrated, but to shift the economic balance towards recycling and reuse.</p>
<p class="contents">In Basildon, Braintree, Chelmsford, Colchester, Epping Forest and Rochford, our county council in Essex currently plans eight new major waste facilities, including incinerators, over‐providing by some six times local waste generated, according to Friends of the Earth. This is lunacy! It consigns Essex to remain the waste‐tip for London, it underestimates the potential for recycling by half, it threatens areas of natural beauty close to people's homes and to schools and sites of historic interest. It is predicated on landfill at full capacity in ten years, whereas district councils project some thirty. Like every major incinerator proposal it sends up in smoke not just the waste but the prospect of small recycling centres and the jobs with which they are associated.</p>
<p class="contents">In France the Ministry of Environment surveyed incinerator emissions last year and closed a number of its facilities. Denmark too is switching from incineration to recycling. America estimates that the greenhouse effect of a one per cent increase in recycling is equivalent to taking one million cars off the road. Europe can and should follow suit. Tonight's resolution, by regulating the incinerator, relegates it to the option of last resort, and gives hope to 10 000 individual people who have submitted objections in Essex.</p>

<p class="contents">I have been quite amazed by the amount of time this Parliament has spent over the years on the issue of waste incineration. I go back to the times when we looked at this directive in the first place. But in the end we have come up with something which is equitable, sensible and just. We are going to impose tighter Commission limits on municipal waste because we recognise that when it is burned it is as dangerous as hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to continue to ensure that there are additional requirements upon dangerous or hazardous waste disposal because it poses risks over and above that posed by municipal waste in terms of handling and other controls.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take care to ensure that where co‐incineration is proposed, it is used correctly and not abused or used covertly. We must accept that there are some forms of hazardous waste that can be well disposed of in cement kilns and that is where it should go, but under the strictest of controls.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that co‐incineration does not undermine the economics of the industry and essentially stop the working, or close down the working, of dedicated hazardous waste incinerators whose use is absolutely essential for some forms of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">I would again like to thank Mr Blokland for the work he has done. The Socialist Group will be supporting the vast majority of his amendments. The combination of the two texts make sense. We look forward to a successful second reading in Parliament after the elections.</p>

We also believe that it would be worthwhile if Europe provided more assistance to the countries or local authorities that have been making great efforts over the last few years to reduce the dangerous nature of incineration. For this reason, we cannot support the co‐incineration of household and hazardous or industrial waste. We feel that there are still too many uncertainties and that we must continue to carry out studies in this area. Otherwise, some of our local authorities might end up with catastrophes if household and industrial waste are mixed in incinerators destined solely for household waste.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Madam President, the Commission would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment and in particular its rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for the efforts they have made and for the attention to detail with which the committee, and especially the rapporteur, have dealt with this very technical proposal. The Commission has worked hard to be able to present a balanced proposal which can achieve a high level of protection for the environment and human health, while at the same time taking into account the special needs of incineration plants and co‐incineration. The combining of the two directives on incineration has been a very important point in the debate here this evening, and the report also quite rightly focuses on that. From the Commission's point of view, the combining is a good thing because it satisfies the general demand for streamlined EU legislation. I can therefore also say that I do not agree with the comments made by Mr Cabrol and Mrs Lienemann here today. Neither the Commission's proposal nor Directive 94/67 contains any provision which prevents co‐incineration of hazardous and non‐hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore able to accept the amendments which Mr Blokland and Mr Eisma in particular underlined as important for their positions. These are Amendments Nos 7, 9, 15, 18, 19, 24, 50, 56, 60 and 61, which we accept either in part, in principle or in full. In addition to what the report says about the combining of Directive 94/67 and the Commission's proposal, we consider it necessary to introduce a transition period for existing plants for the incineration of hazardous waste, in accordance with Article 14 of Directive 94/67. Parliament's Amendments Nos 8, 14, 23 and 55, which are aimed at including certain questions of waste management, are unacceptable on grounds of principle. The aim of the Commission's proposal is to set emission limit values and operating conditions for all waste which is incinerated or co‐incinerated, and not to interfere with the rules on waste management. However, it is important that the recitals draw attention to the fact that incineration is only one of the ways in which waste can be treated. The same applies to some of the comments which have been made here this evening, in other words that the Community has both specific and general rules for waste treatment. We are therefore unable to accept Amendment No 1 for reasons of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 16, 17, 21 and 22, which seek to introduce provisions on quality standards for air and water. For this we already have legislation either in existence or under preparation, such as the IPPC directive or the proposal for a framework directive on water. The proposed amendments would simply duplicate or encroach on these documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are Amendments Nos 36, 37 and 43, which are aimed at changing the emission limit values which the Commission has proposed for co‐incineration. This is unacceptable, because the values the Commission has proposed are based on cost‐benefit analyses and take into account the special characteristics of the various processes. The Commission believes that the Member States and the operators concerned should have a certain amount of flexibility with regard to the recovery of heat. It would not be realistic to demand that the heat produced by incineration should always be recovered. This would be impossible for incineration plants in remote areas, for example. Therefore we do not accept Amendments Nos 13 and 20.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept in part, in principle or in full Amendments Nos 4, 10, 19, 24, 28, 33, 35, 56, 59 and 64, which we think clarify the Commission's intentions and otherwise improve the quality of the document. For technical reasons, we have to reject a number of other amendments, including Amendments Nos 3, 6, 11, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32, 34, 38 to 41, 44 to 49, 51 to 54, 57, 58, 62, 63 and 65 to 71. I received a specific question from Mrs Kestelijn‐Sierens about Drogenbos. I can say that three months ago we sent a letter of formal notice concerning the EIA directive. We have sought a reply to this letter and in the course of this week, during which the matter will be discussed in the Commission, we shall be proposing an additional letter of formal notice because the Flemish authorities issued planning permission after we had sent our letter.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me therefore conclude by saying that the Commission thinks that the proposal being dealt with here today, strengthened by the inclusion of those of Parliament"s amendments which I have said that we accept, forms an effective and balanced basis for the control of incineration plants and co‐incineration. I am very pleased with the role which Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, have played by taking the initiative to propose that certain existing legal requirements should be integrated into the Commission's proposal, thereby taking account of the general need for more streamlined legislation.</p>
