<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Turmes (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, what is the purpose of a directive on renewable forms of energy, or an own-initiative report from Parliament? I think we must place this report, and also the directive which is in the pipeline, in the context of the European Union’s energy policy with its three objectives of competitive pricing, security of supply and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 29 February 2000, we have had a common electricity market but, regrettably, still with considerable distortions of competition which still, unfortunately, work to the disadvantage of both renewable energy cogeneration and energy management and the forms of energy of the future. The reasons for this are energy prices which do not incorporate the external costs, with the sizeable subsidies which are still available to the nuclear sector as well as the fossil-fuel sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive which is currently being prepared should, in my opinion, have two objectives. Firstly, the current imperfect market must be adjusted as necessary in order to protect the still tender shoots of the plant which is renewable energy, and also to lay the foundations for renewable energies so that they head in the direction that they need to before the year 2030 or 2040, when they must be capable of providing the greater part of the European Community energy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">We have many reasons to move in this direction. Firstly, the protection of the environment, but also the creation of jobs. We have studies, backed up with figures, to show that renewable energies create more jobs than conventional forms of energy. We know that we must make Europe ready for a world renewable energy market and there are also geostrategic advantages to our reducing our dependence on regions which are often in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">What must the cornerstones of this forthcoming directive be? It must, in the first place, be based on the Treaty articles relating to both the internal market and the environment. It must have ambitious, clearly defined objectives at European level in the order of those given in the Commission White Paper, i.e. 12% for energy and 23% for electricity. After setting these objectives at the European level, there must be ‘burden sharing’ negotiations between the Commission and the Member States in order for reciprocal agreement to be reached on the specific national objectives which, when added together, will combine to form the European objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the instruments to be implemented, my report advocates subsidiarity. I believe it is too early to pass judgement on the various instruments that can be classified. On the one hand, there are the fixed-price systems which have launched the renewable energy industry in Europe. On the other hand, there are the trading systems which have just been created in the Netherlands and Denmark, where there are still many administrative and technical problems to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore propose that the Commission makes an assessment of the various instruments in 2005, and that, until that date, subsidiarity should be maintained and the Commission should refrain from regulating subsidies to the renewable sector. I would argue that it is pointless to make cuts in subsidies to the renewable sector when there are much larger subsidies going to the nuclear and fossil-fuel sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one last point which I wish to put forward, namely the need for a system for labelling and providing information on all forms of electricity. In an internal market, the consumer should be informed, and this information should be provided for every form of energy, not just green electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all the people who contributed to this report, which is the result of a real team effort, and I await their comments with interest.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have what are <span class="italic">per se </span>excellent basic documents in the field of renewable energy sources, such as the White Paper referred to, which contains a brilliant critical analysis. But, on balance, everyone is in favour. Everyone says yes, we need these new sources of energy. They are a fundamental component of the 21st century, of the 21st century way of thinking. But everyone has slightly different ideas and, as a result, we often fail to find a standard line which will allow us to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that we tend to polarise, and that causes problems. On the one hand, we say, there are the advocates of renewable energy sources, ecologically-minded, forward-looking people. On the other hand, there are the energy suppliers, oil traders and oil producers, who want exactly the opposite. All we are doing is fanning the flames of enmity. I think we should put this enmity behind us and acknowledge that these renewable sources of energy only have one enemy. That enemy is our ignorance of the fantastic opportunities which they offer us.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there are ecological advantages and, secondly, there are job opportunities. Thirdly, I think that whatever we invest in this area is neither subsidy nor promotion but sensible investment from a national economic point of view. We must recognise that. Fourthly, we must bear in mind that sources of fossil fuels have been accompanied recently by price fluctuations ranging from 10 to 30 dollars a barrel. Fifthly, more and more studies are implying that actual sources of fossil fuels are much smaller than we perceive them to be today. Sixthly, we are conducting discussions throughout the world – and we can see this happening from Chechnya via the Gulf to Africa – about earth’s remaining resources.</p>
<p class="contents">If we now recognise that you are also a bringer of peace, then we will probably have made a huge step if we accept this report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mombaur (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has basically been in agreement on this question since 1996. It was Parliament, may I remind you, which had to push the previous Commission in the direction of this policy. It did not start with the White Paper, but with an initiative by Parliament, and I remember because I was the rapporteur at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a much higher proportion of primary energy used. We have already come a long way, but not far enough by a long chalk. We need it for climatic reasons and for industrial policy reasons, because there is a global market to fill here. In this respect, I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of the committee and note that, consequently, 80% of the resolutions tabled are therefore uncontested. For the rest, an aside: everyone still here this evening must have not renewable sources of energy but an inexhaustible supply of energy! We are represented in accordance with the subject matter!</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I note that the report contains a number of statements which are incorrect, which violate the Treaty or which are politically untenable. For example, elevating the feed-in system to a universal panacea is wrong. It is true, of course, that the countries with feed-in systems have made a great deal of progress, but that is not on account of the feed-in system but because of the financing which is in place there. We must make a distinction between these causes. As a result, we and the Commission are of the opinion that the Member States should now be allowed to experiment. It is too early to see one system as a universal panacea and dismiss another.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report also contradicts the Treaty at certain points. This applies in particular to the statements on aid policy. It is true that renewable energy needs aid now, and probably will for some time to come, in order to get started. That is quite right and it complies with the Treaty. But it is certainly not right to give them the same aid as all other forms of energy because they make a totally different contribution to the energy mix, and it is not right to link aid for one to the lifetime of the others.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment also concerns a point at which the resolution does not comply with the Treaty. We here in the European Union cannot impose mandatory obligations on the Member States. The European Union has no legal basis and no credentials for doing so and, because of that, it cannot impose sanctions. Anyway, that is precisely what the Lisbon Council has just agreed to reject in connection with the job markets. That is why it is right to regard this as a matter of economic policy of common interest; hence the burden sharing negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, I cannot agree when there is talk of the curse of the lowest bidder. Statements like this show disdain for the consumer and disregard the principle of supply and demand. In addition, as I am sure you will understand, we cannot get excited about new forms of bureaucracy, even if it comes along in the jewel-studded cloak of an EU agency. That is why, Madam Vice-President, I have three recommendations to make to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">First: you should use your directive, the draft of which we are waiting for, to promote the use of all renewable sources of energy and, if possible, you could suggest a uniform development framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: as far as financial assistance is concerned, a distinction should be made between everyone and those who need this financial assistance. The distinction is easy to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and I consider this extremely important in the interests of investors: if a new system should replace the systems currently being tried out in Europe, either in the Member States or in the Union, it should not, of course, penalise those who have already made investments. They need permanent protection. We want both the competition and energy departments of the Commission to make a clear statement on that to the markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We certainly have no lack of reports. We have had the Mombaur report, the Rothe report, the former member, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, drafted a report, Mrs Ahern drafted a report and, if I remember correctly, I also drafted a report on this subject once. So there is no shortage of reports and they have all been translated into every possible language.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need now are initiatives to implement our decisions. We have decided that the share of renewable sources of energy should rise from 6% to 12%. At present, if I remember the figures correctly, we are not yet even quite at 6%, but at 5.4%. In any case, I am merely repeating the Commission’s figures. How can we do this? Biomass and hydroelectric power account for 95% of renewable energy sources in the European Union. Wind, solar energy, photovoltaic energy etc. only account for 5%! In other words, if we decide to double these figures and if we come up against purely physical limits with hydroelectric power, if we cannot build more large power stations as and where we please, and there is a limit to what we can do in the Alps, then we have to think of something else, for example a bridge with agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to build a bridge with agricultural policy, to enter into an alliance. If, for example, the enlargement of the European Union encompasses countries such as Poland, which have large agricultural areas and a high proportion of their population working in agriculture, most of whom will become unemployed over the next 10 or 20 years as these countries engage in intensive farming, then there is room for manoeuvre here. There is, of course, the question of how we can finance this, but at least we have technical room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as renewable sources of energy and financing them at national level is concerned, I have just a few brief comments. The systems are so different that they must, at all costs, be made compatible in the medium term, so that we can create a real European market here. Secondly, aid must be degressive. Not radically degressive perhaps, otherwise there is no end result, but it must show a downward trend in order to ensure that the best technologies are used, because there is constant technical progress even with renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I can easily imagine, and here I do not share Mr Mombaur’s view, that we may need to consider sanctions, otherwise the whole thing makes no sense. For example, we undertook at Kyoto to adhere to certain quotas. No one can be punished for failing to keep to the quotas. Had we introduced the euro like that, if no sanctions had been imposed for failing to comply with requirements, the euro would not have been a success. In the case of renewable sources of energy or the CO2 policy, nothing will be achieved in the long run without sanctions. We cannot enter into commitments willy-nilly and then fail to honour them. I keep coming back to this: without sanctions, this joint energy policy, because in the final analysis that is what it is, will not function. It is perhaps an unpleasant thought, but it will not function otherwise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Three points – firstly, the whole issue of a level playing field. It seems to us essential that if we are going to give renewable energies the breathing space and the momentum that they merit, it is right to try and aim for a level playing field. That requires, above and beyond everything else, downward pressure on the unacceptably high and legally dubious levels of subsidies which continue to flow to fossil energy sources in the European Union, notably, but not excusably, the coal industry in a number of large Member States. As long as those market distorting subsidies to fossil fuels continue we cannot realistically talk about a fair or level playing field in the European Union. In that context we join with the rapporteur in feeling that some kind of special provisions concerning subsidies are merited as long as those market distorting subsidies continue elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">On targets, I very much side with Mr Linkohr. We cannot be serious about this without trying to add teeth in some form, moral, financial or otherwise to the concept of targets. We were not very happy with the early versions from the rapporteur because we felt the targets were there to almost micro-manage the market in renewable energy sources. That is neither viable nor desirable, but a mixture of the pressure towards targets, combined with competition between effective renewable energy industries, seems to us to be the long-term approach we should all adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would make a plea on behalf of my group: let us not set up yet another agency. Paragraph 22 of this report calls for the establishment of a European sustainable energy agency. This Parliament and the European institutions have been spawning a blizzard of new agencies all over the European Union. It does not necessary help us to follow the policies which we wish to follow – it could actually have the effect of ghettoising the policy altogether. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive should be solely directed towards supporting new renewable technologies that are not yet commercially viable.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive, as some of the speakers have already said, needs to have binding targets in order for the Member States and the entire EU to achieve a significant increase in the share of renewable energies in the total energy market. I note that the Commission is proposing a review in 2005 but I would urge that you also ask the Member States to make annual reports on achieving the targets in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like the directive not to establish any ceiling or limitation on direct support mechanisms chosen by the individual Member States. It should also encourage fair and non-discriminatory network access as its most important item. The directive should also contain mechanisms to discourage, as we have already heard, the Member States from their market distorting subsidies to traditional forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels and nuclear. There are a lot of covert subsidies to the nuclear sector that have been there for a long time and that are long overdue for a considerable review if not a total ban. Attempts to say that support for renewable energy is a distortion of the market in the context of the vast subsidies for nuclear and fossil fuels that exist in the European Union are totally spurious. I hope that the Commissioner will really take that point to heart.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive should explicitly propose a system of support and advantages for the small and medium-sized companies in decentralised production and distribution of renewable energies. It should include incentives allowing the Member States to clearly support advantages for the regions, especially rural areas, in respect to labour intensive green production. Most importantly, the directive should propose mechanisms for the internalisation of external costs of traditional energy production.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would urge that it is important that some of the undertakings by Member States to include renewables in the energy mix in the electricity sector be at least equal to the total EU commitment made in the White Paper on renewable energy, as endorsed by the Council and this Parliament. I would like to make particular reference to the unsatisfactory rate of uptake in the UK, Ireland and France. Here we can clearly see from empirical studies that network access is by far the best way to achieve high percentages of renewable energy rather than the other methods that have been undertaken in those countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are serious about this, we must be prepared to make funds available for research and development in this area, both at national and European levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament recently voted to maintain and increase funding for the SAVE programme. In my own country of Ireland a total of EUR 125 million has been devoted to developing an environmentally sustainable energy sector. I am pleased that the rapporteur identifies the links between the issue of renewable energy sources and wider policy considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of an internal market in electricity should provide consumers of electricity with real choice. The introduction of an element of competition in any industry should lead to more favourable pricing for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is desirable to create a level playing field it may also be necessary to provide subsidies for certain types of energy in order to promote other objectives. Clearly the development of renewables is linked to environmental objectives as well as issues of employment, regional development and the promotion of local initiatives. I would like to see the development of small local initiatives which would strengthen rural development by the provision of, say, 20 to 30 jobs per project. Such projects should not only be open to the business sector and local groups such as small locally-based co-ops should be assisted in creating such local enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">This report states that support for renewable energy projects must not be viewed as a straightforward subsidy under the state aid rules. What is important is that Member States be allowed to continue subsidising renewable energy sources which are not yet economically viable. Apart from the obvious environmental and other benefits, this can actually be justified on competition grounds. It is clear that there are serious distortions in the energy market with many hidden subsidies to both coal and oil generated energy. It would be virtually impossible to quantify these subsidies which have been embedded in the industry over decades of generator construction.</p>
<p class="contents">We still face a significant challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto protocol while, at the same time, promoting growth within our economies. I believe that, while each Member State must work towards the 12% target of renewables, the imposition of a single binding target would not be helpful because of the great differences in the structure of the energy market between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">All I have said so far is on the positive side but, on the negative side, the report specifically calls for peat to be excluded. Peat power plants work very well indeed in my country and make an important contribution to Ireland’s energy supply. In addition to that, the report emphatically calls for the European imposition of an energy tax. I am totally opposed to this approach and I reject this taxation. Therefore, I regret to say that my final vote on this project will be seriously affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also, on everyone’s mind is the fact that supporting renewable energies is one of the most important ways of achieving effective results, particularly with regard to controlling carbon dioxide emissions and to attaining the objective proposed in the White Paper, to reach a level of 12% renewable energy by 2010. Since we are aware of this need, there is a set of relevant facts that we should consider.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it should be said that renewable energies currently have the disadvantage of being less efficient in economic terms, which means that, in the first phase, support mechanisms are needed which will make them viable from a business point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, any support mechanism that is considered must be realistic and consistent, but must, above all, fit into a stable and appropriate legal framework if it is to achieve the desired effect. In order for any action related to the development of new projects for investment in these technologies to be launched, it will require a legal basis which will ensure that the laws on which it is based are transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, renewable energies are characterised by the different situations from which the various Member States are starting, which means that any solution will have to adapt to these differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must not place too many limits on the concept of renewable energy, although it does seem reasonable to impose certain restrictions on support actions for plants whose size and performance require them.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by saying that the report by Mr Turmes, on which this House is about to vote, addresses my main concerns sufficiently. Its content provides the necessary balance for us to be able to rate it positively, but our final position will depend on the outcome with regard to certain key points.</p>

<p class="contents">The UK has a low proportion of electricity from renewable sources, I believe amongst the lowest. Yet the studies in my home region have demonstrated considerable potential for renewable projects: wind, including offshore, small hydro, landfill gas, waste incineration, biofuels and photovoltaics. It is important to have EU and national targets, but it is also important to have a European directive which will support efforts at local and regional level, where many of the decisions are actually taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, there is a need to build up an awareness amongst architects and potential customers of the technologies that are available. Support for demonstration projects should be included in any directive. Larger developments often fail to get planning permission, sometimes because of public opposition. More proactive planning guidance, preferably linked to regional renewable targets, and feasibility studies would be helpful additions to the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to the grid system at fair prices is crucial. The disincentive of high capital costs of connection to the grid from remote renewable sites and the prevention of transmission penalties are other issues which the directive should tackle. I hope that the Commission will take note of these points. I would urge support for the amendment to assist the promotion of renewables in the remote islands of the Community. I am sure that this was an oversight in the drafting of the text. I have to say that the British Labour Members will vote against the exclusion of waste incineration from the definition of renewables, on the understanding that this refers to material which cannot be recycled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This aim is clearly visible in the Commission’s preparatory act. In his report, Mr Turmes, does not in all respects advocate the same way of thinking, however. The report does contain many good ideas. The recorded aim of the Commission with regard to the promotion of renewables obviously has to be supported. We really do have to invest in research into energy sources. However, we must remember that a free energy market will have to be based in the future on viable, free competition, and not on favouring renewable energy sources by discriminating against the others. All forms of electric power must have free access to the market. The harmonisation of taxation and aid schemes is a different matter. Electricity producers must be able to determine the prices at which they wish to sell. If the Union starts messing about with the burgeoning electricity markets, for example, by imposing rules controlling the electrical supply, or with guarantees of minimum prices or quotas, we can say goodbye to the free market. Renewables can be made more competitive by increasing consumer choice. In this respect the certification of electricity is an idea to be supported. If we wish to pay more for electricity produced from wind power than from other sources, for example, then we should be allowed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">To no good purpose, the report tries to define renewable energy by raising the question of peat as a special area. The position with regard to peat cannot be determined according to the same standards as biogases, for example. For that reason, peat must occupy its own energy class in future, so that its taxation can be determined on a level that is reasonable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we must consider all matters related to renewable energies to be extremely important, bearing in mind the fact that we want to leave behind us a world which future generations will find inhabitable. </p>
<p class="contents">It is curious that we are slowly killing ourselves and yet the earth’s contamination is not causing the alarm bells to ring. What can we do about it? I think that first we must seek out all renewable energies and take advantage of them, encourage them, promote them and provide the appropriate incentives to make them viable, and at the same time penalise energies that contaminate.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is all easy to say and difficult to do, but unless we act immediately, within a few generations, we will be stretched to the limit. My opinion is that we should start by differentiating between compensation and subsidies. It is common knowledge that most traditional sources of energy, apart from those using water, wind etc., cause a great deal of serious environmental damage, in many cases, such as CO2, acid rain, oil slicks etc. This damage is usually repaired by public administrations, by means of programmes for restoring and caring for the environment. In the case of renewables which do not cause any harm to the surrounding environment, I believe it would be reasonable to compensate them while there is no tax on emissions of polluting particles such as CO2.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as long as public administrations continue to take responsibility for repairing the damage caused by thermal or nuclear power stations, we will be subsidising these sources of energy at the expense of renewables.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to mention the establishment of an appropriate legal framework for this kind of energy, which would foster its rapid development, bearing in mind that, in the long term, renewables must become predominant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the sustainability of energy sources. Secondly, security of supply, which has a quite special effect as far as Europe is concerned, not least because of the unstable political situations in the countries which currently supply energy to Europe. Thirdly, of course, the economy, because energy is a fundamental factor in our international competitiveness and we must therefore ensure that we have an economical supply of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally come from Upper Austria and, at present, Upper Austria has broken the energy-saving and energy-renewing records. Where I come from, renewable energy takes top priority, and Upper Austria has an energy savings agency which runs like clockwork. The principle of subsidiarity applies here and I think that it was this energy savings agency which inaugurated the energy savings fair held a few days ago, thereby meeting the need for education and information for the public as a whole. I also think that research and development in this area need greater support. In the final analysis, we should endeavour in Europe to apply the best practice, i.e. to see where there are models – at this energy savings fair in Wels we presented a thick directory of best practice models – and, at the same time, to use benchmarking to show where we have taken the lead in Europe and where progress is being made elsewhere in the world. I think that this management system is particularly significant for the future of energy supplies in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to remind you that in April last year the Commission approved a working paper on electricity from renewable sources, whose main objective was to present a thorough overview of the support programmes of the different Member States in the field of renewable energies, as well as to highlight certain conclusions and possible options for the adoption of Community measures in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">On that occasion the Commission indicated in its working paper that it had not reached a final conclusion and that a final decision would be adopted on all the issues involved in the light of reactions to the paper itself. In this respect, Parliament’s contribution is an extremely important element in this process. This House has always been forthright in its support for active policies designed to promote renewable energies. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to Mr Turmes for his work. Furthermore, and as Mr Linkohr has pointed out, it must be said that it is Parliament that has, in part, forced the Commission to undertake more concrete action in the area of renewable energies and that Parliament has always been a leader and a driving force in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that renewable energies have to play a key role in guaranteeing our supply of energy, as well as making us less dependent on imports and in fulfilling the commitments we gave in Kyoto. However, they can also help the EU’s technological development and enable us to export clean technologies to other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that Mr Turmes’s report fully concurs with these views. The Commission is already giving its support to the production of wind, solar and biomass energy, small hydroelectric stations and geothermal energy, that is all sources of renewable energy, with the exception of large hydraulic power stations, which we feel we should not support because they have sufficient options available to them. Furthermore, they have some extremely negative aspects from an environmental point of view, as constructing a dam always involves flooding a valley.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, say to Mr Turmes that, despite what I have just said, we cannot consider peat to be a renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALTENER programme is enabling magnificent work to take place and Parliament has always been an ally of the Commission. It has always cooperated with the efforts of the Commission and, I repeat, has even been a driving force in making the Commission’s proposals more ambitious. </p>
<p class="contents">We are now faced with a considerable challenge, which is to establish the most appropriate mechanisms for supporting the development of green electricity in an internal market, an open single electricity market, which is what we are trying to achieve in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that all issues that have been highlighted here will be carefully considered in relation to the directive on which discussions will begin in the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">Going into specific issues, almost all of the points made in Mr Turmes’s report deserve our support and fully concur with our own studies. Some aspects are more open to debate, but they also deserve thorough study, even if they must be rejected, in some cases because they are not sufficiently based on fact or because the problems they present are greater than the solutions they propose. I must repeat that the report stresses the importance of the objective of doubling, from 6% to 12%, the proportion of renewable energy sources in the gross domestic consumption of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the proposal for a directive, we hope to include some objectives chosen by countries, that is, individual objectives for each country in the European Union. These would not be compulsory objectives, but ones which can produce results, at least from the political point of view, and I think that this would be a very important step.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Turmes on the need to protect the different national systems in force at the time that this directive is adopted. This is what we will do, which does not mean that, in five years time, there should not be a review of the different systems and that we should not commit ourselves to those which have proved to be the most effective and which have resulted in greater development of renewable energies in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, as you know, on 2 December 1999, in the Energy Council, I gave a questionnaire to the Member States, so I could see what stage we had reached, what stage the issue had reached, and so I could present a directive that could obtain sufficient consensus to quickly conclude its passage through both Parliament and the Council. The result of this questionnaire, which has been studied by the services, is a document, in my opinion, of extremely high quality, which I hope will enable us to get through the Parliamentary and Council procedures reasonably quickly. Let us state quite clearly that the proposal simply and straightforwardly seeks to stimulate production in the EU of electricity from renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that I have taken careful note of Mr Linkohr’s words on agricultural policy and the possibility of encouraging non-food production. As a former agriculture minister, I am sensitive to these issues and this is one which, to a certain extent, is also covered in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that our objective in all of this is to have a safer and more reliable supply of energy, which treats the EU’s environment with greater respect.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, other speakers have mentioned repayment. Mr Vidal-Quadras and Mr Valdivielso both mentioned this a while ago. Renewable energies today are not competitive in relation to traditional energies, particularly as traditional energies have certain external costs which, of course, are not internalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Support must be given to renewable energies. My personal view – although there are other ideas on this subject – is that, as things stand, we cannot write off other energies, for reasons of competitiveness and growth. We can, however, support renewable energies, precisely because they are obviously based on respect for the environment and on reducing emissions. In this respect, we must be able to ensure that those who do commit themselves to renewables have a fair return on their investments. We obviously have to create a stable framework that will enable investors to make investments which require a sufficient number of years to cover their repayment. This is one of the issues under discussion in the Commission and which has proved to be more difficult in some cases, together with certain other aspects. But, ultimately, everyone in the Commission agrees on the need to encourage green energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the speakers, and to assure them that this element of stability, which will enable decisions relating to medium-term investments to be taken, will also feature in the proposal for a directive that I hope to be able to present to you soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
