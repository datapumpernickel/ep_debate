<p>On 19 and 20 June the European Council noted the outcome of the Irish referendum and noted that the ratification process was continuing in other Member States.</p>
<p>The French Presidency is in close contact with the Irish authorities. Mr Sarkozy visited Dublin along with Bernard Kouchner on 21 July in order to listen to and understand the different points of view. They met with the Irish authorities, the leaders of the political parties and representatives of civil society. Further contacts are due to take place in the months ahead in both Paris and Dublin.</p>
<p>I noted the recent statements by the Irish Minister for European Affairs on the possible prospect of allowing the Irish people to vote in another referendum.</p>
<p>As the European Council indicated in June, we respect the sensibilities and the choice of the Irish people. However, we must not forget that 24 national parliaments have approved the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>Moreover, your Assembly is very aware of the fact that in the new uncertain international climate it is crucial for the Union to have at its disposal the political and legal resources and instruments that will allow it to fulfil its objectives.</p>
<p>With a view to the European Council meeting in October, we will make every effort to help the Irish authorities to draw up proposals for the future. It is important for these proposals to be ready by October so that a solution acceptable to all 27 Member States can be found as quickly as possible. At an institutional level, we cannot waste any time. We need to act. We must ensure that, on the basis of the Irish proposals, we are ready to put in place our future legal framework and to put into practice the lessons we have learned when it comes to the organisation of the European elections and composition of the Commission in 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0542"></a>

<p>The Union’s position is clear. It has reiterated it on several occasions:</p>
<p>As far as the European Union is concerned, the establishment of settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law. The act of establishing settlements prejudges the result of the negotiations on the final status of the Palestinian Territories and threatens the viability of an agreed solution based on the coexistence of two States.</p>
<p>In July and August the European Union once again called on Israel to suspend all settlement activities, notably those linked to ‘natural growth’, including those in East Jerusalem, and to dismantle the uncontrolled settlements established since March 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0551"></a>

<p>The accession negotiations with Croatia are making good progress and have entered a key phase in 2008. Since the beginning of the negotiations in October 2005, 21 chapters have been opened, and three of these have been provisionally closed:</p>
<p>Chapter 25, ‘Science and research’</p>
<p>Chapter 26, ‘Education and culture’</p>
<p>Chapter 20, ‘Enterprise and industrial policy’</p>
<p>In addition to the closing of Chapter 20, the Accession Conference of 25 July saw the opening of Chapter 1, ‘Free movement of goods’.</p>
<p>The rate of the negotiations depends, and will depend, first and foremost on the progress Croatia can make in terms of fulfilling the conditions laid down.</p>
<p>The main challenge now is to draw on the progress that has been achieved in order to speed up the rate of the reforms and their implementation, notably:</p>
<p>the reform of the justice system and public administration</p>
<p>the fight against corruption, minority rights</p>
<p>the economic reforms.</p>
<p>In the field of regional cooperation, the EU encourages Croatia to continue its efforts to establish good neighbourhood relations in order to:</p>
<p>find definitive, mutually acceptable solutions to all the outstanding bilateral questions with neighbouring countries, particularly border issues</p>
<p>work towards reconciliation among the people of the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0556"></a>

<p>reduction in export refunds</p>
<p>removal of the set-aside requirement for 2008</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>I provided a partial answer to this question on 8 July in response to the question posed by your colleague Mr Matsis.</p>
<p>However, it is true that during the summer the situation changed somewhat. We are now seeing a slow-down in the increase in the price of raw materials. That is good news, even if it is still not enough. It is still important to emphasis it, nonetheless.</p>
<p>As you know, on 19 and 20 June 2008 the European Council discussed the development of agricultural and food prices. A series of specific measures were thus introduced with a view to the European Council in October or December 2008.</p>
<p>As I have just said, it is important in this respect to reiterate the measures already taken by the Union in order to moderate the pressure on food prices and stabilise the markets, for example selling intervention stocks, reducing export refunds, removing the set-aside requirement and increasing milk quotas.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures to be taken, the European Council has highlighted the importance of ensuring the sustainability of bio-fuel policies, assessing the possible impacts of these policies on agricultural products for food and taking action, if necessary, to deal with any problems.</p>
<p>Specific measures to support the most disadvantaged, both in Europe and around the world, are also being drawn up in the Commission and the Council will examine these in October.</p>
<p>I am not forgetting the links between this issue and development of international trade, however.</p>
<p>The negotiations in July on the Doha Round did not produce a balanced agreement, despite all the EU’s efforts. It is not time, within a multilateral, or failing that a bilateral and regional, framework to look for the means to enable third countries to improve their production and promote their exports.</p>
<p>The European Council has welcomed the Commission’s initiatives to examine the issue of restrictive regulations in the retail sector and to closely monitor activities in commodity-related financial markets, including speculative trade, and their impact on price movements as well as any policy implications. It has invited the Commission to report back on this issue in advance of the December 2008 European Council and to consider proposing adequate policy responses, including measures aimed at improving market transparency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0562"></a>

<p>The Council attaches great importance to the training of the judiciary and judicial staff, and to judicial cooperation in developing the European area of justice.</p>
<p>We have not yet defined all of the instruments at Community level, however. A number of initiatives have therefore been launched:</p>
<p>on 7 and 8 July in Cannes the French Presidency devoted a significant proportion of the informal meeting of the Council of Ministers responsible for justice and home affairs to the subject of training of the judiciary and judicial staff. The Member States unanimously agreed that efforts in this area had to be stepped up considerably.</p>
<p>subsequently, on 10 July, France, together with 10 other Member States, tabled a draft resolution of the Council and of the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting in the Council with a view to offering substantial political support for greater action in the field of training of the judiciary and judicial staff in the European Union.</p>
<p>a further initiative aimed at harmonising efforts, the European Judicial Training Network, has been launched in the form of a non-profit-making association under Belgian law, outside the scope of the EU’s legal framework. This initiative receives Community funding and financial support from the participating Member States. We hope that it will be incorporated within the EU system. The French Presidency is not just in favour of this; it will actively support the project.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0568"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 26-27 May 2008, the Council recalled that the European Union wishes to see a sure, stable, democratic, prosperous and unified Afghanistan where human rights are respected. In general, the European Union is highly committed to Afghanistan. Not only all of its Member States, but also the European Commission, finance programmes to promote governance and the rule of law, rural development, health and social protection, mine clearance and regional cooperation. Consequently, at the International Conference in support of Afghanistan held in Paris on 12 June the European Commission announced that it will contribute EUR 500 million to these actions over the period 2008-2010. As far as the EU’s activities in Afghanistan are concerned, I must also mention the ESDP EUPOL Afghanistan mission, which does remarkable work in training the Afghan police.</p>
<p>Over and above these specific European actions in Afghanistan, the honourable Member rightly emphasises the fact that the action of the international community in Afghanistan is based on two principal elements: one military and one that consists of civil reconstruction. Both of these aspects are intertwined and stem from the international community’s global approach in Afghanistan. Indeed, the international military presence can only be justified if it seeks to create conditions that will promote the institutional, economic and social development of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>As a result, the international effort in Afghanistan must encompass both aspects. In fact, after having strengthened its military effort in Afghanistan at the Bucharest Summit in April, the international community also decided, at the International Conference in support of Afghanistan in June, to increase substantially and over a considerable period its political and financial commitment to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. By amassing almost EUR 14 billion and renewing the partnership between the international community and the Afghan authorities, the Conference proved to be a great success for Afghanistan and its people. It was also a great success for the European Union, which succeeded in emphasising fully its positions on key issues for the successful development of the country.</p>
<p>As far as Iraq is concerned, in its conclusions of 26-27 May 2008 the Council reiterated its desire for a safe, stable, democratic, prosperous and unified Iraq where human rights are respected. The European Union carries out aid missions to support the reconstruction of the country. As regards the rule of law, the EUJUST LEX programme has enabled 1 400 Iraqi police, judicial and penitentiary personnel to be trained. Given the positive results of this mission, its mandate is likely to be extended in June 2009 with a view to adapting the training to the changes in the security situation in Iraq and ensuring that the Union’s efforts meet as closely as possible the needs of those working in these sectors. In addition to these cooperation activities, the European Union is actively involved in Iraq’s reintegration into the international community through its support for the International Compact with Iraq and its negotiations on the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to remember that a balance must be maintained between the spending on military operations on the one hand, and the spending on reconstruction and humanitarian aid on the other, and above all, that the two elements of the operation are both part of the same objective of improving security and maintaining peace.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0579"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, peace and reconciliation in the Middle East are a strategic priority of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) for the EU Member States.</p>
<p>The Union today is involved in two major types of efforts to promote peace in that region.</p>
<p>Firstly, it cooperates closely with the other members of the Quartet and its partners in the region to encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to resolve together the disputes that divide them with a view to concluding a peace agreement before the end of 2008, as agreed in Annapolis last November. In particular, the European Union has for more than 10 years appointed a special representative with responsibility for the peace process to work alongside both parties. This post is currently held by Ambassador Marc Otte.</p>
<p>Secondly, the European Union has recently established an action strategy entitled ‘State-building for peace in the Middle East’. Presented in November 2007 and endorsed by the Member States during the General Affairs and External Relations Council, this strategy organises, in particular, the activities relating to the EU’s current and future technical and financial assistance aimed at strengthening Palestinian state-building.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that the European Union and its Member States have for a long time been the largest donors to the Palestinian Authority: they alone account for almost one third of its budget and more than half of all foreign aid. This EU support is provided notably through a special financing mechanism, currently known as PEGASE. This mechanism has just supported the three-year Palestinian Reform and Development Plan, which was approved in December 2007 by the international financial institutions and which relates to governance of the Territories, public infrastructures, private sector development and social development.</p>
<p>However, the European Union is not content to be merely a donor: for example, it is also involved in training and providing equipment for the Palestinian police (so-called EUPOL COPPS mission, a civilian mission governed by the legal regime for ESDP missions). The Union is also prepared at any moment to resume its border assistance mission at the Rafah border point (EUBAM Rafah) when circumstances so permit.</p>
<p>With a view once again to strengthening Palestinian state-building, the European Union has also organised, or strongly supported, in close collaboration with the Quartet representative, Mr Tony Blair, three international conferences in less than a year concerning: the financing of the Palestinian Authority (Paris Conference, December 2007); private investment in the Palestinian Territories (Bethlehem Conference, May 2008); and finally, support for civil security and the rule of law (Berlin Conference, June 2008). Each of these conferences resulted in resources being made available and new measures being agreed upon to strengthen Palestinian state-building.</p>
<p>Finally, within the framework of the action strategy, the Union is examining the specific contribution it could make to the implementation of a future peace agreement supported by the parties.</p>
<p>The honourable Member can therefore rest assured that the European Union is exploring every avenue and intends to use all its influence to ensure that the Middle East peace process continues to move forward.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0583"></a>

<p>In accordance with the Community legislation on VAT and excise duty, all goods brought into the European Union from a third country are subject to tax.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to avoid double taxation, a Community system of tax-free allowances is applied to non-commercial imports of goods contained in the personal luggage of travellers coming from third countries. At present, and in accordance with Directive 69/169/EEC<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Member States do not apply tax to goods whose value does not exceed EUR 175.

<p>In addition to these monetary thresholds, certain quantities of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages may also be imported duty-free and the limits for these items are laid down in the Directives.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Directive 69/169/EEC also lays down quantitative limits for exemptions from excise duty for tea, coffee and perfume, which will be abolished from 1 December 2008 pursuant to Directive 1007/74/EC.</p>

In the declaration adopted at this Summit the Heads of State and Government also underlined their commitment to strengthen democracy and political pluralism. They also affirm their ambition to build a common future based on respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as enshrined in the relevant international instruments, including the promotion of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, strengthening the role of women in society, respect for minorities, the fight against racism and xenophobia, and the advancement of cultural dialogue and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Moreover, the association agreements and action plans that exist within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy contain commitments to human rights and provide for the possibility of raising questions on this aspect.

<p>As you know, in January 2007 the Commission presented the ‘energy/climate’ legislative package, which seeks to tackle simultaneously the challenges of reducing greenhouse gases, improving energy security and guaranteeing the European Union’s competitiveness in the long term. The package contains numerous proposals in the area of energy and climate change.</p>
<p>One of the proposals in the package, the proposal on effort sharing, covers all the greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, i.e. carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
<p>As regards agriculture and climate change more specifically, I would remind you that in its conclusions of 19-20 June 2008 the European Council states that it is essential to pursue work on innovation, research and development of agricultural production, notably to enhance its energy efficiency, productivity growth and ability to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>To date, the Council has not received any proposals concerning the appointment of a body to assess the real influence of all the factors contributing to the greenhouse effect, but, as you know, the discussions on the proposals in the ‘energy/climate’ package are continuing in the Council and with the European Parliament with a view to reaching a global agreement before the end of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0610"></a>

<p>Recently Israel has been adopting an increasingly bellicose stance towards Iran in response to its nuclear programme, stepping up its threats to launch a military offensive. This has been made abundantly clear in recent statements issued by the Defence Minister Ehud Barak that Israel is prepared to move against Iran, pointing out that Israel has in the past repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to take unhesitating action. From 28 May to 12 June 2008 the threats were backed up by the ‘Glorious Spartan’ air force manoeuvres on Greek territory organised jointly by Greece and Israel simulating a hypothetical Israeli attack on a nuclear plant in Iran. These developments confirm that aggressive imperialist tactics by Israel pose a constant threat to peace in the area and to the peoples affected.</p>

<p>The Council supports the approach of the General Secretariat/High Representative Javier Solana and the Group of Six (Germany, China, United States, France, United Kingdom, Russia), which are actively seeking a diplomatic solution to the crisis between Iran and the international community on the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme. The issues involved in the Iranian nuclear affair have a considerable impact on the stability of the region and the international non-proliferation regime.</p>
<p>The Council is making every effort to reach a peaceful and negotiated solution that responds to the concerns of the international community. To this end, as the Council has reiterated on many occasions, we must resolutely pursue the ‘double approach’ that combines an openness to dialogue and increasing sanctions if Iran refuses to apply the decisions of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Council regrets all statements that are likely to jeopardise the efforts to reach a negotiated solution and recalls that it has condemned in the strongest possible terms the threats made on several occasions by the Iranian authorities against Israel.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0573"></a>

<p>In the summer of 2007 the Commission launched a review of the activities of credit rating agencies (CRAs) in the credit markets and their role in the subprime turmoil.</p>
<p>In view of the lessons learned following that review, work is now advanced on a regulatory response to a series of problems identified in relation to CRAs. The Commission is consulting on the main features of a regulatory framework. The documents subject to consultation suggest the adoption of a set of rules introducing a number of substantive requirements that CRAs would need to respect for the authorisation and exercise of their rating activity in the EU. The main objective would be to ensure that ratings are reliable and accurate pieces of information for investors. CRAs would be obliged to deal with conflicts of interest, have sound rating methodologies and increase the transparency of their rating activities. The consultation documents also propose two options for an efficient EU oversight of CRAs: The first option is based on a reinforced co-ordination role for the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and strong regulatory co-operation between national regulators. The second option would combine the establishment of a European Agency (either the CESR or a new agency) for the EU-wide registration of CRAs and the reliance on national regulators for the supervision of CRA activities. The consultation also deals with possible approaches to the issue of excessive reliance on ratings in EU legislation.</p>
<p>This preparatory work should conclude in autumn 2008 with the adoption of a legislative proposal by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0594"></a>

<p>In reply to the first part of the question, the Commission would like to refer the Honourable Members to the conclusions of the June 2008 European Council. The European Council noted the outcome of the referendum in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty and agreed that more time was needed to analyse the situation. It noted that the Irish Government would actively consult, both internally and with other Member States, in order to suggest a common way forward. The European Council recalled that the purpose of the Lisbon Treaty is to help an enlarged Union to act more effectively and more democratically. It noted that, by then, parliaments of 19 Member States had ratified the Treaty and that the ratification process continues in other countries. Indeed, since then the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty has been approved in a further three countries. The European Council indicated that it will address this issue on 15 October in order to consider the way forward. The President in office of the European Union, Mr Sarkozy, confirmed this approach in his intervention on 10 July 2008 before Parliament.</p>
<p>The Internal Market is and will remain at the heart of the European integration. Its future is not directly linked to the Lisbon Treaty. Therefore work will continue to strengthen the Internal Market and to make it more efficient so it can continue to be a driver of prosperity and economic growth to the benefit of European citizens and businesses.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0544"></a>

<p>Over the last few years, Vietnam has experienced a significant economic boom which has been supported by (amongst other things) the EU's development-aid and financial-support policies. The growth in the country's GDP has been matched by an increase in human-rights abuse. In particular, over 250 Montagnard political prisoners who were arrested in 2001 and 2004 have yet to be released, whilst a growing number of Khmer Kampuchea Krom are seeking asylum in Cambodia on account of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Given that the Commission is making efforts to ensure that its development policies are more consistent with human rights, can the Commission consider itself satisfied with the impact which its support has on the situation of ethnic and religious minorities, immigrant workers and democracy activists in Vietnam?</p>

<p>While recognizing the benefits of the economic openess of Vietnam, the Commission shares the Parliament’s concern on the human rights situation in the country. Rights of ethnic and religious minorities as well as of human rights activists are essential foundations of a democratic society and sustainable development. The Commission is extensively involved at the national, regional (ie. ASEAN), and multilateral levels to ensure respect and protection of these rights. While the Commission is actively promoting projects that focus on advancing human rights protection in Vietnam, it recognizes that there is still a lot to be done.</p>
<p>Currently the Commission is implementing numerous projects that aim to enhance life quality of the poor and disadvantaged people in Vietnam. The Commission is implementing a 18 million euro project (for the years 2006-2010) with the main objective to improve health standards by providing high quality preventive, curative, and promotive care to the poor living in the Northern Uplands and Central Highlands. Additionally, the Commission contributes 11.45 million euro in grant to a project implemented by the World Bank, that will provide an increased coverage of essential health services, particularly at the commune level in the mountainous areas in Vietnam. The project is expected to benefit some 3 million people, mostly ethnic minorities and poor people. There is also a joint project of the Commission and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that will ensure equal and unrestricted access to education for disadvantaged indigenous families.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to press the Vietnamese government for progress in human rights protection during the local human rights dialogue, and a Joint Committee Sub-group on Human Rights. In addition, during the ongoing negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), the Commission is strongly insisting on including the essential elements human rights clause and a human rights cooperation clause.</p>
<p>During the upcoming visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Vietnam, Mr. Pham Gia Khiem, the Commission will address the issue of Vietnam’s international obligations, and will urge the Vietnamese government to observe the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international human rights standards in its internal laws.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0552"></a>

<p>The European Neighbourhood Policy is and will remain a key priority for the Commission. In this context the Commission is keen to strengthen bilateral relations with its Eastern partners. Suggestions which pragmatically contribute to this goal, such as the Polish-Swedish initiative are welcome.</p>
<p>In June 2008, the European Council invited the Commission to take the work forward and to present to the Council in spring 2009 a proposal for modalities of the "Eastern Partnership", on the basis of relevant initiatives.</p>
<p>The Commission has immediately started working on this. At this stage it can be said that the Commission's proposals will be based on the following principles:</p>
<p>a) The European Neighbourhood Policy, based on bilateral, differentiated co-operation with each individual partner, remains the principal framework of the relations towards the EU's Eastern neighbours. That is also clearly what these partners want.</p>
<p>b) The proposals should build upon, complement and add value to already existing structures, without duplicating what is being done and in particular, the Black Sea Synergy, established a year ago and which is now bearing fruit with concrete results on the ground.</p>
<p>c) Any new multilateral framework must comprise all EU Member States so that the Union can deploy its full political and economic weight and partners become gradually closer to the Union as such.</p>
<p>d) New proposals must of course have the clear support of the neighbours they are designed for.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0563"></a>

<p>The European Union has been a leader in funding the prevention of torture and support for victims of torture under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). EU funding is scheduled to be phased out and/or reduced beginning in 2010, with that deficit to be taken on by Member States. Mr Manfred Nowak, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, recently cautioned against this plan unless a comprehensive programme and clear commitments are first in place.</p>

<p>The prevention and eradication of all forms of torture and ill-treatment worldwide represents one of the main objectives of the EU’s human rights policy. In this context, the Commission is committed to continue its substantial support to the fight against torture under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). It doesn't plan to reduce its overall support in this area. For 2007-10, more than € 44 million have been allocated to that purpose. Such funding is fully consistent with its past funding.</p>
<p>The Commission does, however, intend to somewhat redirect EIDHR support to torture rehabilitation centres. Indeed, it plans to phase out gradually our support to centres in the EU from 2010 onwards, with a view of funding more torture rehabilitation centres outside the EU, where government and private support is often scarce or even non-existent. The Commission recalls that the EIDHR is an instrument dedicated to supporting non-governmental organization (NGO) projects outside the EU and that EU Member States have an obligation under EC and international law to provide assistance to torture victims. In April 2008, the Council recalled the importance of financial support for torture prevention and rehabilitation programmes and specifically called on Member States to support torture rehabilitation centres.</p>
<p>The Commission is well aware of the potential consequences of this reorientation and has approached this issue with care. The Commission and Member States are committed to ensure that the phasing out will not be made at the cost of torture victims in the EU. To this aim, the Commission has already launched a process of consultations with stakeholders, including the relevant UN bodies and NGOs.

<p>In relation to the death of Alexander Litvinenko the Commission refers to the statement made by the Presidency of the EU on behalf of EU over a year ago where the EU which stated explicitly “its disappointment at Russia's failure to cooperate constructively with the authorities of the United Kingdom” and it underlined “the importance of urgent and constructive cooperation by the Russian Federation on this matter”.

<p>Afghanistan and Iraq are becoming test cases for international development assistance and multilateral cooperation and for the European Union in particular. For example, having regard to the Commission's National Indicative Programme, earmarking EUR 610 million for Afghanistan for 2007-2010, it is very important to find and implement a right balance between the spending on law enforcement and support for military operations, on the one hand, and on civil reconstruction and humanitarian assistance as well as on health and education, on the other.</p>
<p>What is envisaged by the Commission in this field? Is the EU financial assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq to be increased? What programmes and projects are to be financed in the upcoming three years? Does the Commission intend to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the EU financial assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq and keep the European Parliament adequately informed about the results of such evaluation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. The Commission clearly agrees on the importance of ensuring effective support for reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq, and on the need for improvement in both the security situation and the welfare of their populations.</p>
<p>Most of the funds available for Afghanistan's Indicative Programme for the period 2007-2010 have been allocated to support reconstruction in rural development, governance and health. Education is supported through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund managed by the World Bank.</p>
<p>In the case of Iraq, the Commission has unfortunately not yet been able to develop a multi annual indicative programme. Security, the volatile political situation and rapidly changing living conditions do not allow such multi-annual planning for the time being. Consequently, aid to Iraq has been provided until now through Special Measures. In 2008 the Commission proposes to allocate 85% of the € 72 million total to the provision of basic services to the population and to refugees, and the balance for technical assistance to the Iraqi institutions.</p>
<p>2. The Country Strategy Paper for Afghanistan sets out the priorities for Community financial assistance for Afghanistan 2007-2013. For the period 2007-2010, €610 million has been allocated. In addition, Afghanistan benefits from support provided from thematic budget lines, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, humanitarian assistance and the Instrument for Stability.</p>
<p>In the case of Iraq, it is the common understanding of the Government of Iraq and the international community that donor support in the future should concentrate in improving the capacity of Iraqi institutions to make better use of Iraq's considerable financial resources. The Commission is therefore concentrating its support on the technical assistance to the Iraqi institutions and on the improvement of the basic services to the population.</p>
<p>3. The Commission will propose, in the Annual Action Programme 2008 for Afghanistan support for Health (€ 60 million) Social Protection (€ 24 million), Justice Sector and Customs (€ 30 million) and Agriculture (€ 30 million). For 2009 programmes are expected to include funding for Governance, Rural Development, Mine Action and Regional Cooperation and in 2010 programmes for Health, Rural Development and Governance.</p>
<p>In the case of Iraq, given the absence of multi-annual programming, no programmes are foreseen for the moment for the next three years. For 2008, the Special Measure for Iraq will be presented to the Council and to Parliament in October 2008. It will follow the guidelines of the Information Note distributed to Parliament in June 2008.</p>
<p>4. The Community's financial assistance to Afghanistan is being monitored and evaluated in a systematic way through field missions and visits, independent Result Oriented Monitoring missions, regular project reports, as well as through the Coordinated Donor Dialogue mechanism and steering committees with the Government. In the context of the Budgetary Discharge 2006 the Commission has confirmed its intention to report regularly to Parliament on the implementation of aid in Afghanistan. A first 'State of Play' report is being published on the web and will be regularly updated.</p>
<p>In Iraq, two verification missions and one evaluation on the ground were performed during 2008. Their first results are positive. The final results and conclusions will be shared with the Parliament as soon as they are available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0572"></a>

<p>Following the “no” vote on the Lisbon Treaty in the Irish referendum in June 2008, the European Council examined the situation at its meeting on 19/20 June 2008.

<p>The Commission successfully completed negotiations with 11 of the 16 countries.

<p>Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters is applicable in all 27 Member States. With regard to Denmark, the Regulation is applicable since 1 July 2007 on the basis of an agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In October 2004, the Commission adopted a report on the application of the Regulation. The Report concluded that since its entry into force in 2001, the application of the Regulation had generally improved and expedited the transmission and the service of documents between Member States. The main reasons for the speeding up of transmission and service were the introduction of direct contacts between local bodies, the possibility of postal service and direct service and the introduction of standard forms. Nevertheless, many persons involved in the application of the Regulation, in particular local bodies, still did not have sufficient knowledge about the Regulation. Furthermore, the application of certain provisions of the Regulation is not fully satisfactory. Adaptations of these provisions should be considered in order to further improve and facilitate the application of the Regulation.</p>
<p>Consequently, in July 2005 the Commission proposed to amend certain provisions of the Regulation (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0305">COM(2005) 305</a>). On 13 November 2007, Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000. The new Regulation will enter into force on 13 November 2008.</p>
<p>The most important modifications with respect to Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 are:</p>
<p>Introduction of a rule providing that the receiving agency shall take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document as soon as possible, and in any event within one month of receipt.</p>
<p>Introduction of a new standard form to inform the addressee about his right to refuse to accept the document to be served at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within one week.</p>
<p>Introduction of a rule providing that costs occasioned by recourse to a judicial officer or to a person competent under the law of the Member State addressed shall correspond to a single fixed fee laid down by that Member State in advance which respects the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination.</p>
<p>Introduction of uniform conditions for service by postal services (registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or equivalent).</p>
<p>In accordance with Art. 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007, the Commission will then publish the information communicated by Member States and an updated version of the manual and the glossary.</p>
<p>Art. 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 provides that the next report on the application of the Regulation will be presented no later than 1 June 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is not responsible for monitoring healthcare delivery in third countries.</p>
<p>As for the European Union, according to Article 152 of the Treaty, Member States are responsible for the organisation and delivery of health services on their territory, irrespective of whether healthcare is delivered to domestic patients or to foreign patients. This includes monitoring of results as well as quality and safety control.</p>
<p>Within its sphere of responsibilities, the Commission supports work leading to increased availability of data on the outcomes and quality of medical procedures in the European Union, through projects co-financed by the Public Health Programme.</p>
<p>For example, it supports the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Healthcare quality indicators project, focusing on cardiac care, diabetes care, mental health care, primary care and prevention, and patient safety. Other examples are the Euphoric project, aiming at benchmarking health outcomes and assessing quality of care of health procedures or the Hospital Data 2 (HPD2) project, improving the comparability and developing a time-series of hospital procedures.</p>
<p>As regards the case of "flying-in surgeons", Directive 2005/36/EC on recognition of professional qualifications provides for free provision of services whilst ensuring an appropriate level of qualification. Surgery belongs to the medical specialities for which the Directive ensures automatic recognition of diplomas based on minimum common standards at EU level.</p>
<p>In addition, without affecting the role of Member States in healthcare delivery, the European Community may contribute in the future to provide patients with better cross-border healthcare.</p>
<p>As regards healthcare provided in an EU Member State, the Commission proposed, on 2 July 2008, a Directive<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare which would, inter alia, clarify the responsibilities of Member States in relation to quality and safety of cross-border healthcare. A clear principle would be agreed: the Member State of treatment has the responsibility for the definition, enforcement and monitoring of quality and safety standards. This proposal also aims at improving data collection on cross-border healthcare. However it is the Member State of origin of the patient that shall determine which treatments will be eligible for reimbursement. Moreover, this proposed directive is without prejudice to the Directive 2005/36/EC on recognition of professional qualifications and implementing measures adopted by the Member States should not constitute new barriers to the free movement of health professionals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Complaints from citizens who are experiencing problems making payments with € 500 banknotes in Belgium have been brought to my notice. The main problems are encountered in service stations and at Brussels-Charleroi airport. Not being able to pay with € 500 notes is extremely inconvenient, particularly in places such as airports. This is not a question of individual cases in which the person taking the payment is unable to change banknotes of that size, but rather of a systematic refusal to accept such banknotes.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the third sentence of Article 106(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro, all banknotes denominated in euro have the status of legal tender. Although Article 11 of the Regulation defines the maximum number of coins that a party is obliged to accept, the Regulation does not set any limit on banknotes. The various banknotes denominated in euro are stipulated in a decision of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>
<p>There are no Community rules that explicitly provide for appealing against a refusal to accept certain banknotes. Different provisions may apply under the civil law and monetary law of the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that € 500 banknotes are sometimes refused as payment in certain shops in Belgium. However, this practice does not seem to be on the increase and it dates back to when the Belgian franc was in use, when the same thing happened with BEF 10 000 notes. Cases of € 500 banknotes being refused are also recorded in the other countries of the eurozone.</p>
<p>If a shopkeeper clearly informs his customers that he does not accept large banknotes as payment (for example in visible signs at the shop entrance and beside the checkout), the buyer is generally deemed to have entered into a contractual relationship with the seller and have tacitly agreed to the conditions set out.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0557"></a>

<p>After seven years of negotiation, right at the moment when success finally seemed within reach, Ministers meeting in Geneva in July 2008 could not finalise something in which the EU still believed and for which it had fought so much. It is too early now to assess the long-term consequences of this failure. What we know is that an agreement in Geneva would have brought benefits for Europe and its partners while boosting the economy of developing countries in a way which never occurred before, laying the foundations for enhanced trade and prosperity over the next decade.</p>
<p>Of course, new trade opportunities do mean greater competition and the challenge of adaptation – which is not always easy. It is important to ensure that this change is phased in: this is why the Doha round's provisions would have not been implemented overnight but over a number of years. It is also why in the area of agriculture, the EU has consistently rejected all over the negotiations the extreme liberalisation demands made by some World Trade Organisation (WTO) member states.</p>
<p>In the long run, the challenge of adaptation is worth taking, because the shift from less to more competitive sectors is critical to improving productivity and securing long-term growth. The Commission continues to believe that a successful conclusion of a multilateral agreement under the WTO is still the best way to achieve this objective and do so in a way that forces others to take similar steps.</p>
<p>The liberalisation and the lower tariffs inherent in a successful conclusion of such an agreement would inevitably mean lower tariffs for food products as well, but would also translate into cheaper food for consumers, and cheaper inputs for companies.</p>
<p>Moreover, all imported food products would continue to need to respect strict food safety rules comparable to those in place in the Community: the Commission can assure the Honourable Member that there will be no compromise on this crucial point. The Community has now a comprehensive legislative framework on food safety designed to ensure that all food is safe, irrespective of origin. The Commission is not going to jeopardise this.</p>
<p>A successful agreement would have also meant a level playing field for EU farmers and therefore more opportunities for European exports by opening new farm markets for European produce abroad. 70% of EU agricultural exports are finished consumer oriented products, for which there is a growing market in the world.</p>
<p>It is also very important that, through Doha, among great difficulties and opposition from many countries: the EU was trying to secure improved legal protection for what is called 'geographical indications', the special local agricultural products that are some of Europe's most competitive exports – things like Parma Ham and Roquefort cheese. It is also important to note that some form of commitment by our partners on this subject would have been a condition "sine qua non" for a final deal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0558"></a>

<p>In spite of the pledges made by the European Commission, the financial procedures for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development are even more complicated than those for previous framework programmes.

In other words, although the Commission had promised to speed up its internal financial procedures they will in fact take 80% longer.</p>
<p>Now that more than six months have been added to the waiting period, many small- and medium-sized undertakings are likely to lose interest in the programme and employ their capacity elsewhere, leaving none for EU work.

<p>The Commission has no indication that supports the statement in the question that there has been an increase of 80% in the time to process proposals. The average time-to-grant in the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP6) was between 12 and 13 months. Detailed statistics for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7) are not yet available (because the processes are still ongoing) but estimations show that the average time-to-grant for the first wave of FP7 projects will probably be of the same order.</p>
<p>The legal framework of FP7 itself provides for simplification of grant negotiation. However both this legal framework and the Financial Regulation also impose limits to such simplification in the interest of providing adequate assurances and accountability.</p>
<p>The introduction of the guarantee fund leads to a considerable reduction of the number of ex-ante financial capacity checks. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, only coordinators and participants requesting more than € 500 000 have to be checked, meaning that nine out of ten participants will not be concerned by ex-ante financial capacity checks (in FP6 all participants had to be checked). This is particularly beneficial for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups.</p>
<p>In addition, major investments were made at the start of FP7 into new systems and procedures like the unique registration facility and the new online negotiation system; both of which are now fully operational. The introduction of these new systems has indeed led to certain delays in negotiations of the first wave of grant agreements, but we are confident that these investments will pay off during the further course of FP7 and have an effect on shortening time-to-grant. The unique registration of legal entities is now an established process. As a result of the first wave of calls, more than 7000 entities are already registered in the central data base of validated entities and will not have to undergo this step in future calls, which will save a considerable amount of time and effort in grant negotiations. The new online Web tool for negotiations (NEF) is now fully up and running and allows an easy exchange of information between coordinators and project officers. More generally our efforts to improve information and guidance to potential beneficiaries will ensure better targeted, and better prepared, applications.</p>
<p>The process of processing and evaluating the many hundreds of thousands of applications received for the research programme is a complicated task requiring efficiency, rigour, independence and fairness. The new facility in Brussels which manages this process is already undertaking this task effectively. Commissioner responsible for Science and Research recently extended an invitation to members of the Budgetary Control Committee of Parliament to visit this facility in October 2008 to witness for themselves the process. This invitation is hereby extended also to the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0559"></a>

<p>In June 2008, an alarming study by the Catholic University of Louvain (UCL) was published concerning the health risks posed by electromagnetic radiation (mobile telephony, WIFI, antennae). The same month, writing in the French Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche, 20 international scientists called for caution in the use of mobile telephones. In the '13th Progress Report on the Single European Telecoms Market 2007' (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2008&amp;nu_doc=0153">COM(2008)0153</a>), I do not find any reference to the relationship between consumers and health.

<p>The Commission is aware of concerns of the public about exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from mobile telephony. It is also informed about the recent recommendations from a French group of 20 personalities and the outcome of a recent experiment led by the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. The Commission is continuously monitoring international research on EMF in order to fulfil its role of protecting the public from potential adverse health effects of EMF.</p>
<p>The matter is covered by Directive 1999/5/EC<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which covers radio equipment and the related health risks. The harmonised standards adopted under this Directive apply to all equipment and installations mentioned in the Honourable Member's question. The values imposed in those standards are based on the values listed in Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0-300 GHz), based on the best science available. Since 1999, the Commission has been monitoring its implementation regularly and has consulted several times its Scientific Committees to see whether it should be adapted in view of new scientific developments.</p>
<p>The recommendations of the French group are basic actions that can be taken easily by users to reduce exposure even more from the use of mobile phones if they so wish. As such, they are a sound way to apply a certain form of precaution.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) confirmed that for Radio Frequency (RF) fields, so far no health effect has been consistently demonstrated at exposure levels below the limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and proposed in the Council Recommendation. The opinions of the SCENIHR are public and available to the European Parliament. The SCENIHR is already updating its 2007 opinion upon request of the Commission and will take into account all new published research available.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to promote independent research in this area. The most recent call for proposals under the Environment theme of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research contains a topic on health impacts of RF exposure in children and adolescents.

<p>I have been contacted by a citizen who told me that he wanted bring his teas with him when moving back to Sweden from the USA, but was informed that there is a 100g limit on the import of (duty-free) tea. It is possible to apply for customs release for the shipment of personal and/or household goods, but he was not informed of this, and in any case this is limited for products with special restrictions such as tea.</p>
<p>It is logical and correct to have strict rules for goods such as alcohol, tobacco, weapons, etc. in order to protect public health, but I have problems in understanding why something as harmless as tea has such extremely stringent import rules.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain the background to these rules and why, for example, tea does not have at least the same 500g limit as coffee? Does the Commission have plans to relax the rules on the import of tea? Has Sweden applied the rules correctly in this case?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community provisions applicable distinguish between the conditions under which the goods enter the Community territory, as well as between customs duties, value added tax (VAT) and excise duties.</p>
<p>In case of a move from a third country, personal property is exempted from customs duties and VAT under certain conditions; notably, the goods must have been used at the former normal place of residence and must be intended to be used in the new normal place of residence, and the exemption does not apply to articles for use in the exercise of a trade or profession. The exemption does not extend to some specific goods, such as tobacco or tobacco products and alcoholic products. Tea however has no such special status and thus benefits from the exemption under the same conditions as other products. Excise duty on tea is subject to a different regime. Indeed, tea does not form part of the products to which harmonised excise duty applies. However, Community law does not prevent Member States either from levying excise duty on tea, nor does it provide for particular allowances in this field in the case of a move from a third country. Therefore, Member States levying excise duty on tea may in principle apply their national rules in the matter.</p>
<p>As regards travellers from third countries, the position is different. Here, the principle is that goods contained in the personal luggage are exempted from value added tax, from excise duty and from customs duty, up to a certain monetary amount applicable to the totality of the goods in the personal luggage (so far 175€). However, some goods are, instead, subject to quantitative limits. This concerns first and foremost alcohol and tobacco products. However, as regards VAT and excise duties, quantitative limits also apply to perfume, coffee and tea. In the case of tea, the quantitative limit is 100 g. The extension to these three latter categories, adopted in 1969, was due to the fact that at the time, a considerable proportion of Member States levied excise duties on them. Today however, this regime no longer reflects the real pattern of taxation of excisable goods in the vast majority of the Member States. Therefore, the Commission proposed on 22 February 2006 to abolish the quantitative limits applicable to these three product categories<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This proposal was adopted by the Council on 20 December 2007<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. As a consequence, tea will be treated as any other product and thus be subject only to the monetary limit applicable to the totality of goods contained in the personal luggage (value increased to 300€, and in the case of air and sea travellers to 430€). However, the new regime will only apply with effect from 1 December 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member that toys should fulfil the highest health and safety standards. There can be no compromise on the safety for children, the most vulnerable consumers. For this reason the Commission has initiated a wide range of legal and operational measures to ensure the highest level of safety of toys placed on the market in the Community.</p>
<p>On the basis of a Commission proposal of 14 February 2007 Parliament and the Council adopted on 9 July 2008 two legal acts on the marketing of products namely a Regulation setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and a Decision on a common framework for the marketing of products<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. These horizontal acts contain considerably higher requirements for product safety, including toys, such as enhanced obligations of economic operators, i.e. manufacturers and importers, for market surveillance, and for the treatment of detected unsafe goods. Their application will contribute to ensuring that toys entering the Community market are safe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission adopted on 25 January 2008 a proposal for a revised Directive on the Safety of Toys<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The Commission proposal foresees to strengthened safety requirements for toys, in particular to deal with the recently identified hazards, such as chemicals in toys.

<p>Recently the European Commission brought infringement proceedings against Spain on the grounds that its domestic law discriminated against non-resident EU nationals in relation to property sales and capital gains tax.

<p>The Commission decided to refer Spain to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty over its taxation of non-residents on capital gains realised on the sale of Spanish immovable property. The Commission considered that the Spanish tax legislation infringed the freedom of capital movement enshrined in the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Under the previous Spanish legislation capital gains of non-resident individuals were taxed at a flat rate of 35%, whereas residents were subject to progressive taxation when the fixed assets remained within the possession of the taxpayer for less than one year, and to a flat rate of 15% when the assets were realised after one year of possession. Thus, non-resident individuals were always subject to a substantially higher tax burden if they sold their property after one year of possession, and were so in most cases, if the property was sold within a year after acquisition.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Spanish parliament approved a tax reform through Law 35/2006, of 28 November 2006, published in the Official Gazette of 29 November 2006. The reform entered into force on 1 January 2007. One of the most significant amendments concerning the taxation of capital gains was the introduction of a flat rate tax of 18% on any capital gains. The Commission considers that this amendment removed any future discrimination in this field between residents and non-residents.</p>
<p>However, due to the fact that there are many non-resident citizens who have suffered from the application of discriminatory rules in respect of capital gains that have often accrued over a considerable period of time, the Commission decided to continue the infringement procedure when the new legislation entered into force as this legislation does not provide for satisfactory arrangements in respect of such pre-existing cases. The Court of Justice will decide whether the previous Spanish tax legislation infringed the freedom of capital movement enshrined in the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>It should be noted that even if an infringement procedure under Article 226 EC Treaty is opened against a Member State, any subsequent finding of an infringement by the Court of Justice has no automatic or immediate impact on the procedural position of individual complainants, since the Court procedure does not serve to resolve individual cases. It merely obliges the Member State to amend its tax rules in line with Community law. National courts and administrative bodies are responsible for ensuring that the authorities of the Member States comply with Community law in individual cases. Therefore, if citizens consider a particular measure or administrative practice to be incompatible with Community law, they are advised to seek redress from national administrative or judicial authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0588"></a>

The Commission services therefore provided a comprehensive overview of possible scenarios for the development of the ongoing State aid investigation concerning Szczecin Shipyard. The Commission services explained the conditions for the authorisation of State aid under the Community guidelines for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty as well as the consequences should these conditions not be met. The Commission services explained that in the latter case, as in any case of unlawful and incompatible State aid granted by any Member State, the Commission would have to order recovery of the State aid granted. To the question of Ulstein on how the State aid recovery claim would affect the sale of assets in a bankruptcy procedure, should the recovery order indeed lead to bankruptcy, the Commission services responded by explaining the established Commission practice and the case-law of the European courts on the treatment of State aid recovery claims in bankruptcy procedures.</p>
<p>The responses of the Commission services were based on the Notice from the Commission “Towards an effective implementation of Commission decisions ordering Member States to recover unlawful and incompatible State aid”<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Part 3.2.4 of this Notice concerns the treatment of recovery claims in case of insolvency of the State aid beneficiary.</p>
<p>The Commission can confirm that no suggestion such as described in the question of the Honourable Member has been made. The Commission services provided the Polish authorities present at the meeting and the representatives of Ulstein, on the request of the latter, with an explanation of the applicable Court jurisprudence and Commission case practice concerning the treatment of cases concerning rescue and restructuring State aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The political agreement on the fruit and vegetable market reform of June 2007 foresees specific provisions in relation to the coexistence of actions implemented under the operational programmes set out by the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for fruit and vegetables and measures implemented under the rural development programmes.</p>
<p>The principle of complementarity, i.e. specific provisions on coexistence, is foreseen by the rural development regulation. Also the implementing regulations of the Commission in the fruit and vegetable sector refer to that principle.</p>
<p>These provisions state as a general rule that no support can be granted under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to schemes that are eligible for support under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. However, where support under the rural development fund is exceptionally permitted for measures falling within the scope of common market organisations, such as the common organisation for fruit and vegetables, Member States shall ensure that a beneficiary may receive support for a given operation only under one scheme.</p>
<p>In order to provide this assurance, Member States shall describe in their rural development programmes the criteria and the administrative rules they will apply for these exceptions. A number of Member States had already defined such criteria and administrative rules when they prepared their rural development programmes for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>Where criteria and administrative rules have already been approved as part of the rural development programmes 2007-2013, Member States have to amend their programmes in order to take account of new rules introduced under the fruit and vegetables reform in relation to the National Framework for environmental actions and the National Strategy for operational programmes in the fruit and vegetable sector.

<p>Water is an irreplaceable and indispensable natural resource which, regrettably, is not available to all. According to a report by Transparency International, corruption in the water sector is the principal cause of the world water crisis which is threatening millions of lives and aggravating environmental problems. The report mentions problems from small-scale bribery connected with the supply of water to fraud involving funds for irrigation and dams, concealment of industrial pollution and the manipulation of policy on water management and allocation. According to the report, the influence of corruption on water is insufficiently recognised in development aid and food and energy supply. Yet it should be recognised, as more than one billion people worldwide have no guaranteed access to water and more than two billion people have no access to adequate sanitation.</p>

<p>The EU takes an extremely firm stance on this matter of corruption in the water sector, and views corruption as a major obstacle to achieving development goals.</p>
<p>The EC sees corruption as a symptom of poor governance and of a lack of transparent, accountable management and control systems. Corruption can not be tackled in isolation but needs to be integrated into development and poverty reduction strategies and into support to the processes of democratic governance. This means strengthening the role of civil society and the media, as well as protection for multiparty democracy and electoral competition.</p>
<p>The Commission has been participating – without being a member - in annual meetings of the Water Integrity Network (WIN), formed in 2006, which promotes increased awareness and understanding of corruption issues related to water. Transparency International is one of the founders of the network and the Commission is aware of its recent report.</p>
<p>In this context in the last two years the Commission has introduced the Governance Profile under the European Development Fund (EDF) 10, which enables an in-depth analysis of service delivery and governance of aid programming - including projects in the water sector - to address these issues. The new format of Country Strategy Papers for the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries locates the analysis of the questions related to the governance in the broader context of the analysis of the political situation and provides useful information on this subject. The aim is to facilitate the link between the analysis and the response strategy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is introducing a sector governance analysis framework encompassing the water sector. The framework analyses and addresses the issue of bad governance in our interventions and that includes the problem of corruption. In the water sector, the Commission is taking practical steps towards broader participation of local actors and the accountability through the promotion of integrated water resources management (IWRM). For 2007-2013, approximately € 180 million will be dedicated to IWRM worldwide through the EDF and the Community Budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0597"></a>

<p>Unfortunately, the question of the rules governing the use of driftnets in the European Union needs to be addressed once more. In the light of the decision adopted by the Commission banning the use of driftnets for salmon fishing in the Baltic, the latest legislative proposal from the Council and Commission is surprising in that it authorises the use in other EU waters of driftnets up to 100 kilometres long, together with a 5% shark by-catch, whereas nearly all shark species are protected. Will the Commission therefore answer the following question, which I have asked many times before:</p>
<p>Why is the use of driftnets not authorised in the Baltic, when there is no evidence of significant porpoise by-catches? This is totally inconsistent on the part of the Commission and is tantamount to discrimination between different fishing grounds.</p>
<p>How can EU legislation be reconciled with the United Nations ban on the use of long pelagic driftnets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The ban on the use of driftnets in EU waters has not changed and is clearly justified. When using driftnets, some cetacean bycatches such as porpoises or dolphins occur. Since no proven efficient technical solution has yet been identified, the only way to avoid such cetacean bycatches is to prohibit the use of driftnets.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted in June 2008 a proposal for new technical measures in the Atlantic and the North Sea. The main objectives of that revision were a simplification of the current rules which at times are too complex and too difficult to understand, along with a harmonisation of the main provisions, taking into account the distinctive regional nature of fisheries in those waters. In that proposal, there is no authorisation whatsoever for the use of driftnets which are and shall continue to be prohibited. There are some rules on the use of bottom set gillnets including a ban on using gillnets in depths of over 200 metres so as to reduce discards and catches of sharks. Nevertheless, the proposal allows the use of gillnets in depths of up to 600 metres where hake or monkfish are targeted.</p>
<p>In the Baltic Sea, the driftnet ban is a necessary conservation measure in line with the Community's Fisheries and Environmental Laws and with the existing international obligations for the protection and the recovery of harbour porpoises. In the last century, the incidental entanglements of harbour porpoises in fishing gears and particularly in driftnets were identified as one of the key factors behind the strong decline of the harbour porpoise population in the Baltic Sea. Whereas, harbour porpoises were present over the whole of the Baltic Sea in the past, they are today only found in the western part of the sea. Harbour porpoises are considered an endangered species and are listed under the Natura 2000 European Habitats Directive. Over the last ten years there have not been any signs of recovery according to the most recent assessments that have been made, although, there were still significant porpoise bycatches being reported within the Polish driftnet fisheries for salmon, over the last decade.</p>
<p>In contrast with the measures taken in other Community waters, the Baltic driftnet fishery was only banned with effect from 2008 instead of 2002, and only after a gradual adaptation period and the provision of financial support for fishermen to adapt to the ban and to change fishing gears.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0599"></a>

<p>Under Articles 136 and 137 of the EC Treaty, the European Community has competence to adopt legislation and take action to make improvements, in particular in the working environment, to ensure a higher level of protection of the safety and health of workers.</p>
<p>On that basis an extensive body of Community legislation has been developed with the overall aim of protecting workers' health and safety.</p>
<p>The central piece of legislation concerned is the Framework Directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work<span class="sup"> </span><a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It aims inter alia to introduce or improve preventative measures to safeguard the health and safety of workers and ensure a higher degree of protection (Recital 10).</p>
<p>The Framework Directive's scope is wide: in accordance with Article 2(1), it applies to all sectors of activity, both public and private (industrial, agricultural, commercial, administrative, service, educational, cultural, leisure, etc.).</p>
<p>Article 14 of the Framework Directive makes it an obligation to ensure that workers receive health surveillance appropriate to the health and safety risks they incur at work. Article 15 stipulates that particularly sensitive risk groups must be protected against the dangers which specifically affect them.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member's attention is also drawn to the fact that the Community strategy (2007-12) for health and safety at work provides that 'National and EU policies should help to create working environments and occupational health services which enable workers to play a full and protective part in working life until they reach old age.'<a href="#defann_54_3" name="refann_54_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>As regards the retirement age, the Commission would like to recall that the 2001 Stockholm European Council has agreed to set an EU target for increasing the average EU employment rate of men and women in the 55-64 age-group in the EU to 50% by 2010. The 2002 Barcelona European Council concluded that 'A progressive increase of about 5 years in the effective average age at which people stop working in the European Union should be sought by 2010.'<a href="#defann_54_4" name="refann_54_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the aims of the EU's employment and social affairs policy is accordingly to improve working conditions at every workplace in order to obtain a continuous, sustainable reduction of occupational accidents and diseases and to maximise the ability of individuals to work and so prevent early withdrawal from the labour market.</p>
<p>For these reasons, developing the concept of arduous, unhealthy work would not be in line with the objectives of the EU policy concerned as the approach is to achieve a healthy and safe working environment by means of prevention and improving working conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The seven waste transfer (WTS) the two recycling centres and the biological purification plant have not yet been completed. Responsibility for this lies with the authorities who have for decades been simply using the Tagarades waste disposal centre in the prefecture of Thessaloniki without building any landfill sites equipped with the necessary infrastructures to protect public health and the environment. When the Tagarades waste disposal centre ceases to operate within a few days, this will greatly increase the problems facing the residents of Thessaloniki, ever more so in the Assiros district.</p>

<p>Through Decision C(2002)4710 of 27 December 2002, as amended by Decision C(2008)3823, the Commission decided to grant Community assistance under the Cohesion Fund to the project for a ‘Waste disposal centre in the north-west zone of Thessaloniki and access road’. This project relates solely to the construction of the waste disposal centre and the related works as well as the access road. The final date for the eligibility of the expenditure is 31 December 2009.</p>
<p>Some of the actions mentioned by the honourable Member are actions envisaged by the Regional solid waste management plan and are not cofinanced by the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>As regards the work envisaged by the abovementioned Decision, the competent Greek authorities (Management authority of the ‘Central Macedonia’ operational programme) have informed the Commission that the test period for the operation of the landfill site (HYTA) situated in Mavrorahi, cofinanced by the Cohesion Fund, began on 7 June 2008 and will last for a period of five months. It should be noted that this test began after the completion of the work on the two waste recycling centres and the related infrastructure work as well as the site access road.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the information provided by the Greek authorities, the entire project as described in the Decision is due to be completed within the deadlines laid down in the Decision, including the construction of the leachate treatment plant.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities confirm that the additional work envisaged by the Regional solid waste management plan does not have any impact on the operation of the Mavrorahi landfill site. The completion of the network of waste transfer sites affects the way in which the waste is transported, not the operation of the site. The two waste recycling centres in Tagarades and Thermi are operational but have not yet achieved full capacity, while the Eukarpia centre is in the process of obtaining its environmental permit. Finally, according to the Greek authorities, the leachate treatment plant does not affect the operation of the landfill site since the plant should be completed by the time leachate production begins.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0609"></a>

<p>The effectiveness of aid provided by the Commission has been a subject of both internal and external evaluation. The aid effectiveness agenda as known today was launched with the Paris declaration of 2005 which included targets to be achieved and indicators to measure progress. Signatories to the Paris Declaration agreed on a Joint Venture on Monitoring Implementation. The results of the latest survey are currently being finalised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and will be presented at the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra in September 2008.</p>
<p>Tentative results from the survey data show that in the 33 partner countries, which participated in both surveys (2006 and 2008), the Commission made progress in the field of capacity building (better coordination of technical assistance and less use of parallel project implementation units), alignment with priorities of partner countries, predictability of aid and coordination of field missions and analytical work with other donors. Outstanding challenges remain increasing the use of country systems (for public finance management and procurement) and the use of common arrangements and procedures by increased use of program based approaches. The survey also shows that investment in public finance management systems in partner countries is paying off, as one third of countries have improved their systems. Furthermore, a quarter of partner countries were able to improve the quality of their national development strategies, and nearly one fifth of the countries were able to improve the related result based monitoring frameworks.</p>
<p>Measuring the effectiveness of aid is a medium to long term process and the next comprehensive review by the international community will take place at the Fourth High Level Forum in 2011. At this point, it can be better established whether the 2010 targets set by the development community in Paris have been achieved, and what the impact has been of more effective aid (by applying the Paris commitments) on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth.</p>
<p>In 2007, the OECD/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducted an extensive peer review of aid provided by the Community which recognised the Commission's leading role in the aid effectiveness debate and included important recommendations in the areas of budget support, use of parallel implementation units, untying of aid and the relationship with civil society.</p>
<p>According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data, GDP in developing countries has grown substantially in recent years: between 2000 and 2008 there has been an annual growth of between 3.8 and 7.9% for the group of "emerging and developing economies". For sub-Saharan Africa, a region consisting entirely of developing countries, the same figures are 3.8 and 6.8%. Clearly, country-situations differ substantially from one another.</p>
<p>There is extensive research and an ongoing debate about exactly to what extent aid assists in ensuring economic growth (see for example Dollar, Collier: "Aid Allocation and Poverty Reduction", JavaScript:WinOpen();" </p>
<p>). Aid helps release constraints to growth in many different ways. How immediate this influence is depends on many factors. For example, a country's development strategy might be directed more towards private sector development and building up productive capacity. In such cases, expected effect on economic growth would be more direct. Similarly, resources can be directed, for example, to health and education which, over the longer term, would have an expected positive effect on economic growth.</p>
<p>In any case, there can be no doubt that effective aid is more conducive to assisting economic growth than poor quality aid which overburdens partners with large transaction costs. While improving aid effectiveness, implementing actions and changing behaviour, including new arrangements in administrating aid, will, inevitably, take time, some elements of the aid effectiveness agenda should have a more direct influence on economic growth. Improving public financial management capacity by partner countries, for example, should have a beneficial effect on investments. Moreover, untying of aid should provide more possibilities to providers from developing countries to provide and develop their expertise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0611"></a>
