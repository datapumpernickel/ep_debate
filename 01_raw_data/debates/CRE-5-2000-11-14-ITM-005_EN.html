<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sommer (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I take a close interest in Turkey's accession prospects. I should like today to highlight Mr Morillon's call for a European-Turkish discussion forum in the House and for a debate on Turkey's accession prospects in the national parliaments in our Member States. This is important for Turkey, but it is even more important for the Member States themselves and for our citizens. Our governments agreed to Turkey's accession prospects in Helsinki. The people of Turkey were surprised by this decision and many still fail to understand it. This is because Turkey's own people have been offered no forum for discussion, with the result that the issue is being discussed subliminally, in ignorance and without any knowledge of the background to the Helsinki decision. This is giving rise to an anti-attitude which we cannot afford in the Union, given the large number of Turkish immigrants already living here, and which, given the increase in xenophobia, we must not afford.</p>
<p class="contents">My Turkish counterparts in the Turkish Grand National Assembly are also complaining about this deplorable state of affairs in which no-one wants to talk to them openly, no-one from the national governments or parliaments and, to all intents and purposes, no-one from the European institutions. Of course there are informal discussions, but there are, to all intents and purposes, no official meetings. One almost gets the impression that there is a sort of gentlemen's agreement to talk about Turkey's accession only behind closed doors. What is everyone afraid of? Was the Helsinki decision premature? The initial euphoria of the Council and Commission has clearly waned. Apart from declarations of intent, so far Turkey has made no fundamental progress towards meeting the political criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, there is even more need now, almost one year on from Helsinki, for Turkey's accession prospects to be debated in our national parliaments and with our citizens. We owe it both to Turkey and to our own people, and this sort of discussion will perhaps help to integrate the Turkish immigrants already living in our midst. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, if Turkey were a member of the EU, it would be the most populous Member State after Germany. It would be the first Member State geographically to bridge the gulf between Europe and Asia and to have a mainly Muslim tradition. Unfortunately, it is a country which is not only large but which also has an unstable feel about it when it comes to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">All these factors go to show that Turkey’s application for membership of the EU is one of the most important issues for the EU’s future. The Commission’s latest report on enlargement confirms that progress has been made but also highlights large deficits in terms of democracy, human rights and the treatment of ethnic minorities such as the Kurds. Turkey has not come so far as had been hoped. Torture is still practised, and the military plays far too large a political role. Turkey’s role in Cyprus is also unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">My role here is to represent the members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in the Committee on Budgets. It is, of course, economic considerations that are at issue. From an economic point of view, poverty, inflation and budget deficits are general problems, like the uneven social distribution of the results of economic progress. Major structural reforms are needed in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Seppänen’s report is about increasing the European Investment Bank’s powers and mandate to take action in Turkey. Seen from an institutional point of view, this issue is crucially linked to the Customs Union with Turkey, which has existed for many years. That Customs Union nonetheless needs to be strengthened by means of a special programme of measures from the European Investment Bank because the latter does not see Turkey as belonging yet to that circle of countries entitled to pre-accession aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We see it as a matter of great urgency for the EU, through the EIB, to support development so that Turkey might as soon as possible set a practical process in motion with a view to fulfilling the Copenhagen Criteria. That is why the demands for democracy and human rights must also find expression in the EIB’s financing activity. In practical terms, this is about the opportunities for granting loans for projects in Turkey amounting to EUR 450 million between now and 2004. Certainly, Turkey is already entitled to loans in a number of connections, but the Commission now wants to invest in economic development, especially where the infrastructure is concerned, in order to strengthen the country’s economic competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment on the procedure in terms of principle, leaving aside the point at issue. This is a consultation procedure, but it would be reasonable, of course, for it to be a codecision procedure because these decisions can in actual fact lead to the Budget's having to be adjusted. That particularly applies at this stage when we are progressively committing more and more of the EIB’s resources, but without fully covering the financial risks we are taking. When the EIB grants loans to countries other than the Member States, Parliament ought also to be consulted about the political priorities to be set in what is a part of the Bank’s activity mainly motivated by foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The immediate Budget problem is that there is a danger of there being no margin left in the guarantee fund reserve. We are increasing the Investment Bank’s commitments, but we are not increasing the EU Budget’s loan guarantee reserve to the same degree, and we have undertaken to provide 65% finance if a loan cannot be repaid. The residual guarantee fund reserve is now so low that it may prevent the Union from using the EIB as an instrument if new events should occur, requiring initiatives of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this concern, the Committee on Budgets nonetheless proposes that Parliament approve the Commission’s proposal. However, we back the rapporteur’s criticism that there is at present no effective assessment of the EIB’s loan operations and that there are deficiencies when it comes to public scrutiny and democratic control of the Bank’s activity.</p>
<p class="contents">If we shall nonetheless be voting in favour of the proposal, it is because we think it important to contribute to more positive development in those areas where Turkey is still falling down, especially the economic area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The challenge for Turkey in fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria is to reform not only the constitution but also its political and intellectual inspiration. In Western Europe ideas of pluralism and differentiated identities within the same State have led to recognition of cultural, linguistic and political rights and devolution. Turkey needs to adopt these modern European notions of diversity and the right to be different. The Kemalist ideology that was modern in 1930 is not so in 2000. Hence my amendments on the need for a political solution for the Kurdish people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that the Commission omitted any mention of the Kurds from the accession partnership document, though they have been referred to in successive regular reports and Mr Verheugen mentioned them this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Parliament and the Council will remedy that omission. It does not help Turkey or the European Union to fight shy of this issue, the biggest single cause of Turkey's poor human rights record. Until there is a solution for the Kurds there will be no fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria and I therefore call upon Parliament to pass my amendments, and on the Council and Parliament to insist that a solution for the Kurds is a key to unlocking the problems of Turkey fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While there is a special relationship between Azerbaijan and Turkey, this is far from being the case for Armenia, a country against which Turkey is maintaining a commercial blockade, which is not acceptable in a country which has been accepted as a candidate for membership of the European Union. The dispute relating to acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide should also be waived in order to enable diplomatic and trade relations to be normalised, especially as Turkey plays a key role in the project for the construction of an oil pipeline taking petroleum from the Caspian Sea to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.</p>

We all know how difficult it is under such difficult circumstances to deal efficiently with successive efforts to serve political, economic and other purposes and interests at the expense of principles and rules of law and generally using two yardsticks and two sets of scales.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the frankness which runs through the Morillon report deserves special mention, although fewer excuses at some points in the report would, I think, have reflected the factors used to evaluate Turkey's progress towards accession more accurately. In this context, I would like to reiterate the basic conclusion in paragraph 22 that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria and draw attention both to the fact that Turkey has been condemned on numerous occasions for acts and omissions in relation to human rights, democratic freedoms and its international attitude and to the European Parliament's recommendations that Turkey comply with the relevant European values.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, although paragraphs 9, 10, 12 and 17 expressly refer to infringements of these values by Turkey on numerous occasions, especially by the Turkish occupying army in Cyprus, which Turkey is called on to withdraw, the fact remains that it would have been preferable to roundly condemn Turkey's present and past responsibility for problems caused by its intransigence and the resultant impasse on the Cyprus question – where, it should be noted, there are clear signs of Turkey's intention to provoke a new heated crisis –, its failure to abide by international conventions with its expansionist policy towards Greece, its concealment of the historical truth of the Armenian genocide and its disregard for the fundamental minority rights of the Kurds.</p>
<p class="contents">Something along these lines might have been more helpful, including for Turkey, because it would have sent a more accurate message to the forces in Turkey which really do intend to modernise the country and it would have supported their efforts to put conditions in place which guarantee its European prospects, giving them serious arguments with which to convince the many sceptics that those prospects are, in fact, well-founded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the first serious step on the road towards Turkey's accession and the accession process can now move into the practical application stage. We, for our part, welcome this. Turkey, for all its differences, always was and still is an integral part of Europe. Old feuds cannot deny Turkey its place in the life of the Member States of the European Union. If Europe can accept Turkey for what it is and welcome it into the European family, with all its differences, it will, I think, have made a quantum political and cultural leap. It will have demonstrated that our values are catholic values which seek not to iron out the differences between the partners but to assimilate their differences and peculiarities.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in order for there to be assimilation, there must be common ground. Our rapporteur has identified and brought Turkey's attention to this common ground in his really excellent report, for which I too wish to thank him. The common ground is democracy and it presupposes freedom of opinion, i.e. equal human and political rights for everyone, irrespective of national origin, and the right to choose a government in free elections, in truly<span class="bold"> </span>free elections and only in free elections, something which is, of course, incompatible with autonomous centres of power, especially autonomous centres of excessive military power. What more could one ask of the Morillon report? Only, perhaps, that it might have stated more clearly at this point that there can be no democracy in Turkey and there can be no accession by Turkey unless the military is stripped of its excessive, constitutionally-protected powers. Democracy is compatible with institutionalised civil functions for the armed forces; it is not compatible with fundamental military intervention in political life, irrespective of whether or not it is sanctioned constitutionally.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only natural to expect a democratic country to display a peaceful attitude towards its neighbours, especially if they happen to be future partners. And from this point of view, the report is right to condemn the bombing of Kendakor by the Turkish air force and to highlight and reiterate the Turkish Government's obligation to support negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots without preliminary conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is worrying is that Turkish officials and the Turkish press seems to be taking a reactionary stand, rather than encouraging Turkey to move in this direction. I trust that Turkey will start to take a more serious view of things and understand just what its obligations are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These have been put forward by the TDI, GUE et al. I find them unseemly, ill-advised, untimely and inappropriate because these are amendments which use three words – "genocide", "Muslim" and "Asian" – in a way that is racist, derogatory and discriminatory and which causes impenetrable and false barriers to be erected against Turkey's accession to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Muslims follow one of the three Abrahaminic faiths. Islam is the brother of Christianity and Judaism. "Asian", in this context, is used as a racist term to be deplored and dropped. As regards genocide: Turkey is not responsible for the Armenian massacre. If we accept that, do we then place all of the Ottoman Empire's crimes against humanity at modern Turkey's door? Indeed, the UN Convention of 1948 has not been broadened to include the Armenian tragedy. Until that happens I do not think this Parliament should act differently. I welcome Turkey's careful progress towards the Union and I support the Commission and the Morillon report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unlike some others, I am not stirring up the religious argument in order to put off this prospect. This cannot, however, be just a formality. I am thinking, instead, of acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide of 1915. In the country currently holding the Presidency of the European Union, the French National Senate recently at last proclaimed this significant act of public recognition, two and a half years after the French National Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Acknowledging this act of genocide does not mean that the present-day Turkey is a barbaric nation. Quite the contrary, a nation only grows in stature by facing up to its past. How could Europe maintain its credibility with regard to the state violence perpetrated in the world today, even, at times, including genocide, if it were to embrace Turkey as a Member while brushing aside its history? Furthermore, the ongoing denial and repression of the Kurdish people is as appalling as it is unacceptable. The Turkish parliamentarian, Leyla Zana, winner of the Sakharov Prize, and in prison since 1995 merely for haven spoken in Kurdish within the Turkish Parliament, is still languishing in prison. These are facts that the European Parliament has highlighted on a number of occasions. There is no justification for our omitting them today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am myself the author of this wording in the form of Amendment 72, adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 10 October 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to address Mr Verheugen, as the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement, and also the French Presidency. Almost 40 per cent of Cyprus is occupied by foreign troops in the form of Turkish soldiers. Eleven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Nicosia is now Europe’s only divided capital. Historically, Cyprus – the island of Saint Paul and Saint Barnabas – has not previously been divided, but has now been so for 26 years due to a foreign invasion.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s four freedoms cannot be applied to the whole of Cyprus following the partition. Is it possible for Turkey to begin membership negotiations at all without the four freedoms’ being applied in Cyprus? Must not Nicosia become a united city and Cyprus a united country? Must not the occupying troops be withdrawn?</p>
<p class="contents">Previous speakers referred to the genocide in Armenia. This took place only 24 years before Hitler’s time and before the Second World War, when Hitler began the annihilation of the Jews. He himself referred to this genocide as if it were something forgotten. Turkey must come to terms with the truth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Morillon says that Turkey should try not to perceive the European Union as an exclusive Christian club which wants to keep it, Turkey, out. This premise presupposes that the opposite holds true within the European Union, i.e. that we are not an exclusive Christian club which wants, can or should exclude Turkey on relativistic religious or cultural grounds. The premise should be that a country with a laicistic constitution inhabited predominantly by Moslems which is based on the values on which the European Union itself is founded – i.e. freedom, equality and tolerance – could enrich the European Union. The European Union is not founded on religious values, it is founded on values which we owe to the Enlightenment and which, quite independently of the religious leanings of a person or a country and its inhabitants, find their way into the constitutions of the Member States and, as we have seen during today's debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, into the EU's perception of fundamental rights. This means that, as a democratic state under the rule of law with separation of powers and fundamental values as we understand them, Turkey will enrich the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, it is clear from Mr Morillon's report that Turkey is nowhere near meeting these demands. The Copenhagen criteria are, admittedly, economic criteria, but they are also criteria which are centred around precisely these points. The question is, how far have tolerance, democratic rule of law, separation of powers and respect for the separation of powers been put into practice in Turkey? And the answer is, as Mr Morillon's report makes clear, not far enough. Too little progress has been made and Turkey must do better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to turn to the Commissioner and the President-in-Office and ask them, given their level of support for the Morillon report – as they themselves have said –, why they were so lacking in inspiration and loath to include in the accession partnership which they formulated issues such as the Kurds, the Cyprus question and peaceful, non-threatening coexistence with Turkey's neighbouring countries, issues which have been left out of the basic debate with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Armenian genocide is concerned I fully agree that it should not be a precondition to Turkey's accession. However, the debate here is about what we have to say and what we remember.

In addition to explaining how far Turkey is from complying with the Copenhagen criteria, Mr Morillon also lists and enumerates what additional conditions Turkey must meet. They include the Cyprus question, the role of the Turkish army, especially the national security council, the all-powerful position of which is out of keeping with the principle of democracy, the Kurdish question, which is of paramount importance, and last but not least, the virulent conflict with Greece which Turkey must endeavour to defuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen has explained to the House that, first and foremost, the political criteria must be met. As you all know, our group was highly sceptical about Turkey's candidate status but we are delighted, now that Turkey has candidate status, that it is on the ball and has decided to engage in a process of reform in order to meet the demands of the European Union. Turkey is being responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention a number of economic criteria, such as the high rate of inflation which was over 100% and which is still over 50%, the high national debt as the result of the strain on the national budget from military expenditure and the military conflict with the PKK, high real interest rates, the continuing predominance of the public sector, huge regional differences in Turkey, a prosperity differential within Turkey of 1:10, which the European Union will never be able to bring under control, different educational qualifications, illiteracy, which still affects 27.6% of women, i.e. problems which Turkey itself must resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">The optimism of people such as deputy prime minister Mesut Yilmaz, who believes that the Maastricht criteria will be met as early as 2002, is to my mind exaggerated. Turkey must know that it has embarked on a difficult journey, that it will have to give up its sovereignty and will have to exert itself. We want to support it on this journey, not obstruct it and, above all, we want to keep our financial promises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since both Turkey and Cyprus are candidates for membership of the European Union, it is increasingly clear that a solution to the Cypriot question is becoming a matter of internal policy. Commission Verheugen has confirmed that the Cyprus issue plays a very important part in the discussions currently being conducted with Turkey. Given the political and military presence of Turkey in the northern part of the island of Cyprus, this could not fail to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mr Morillon, deserves our congratulations for stipulating that a solution to the Cyprus problem must be one of the preconditions for Turkey’s accession. ‘It is hard to understand today,’ he writes, ‘how it can remain divided by a wall, while in many other places such walls have crumbled over the past decade.’ In order for this outdated wall to be brought down, it is now essential for Turkey to comply with the Security Council resolutions requiring it to withdraw its occupying forces from the northern part of the island. Paragraph 17 of our motion for a resolution explicitly calls for this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that Turkey listened to the Turkish Cypriots, the great majority of whom wish to overcome the divisions of the past and join Europe alongside the Greek citizens of Cyprus. If, on the other hand, Turkey continues to fuel the separatist, even annexationist impulses of the unofficial government of northern Cyprus, then it will be responsible for causing the proximity talks to fail. In the medium term, an attitude of this kind would be an insurmountable obstacle to Turkey’s accession. One of the three conditions stipulated in the Morillon report, a condition that the European Parliament will be adopting, would still remain unfulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the Ankara Government has understood that the status quo is not acceptable to Europe or to the rest of the world, then considerable progress may be made: the island may be reunified, and a fair and lasting global settlement may be achieved tomorrow in compliance with international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But where is the real welcome for the Helsinki decision to accord Turkey candidate status? Where is the recognition in the resolution of the remarkable efforts, and I quote here from the explanatory statement that accompanied the resolution, 'the remarkable efforts that Turkey is making to adapt its structures to EU requirements'? In fact what a pity that Turkey was not discussed during the wider enlargement debate in the context of the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course peoples of Kurdish origins as well as other cultural and linguistic minorities must not be subjected to political, economic or other discrimination and must have the opportunity to express themselves freely, but this expression should be through entirely peaceful means and without intimidation and terrorism. We should remember that the removal of Turkey from the western orbit was a prime objective of Soviet policy throughout the Cold War period and that the PKK was supported as an instrument of this policy. Where is the demand in this resolution that the representatives of minorities should renounce violence? Civil peace is a prerequisite for investment and economic progress. Terrorism has been a barrier to such progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be clear that the resolution of extraordinarily difficult problems such as Cyprus, which requires the assent of all the people of Cyprus, will not be helped by frustrating Turkish progress towards accession. After all Turkey, along with Greece and the United Kingdom, is one of the guarantor powers in relation to Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">I detect increasing nervousness in this Parliament about the potential impact of the accession of Turkey on the Union. I might say there is increasing nervousness among the citizens of many of the current Member States about the pace and intensity of political integration within the EU and the leftist thread which runs through the fabric of this development and is increasingly visible. How much more desirable and acceptable would be the goal of a looser community of nation-states trading freely and acting in unison over a limited range of policy areas and how much easier it would then be to accommodate a country such as Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it will make it worse. The real purpose of the report finds expression in the draft resolution, with its references to Turkey's gross domestic product, the high level of trade with the European Union and the anti-grass roots, liberal, economic reforms to accelerate privatisation and strengthen the bases of a free market economy which the Turkish Grand National Assembly has passed at the request of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The enthusiasm with which the resolution welcomes Turkey's intention to commit military capabilities under the common security and defence policy is in keeping with the general tone of the report. In other words, we are talking about increasing the degree to which Turkey is subject to the economic, political and military objectives of big business in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not, of course, overlooked the positive references in the resolution, such as the reference to human rights, despite the fact that it mistakes manipulation of the status quo for progress and ignores the 10,000-15,000 political prisoners. There are also positive references to Cyprus, with the call for the occupying forces to be withdrawn, to the need to implement the decisions of the European court, as in the Loïzidou case, to the need for a political solution to the Kurdish question and to the bombings in Iraq. But we are afraid that, yet again, they are no more than a wish list. Why is none of this included in the European Commission's report?</p>
<p class="contents">For us, the basic issue is this: despite numerous allegations to the contrary, not only has Turkey failed to improve the standard of living of its people, in certain sectors it has made it worse since customs union in 1995 and the declaration of candidate status in 1999. There can be no doubt that the accession process and accession itself will reduce their quality of life, especially in the economic and social sectors. There can likewise be no doubt that any funding which it receives will be used to strengthen its oppressive instruments and encourage the regime to continue with its present policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, we fail to recognise the sovereign circles of the European Union as defenders of human rights. Their actions to date have proven the contrary, which is precisely why our feelings of solidarity with the people of Turkey force us to oppose its accession and, by extension, the reports which advocate it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Turkish Government has announced a whole raft of reforms. President Sezer has made a personal commitment to the process of modernisation in his country. I therefore think we must encourage the Turkish authorities to forge ahead in order to achieve the necessary compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria. At the same time, we must continue to be vigilant with regard to the actual implementation of the measures that have been announced. This, it seems to me, is precisely the balance advocated by Mr Morillon’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy adopted in Helsinki last December marked a turning point in relations between the European Union and Turkey. It is within this balanced framework that we shall have to resolutely continue our work to promote rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in conclusion, let me say: let us be demanding, let us be vigilant, let us set our terms but, let us not be excessive in our demands, as we too must live up to our commitments and the European Union made an important decision in Helsinki. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Several speakers have criticised the fact that the Commission failed to address certain problems. I can only assume that these speakers have not read the report, because all the problems referred to here, which the Commission allegedly failed to address, are dealt with in the report. Nor is it correct to say that the Kurdish problem was not called by its name. Where the report talks about the Kurdish language, Kurdish culture, Kurdish settlements, Kurdish parties, it calls them Kurdish. Anyone who says that the concept or the word "Kurdish" does not occur has obviously not read the report. I must defend myself against the impression created here that the terminology of the 2000 report differs from that of the 1999 report. It does not.</p>
<p class="contents">What is new is the accession partnership, and the accession partnership contains a very important stipulation: that the candidate country must deal with all the issues addressed in the progress report. In other words there is an internal link here. The accession partnership per se is a very balanced document, based largely on the Helsinki conclusions. Allow me to correct the erroneous impression, which one or two speakers are clearly under, that it is already a fact of life. We are at the proposal stage and I am not in a position this afternoon to tell you if this project will get beyond the proposal stage, especially if Parliament endorses proposals made here this morning and this afternoon. It is not my place to give Parliament advice or to criticise – nor shall I do so. My place is simply to point out any consequences which the decision may have. If you deal with the Armenian question in connection with the EU report – please read my lips: the Armenian question in connection with accession to the EU, then the project which we have discussed today will simply never get off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Helsinki conclusions on resolving the Cyprus question are changed along the lines called for by some speakers in the House, i.e. that accession should depend upon resolving the Cyprus question, the project will again founder. We changed precisely this last year with the backing of a large majority in the European Parliament. We have said in the past that it is not a condition and all we can demand of Turkey is for it to do its best, in all earnestness, to find a solution. However, we must never forget that it will take two sides to resolve this issue, not just one. That is why you cannot demand more of Turkey than serious, constructive, credible effort and you can only demand that a solution be found by those who have made resolving the problem their overall objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I feel that I should again point out that we made Turkey an offer with the Helsinki strategy. What we now need is to take the first step of the Helsinki strategy and I think it is unfair to evaluate this strategy as if it had already failed, even though the first step has yet to be taken. What we need now is to take the first step and it is your responsibility, as members of the European Parliament, to decide whether or not we can do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
