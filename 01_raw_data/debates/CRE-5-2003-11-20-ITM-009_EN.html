Tomorrow’s meeting of the Joint EU-Vietnam Committee in Brussels provides <span class="italic">the</span> opportunity for this. Just yesterday evening I had direct contact with Hanoi by telephone, from which extremely gloomy background information emerged. The Vietnamese Government is conducting a vigorous campaign against the Protestant Montagnards via television. They are called ‘separatists’ and are a ‘social evil’: at least, that is how the authorities in Hanoi interpret the constant protests of these ethnic minorities against the unabated removal of their social and economic rights – land theft, simply – and the discrimination and religious persecution by the ethnic Vietnamese, the Kinh, who consider themselves superior. Incidentally, this same government is screening off the central highlands to outsiders. Even local NGOs, backed by foreign co-financing organisations, are saying that they will shortly have to discontinue their aid to the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this depressing background, I ask that both Commission and Council show their ability to act. After all, they are investing a great deal of money in Vietnamese public-sector projects, so let them then ensure that that aid also benefits the oppressed ethnic minorities in the central highlands. Call in foreign co-financing organisations for this purpose. Urge strongly that the central highlands be opened up to foreign observers. Demand observance of the constitutional principle of freedom of religion on the basis of the international commitments that Hanoi has entered into.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meanwhile, in spite of all the oppression, the number of Protestants in the central highlands is growing unmistakably. This is an interesting point for the European Union and Vietnam to reflect on for tomorrow’s meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Vietnamese authorities have placed eleven dissident bonzes of the UBCV under house arrest for two years, including the Patriarch of the Buddhist Church, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, who has already spent twenty-one years in prison. This repression followed the first extraordinary assembly of the UBCV since it was outlawed by the communist authorities in 1981.</p>
<p class="contents">The UBCV, which is an important religious grouping in Vietnam, and was founded decades ago, is still not allowed to exist. The Hanoi Government has justified these detentions by using violations of national security legislation as an excuse. Vietnamese law authorises local authorities to place individuals under administrative detention lasting between six months and two years, without trial, in cases of attacks on national security. In actual fact, through their behaviour the Vietnamese authorities are contradicting their grand declarations in favour of reforms and democracy. I should point out that religious freedom is a fundamental right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the European Union/Vietnam Cooperation Agreement is based precisely on fundamental respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy of repression, not only of the monks of the Unified Buddhist Church but also of the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church, the Catholic Church and the Christian Montagnards must end. In fact, all of these religions are outlawed and have no legal status. Vietnam is a multiethnic, multicultural and multi-religious country. This diversity is a wealth that should not be squandered. The Hanoi regime must show good will and implement a series of concrete reforms, beginning with those that guarantee complete freedom of religion, and in this way launch a real process of democratisation. Then we will be able to have confidence in them once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The freedom to believe in a religion, or not to do so, is guaranteed. That is what Vietnam’s constitution claims; that is what the country has undertaken to do in a number of agreements, for example the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The reality, though, is something else. Worshippers, priests, monks and eminent religious dignitaries are harassed, persecuted and locked up. State recognition is denied to such faith communities as the Montagnard Christians or the Hoa Hao Buddhists. Vietnam’s United Buddhist Church was banned in 1975; its Patriarch was interned for 21 years and was released only in 1998 following international pressure. Much hope was kindled when he met the Prime Minister in April of this year, but, following these conversations, the authorities stepped up their action against the adherents of this church and of other religions.</p>
<p class="contents">In October, the Patriarch and his deputy were placed under house arrest, and many of their followers were sentenced to two-year terms of imprisonment. Cooperation between the European Union and Vietnam is founded upon the absence of any restriction on the exercise of human rights, as is stated in our cooperation agreement of 1985. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly condemns the latest acts of repression. If the Hanoi Government does not want to jeopardise its cooperation with the EU, legal status must be granted to all churches, and people interned for their religious beliefs must be set at liberty. We urge the Council and the Commission to use all diplomatic means to make religious freedom a reality in Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Commissioner Kinnock, to use your personal influence to make this issue central to tomorrow’s meeting in Brussels between the representatives of Hanoi and those of the EU’s Commission in the EU-Vietnam Joint Committee. We believe that Parliament needs to send a delegation to Vietnam to examine the situation on the ground and have talks with office-holders of all religions.</p>

If a country’s human rights situation is poor, it is likely to be seen first among religious groups. It is among these that we can test to see whether human rights concerning freedom of speech, freedom of association and assembly, and the freedom to practise a religion are in place or not.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Vietnam demands the attention of the international community. The EU has to send a clear message that discrimination against, for example, the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Protestant congregations and dissident groups must cease. These members of communities practising a peaceful religion have suffered deprivation of freedom and house arrest. Furthermore, the original mountain-dwelling minority Christian community has been continually harassed, arrested and imprisoned by the Vietnamese Government.</p>
<p class="contents">A precondition of economic cooperation between the EU and the communist republic of Vietnam has been a respect for fundamental rights and the principles of democracy. In violating these principles Vietnam is violating and harming itself, and the EU must now clearly indicate that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that criticism of the Vietnamese communist party is automatically viewed there as a threat to the state itself. The practice of fundamental rights such as expressing one’s opinion can even be loosely interpreted as espionage on the basis of specific law on national security. From the point of view of human rights it is also worrying that those accused are considered guilty before commencement of trial, and that trials almost without exception are declared secret.</p>
<p class="contents">A state ruled by law needs clear and precise laws that guarantee equality and legal certainty for all. In no case can a state ruled by law be built with laws that permit racial, religious or political discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to remind you that there was still some hope that the meeting that took place in April, to which Mr Mann has already referred, between the leaders of the Vietnamese State and the patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), could lead to greater understanding on the part of the State as regards religious freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we must clearly accept that these hopes have unfortunately proven to be quite unfounded. The situation has not only failed to improve but has actually worsened from all points of view. The Buddhist patriarch is under house arrest and, what is worse, the pagodas belonging to the Buddhist church have been locked up, in a blatant attack on the most important principle of the Buddhist church. At the same time, the pace of death sentences handed down and of executions carried out by the regime has picked up, and is already more than twice that seen in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, I wish to reiterate what has been said here and urge the Commission to make our voice, the voice of the European Union, heard loud and clear in Vietnam in order to ensure that religious freedom and the principles of universal human rights are respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe – and Mr Casaca said this – that Parliament is tired of having to return to the issue of Vietnam, it is tired of lies and promises from the Hanoi Government, and I do not feel we can continue in this situation. Yesterday, the US congress adopted a very similar resolution to that which we will vote on in a few moments, and I feel that is another demonstration of weariness from the other side of the Atlantic. The issue is in the Commission’s hands. We are quite aware that there are problems in the Council, in which one State known as ‘the birthplace of human rights’ is cultivating some imperalistic nostalgia, is paying a great deal of attention to the sale of <span class="italic">Airbus</span> and harbours extremely bizarre anti-American opinions. This is an established fact, which should be clarified. I am sorry to say that the Council and the Member States are often absent from this House.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still the issue of the Commission: tomorrow the Joint Committee is meeting – the Commission and the Hanoi authorities – and it should be then that the Commission, which has a programme assigning tens of millions of euros in aid for legal reform in Vietnam, raises the issue of the legal status of the Unified Buddhist Church and other churches. The Commission should make the Hanoi authorities understand that if there is no progress in this specific area then cooperation aid will be suspended immediately. I believe that without a strong gesture from the Commission in the meeting tomorrow, this umpteenth Parliament resolution will be useless. I expect a very specific reply from Commissioner Kinnock on the approach that the Commission is going to take tomorrow in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even then, there were many who told us that the work we were doing had no prospect of success whatever, that it was pointless, and that what we were doing would get us nowhere. Today, there are among us observers from various countries – Mr Landsbergis was also at the ceremony earlier – who can tell us that debates like the one we are having today changed the practical conditions under which they were held as political prisoners, and that, most of all, they gave them hope in political terms. Today, too, we are on the threshold of the enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let that give us courage when we debate Vietnam. It is a topic that we have often discussed, and, alas, the people named in the resolution – some of them important religious leaders, are still in jail; human rights activists are still being suppressed, and peoples are still enslaved. We should, however, recognise that the time is coming when the wind of freedom will blow through Vietnam. We in this European Parliament must not relent in campaigning for human rights and for the freedom of religion, even if there are those who tell us that this is unrealistic and bid us talk business instead.</p>
<p class="contents">We are under the great obligation of living up to our tradition and our name as Europe’s Parliament. We appeal to the Commission and the Council not to fail at this hour. Vietnam is an important partner, both in political and in economic terms. As a country, it has suffered appallingly through wars, intervention by outsiders such as Europeans, Americans and the Soviet Russians. Like Germany, it was a divided country; it endured a Communist regime and suffers its effects to this day, but it will be able to become a stable partner to the European Union only when it has become, no longer merely an economic factor, but a free state under the rule of law, a democracy in which freedom of faith and conscience prevail, and we ask you, tomorrow in Brussels, to employ your energies without reserve so that it may become that!</p>

I also echo what Mr Posselt said, that no one in this House or anywhere else should fail to understand the critical importance of free people in free institutions, communicating their concern about those who are not free and who suffer because of their efforts to observe or assert their own opinions and beliefs. Everyone in this House, myself included, has had many encounters with people who have suffered grievously for the beliefs they hold and for resisting oppression. It always comes as a great inspiration to hear from them that, even in the darkest hours, in the deepest jails and in the worst conditions, they had their spirits lifted by messages from outside.</p>
<p class="contents">The admired Socialist philosopher Aneurin Bevan said that each freedom is only made safe by adding another to it. So, when we strive for freedom in Vietnam, we are striving to secure our own freedoms and those of other people around the world. It is always encouraging to see the enthusiasm and energy Members of this House devote to that cause.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has an overall policy towards Vietnam, with which the House is familiar. It is to encourage and support continued progress, with respect for human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns where abuses occur or where the situation is evidently deteriorating. The Commission works closely with the European Union Member States in monitoring human rights developments in Vietnam and participates in all EU Troika approaches to the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure the House that the Commission and the Member States have repeatedly urged the Vietnamese Government to respect political and religious freedoms and strengthen economic and social freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 1 of the European Commission-Vietnam Cooperation Agreement of 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis of our cooperation. As we informed Parliament on 15 May, this allows the Commission to discuss human rights issues with Vietnam, for example in joint Commission meetings held under the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Since that debate six months ago, the Commission has proposed further reinforcement of the EU's human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government, in the light of the EU's experience with dialogues in other countries. That proposal, which has been accepted by the Vietnamese side, aims to encourage and support the continued commitment of the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues. So far agreement has been reached on the dialogue, which will include all departments with responsibility for human rights-related matters, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Public Security and the Office of the Prime Minister. While the Commission cautions that sweeping changes cannot realistically be expected, we look forward to further incremental steps that start to meet our concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights dialogue with Vietnam is taking place on two different but complementary levels: the EU-Vietnam dialogue on human rights between EU Troika missions in Hanoi and the government, which will next convene on 26 November, and the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission, which is to take place tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We also note that Vietnam’s parliament, the National Assembly, has expressed an interest in entering into a constructive dialogue with this House on these and other issues. Far be it from the Commission to suggest how Parliament should respond, but I know it will seize eagerly on any opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the state of religious freedom in Vietnam, the Vietnamese Constitution <span class="bold"></span> as Mr Mann reminded us <span class="bold"></span> enshrines the freedom of religion as a basic freedom of the Republic. However, that freedom is limited <span class="bold"></span> and some would say contradicted <span class="bold"></span> by other specific laws. We hope that these restrictions will be relaxed and we have made that case explicitly and repeatedly to the Vietnamese authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Belder mentioned, there are reports of increased harassment of some Christians <span class="bold"></span> especially Montagnards and Hmong Christians <span class="bold"></span> since the uprisings in the Central Highlands in 2001. It is alleged that local authorities have tried to force highlanders to renounce their deeply held beliefs. If they looked at history, they would see how fruitless such efforts have been throughout the centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The House is aware of the renewed detention of some leaders and members of the unrecognised Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. The European Commission and Member States have expressed their concerns over these events, and have called upon the Vietnamese Government to resume the dialogue initiated earlier this year between the UBCV and important members of the Vietnamese administration, including the Prime Minister, to restore the hope of a solution acceptable to all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by emphasising that it is clear to the Commission that Vietnam would be best served by continued and more rapid progress in the country’s reform programme, so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and appreciates the value of accommodating dissent. Those vital elements of liberation still have to be secured in Vietnam. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not understand. There is no progression; rather, there is regression in Vietnam. The question is simple: is the Commission prepared to introduce tomorrow as ‘conditional’ in the negotiations with Vietnam the issue of granting legal status to the churches that are not recognised? There is no freedom of religion in Vietnam. We must therefore take a stand. You are encouraging the lack of reforms with millions of euro from European taxpayers. We cannot continue like this. Either money is provided for reforms, and the reforms are implemented, or else none is provided. I think that that is the question to which the Commission must respond. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that Mr Dupuis is, quite justifiably, passionate about this issue. I would simply say to him, without softening the attitude of the Commission at all, that in our efforts to try and secure protection for human rights and progress towards greater democracy, the setting of litmus tests is not always well advised. I can certainly see the direct and straightforward arguments for setting such tests. What we have to evaluate is whether that would help achieve the greater objective of bringing about the advances we all want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, European taxpayers' money is going into development and cooperation in Vietnam. That is because people's lives would be blighted and even endangered if that aid was not provided. Consequently, whilst I understand the argument for conditionality and in many cases would take that to its logical conclusion, the Commission cannot be certain that that approach would, in these circumstances, lead to the outcome that Members of this House and of the Commission would want. This requires very delicate judgment. We have to continue to exercise it in the fashion familiar to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
