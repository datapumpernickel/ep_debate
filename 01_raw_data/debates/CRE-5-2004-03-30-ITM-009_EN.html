<p class="contents">I am grateful for the constructive approach shown by Parliament and the rapporteur to a number of elements in this highly technical legislative proposal. They know that this proposal can help the European Union to meet its Kyoto commitments. Fluorinated gases, as defined in the Kyoto Protocol, accounted for 65 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, that is, 2% of the total EU greenhouse gas emissions in 1995, but are forecast to increase to 98 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent – from 2% to 4% – in 2010 under business as usual.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in the refrigeration and air conditioning sectors there is a strong upward trend in the use of fluorinated gases due to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Our proposal addresses these rising trends. This proposed regulation, by introducing cost-effective mitigation measures, could reduce projected emissions by around 23 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2010 and obtain even greater reductions later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goodwill (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, we are all familiar with the principle of substitution, the substitution of a more environmentally friendly or more healthy product for another one which is environmentally damaging or damaging to health. In many ways the use of fluorinated gases has already exhibited the principle of substitution, given that many applications that were previously used with CFCs have been substituted with HFCs. As we know, CFCs are much more environmentally damaging than HFCs, being ozone-depleting gases which we have very successfully grappled with under the auspices of the Montreal Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">HFCs are greenhouse gases like CO2 and, as the Commissioner said, whatever action we take on control of fluorinated gases, it cannot be at the expense of the action we need to take to control CO2. HFCs are a drop in the ocean in relation to CO2.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I would like to make a point about the legal base. There has been much discussion about this, but I am firmly of the opinion that Article 95, the single market, is the correct legal base. If we were to use Article 175 it would make marketing of products containing these gases almost impossible across the whole of the European Union. Whilst I understand the situation, for example, in Austria, where they have gone further, in the interests of the single market we should maintain the legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of applications of HFCs, from air conditioning to air-sole trainers and to aerosol fake snow, for example, which we had a little bit of fun about in the press at Christmas. But this proposal is primarily about containment, not banning. In fact there are a number of applications where no alternative is possible, for example fire protection and the use of sulphur hexafluoride in switch gear. If we were to go along with one of the proposals that the Verts/ALE Group made, the lights would go out all over Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to vehicle air conditioning – and it is one side-effect of global warming that more people have air conditioning in their cars – the proposal was to replace HFC134a, with a global warming potential of 1300, with the more environmentally benign HFC152a, with a global warming potential of 140. I can see people in the gallery already nodding off, and that is why Parliament decided that we should take a bold step to actually phase out the use of HFCs in air conditioning and substitute them with the new developing technology involving CO2.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Commission's proposal there was a very complex quota system which looked as if it should start in 2009. In practice, however, as 20% of the vehicle fleets of most manufacturers are not fitted with air conditioning, these manufacturers would have met the first step of the quota system without doing anything. So actually the Commission's proposal would have started in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The quota system is complex and would only have worked very well with a company that had a range of products which fitted conveniently into these 20% steps. Most manufacturers do not have a product line-up that fits in quite that way. And of course there was a massive loophole in the whole system, a loophole big enough to drive a Rolls Royce through, in that manufacturers could as an alternative pay a 200 euro fine for not complying with the directive. I suspect the manufacturers of some large expensive cars would do that rather than spend money on re-engineering.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the fact that HFC152a is flammable, which may cause some problems with regard to safety. That was not the final solution, and we think that using CO2, maybe a little bit later, would be a much more effective compromise. That is why I am very pleased that the PSE Group has prevailed on me and made me see sense and that we have Compromise Amendment No 112, which says that, based on type-approval, we should phase out the use of HFCs and substitute with CO2 from 2012, with a two-year exemption, or two-year delay at least, for some of the smaller manufacturers – what we call the Porsche exemption –, moving towards CO2, which is a much better goal, not only environmentally, but politically too.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need some changes to the first line of Annex 2, which I am sure the sessional services will take care of if the compromise amendment goes through, substituting '50' for the global warming potential and putting type-approval in.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all air conditioning systems are mobile: some of them are in stationary applications such as buildings like this one. This monstrous waste of taxpayers' money is cooled using HFCs! In the case of buildings, it is important that we control leakage, and inspection and control of leakages are included in the Commission's proposal, which we support. But we should also reward good practice by reducing the number of inspections where leakage is not occurring, as well as stepping up the number of inspections where we have leaks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Mr Lange and Mrs Corbey for making me see sense, and Mr Davies for finally coming round to our way of thinking. It has been a very interesting journey and I just hope that the people in the gallery do not think we spend all our time talking about these boring technical subjects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The brevity of colleagues today has brought this debate forward slightly to the point where I was not quite expecting to be called to speak so early. Nevertheless, perhaps we can finish before the dinner break.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Goodwill, who has written a good report and taken on board many of the comments and remarks made by colleagues. We are moving towards a document which will carry to the Council many of the points that we have raised and will be a sound basis for further work in the next Parliament. As a Geordie to a Yorkshire man, I have to say, 'Th'as done good, lad'.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved. I hope we can get unity in this House for the change of legal base to a double legal base. It makes sense. In many respects this directive has two purposes, both to regulate the industrial market and also to protect the environment. We are trying to protect the environment, to remove from use, gradually and steadily, fluorinated gases, or Fgases as they are called. Useful though they have been to replace CFCs, HFCs themselves present problems, particularly with their global warming potential, and we have a responsibility to gradually reduce their use, but in a way that is logical, not too expensive, and where there are proven and viable alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Our biggest step forward and our biggest technological push is unquestionably the replacement of HFCs in car air conditioning systems. These systems are produced in their millions, their leakability is notorious – I know of colleagues at home who have had to have their air conditioning systems refilled two, three or four times. I do not accept that the solution is simply to reduce the number of leaks. The solution is to move to a different kind of gas that does not present the problems that HFCs clearly do in that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards uses in other areas, there are some key and essential uses and we want to examine them carefully before we move forward with an amendment that originated with me – Amendment No 89 – which asks for an orderly phase-out over a period of time after this directive is brought into force. I hope the Commission can agree to that amendment. It gives it flexibility and a task to perform, but in a steady, logical way for which it will no doubt come back to this House for approval.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not immediately be looking to remove HFCs from fire-fighting uses, where they are clearly very useful and the alternatives are, in my opinion, not yet proven. We will not want to remove the ban from refrigerators, where there are certain medical uses which are essential. The motto with this proposal is 'forward, but with a degree of prudence'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Montreal Protocol was an attempt to eliminate CFCs, as these gases are harmful to stratoshperic ozone. The report before us is necessary because HFCs are not entirely harmless either: they are powerful greenhouse gases. Their global warming potential is a hundred or even a thousand times greater than that of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, it can take a very long time for these gases to disperse in the atmosphere. Accordingly, the danger of climate change means there is also an obligation to restrict the use of HFCs.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself was active and put forward the amendments on air conditioning systems in vehicles in particular. My own view is that the best solution with regard to overall emissions is to switch to systems that use carbon dioxide. According to a recent news item, a certain Japanese car manufacturer has already switched over to the use of this technology on the production line, and European manufacturers ought to follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Carbon dioxide is, moreover, user-friendly, because it reacts faster than HFCs to the desired temperature and is also cheaper in terms of fuel costs than the alternative gases available. The slightly higher price at present of carbon dioxide systems is marginal from the point of view of the consumer price of air conditioning equipment, and when mass production starts, the economies of scale will ensure that its relative cost may start to change.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromises proposed by our rapporteur and agreed by the committee are not entirely in harmony with my own amendments, but I can accept them as an improvement on the original proposals. I think the timetable that will now be adopted is too slow from the point of view of climate change, especially as there has been a dramatic increase in the use of air conditioning in vehicles in recent years. All in all, then, the role of private transport in combating climate change is more important than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">With stationary systems it is essential to ensure that those who fit the equipment are properly trained and that such professional people produce reports on leakage. In this way it will be possible on the one hand to minimise emissions and, on the other, to make certain that reports are in fact produced, which is vitally important from the point of view of monitoring. In this respect imposing restrictions will hopefully swiftly make an impact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, our work is becoming increasingly more specific; we are now also taking real measures. On behalf of my group, I would like to state that we are generally satisfied with the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I would therefore like to thank Mr Goodwill very much for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have before us is a balanced result. In the battle against climate change, emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases must be reduced as much as possible. We therefore wholeheartedly support the committee in its attempts to tackle the biggest sources of emissions. These are refrigeration and air-conditioning installations, mobile air-conditioning installations and foam products.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things still require some attention. After much discussion, my group would like to be a little more flexible with regard to the gases in fire protection systems. The emissions from these are extremely low and are only released in the event of a fire. In our opinion, consumer safety is a very high priority. We would like to ban fluorinated greenhouse gases, but only in cases where this is actually possible and where there are alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">A large proportion of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases stems from the use of air-conditioning in cars. We have paid a great deal of attention to this, and rightly so, and in this regard I would like to thank Mr Goodwill again for his willingness to compromise. Many people are not aware of the negative impact air-conditioning can have on the environment and our climate. The fact that the use of air-conditioning increases fuel consumption in the car is far more widely known. In many countries, including my country, the Netherlands, it is actually unnecessary to have or to use air-conditioning. It is different in southern countries. In view of the negative effects of the fluorinated greenhouse gases in air-conditioning, I would like to call for them to be phased out as soon as possible. I personally would rather see this by 2009 than by 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">What is certainly important is that we choose Article 175 as the legal basis. Member States must have the opportunity to take further-reaching measures, particularly in view of the geographical differences and the fact that air-conditioning is superfluous in northern countries. Member States must therefore have the opportunity to discourage air-conditioning in cars. Perhaps we should go even further in order to limit the installation of air-conditioning in cars. For example, the Commission could take a look at energy efficiency requirements for cars with all the on-board equipment switched on full, as these luxury accessories in particular cancel out any improvement in the energy efficiency of engines. That is definitely not a good example of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we would like the result achieved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to be accepted by the plenary session, with some amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The committee has rejected some of the key proposals from the Commission on mobile air conditioning. I hope it has made the position for the car industry clearer. However, I am not sure that the way in which we have thrown out some of the opportunities for flexibility is really the most appropriate course of action, so we shall wait to see what the Council of Ministers has to say about that and, no doubt, return to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of all, I regret that the Socialist Group and the European People's Party have done this deal on pushing the date for the introduction of vehicles using carbon dioxide back to 2011 from the original proposal of the committee for 2009. That is not ambitious enough, certainly not for a first reading, when we have so many negotiations yet to come. I know it takes manufacturers many years to design a vehicle to put on the market. A few years ago no one used air conditioning – I have never bought a car with air conditioning. What do we say to future generations? We did not take action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and global warming as fast as we could, because we all wanted to drive around in cooler cars in the summer. However convincing the industry's arguments may be now, they will look pretty weak in years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has not done nearly enough. It could and should have done a lot more to replace enormously powerful greenhouse gases with environmentally less harmful alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I disagree with Mr Goodwill on the legal base. I still believe that Article 175 is the necessary and logical legal base. As far as mobile air conditioning is concerned, it is disappointing that the committee has failed to take note of those parts of European industry that are already committed to delivering CO2 mobile air conditioning as soon as possible. The technology is there and it works well, so there is no reason why a phase-out of F-gases cannot begin in 2007. Beginning this phase-out two years later, as the current draft report provides for, would mean pumping the equivalent of an additional 80 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Whilst the proposed phase-out for mobile air conditioning is at present unacceptable, there is no phase-out provided for at all for the use of F-gases in many other applications where alternatives are available. I believe that should be remedied. That is a serious omission. Domestic refrigerators using HFCs are left untouched by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy's report, despite EU markets already being dominated by hydrocarbon, greenfreeze technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will vote to support alternative, climate-friendly technologies and take the big opportunity that stands in front of us to do something serious about the environment, rather than letting the single market ride roughshod over these very important concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that Mr Goodwill did not read our amendments more carefully. Far from leading to the lights going out, the Green amendments specifically called for the phase-out of SF-6 with the exception of switch gear. So let us have a debate based on the facts, not on the myths. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we have ended up looking in the right direction, especially as regards the issue of air-conditioning in cars, about which something has to be done, and, for the benefit of, among others, our visitors, let me say that what was agreed in Kyoto is binding in law within the European Union. What the decisions of 2002 and of 10 March this year mean is that this is binding in the European Union whether Russia ratifies or not, so we too have to do something about this. I think the facts are there for all to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The first fact is that more and more cars have air-conditioning; it is fitted in 80% of all new vehicles, and every year these units discharge between about 8% and 10% of the gases that damage the climate. The second fact is that alternatives of various kinds are in the process of development. I think it is perfectly clear that we have to go down the road of seeking out the safest alternatives possible with the absolute minimum of global warming potential. Thirdly, that alternative is in fact a CO2-based air conditioning unit with a global warming potential 1 300 times less than at present. Fourthly, I believe that we have to adopt the same approach to the type approval of new cars as we do to everything else, as construction, involving the energies of engineers, plays a part in that, and we have to demand, as soon as possible, new air conditioning systems. Fifthly, CO2-based air conditioning systems are European technologies and European products, which, I think, also makes it apparent that, if we move on down this road, from f-gases to CO2-based air conditioning systems, the air-conditioning system of the future will indeed no longer be a climate-killer; on the contrary, the air conditioning unit of the future can also be a hit where European jobs are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission also welcomes a number of amendments that strengthen the provisions on containment and inspections and the training and certification of personnel involved in containment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to say that this proposal is only a first step. The Commission has indicated that it will look at a number of other issues, such as foams. Consequently, it cannot accept the amendments on recovery, in particular in relation to foams. Further action needs to be based on the careful assessment of the benefits and the costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can the Commission accept amendments that would either weaken the proposed inspection system of air conditioning and stationary refrigeration or put in place additional requirements as regards training and certification of personnel, both for the Commission and the Member States that have not been evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">An important part of this proposal is the reporting system, which will enable the Commission to check the accuracy of emissions reported to the UN Convention on Climate Change and to support possible further action. The Commission proposal tries to ensure that the necessary information can be collected without imposing too onerous a reporting system on industry, especially SMEs. In this context, the Commission cannot accept a number of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that its proposal on use bans and the phase-out of some products and equipment containing fluorinated gases is based on a careful evaluation of all sectors and is balanced and cost-effective. Consequently, it cannot support the amendment that would remove the derogation for small magnesium dye-casters using less than 500 kg per annum. The cost for this limited number of small and medium-sized enterprises to convert to an alternative would be high, hence the exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other bans that deserve comment. The deletion of the ban on perfluorinated carbons in fire fighting cannot be justified since, apart from some minor uses, the market has already moved to other alternatives. As regards aerosols containing fluorinated gases, the new definition would exclude a number of novelty aerosols, while the inclusion of pharmaceutical aerosols in the exemption category could be a big loophole.</p>
<p class="contents">On the sensitive issue of the phase-out of the fluorinated gases in mobile air conditioning in vehicles, the Commission notes with interest the amendments to ban fluorinated gases, essentially HFC134a in mobile air conditioning in new vehicle models from 1 January 2009, and that a ban should apply to all new vehicles from 1 January 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission prefers to remain with its overall position on mobile air conditioning, given other amendments that reject the quota system and ban all fluorinated gases used in mobile air conditioning with a global warming potential over 50, rather than 150, as proposed by the Commission. The latter would effectively exclude the use of fluorinated gas mixtures or HFC152a and favour CO2 mobile air conditioning systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the legal basis, the Commission is proposing that the regulation be based on Article 95 – the internal market – and cannot support amendments that propose that the regulation be based on a dual legal basis. The Commission believes that while the environmental objective of reducing emissions of fluorinated gases is paramount, the main thrust of the proposal is more relevant to the functioning of the internal market and Article 95.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to underline that the Commission supports many of the amendments proposed for the first reading, and Parliament, by acting so quickly, sends an important message to the Council that there is now a need for increased focus on this proposal with the aim of reaching a final conclusion as quickly as possible. I will hand over to the secretariat a list summarising the Commission's position on each individual amendment<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.
