<p class="contents">Allow me to draw your attention to the principal elements of the Commission's proposal to replace the framework directive of 1989 on materials and articles in contact with food. First, the proposal extends the scope of the regulation to include innovative types of packaging, known as 'active' and 'intelligent', and provides the general legal framework for their safe use. It sets the general principles of safety and labelling and allows for additional rules, if necessary, to be adopted in implementing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the proposal will ensure better traceability and labelling of materials and articles intended to come into contact with food. Third, it increases transparency and legal certainty for operators, by describing the procedure for the authorisation of substances used for food contact materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal will give the possibility to adopt not only directives, but also decisions or regulations, as the latter are more appropriate for certain provisions, such as lists of authorised substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is in the interests of both consumers and industry. It would enhance harmonisation of different sectors of materials in contact with food, including recycled materials and active and intelligent packaging. I am grateful in particular to Mrs Thors for her intense efforts to adopt the proposal in first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports these efforts. We can therefore accept all amendments that are part of the compromise package that is the result of close contact between the three institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thors (ELDR) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, we are about to see the approval of a framework for our food packaging. It feels almost like a symbolic act because we have almost concluded all the legislative work surrounding the Green Paper on Food Law. After everything else we have successfully resolved, we are now to create an overall framework. I hope we succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise that we are concerned here with approving the principles that are to apply to material that comes into contact with food. We are not approving new materials as such, but saying how matters should proceed. In my view, the fact that we are laying down guidelines and establishing limits for what is to be approved is an example of good legislation. In the future too, packages will on many occasions have to be expressly approved in the light of the particular substances and food they are to be used for. For example, what is the fat content of the food with which the material comes into contact? I can guarantee consumers that we shall continue to be cautious so that, for example, phthalates are not released from soft plastic.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said, there are three principal new developments: the new administration, and thus transparency, resulting from the setting up of a European Food Safety Agency; the new principles incorporated into food legislation; and, finally, the opportunity to approve active, intelligent packaging. A majority in Parliament appears to be prepared to accept active packaging, that is to say packaging that can absorb oxygen and moisture in the environment or give off antioxidants. Research projects carried out demonstrate, for example, that tomatoes and fruit retain their proper form for longer in the active packaging. Correctly used, I believe that they can in actual fact lead to fewer additives. That would be an advantage, because we are concerned about a possible link between additives and the increasing number of allergies.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally prefer active packaging around my bread. I myself came across an unopened package after two years and found the bread completely unchanged. As we said, active intelligent packaging should entail advantages for both consumers and manufacturers. I can also envisage situations in which such packaging helps us save energy, something which would of course be of value.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the conditions of our approving the new types of packaging is that they should be compatible with Community legislation generally. The substances that have been allowed into food must be approved, and active packaging must not be misleading to consumers. A bad smell must not be covered by another smell. Intelligent packaging can provide us with information about the way in which food has been stored and thus show whether it has been stored suitably. We know, for example, that certain smoked food can be difficult to store in the right way. Let us hope that, in the future, intelligent packaging will be developed that shows, for example, how smoked fish has been treated and whether it has been treated properly. We know that, in this connection, problems have sometimes arisen involving listeria.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said, we shall have discussions concerning the recycling of material, for the requirements have become stricter when it comes also to the use of plastic, metal and paper in packaging. It is important for new regulations, backed by this regulation, to be adopted and for us to know with certainty that food packaging needs to be approved to ensure that it is safe.</p>
<p class="contents">More rules concerning traceability will be adopted, supported by, and in line with, the previously adopted legislation. In its work, Parliament has tried to emphasise that the information to be preserved is that which is needed for investigating problems that may arise later. I also believe that the rules on traceability that we are now laying down are important if all the parties are to have equal opportunities to be suppliers to large chains of food stores. I am pleased that we have set out clear rules governing the language used and public access to records. That aspect of the Commission’s proposal was not entirely clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Had there been more rules on the subject of unambiguous, binding regulations to promote sound administration, we should probably have avoided a number of amendments. That was not, however, the case. We therefore need to clarify matters here and now. For my part, I regret the fact that the Council and the Commission did not wish to approve the independence of the Food Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can adopt this report at a single reading. That would be the case if we were to vote in favour of blocks one and two. That would be in keeping with the position at which we had arrived in our negotiations with the Council and with what COREPER approved last week. I see no reason, however, for approving Amendment No 17.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation. Above all, I wish, however, to say a big thank you to the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as to our helpful official, Mrs Köykkä, for her excellent work. It has been a pleasure to collaborate with her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it would be a very good idea to round this off in a first-reading agreement. It is a fairly technical dossier, but I think that we will get a fair distance with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market makes it necessary to harmonise regulations for the food industry and for packaging. New developments require new standards. Active and intelligent materials and objects are just such new developments. Active materials interact with food in order to maintain or improve the condition of the food during its storage and to extend its shelf life. Intelligent materials are being designed to provide information on the condition of food. A possible development is a packaging material that changes colour when the milk in it turns sour or the food in it begins to perish. These are all interesting developments and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy wholeheartedly supports the Commission’s proposals, although it does have a few comments on these developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, active and intelligent materials must not be used to mislead the consumer. The opportunities to do this exist, but we would like to state very emphatically that this is not the intention. Secondly, traceability is necessary, but our committee believes that this need not go all the way back to the tree from which a paper bag is made. A good system is sufficient. Thirdly, the consequences for trading partners must not be inequitable, and no unnecessary trade barriers should be erected, particularly for developing countries. I understand that some solutions have been put forward in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is calling for the barriers to the use of recycled materials to be eliminated. We cannot have a situation in which recycling is encouraged on the one hand and recycled materials are not permitted onto the market on the other. Food safety is of course the yardstick in this area. In short, our committee wants to see modern technologies being used for the benefit of the consumer and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It confirms my already high opinion of her parliamentary talents. She will be a sad loss to this Parliament when she goes back go Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have an active and intelligent packaging of a Commission proposal. It has received broad support in our committees and in the responses from the Council and the Commission, which I found to be entirely constructive. If we could do this more often, everybody's life would be simpler. However, there were certain questions that we had to raise. One was the extent to which traceability would be possible. I am glad that Mrs Thors took on board my own amendments. I accept her advice that we should not vote for Amendment No 17. Had she told me to go the other way, I would have done. I believe that the issue of public openness on this matter is one we should take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that some of us are slightly concerned about – and it comes up time after time in these debates – is the precise role of the European Food Safety Authority. Time after time the mantra comes up that there will be a reference to EFSA, that it will do this or that. We were due to have heard from the chief executive of EFSA this week. That has been postponed. Where we are moving towards greater food safety, safer food packaging, better labelling and so on, we should not require EFSA to do all the work. Where there is a measure of derogation built into this, all of the Member States seem to be reasonably happy with it. Where the Commission has done a good job, we should move ahead and see how far the existing institutions can do it for themselves.</p>

<p class="contents">We are fairly sceptical about the active and intelligent materials. We nevertheless believe that the compromise is sound overall because it constitutes a clear improvement upon the original proposal. That is a constructive step along the road.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to emphasise that, in our opinion, traceability is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even though the rapporteur has attempted to improve the labelling rules, the decision-making procedures, including the procedure for authorisation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and access to public documents, the report, as it stands, is still unacceptable to the Greens. Whereas Community legislation on food additives is regulated in great detail, the Commission's proposal simply introduces a general procedural framework, putting great emphasis on comitology. The door is left wide open for the introduction of active packaging, without providing a strict framework for specific substances.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been fighting for a very long time against the ever-increasing exposure of consumers to a whole host of additives and we refuse to let these become more widespread, which would be damaging to health. The Greens therefore request that authorisation should be withheld from active packaging whose effects are not known, that it should be ensured that there are no toxic products in active packaging, and that Community legislation on food additives should be applied strictly if new food packaging is authorised. If our proposals are rejected, we will be obliged to vote against this report, which does not adequately consider the possible consequences for consumer health. How long will it be before we see urgent recalls of certain future types of packaging? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After only three months of fruitful collaboration between the three institutions, we are very close today to a first reading agreement. If this is achieved, it will certainly be a record in terms of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Thors in her earlier contribution made reference to the near completion of the work that we have been undertaking – the necessity to put in place the legislation referred to in the White Paper on food safety. I am happy to say that we have nearly completed that work. Perhaps we can reflect and congratulate ourselves on our hard work over the last four and a half years when we have worked well together to achieve these results.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand Parliament’s wish to accelerate the Commission’s proposal on recycled plastics. I also appreciate the clarifications provided on certain aspects, notably on traceability, the authorisation procedure and the provisions on active and intelligent packaging.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I am pleased to accept the entire compromise package. I think I am correct in saying that this is Mrs Thors' last report, so let me congratulate her on it and on her work in Parliament and wish her well in her future career. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome the revision of Framework Directive 89/109/EEC, and thank Mrs Thors for her good cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party has called for a number of crucial amendments in order to make packaging, and thus also food, safer in future. Much as the proposal for a labelling system using the legend ‘suitable for food contact’ or the symbol of a stylised glass and fork is to be welcomed, we demand that an exception be made for items that it cannot be doubted are intended for contact with food (for example, cups, glasses, etc), thereby avoiding excessive bureaucracy. We also welcome the extension of the traceability principle to the materials used, although this must not result in over-regulation; it would, for example, be nonsensical for every item of paper packaging to have to indicate the origin of every tree. As these are always mixtures, this is not technically feasible. Provided that the plenary agrees to these demands, the Group of the European People’s Party endorses the compromise negotiated with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
