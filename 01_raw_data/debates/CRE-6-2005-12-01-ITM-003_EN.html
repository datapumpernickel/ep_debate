<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zsolt László Becsey (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(HU) </span>We are debating two issues, and I shall start with the minimum standard VAT rate. We are debating an issue of extreme legal and political sensitivity. According to the Commission’s report, an extension of the current temporary regime based on the Sixth VAT Directive – which expires on 31 December 2005 – would be justified. What I mean is that we could set the minimum standard rate only, at the current level of 15%, and extend this regime, still with a temporary effect, to 2010. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of our Parliament has debated this proposal, and basically agrees with the approach of the Commission. Accordingly, we too agree with the proposal and with its time frame, namely with the extension to 2010. We also accepted the necessity of having to debate this issue with extraordinary speed, before the last ECOFIN session on 6 December, to enable the Council to have the opinion of Parliament and make a decision in view of it. Based on the debate of the Committee, we amend the original proposal tabled by the Committee in respect of one issue, namely that apart from the minimum standard we would also like to set the maximum rate at 25%, which would be the highest rate currently used in Member States; this would avoid any of the Member States having to resort to legislation amendments or budget course corrections in the very short term. However, by adopting this course of action, the majority of our Parliament indicates that we believe in the necessity of preventing divergence of standard VAT rates. However, our Parliament has also adopted another significant position on this issue, which does not affect the current prompt decision of prolongation, but it is important to us. We would actually like to avoid a situation similar to the current one, where we are pressed for time both in respect of the extension of the minimum standard VAT rate and the intensive employment regime expiring at the end of the year, which has been implemented with the involvement of several Member States who have all gained valuable positive experience in the process. Therefore we ask the Commission to prepare a study by the beginning of 2007, to enable Parliament to start a debate in 2007-2008 in good time, without any rush, concerning the direction and depth of the VAT policy to be implemented by Member States, and the European Union regulation required in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In our request proposal prepared with the participation of all parliamentary factions, we ask the Commission to evaluate the current standard implicit – that is, converted to one rate – VAT level differentials and their budgetary implications, particularly in respect of the differentiations seen in Member States joining the EU during the last enlargement, which are unable to apply the individual reduced rates, and can only effect transition to the special areas not included in the Sixth VAT Directive (that is, not included in Annex K or Annex H) until 2007. Based on the material to be prepared by the Commission, we will be able to define our parliamentary position on the issue of VAT charged at source or charged to the consumer, and then examine whether or not, in the spirit of subsidiarity, we need to set a minimum and a maximum rate at Community level, and if the answer is yes, whether we should use the normal standard or implicit – that is, the actual converted – rate for these VAT rates. Another further issue to be debated by Parliament in the following years in light of the efficiency of the Stability and Growth Pact is the extent of freedom to be granted to Member States for the possible reduction of VAT rates, and whether the standard rates or the individual exemptions from standard rates are most likely to distort the market (if they distort it at all). At the same time, we could also examine the issue of whether the priority given to consumption tax – at the expense of direct taxes, and mainly taxes affecting the workforce – can actually assist Member States in achieving the Lisbon employment targets. These would be the issues of the next debate, for which sufficient time should be allowed. I am convinced that a good background report prepared by the Committee may assist Parliament with this issue, and we will be able to accept a considered position even before 2010, but at this point we still propose extension, with the amendment that we must also set the maximum rate, at 25%.</p>
<p class="contents">My second report concerns VAT refunds. The amendment to the Eighth Directive, tabled before us, is part of a highly significant, triple amendment package tabled by the Commission in October 2004, the effect of which has been – rightly – extended by the current Commission, and which has become famous for the single-window system, the so-called ‘one-stop-shop’. Parliament has already adopted a position on this issue, as well as on tax cooperation between Member States, in connection with two reports tabled before Parliament, and now I am pleased that at the request of the Council we are also able to express our views, even if retrospectively, on the Eighth Directive addressing VAT refunds. First of all, I would state that we fully agree with the approach of the Commission to the entire draft package, including the amendment to the Eighth Directive, as this helps enterprises collect outstanding VAT from other Member States, and it also speeds up this process by the use of electronic methods. So far, collection has only been possible if an entity was VAT registered in another Member State. Many refused to follow the extended and costly procedure, and in the majority of cases outstanding VAT has not been collected at all, because the administrative procedure would have cost more than the actual amount of outstanding VAT. The current amendment will primarily improve the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which had the most difficulty in sustaining the apparatus required for refunds in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach of the Council allowing a period of three months for the competent authorities to assess a claim is also small-enterprise-friendly. We also support the proposal that a very stiff, one-month late penalty fee must be paid by the competent tax authority for each month after the expiry of the time limit. We did not accept the proposed amendment that would have left this to be regulated individually by Member States. Our amendment proposals have also been formulated in line with this approach of the Commission, as we have emphasised that alongside enterprise protection, the tasks of Member State tax authorities must also be stated clearly, with rectifications where required, and specific time limits for forwarding, consideration, decision making and refund. This is the content of our amendments. We also specified separately that the three-month investigation period cannot re-commence even in the event of queries, requests for additional information or any other problems – as we have understood from the Commission’s proposal – as in our opinion the full procedure cannot exceed four months even in the presence of such problems. Our proposal aims at avoiding unnecessary delays in the refund period and keeping the moneys in treasury funds. Although for legal reasons we were unable to include this in our opinion as a formal amendment proposal, I still hope that as part of the package, as part of the overall OSS package, the speed of cooperation between authorities will increase, as this helps avoid cash-flow problems for small enterprises, problems related to VAT refund entitlement and the determination of ratios, and even abuses, because fraud and the formation of fictitious companies very often arise from an attempt to reclaim fictitious export VAT.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the course of the Council debate, the 10–40-day time limit for electronic data forwarding, given to tax authorities in the country of residence, may be shortened in respect of the upper limit of 40 days. However, the priority is to implement the package as soon as possible, and we hope that in a few years (we asked for four years in connection with the OSS) we will be able to evaluate implementation based on the Commission’s report. I am convinced that the procedure (and the screening of abuses) may be speeded up in the future by using some kind of a shared database – or by easier access to the databases of other Member States – but this will require the settling of a large number of legal, data protection and other issues, which should be looked into following the first evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, at present, the most important thing is that this constructive proposal is put into effect as soon as possible, and that our enterprises may enjoy its benefits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards, in fact, the reduced VAT rate system in labour-intensive sectors, we are in an economic, social, political and legal situation that is unpleasant to say the least, if not downright complex.</p>
<p class="contents">We are today faced with a system that has been extended twice. Thereafter, a proposal by the Commission dating from 2003 was submitted to us, of which the Members of our Parliament voted almost unanimously in favour on 4 December 2003 and which has since been blocked by the Council. Very often we are told that better regulation implies Parliament’s working more quickly, but I sometimes get the impression that we should also see how things take place from the Council’s perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">We are here in the realm of unanimity and, while certain Member States will intervene strictly on the basis of national interests by exploiting VAT rates, they are blocking the extension of this system at the Council, a system that has proved its worth. In fact, this system enables us to sustain employment, to combat undeclared work and to organise the tax system more coherently at the level of the Member States. That is why our committee wanted to table this oral question, by means of which we fully support both the Commission’s initiative and the successive efforts of the Luxembourg and the UK Presidencies, both of which have put on the table a compromise proposal that is totally in keeping with the wishes expressed by this Parliament from 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have our backs to the wall: this twice-extended system will expire at the end of the year and, in nine Member States, entire sectors still do not know, at this very moment, which tax system will be applied to them as from 1 January of next year. We are today on the eve of an ECOFIN Council at which, I hope, the Ministers for Economic Affairs and Finance will hear the very loud signal this Assembly wants to send out to them through this oral question, as well as through several written statements, which have been submitted at our Parliament’s Registry and signed by a large number of Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The Luxembourg proposal, taken up by the UK Presidency, enables what was, until now, a simple experiment to be clarified, simplified, harmonised and brought into widespread use. For the construction sector and the home care services sector, it is primarily a matter of prolonging the reduced VAT rates. It is a matter of extending a more flexible mechanism and of making plans for this mechanism to be extended until 2015. It is a matter of coherently discarding what is included in the notorious Annex H. On the initiative of the UK Presidency, it is a matter of evaluating the entire mechanism every five years. It seems to me that we have here before us balanced proposals that will make it possible, I repeat, to sustain employment in labour-intensive sectors – that is where the coherence of the proposed fiscal mechanism comes in – to combat undeclared work and to contribute to what is in line to become the leitmotiv of this House – and, I hope, beyond this House, of the Council – namely, better regulation and the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me once again to say to the Council, even though I see that it is not represented in this House this morning, how important it is to obtain the agreement of the Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance. I believe that solidarity, which must also govern this College’s work should, at the very least, if the Luxembourg and UK proposal were sadly unable to obtain unanimous approval, lead to a further one-year extension of the system as it stands. This would be the ‘least worst’ solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had some traffic problems but now I am here and I will let you know the position of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, for his two reports, and to Ms Berès for the oral question on such an important issue which is very close to my heart. I will first comment on the proposal on the minimum standard VAT rate. I will continue with comments on the oral question and the motion for a resolution concerning the reduced VAT rate. Finally, I will comment briefly on the eighth VAT directive proposal, which is part of the one-stop-shop package on which an extended debate took place in this House back in September.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thanks the European Parliament for the quick handling of the minimum standard VAT rate proposal and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, for his active and positive contribution. This proposal needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency as the present rules come to an end on 31 December 2005. The absence of a timely decision would imply a legal gap in EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules concerning the standard VAT rate currently in force combined with the transitional system mechanisms have functioned so far to an acceptable degree. It is therefore appropriate to maintain the current minimum standard rate at 15% for a further period of five years in order to cover the ongoing implementation of the strategy to simplify and modernise the current Community legislation on VAT.</p>
<p class="contents">For your information, the proposal has received a positive reaction from the European Economic and Social Committee. The committee has acknowledged that in the current environment – i.e. the rule of unanimity – the Commission’s proposal is the best way forward. I would like to stress that, while I fully understand the concerns of the honourable Members regarding the absence of a decision in the Council only one month away from the expiry date for the reduced rates for labour-intensive services, I do not think that the current proposal can be used to solve this problem. Therefore I would very much urge honourable Members not to make a link between this dossier and the discussions on the scope of the reduced VAT rates which are currently being held in the Council on the basis of the Commission’s 2003 compromise proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the oral question and the motion for a resolution concerning the reduced VAT rates on labour-intensive services. I would like to thank you for putting this question to the Commission. I am conscious that this issue is of high concern to the public and to business. I am also very much concerned about this issue as the current regime to apply reduced VAT rates on labour-intensive services is due to expire at the end of this year. I very much appreciate the UK Presidency’s efforts to find a compromise on reduced VAT rates. This issue was discussed at the Ecofin Council on 8 November and will be discussed again on 6 December. The absence of a decision by the Council before the end of this year on the application of reduced rates to labour-intensive services would be a very bad outcome. Businesses are very concerned as they need legal certainty. I can assure you that the Commission will do its utmost to help the Presidency reach a conclusion on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into details about the Presidency’s compromise, I want to explain the difficulties that have arisen in previous debates on this issue. Some delegations reject any extension of Annex H as a matter of principle. I must say that I do not really understand that position. The reduced rates listed in Annex H are optional, so that, apart from a few categories in respect of which reduced rates are largely applied throughout Europe, there are already today huge disparities between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take into account the numerous specific derogations granted to some Member States, these disparities become even bigger. Restaurant services are a very good example. Currently half of the Member States apply reduced rates to restaurant services by way of specific derogations and this has not given rise to any complaints or distortion of competition. Why not, therefore, give the opportunity to all Member States to apply a reduced rate in this sector if they wish to do so? Some Member States press for more subsidiarity. The budgetary impact of applying additional reduced rates also comes into play. In my view only very few sectors are really relevant in this respect. In principle, only restaurants and construction services might have a significant potential budgetary impact. For instance, regarding the building sector the Council could explore criteria for restricting the scope of the reduced rates in order to limit the possible budgetary impact for example by limiting the reduced rate to buildings over a certain age.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to underline the economic importance of the building sector. You know that the Commission has always been doubtful about the positive employment effects of introducing reduced VAT rates. This is still the case. Nevertheless, we have to realise that at least in this sector the VAT rate plays an important role. In contrast to the reduction of the rate, its increase by the reintroduction of the standard rate could well lead to an immediate increase in prices for consumers. This would have negative consequences for employment and could even encourage the black economy in the Member States concerned. I am aware that businesses, the Member States concerned and the European Parliament have great concerns in this regard. Therefore I consider that there are good political and economic arguments to allow at least the preservation of the status quo in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are some conditions. First, only locally delivered services should be added to the existing scope of the reduced VAT rate provisions. The extension of reduced rates to new categories of goods should be avoided, as the risk of creating distortions of competition is too high.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the mere prolongation of the existing experimental reduced rates for labour-intensive services is neither viable nor desirable. Although I was initially tempted by this solution, we have to recognise that it is an illusion to believe that a mere prolongation has more chance of being unanimously adopted by the Council than the compromise currently under discussion. Furthermore, this experiment has been limited to nine Member States and a mere prolongation would only prolong the unequal treatment of Member States. I have to stress that the Council has already had more than two years to reach a decision. It should not duck its responsibilities yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the compromise must be fair in the sense that it should represent a step towards the equal treatment of all Member States. In my view, the UK Presidency proposal for an initial extension of the time-limited derogations for the new Member States to 2015 would precisely contribute to this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some of the honourable Members might not entirely agree with this line, especially as regards the extension of the labour-intensive services. Let me, therefore, take this opportunity to remind them of the fact that when the Council agreed on the second extension of the reduced rates for labour-intensive services for two more years, the Commission considered that the same possibilities should be offered to the new Member States. At the time of the pre-accession negotiations, the possibility of applying reduced rates to labour-intensive services was not considered relevant since the experiment was due to end on 31 December 2003, i.e. before EU enlargement. Therefore, the extension of measures constituted a new element calling for a review of the situation. The situation is clearly not the same as it was in 2003 and it is therefore exceedingly unlikely that the Council will – as it did previously – unanimously request that the Commission propose an extension. In addition, a simple extension of the labour-intensive services experiment offers no solutions for the widespread demand to also include restaurant services in the scope of the reduced rates, because currently they are not in Annex K.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I consider it to be imperative that the Council should now draw up the lines of a viable compromise with a view to a political decision in December during the last Ecofin meeting under the UK Presidency. However, the Commission is in the hands of the Council and we can do no more than help the Council as much as possible to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner responsible for taxation, I can assure you that the Commission is prepared to do its utmost and show the maximum flexibility during the Ecofin meeting on 6 December in order to help reach unanimous agreement on the basis of the UK compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment briefly on the eighth directive proposal. On several occasions I have underlined that one of the ways of attaining the Lisbon Objectives is to reduce cross-border administrative burdens and compliance costs in order to facilitate Community-wide activities by businesses. Today it will be possible to take the next step towards this objective. The proposal which is tabled today is part of the larger package known as the one-stop-shop scheme. The other parts of the overall proposal – the simplification measures, whereby taxable persons can discharge their VAT obligations in the Member States of establishment, and the rules containing the exchange of information between Member States – were adopted by this Parliament in September. This part of the proposal aims at reforming the VAT refund procedure for traders who have to reclaim their VAT in a Member State in which they are not established. An entirely electronic procedure will replace the current burdensome paper-based eighth directive refund system. As a result of the new proposal, it will become possible to speed up the VAT refund procedure substantially. This will be of particular help for small and medium-sized enterprises. In this respect I welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur, although I cannot accept the proposed amendments. Most of the issues are actually already covered by the Commission’s proposal on the one-stop-shop package. I therefore invite you to support the original position of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I am eager to listen to your opinion on the three VAT dossiers on the agenda of this meeting and in my closing remarks I shall take a position on the amendments that have been tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we can use all the optimism we can get in VAT legislation, because whilst everyone is full of better legislation and good governance, we notice the opposite is true in two of the three topics that are on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the simplification of the regulations on VAT refunds to those liable to pay tax who are based in a different Member State. Enterprises, including the smallest among them and also all SMEs, will now all be given the opportunity of actually claiming their money back within an acceptable period of time. Those of us who are members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can only endorse this.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also, however, the proposal to extend the threshold of the normal VAT rate. It is, of course, a good thing that this extension should be proposed, and we support it, but we do find it a bit dramatic to introduce a measure of this kind less than 30 days before the deadline arrives and the successor enters into effect. Anyway, everyone knows what is coming. A decision will be taken at a later date, after which everyone will be able to relax for another five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Worse, though, are the difficulties – and I cannot describe them as anything else – surrounding Annex K and, indirectly, also Annex H to the sixth VAT Directive. The experiment involving the reduced VAT rate for labour-intensive services has been running for double the amount of time originally planned. The Council just cannot manage to make an assessment and take decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The sectors to which we, the Commission and Parliament, had, in 2003, held out the hope of a reduced VAT rate – the hotel and catering industry, the building industry, but also laundries and garden maintenance businesses – all these sectors remain wanting. The Council is not saying ‘yes’ and it is not saying ‘no’; the Council is taking no decisions and is absent from this Chamber. We are creating uncertainty, and uncertainty is detrimental to economic development. This, at a time when we are desperate for growth and more employment, is unacceptable. Commissioner, we are counting on your support in the debate with the Council. For the rest, we fully endorse the two Becsey reports and the resolution linked to the oral question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, let me pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, who has fought his way through this difficult subject matter and who has now become our VAT expert in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. We endorse his report and also what others have said about the VAT refund. It really is vital that this should be introduced more quickly and in a simpler way for companies that operate transnationally; otherwise the internal market in Europe is a farce.</p>
<p class="contents">The other report is to do with the oral question that we have tabled and the deadlines within which certain matters must be dealt with. I completely agree with Mrs Thyssen when she says that it is ridiculous that now, with only one month still to go, there is still uncertainty, particularly in the labour-intensive services sectors, who still do not know where they stand. The Commissioner is beyond reproach in this; it is the Council that is the legal body with responsibility for this and it cannot manage to lay down a regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I stand here as one who speaks up for those labour-intensive services. Ideally, I would like to see them incorporated in Annex H, namely in the structural solution. I hope that our appeal here in this House will, in any event, be the last nudge needed to secure an agreement, and that time will be found for this to be debated next year. I, for one, am in favour of having this discussion on a much broader footing. I think that the whole debate about the shift from indirect to direct taxation, something which your Prime Minister, Mr Verhofstadt, has once again made very explicit reference, has everything to do with the way in which we deal with those VAT rates in a structural manner.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I join Mr Becsey in saying that I am not in favour of formulating a maximum rate in this interim period and that I am all for making the possibility of using those low rates structural. If you want to bring about a shift from direct to indirect taxation, which can indeed be very advantageous, you also need to differentiate the rates. Low rates apply on social grounds, employment grounds, and in order to regulate and prevent moonlighting. Those are all elements that should be factored in. Higher rates should, perhaps, apply to certain luxury or environmentally-polluting factors.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this structural discussion should really be held next year, and I hope that this Commissioner can give the initial impetus for this. I hope that the Member States will not each time hide behind the unanimity rule and the option they have to put up all kinds of blockades and to conclude underhand deals. I follow Mrs Berès in what she said earlier when I say that I do not consider this to be good governance or good legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are discussing a tax with pan-European significance. Although the European Union does not share a common fiscal policy, the value-added tax is a key source of funding for the European Union’s budget. It was as early as 1977, upon adoption of the sixth value-added tax directive, that attempts were made to create, in a general sense, a common value-added tax base in order to ensure the stability of payments into the European Union’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The work in this area has yielded significant results; however, the current system of VAT rates still foresees exceptions in the form of considerably lower VAT rates applied to certain goods and services. Moreover, the issue is not only of the specific products subject to these VAT rates in different Member States but also the varying terms of validity of these exceptions. Such a complicated system poses problems of forecasting long-term budget flows and also creates potentially different conditions under which Members States would apply the provisions of the VAT directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to propose and support those proposals, that the European Commission review and draft a common list of goods and services that would be subject to lower rates; in addition, the Commission should evaluate the macroeconomic impact on and experiences of different countries in order to ensure that the list is valid in the long term rather than being temporary, unless otherwise specified by mutual agreement. The introduction of a common list would help avoid the flawed practice on the part of some countries of applying lower rates as exceptions, while other countries cannot apply such rates. A common list would also undoubtedly ensure the stability of inflows into the European Union’s budget, as it would facilitate the forecasting of long-term financial flows. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is disappointing to see that no progress has been made in the past year.</p>
<p class="contents">I stated at the time that we should, of course, have equality amongst the Member States, but also that we should be pressing the Council to make this principle a permanent feature of our hopes of achieving the Lisbon Strategy. I accept that it can be difficult to quantify the positive benefits in terms of job creation, but I am also convinced that suddenly reapplying VAT to labour-intensive services will have a negative impact.</p>
<p class="contents">I know from personal experience in a small business in the construction sector that having to charge VAT at the full rate has an impact on consumer choice. In a significant number of cases consumers choose to go where VAT is not applied. This resolution, which all the groups have supported and which will be voted on today, is reasonable. This is the least we can expect from the Council if we are not to see a sudden shock being triggered by the end of this scheme, in which I would hope Member States can be encouraged to participate more fully so that we can build up data on the beneficial impacts, which I am sure can be quantified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Constant tax exemptions for big business and its profits, on the pretext of increasing investments, are accompanied by a simultaneous increase in indirect taxes and a reduction in grass-roots income. That is why we are expressing our opposition to all forms of indirect taxation and, in particular, to the value added tax system as it operates today.</p>
<p class="contents">Just recently in my country, the Greek Government, implementing faithfully the dictats of the Stability Pact, increased VAT by one percentage point. At the same time, some people are saying that, under pressure from the Commission, there may be a further increase. Of course, for the profits of companies a tax cut of 10 percentage points has been promoted. It is ironic, but we may ultimately arrive at the paradoxical position of being in favour of a ceiling of 25% on VAT, because then we can be sure that it will not go up any further.</p>
<p class="contents">The rates of 15 to 25%, which allow no distinction between immediate necessities and luxuries, the uniform rates which require the poor worker and the rich businessman to pay the same excise and tax toothpaste at the same rate as a yacht, are often higher than the rates at which big business is taxed directly. There are even proposals to abolish graduated direct taxes and create a standard rate which will be the same rate as for indirect taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the experimental directive allowing a lower rate of VAT for labour-intensive services cannot be applied generally is typical of the uniform strategy of big business and of capitalistic infighting. The period of application of this directive, which allows the Member States to apply reduced VAT rates to certain activities so that the corresponding jobs can at the same time be maintained, has been extended twice. It has not been possible so far to apply it generally to all the Member States, which is precisely why it is representative of the disagreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fighting together with the workers for the protection of grass-roots income, for the abolition of indirect taxes and the application of a progressive income and capital tax policy in order to stop the workers, pensioners, unemployed and grass-roots classes in general from picking up the tab and to stop taxes from being one of the tools for redistributing the workers' income for the benefit of big business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst these are noble sentiments, I hope you will allow me to offer a few words of general advice.</p>
<p class="contents">The current growth projection in 2006 for the eurozone is estimated by the IMF at 1.8%, with the largest economies being the worst performers. This weak growth is far from sufficient to sustain the EU’s social programme. The Commission suggests that a cut in income tax of 1% of GDP would produce a greater than proportionate rise in growth. A harmonised VAT scheme, therefore, should be used to shift from direct to indirect taxation. Unfortunately, there is no undisputed evidence that this growth would occur. Moreover, this shift implies a redistribution from the poor to the rich, like the common agricultural policy, which rewards landowners rather than farmers. Is this really what we want?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to suggest that instead of trying to harmonise taxation, our partners in the Commission should rather leave it alone. Do they not realise that their obsessive pursuit of the illusive level playing field and their inward-looking regulation-led policies are damaging growth rather than stimulating it?

It is also always the case that issues of VAT have to do with justice. It cannot fail to be noted that this European Union of ours is resorting, in its weakness – for our organisational teeth no longer bite – to the artificial aid provided by VAT in order to be able to build up a certain amount of tax revenue worthy of the name. This is a very unfair way of going about things, since, as we know, VAT very often hits the wrong people.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two Austrians who might be able to give you an example of how to do things. With one of them – Bruno Kreisky – you will already be familiar, whilst you probably have yet to become acquainted with the other, Karl-Heinz Grasser. It was Kreisky who, all those years ago, saw very clearly that we would get nowhere with approaches of this kind. Instead, we must focus our efforts – above all with regard to VAT rates – on the VAT applied in areas where we can get back some of what we lose elsewhere, for example the things that the rich really like: luxury limousines, yachts and second homes. The aim of the amendment is to put a stop to such things, and I regard this as wrong-headed. Karl-Heinz Grasser is trying, in Austria at least – and in this I think he is exemplary – to prevent companies operating at an international level from shifting their input tax around without ever actually having to hand over any VAT. One opportunity for the next Council presidency might be to move forward, at least on the European level, with regard to the shutting-off of VAT loopholes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There does not appear, to my mind, to be any security to plan ahead, nor do either the Council or the Commission appear to have done enough of their homework. Had they done so, there would not be in the timetable such a mishmash of reports, deferments and extensions of provisional arrangements, without any real solution being found.</p>
<p class="contents">In German, the word <span class="italic">Steuer </span>has a dual meaning: it is associated not only with taxation but also with steering. Taxes steer. Taxation policy is a political instrument for steering the economy, and if there is not greater clarity about it at European level, if we are not given more powers to deal with it, if there is no wide-ranging debate about it, if we are not given a uniform basis of assessment for the taxation of businesses, if we do not close the tax loopholes, if there are no uniform tax arrangements for occupational pension schemes – then we will be unable to achieve many of our policy objectives for growth and employment, for we will not be in possession of the wherewithal to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for a comprehensive debate on taxation – one, moreover, that is not limited to individual aspects of the subject. What I advocate is a long-term approach to taxation, something that is agreed between the Member States rather than put together at three minutes to twelve, is eventually extended and therefore fails to achieve any solution. Both examples show us that the outcome of what we are debating now will be no more than a provisional arrangement that will get us no further forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States have different standard rates, different reduced rates and different rules for applying these rates. The end result of all this is price distortion within the European Union. These different rates also have a negative impact on resource allocation and, in the long run, reduce the EU’s growth potential.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, many doubts have been raised over whether VAT rates need to be harmonised, and indeed we have heard such sentiments voiced today in this Chamber. As I see it, the time has come for us to hold a serious and comprehensive debate on the tax system in the European Union. I would suggest to the Commission that it should undertake a detailed study of the impact, whether positive or possibly negative, of a gradual EU-wide approximation of VAT rates and their application. We need sound analytical data as a basis for serious consideration of this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to reduced VAT rates for labour-intensive services, I should like to reiterate the point that these rates were introduced six years ago on an experimental basis. I am genuinely astonished that the Member States have not yet been able to assess the results of this experiment.</p>

<p class="contents">The fact is that the special rules introduced in 1999 – for three years in the first instance – on reduced rates of VAT applied only to a few Member States and to certain labour-intensive services. The original timeframe was, following its expiry, extended repeatedly, indicating that it was not possible even in the past to come up with a definitive solution. Failing another decision, this rule will cease to apply at the end of this year. What we do know is that the expectations raised by the introduction of the special rules were met – if at all – only in part.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in 2003 that the Commission established that the reduced rates of VAT were not being reflected in lower prices and that they had practically no perceptible influence on the employment situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It was this that led my group to make its support for the joint, all-party, motion for a resolution dependent on the fulfilment of several conditions. The first of these was that the extension should be a one-off event, effective only until the end of the next year. Secondly, there was the condition that the Commission should initiate a comprehensive study of the measure’s effectiveness. Thirdly, after the end of the extension period, that is to say, with effect from the end of next year, the only areas to benefit from the reduced VAT rate would be those where the reduction had had a demonstrably positive effect on prices and employment. In those, then, the special arrangement would become permanent, and other areas, those in which it had proved ineffective, would be excluded from it once and for all. New Member States would also be allowed to apply the reduced rate so that there would be no distortions of competition in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We demand a split vote on paragraph 2 of the joint motion for a resolution, as the rules have been in force for some considerable time, and the report referred to is, in our view, sufficiently detailed and explicit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is this madness? An aberration? No, this is simply what is taking place. In actual fact, if the ECOFIN Council on 6 December does not extend the reduced VAT rate, this catastrophic situation will begin in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation in 1999 of the experiment of reduced VAT rates for labour-intensive services has proved its effectiveness. It has created jobs. In France, for example, the BTP (public buildings and works sector) estimates that 60 000 long-term jobs have been created. The experiment has also contributed to combating illegal work. Still on the subject of France, the number of offences committed in the construction sector has been halved. Furthermore, this measure is beneficial in combating global warming. Applying reduced VAT rates in the context of energy saving work would benefit consumers and businesses alike and represents a potential source of jobs that cannot be relocated. What more convincing arguments could the Council therefore present in favour of rejecting the extension of reduced VAT rates?</p>

In order to make people vote in favour of the Constitution, the French Government had boldly to confirm this promise throughout the entire campaign, a long-standing promise, in reality, since it had already featured in the programme of the Presidential candidate, Mr Chirac, in 2002, and even in 1995. Likewise, in its draft finance act for 2006, the French Government, gambling on an agreement at EU level, announced and provided for a one-year renewal of the reduced VAT rate for renovation work. It is clear that this two-faced promise fuels a permanent sense of uncertainty with regard to taxation, unsettling consumers and, above all, the professionals of the sectors concerned.</p>

<p class="contents">Probably one of the few concrete initiatives to have been taken in this area has been the establishment of a reduced value added tax on services that create employment, services that promote the contracting of workers, in particular the least qualified. A reduced VAT rate that also brings to the surface resources which were previously submerged, and which can be used to fund future pensions. And a reduced VAT on work that enables us to rebalance the unstable relationship between taxes on capital and taxes on work.</p>

The Commissioner can put pressure on the Council: he can tell it that it is not a good idea to end this experiment just when new States are being incorporated, States in which the problems we have been resolving — the lack of jobs, the black economy — are more pressing than in the old States; that it is not a good idea to end an experiment, and thereby risk an increase in prices and a reduction in employment; that it is not a good idea to end this experiment just when we are about to discuss the Directive on services, which has created such concern in terms of employment in the Member States, and the Commissioner can tell it that this Parliament is unanimous and that this Parliament does not like to be treated as a joke, especially when the Council is not offering any well-founded opinion in return. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have the impression that here we are preaching to the converted for the simple reason that the Council is not here and the Commissioner is agreeing with the strong position which we are taking, even though he is saying that he does not think that the extension of the experiment is a good enough solution. I think we should, at this moment, at the beginning of December, also consider that solution. There is no doubt that the Council should take note of our position which is strongly in favour of the renewal of this facility which is strongly labour intensive and which seemed to be an experiment which succeeded and which created new jobs. Apart from this, this experiment should also be widened and should be given as a possibility to new Member States. The irony of all this is that while here we are speaking about having lower rates, to experiment with these low rates, there are some governments in other countries, including that of my country, Malta, which, since joining the European Union not only did not experiment with low tax rates, but increased VAT from fifteen to eighteen percent. I also believe that the range of services should be widened and should apply also for other services such as environmental services and restaurants. This experiment has proved successful, and in order to ensure our credibility with the people who elected us and whom we represent, the Commission and the Council should place greater value on one of the few experiments that have been truly successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The experiment of reduced VAT rates has been carried out in some Member States, but unfortunately for all of those countries, it has been carried out at a time when the European economy has not been particularly impressive, especially in many of the largest Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In labour-intensive sectors, this experiment has, in fact, made an even greater contribution than could have been envisaged, in so far as it has sustained significant employment levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, another argument in favour of continuing this experiment is the fact that Europe’s overall economic situation is changing slightly, if only very weakly at the moment, meaning that an end to the experiment would have disastrous effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the experiment has been positive inasmuch as it has brought about changes of an all but structural nature in some countries in the space of six years. In my country, Italy, for instance, the experiment of reduced VAT rates has coincided with a measure providing incentives for building renovation via income tax – something that has met with enormous success. It is a genuine success because it has both enabled a large part of Italy’s building heritage to be renovated quickly and improved the country’s economic and financial situation.</p>
<p class="contents">From a financial point of view, the ‘income tax-reduced VAT’ formula has exposed an enormous amount of undeclared work – which can be taxed for the benefit of the country itself – whereas, from an economic point of view, this formula has probably been the most important ingredient in sustaining the country’s overall demand at a time when, in Italy, consumption is slack, productive investment is down and exports are falling.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the very many thoughts expressed, I add my own two in favour of the experiment. I therefore hope that, with the support of the Commission too, the Council will at last listen to the voice of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Astrid Lulling (PPE-DE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, while I support the report’s conclusions with regard to the minimum standard VAT rate, it is my duty to share a few problems I have with some of our rapporteur’s arguments, and I am pleased to have the support of the great majority of my group in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">After much thought, the idea of proposing a maximum 25% for the standard VAT rate seems wise to me. We would therefore have a kind of corridor between 15% and 25%, somewhat like the currency snake in its day.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us recall that the starting point in 1992 was indeed one of moving in the direction of converged VAT rates in the context of the single market. This convergence did not actually take place, but Parliament’s proposal to set a maximum rate of 25% could decisively encourage us to move in that direction and thus prevent too great an imbalance between rates, something that is disadvantageous. That is why I support this proposal, which has been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and endorsed on two occasions by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not disguise my reservations, either, regarding the general idea, outlined by the rapporteur in his explanatory statement, to fundamentally restructure the tax systems by increasing indirect tax at the expense of direct tax. For the time being, I can see many more disadvantages than advantages to doing this: the danger of stimulating even more the inflationary pressures that are already too much in evidence; the danger of taking the momentum out of an often lifeless internal demand; and the problem in terms of the social equity of such restructuring. In short, let us be very careful before embarking on such paths.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, finally, to say something about reduced VAT rates in relation to labour-intensive activities, among other areas. The non-renewal of this measure, which has positive effects on employment, whatever Mr Klinz’s and others’ views on the matter, would not only be regrettable, as you said, Commissioner, but would also be a real catastrophe for all of the sectors concerned. I support Mrs Bérès, who very competently explained our concerns in order to press the Council, when it convenes for the last-chance meeting on 6 December, to reach a solution on the basis of the Luxembourg proposal, which has been taken up and enhanced by the UK Presidency. I therefore hope that our resolution on this matter will at last make an impression on the Council, which still has no representatives in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">With things as they stand, Mr President, I believe that it should be possible for the Member States to have a great deal more scope to determine which sectors will benefit from a reduced rate, and the cause of the French catering workers, to give just this one example, seems, in my opinion, to be one of the most worthy. I therefore send out an appeal for the new German Government to demonstrate greater flexibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask Commissioner Kovács to reiterate his support for this idea, which he expressed at a conference of the European Charities Committee on VAT here in Brussels two months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Charities like the Home Farm Trust – which supports 900 people with learning disabilities and has shops in Braintree, Colchester, Newmarket, Saffron Walden and Sudbury in my own constituency – cannot recover huge sums of money as they do not charge VAT, and provide their services heavily subsidised or for free.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies in Ireland and Denmark, as well as the UK, show that this eats up some 4% of charities’ total expenditure. Given that charities almost invariably provide services at a local level, they are a prime case for subsidiarity and national decision-making on the VAT rates they pay. This principle has already been accepted by the European Parliament in the Randzio-Plath report, and I call for the Commission’s support in the decisions to be taken before the end of this year. Without it charities will lose millions of euros each year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Streamlining VAT procedures for these businesses will enhance efficiency and encourage increased activity within the internal market, feeding to the Lisbon Agenda, which is supposed to be the focus and aim for all of us at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The one-stop-shop schemes, which are at the heart of the package, will ultimately enable new rules for cross-border businesses and business-to-consumer services to be introduced. This will have particular benefits in my own country for Irish companies that deliver services electronically over the internet to consumers in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The current minimum standard rate of VAT fixed at 15% is due to end at the end of this year. The Commission is proposing to extend it to 2010. I support that generally and, in particular, I support the decision of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to have an impact analysis on implicit and standard rates of VAT in the Member States, which should also consider allowing all Member States the same opportunity to apply reduced rates on certain goods and services. We need to revisit the issue of special exemptions on reduced rates. My own country never applied for reduced rates. I think there are only nine Member States – if my facts are correct – that have the benefit of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to do something here. Restaurants, catering and hospitality services need particular attention in all Member States. In terms of jobs and services, these are areas which could really ignite economies throughout Europe at the moment, given that tourism is one of the growing areas. Currently, VAT rates on food in some Member States are prohibitive and need to be looked at urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that the report on the one-stop-shops and the refund of VAT generally was only referred to Parliament because of a change to the legal basis. I have ongoing concerns about the number of times issues around a legal basis arise in this Parliament. These are consultative-only as far as Parliament is concerned. However, what is happening with legal bases? What is happening in terms of Commission proposals on different legal bases and the Council subsequently changing or amending them or, in many cases, introducing a dual legal base? We need certainty in our law. Uncertain law is bad law. We need to have an open debate on the legal basis issue in this House urgently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand the concerns of the honourable Members that we are running out of time, but wish to remind you that the Commission tabled its proposal as early as 2003, and it is the Council that has been unable to come to a unanimous decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall briefly comment on some of the amendments. The first amendment concerns a restriction on the level of the standard rate by setting a maximum level of 25% to prevent growing divergence in the standard rates of VAT applied by the Member States. This would require a new proposal from the Commission, thus preventing the adoption on time of a minimum rate to be applied as from 1 January 2006. Moreover, given past experience it has no chance of being unanimously adopted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment aims at allowing more flexibility in VAT provisions in order to enable Member States to react to the changing economic situation. This is not in line with the first amendment, which tries precisely to prevent such flexibility as regards the standard rate. Generally speaking, this proposal is not yet the appropriate vehicle for carrying out a general assessment of the macro-economic impacts of VAT rates and the associated revenue and budgetary implications for the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that part of the one-stop-shop package concerning the VAT refund scheme has the support of the honourable Members. Unfortunately the Commission cannot accept the proposed amendments, for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 1 and 2 relate to the regulation and cooperation arrangements for the refund procedure, which forms another part of the one-stop-shop proposal. Amendment 3 seeks to extend the deadline, which I believe is not necessary. Amendment 4 is not workable as, on the one hand, a strict deadline of four months for refunds would be imposed on the Member States, but on the other hand, there would be no deadline for a taxable person to hand in the requested additional information. The amendment is, furthermore, in contradiction with the second subparagraph of the same article, which mentions that a new period of three months starts to run as from the moment the additional information is received from the taxable person.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the positive opinion of Parliament will contribute to a timely decision in the Council on the standard rate proposal, and will facilitate the discussion on the one-stop-shop proposals with a view to their adoption under the Austrian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning labour-intensive services, I have listened carefully to all the contributions and I can only remind you that the Commission has already taken the necessary steps to support their inclusion in the scope of reduced rates as defined by Annex H. However, the current discussions in the Council are not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">I extensively explained in my introduction why I consider that an extension of the experimental arrangements is not really a viable way forward. Moreover, we need to be very cautious, since a unanimous agreement in the Council on such an extension would seem as hard to achieve as a genuine agreement on the scope of the reduced rate as such.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the consensus expressed in Parliament’s resolution. This is a very important signal to the Council of the need to reach an agreement that takes into account the interests of the European Union as a whole, as well as those of all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not certain whether the Council will reach an agreement before the end of the year on the recasting of the VAT Directive, and particularly on the application of a reduced rate for labour-intensive services. If the authorisation of these reduced rates is not extended in one way or another on 1 January 2006, then entire sectors, with construction foremost among them, will feel the full force of the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Why have we ended up here? In terms of the labour-intensive services, this is a ploy to pressurise the Council into adopting a comprehensive reform of the VAT Directive. In terms of the catering sector, the Annexes of the directive must be changed. Germany is opposed to this. It does not want to see similar demands sprouting up on its soil at a time when it plans to increase its indirect tax by 20%. Is Germany wrong? No.</p>
<p class="contents">These problems would not exist if the Member States had held on to their fiscal sovereignty and were able to use it to stimulate employment.

Rushing to renew a Council decision year after year is not a responsible way of approaching matters. The legal and economic uncertainty hanging over these sectors of activity is no longer acceptable.</p>
