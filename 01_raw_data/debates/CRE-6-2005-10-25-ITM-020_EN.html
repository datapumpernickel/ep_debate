There is a Commission meeting still going on, while we also have other important issues to deal with, such as avian flu. I therefore apologise for being somewhat late.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I welcome the opportunity of presenting the results of our intensive monitoring of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s preparations for accession and also holding an exchange of views with you on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also thank Parliament, especially its Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the rapporteurs, Messrs Van Orden and Moscovici, for their contribution to this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">When we opened accession negotiations in early 2000 with an additional six candidate countries, we could not know how long the accession negotiations with each of them would finally take. Quite clearly, all six countries were part of the fifth enlargement round. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will therefore complete this fifth round of enlargement, encompassing 12 countries in total.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the reports on the two countries show that both have continued to make progress in fulfilling their accession requirements. Bulgaria, having rather lost momentum after the conclusion of the negotiations in summer 2004, has now worked energetically to make up for lost time after the parliamentary elections of June 2005. Romania has caught up impressively in the fields of justice reform, competition policy and the state aids regime, as well as the overall level of alignment with EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Both countries continue to fulfil the political criteria, which are, as you know, related to the rule of law, human rights and democracy. While much has been done, there is a need for further progress. In particular, efforts are needed to pursue the reform of public administration, to implement effectively the reform of the justice system and to step up the fight against corruption, particularly high-level corruption. In the area of human rights and the protection of minorities and vulnerable groups, further efforts are needed by Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the economic criteria, both countries should be able to comply with them by accession, provided that they continue and intensify their efforts. Both registered robust economic growth last year: 5.6% in Bulgaria and 8.3% in Romania. Both have also pursued structural reforms to their economies. In the case of Bulgaria, particular attention has to be paid to the widening current account deficit. Labour market reforms also need to be enhanced. In Romania, the external balance, wage policy and strengthening of the government’s revenue base call for continued attention.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards alignment with the EU legal order – the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> – we have screened in detail legislative and administrative preparations across 140 separate areas within all 29 <span class="italic">acquis</span> chapters. Over 50% of all areas monitored are non-problematic. That does not mean that everything is perfect in those areas, but it means that no real problems are expected, provided that the current pace of preparations is maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second category, there are areas where the state of preparations calls for increased efforts. Here, both countries’ authorities are encouraged to target their reform efforts better, so as to come into line with EU requirements in the period leading up to accession. This covers around a third of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also identified a limited number of issues of serious concern, covering approximately 10% of the areas covered by the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. These are areas where, unless the countries take immediate and decisive corrective action, they will not be ready by the envisaged date of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these areas require a technical solution. For instance, Bulgaria must reduce the high proportion of uninsured vehicles on the roads; for its part, Romania must fulfil EU requirements in the field of taxation. With regard to these areas of serious concern, I would like to make three particular points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to Bulgaria’s and Romania’s ability to reap fully the benefits from EU funds upon accession. To manage EU funds, an overall reinforcement of the administrative structures in both countries is required. This includes the setting-up of paying agencies for agricultural funds and the required structures in the field of regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are also seriously concerned about areas linked to the functioning of the internal market and to the internal security of the European Union. These include, for example, shortcomings identified in the veterinary sector, which could put at risk the sustainability of food safety in the enlarged EU, and the control of external borders in both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area of particular concern is the fight against corruption, where too limited progress has been made so far. The failure to obtain even a single significant conviction for high-level corruption in recent years, despite commonly available information on its scale, is a cause for serious concern. Urgent efforts are needed here by the judiciaries of both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these shortcomings, the authorities in both countries are strongly encouraged to take decisive and immediate action. This would show that both countries can be relied on to play their parts as future members of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to support Bulgaria’s and Romania’s efforts to prepare for accession to the European Union. Our financial contribution will focus on measures to tackle the shortcomings identified. The total volume of pre-accession assistance available is substantial. The EU budget in 2006 for Bulgaria is around EUR 545 million and for Romania EUR 1 155 million, in other words more than EUR 1.1 billion for Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also pursue its intensive monitoring of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s preparations. Next spring, we shall review the situation and may, if necessary, recommend postponing accession by one year. We hope that steps undertaken by both countries will lead us to conclude that such a recommendation is not necessary. As formally confirmed by President Barroso to President Borrell before the summer break, I will also seriously consider your views on the matter before issuing a recommendation on whether or not to postpone the accession of either one or both of the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have clearly stated before, should there be serious shortcomings, we would not hesitate to make use of all our remedial tools. This includes not only the possibility of postponing accession by one year, but also all other available safeguard clauses. I trust that honourable Members of Parliament can agree to this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is not the time to speculate on the Commission’s recommendation, but for the acceding countries to concentrate all their energy on the outstanding shortcomings identified in our reports. The possibility of being ready in 2007 has not been lost, but it will require plenty of work from both countries. The present report is not the final assessment; that will be provided next spring, in April or May.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the constant interest and support of the European Parliament for Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession process. I look forward to a continued dialogue with you on the implementation of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s commitments. I trust that the newly-arrived observers from the two countries will contribute positively, so as to influence the perceptions of Bulgaria and Romania within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has played a decisive role in ensuring that the fifth round of enlargement is well prepared. I am grateful for the cooperation received since I have been in office and look forward to discussing the challenges ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank him for that, and also for what he has said about the procedure agreed with this House at the time of the ratification last spring, according to which Parliament is again consulted on the accession date before the Commission puts its decision to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to consider the progress these countries have made; they belong to the Group of Twelve, of which 10 have already become Member States, and so their eventual accession to the European Union is not a matter of doubt. The question is whether this is to happen, as the Treaties require, on 1 January 2007, or a year later, although there is the possibility of whole chapters being annulled up to three years after their accession if they are not implemented as they need to be.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that our rapporteurs, and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs, will, acting on this plenary’s behalf and in partnership with the Commission, apply the most exact judgment in determining whether the conditions are right for accession to take place on 1 January 2007. Today’s statement by the Commission is what I would describe as a ‘yellow card’. These countries are being given the chance to make up the time they lost as a result of their internal political circumstances, but reference has been made to desperately serious matters that give rise to grave cause for concern, such as, among others, these countries’ absorption capacity and the capacity of the internal market to operate. There are also questions touching upon the justice system, such as the fight against corruption, and also on the development of administration to enable the internal market to function, which is in these countries’ interests and also in the interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Although accession is not conditional upon the Constitution being in place, the failure to ratify it has meant that there are problems with the constitutional process. These are additional problems that we cannot burden ourselves with if the conditions are not fulfilled, and, at any rate, issues that we will have to examine with a critical eye. There are also issues that have to do with corruption and organised crime, issues of internal security, the problems to which the Commission has referred in relation to the external borders, and these are issues that are very important indeed, not least in the eyes of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union’s citizens are to see it as being capable of further development, it must be clear that there is nothing automatic about these things, but that, on the contrary, we are taking the examination of the conditions seriously and will act only after having done so, rather than out of political compliance. It is for this reason that we will, over the coming months, be addressing this issue with a very great deal of seriousness indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">While we do want these countries to become Member States of the European Union, we also have to create the conditions under which that can be a workable proposition, and it is for that reason that I, on behalf of my group, and perhaps also on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, would like to accept the Commission’s invitation to work very closely with it in order that the decision we take early next year may be the right one.</p>

I should also like to pay tribute to the work carried out by the Commission, which is, I believe, entirely in accordance both with the conclusions of the European Council and with the resolutions voted in favour of by our Parliament. In December 2004, we decided to close negotiations. The main areas of reform in which progress needed to be made with regard to the <span class="italic">acquis</span> – I am referring to justice, internal affairs, competition and the environment – were identified, and it was also decided, at that time, that these reforms would be monitored by the Commission, with the possibility – the assumption – that a safeguard clause would be introduced, which could postpone membership by one year. The work presented to us today is rigorous and objective. I believe that it successfully marks the progress made, that it highlights what limits exist and that it points out what efforts remain to be made, and, as Mr Brok has just said, this approach has, I believe, our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, however, to draw four conclusions of a more political nature from my reading of the reports. The first is that we have a common objective, and that objective is the simultaneous accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union. This is the culmination of the great liberation movement that took place in Eastern Europe. Holding debates on one particular country or another’s relation to the EU’s borders is all very well, but such debates obviously do not apply to Romania and Bulgaria, as the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has just said. It is not a question of if, but of when Romania and Bulgaria join the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">My second conclusion: the Commission’s report highlights both the progress and the efforts that need to be made. A great deal of progress is required. I, for my part, am not sure that the report should be shown the yellow card, for when I see what is said about freedom of expression, justice, the integration of minorities, the protection of minors and competition, I say to myself that there are no grounds to draw negative conclusions about the report, because what has been addressed is not without significance. At the same time, the report highlights substantial efforts that need to be made, and even points of concern that still remain. Firstly, one such point of concern is high-level corruption, to tackle which clearly defined institutions and all-out determination are required. A further point of concern is external borders, which need to be secure and controlled, while other points include trafficking in human beings, the environment and the integration of the Roma community. Dealing with these issues is no small task, either.</p>
<p class="contents">My third conclusion: I agree with the procedure now proposed by the Commission. Today is not the time to give a definitive opinion on the safeguard clause; it would be premature to do so. The monitoring exercise has to be pursued extremely strictly, and, in this respect, it is relevant to arrange for a meeting to be held in April or May. I would remind the Commissioner that the European Parliament wants to be fully involved in making the final decision. Today, we have stopped in midstream: the safeguard clause is not desirable for Romania, for Bulgaria or for the EU, but the idea of it cannot be brushed aside.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by reaffirming a desire, which I know is shared on all, or almost all, sides of this Chamber: we want Romania and Bulgaria to join the EU, and we want them to do so on 1 January 2007. This desire has not been brought into question. It remains intact after the reports have been read but, as the Commission’s report highlights, Romania and Bulgaria hold the key to their membership. The spirit in which we will support the Commission will remain unchanged, and that spirit is one of not only offering friendship and trust but also of making demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that is quite tremendous.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to join in thanking the Commission for the outstanding work it has done. My group joins with the others in welcoming the choice of procedure, which involves – as Mr Moscovici has just said – the consultation of Parliament on the recommendation next spring.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few things I would like to say about Bulgaria. As the country has come through an election and the formation of a government, it is not surprising that the latest progress report by the Commission takes a more critical line than its predecessors. For that reason, I want to start by saying that, while my group supports Bulgaria as it moves towards becoming a Member State of the European Union, we do expect the necessary reforms to be carried out with more discipline and purposefulness than they were last year. Results matter, for it is on the basis of the results achieved that the national parliaments will evaluate the accession treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria has made progress to an enormous degree. In terms of economic performance, the country is definitely in the overtaking lane. Its dynamism and 6.2% growth rate – the sort of growth I wish my own country could produce – gives confidence to the foreign investors who are discovering Bulgaria as a place in which to put their money. Bulgaria owes its considerable economic success mainly to the previous government’s far-sighted policies. The fact is, though, that the finest of roses are invisible if they are obscured by weeds. The successes that have been achieved cannot make their impact felt when corruption is unchecked, the law is unstable, and long overdue reforms are not carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us consider the justice system. On 15 October, the Bulgarian parliament passed a new Code of Criminal Procedure; while this is an important step in the right direction, it is one that has taken too long. The reforms must now be put into practice without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to corruption and the fight against it, one has to acknowledge that progress has been made in combating small-scale corruption. What is now vital is that attention should be focussed on corruption in the upper echelons of politics, business and the administration, and that there should be a sustained campaign against it. Paradoxically enough, the fact that Bulgaria is at number 55 on Transparency International’s Index seems, at first sight, to be a poor performance, but then one notes that Turkey is placed at number 65, Croatia at 70 and Romania at 85, so Bulgaria has already achieved a certain amount on this front.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it perfectly clear that neither the Commission – I am sure of that, Commissioner – nor this House expect Bulgaria to produce miracles. Everyone present in this Chamber is well aware that progress demands painful reforms and cannot be achieved overnight. What we want is for the Bulgarian Government to make progress where it is in its power to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to consider policy in relation to minorities, something that my group regards as particularly important. To this day, the Bulgarian authorities have not succeeded in finding the 15 experts of which the National Council for Co-Operation on Ethnic and Demographic Issues is meant to consist, and that does not augur well for the prospect of integrating the Roma into Bulgarian society. Precisely how the framework programme for this purpose is to be implemented remains vague and unclear. Paper is patient, but we are not; a lack of ambition is not something that Bulgaria can afford at this decisive point in its history.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that the Commission’s, and my group’s, critical observations are not intended to discourage the Bulgarian Government – on the contrary, they should be understood as an encouragement to go down the last stretch on the way towards accession with the sense of purpose and earnestness that this demands.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that I believe we should be holding this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The moment of truth has now arrived. Has the new government succeeded or failed? If we listen to the Commissioner and read the report, we can, in fact, discern a picture emerging that is in keeping with recent Amnesty International reports – a combination of progress in some areas, but ongoing problems in a number of others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to this House – and I am also addressing the Romanian and Bulgarian representatives when I say this – to focus on the existing problems that still need addressing, which you may or may not like, because I share Mr Brok’s view that there is no automatism that could solve all the problems. Allow me to single out two of them.</p>
<p class="contents">One of them is the fight against corruption, and this is where we have to be honest. The image we in the Netherlands, but also in many other Member States, have of Romania is determined in the public mind by the notion that that country suffers greatly from corruption, whether that be at low level or the highest level. It is particularly at this highest level of bureaucracy and politics that something must be done, and that is why it is a good thing – I would like to say this here – that, for example, an old case that was closed in 2003 against Mrs Puwak, the former EU minister in Romania, has been reopened, because there was something fishy about that case, to put it bluntly.</p>
<p class="contents">Something must be done about this, and I would urge the Romanian authorities to really give this priority. You cannot afford to leave this matter to be dealt with by a handful of public prosecutors and judges alone. I would urge you to do what you can in order to remove that image many European citizens have.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the environment and food safety, the Commission has turned its attention to another issue that is a sensitive one for many members of the European public, that being food safety. I think that accession should be out of the question if a country does not regulate that properly. The Commission is right to focus on this. What is missing, though, is attention to genetically modified organisms. According to the Commission’s very brief statement on this subject, there are no real concerns there. This is inconsistent with reports issued by Greenpeace, among others, which are far more alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania is Europe’s largest area for genetically modified organisms. It grows crops that would be unlawful in the EU, and because of a lack of knowledge on the part of the Romanian authorities, there is very little in the way of information to the Romanian public and it is impossible to check whether European guidelines are adhered to. That is unacceptable. A country such as this cannot join the European Union just like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Those problems, namely corruption and GMOs, must be resolved by the beginning of next year. In the unlikely event of this not being done, then it should be possible to defer accession by one year. To the Commissioner, who is a football fan, I would say the following. We have often mentioned yellow cards. If at the end of regular match time, neither of the teams has scored, then extra time can be granted. That too, is part and parcel of the rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Erik Meijer, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, for more than 30 years, first the European Communities and then the European Union have been involved in enlarging the number of Member States and have swallowed up other cooperatives. Since the great enlargement of 2004, when all of a sudden more new Member States joined than in the 70s, 80s and 90s combined, something has changed. Previous to that, each enlargement was a success, but many people nowadays regard enlargement as a threat.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unlikely that the example of Spain and Ireland, which quickly made up the shortfall with the help of generous financial contributions from the EU, will be followed. Many newcomers become dependent on the exports of cheap agricultural products, cheap mining products and, above all, cheap labour, while they have to import expensive new technology. The old Member States expect they will need to make increasing payments to the newcomers and, above all, they expect increasing levels of unemployment, possibly by low-wage competition. Despite this, the new Member States are still lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Romania and Bulgaria, a decision was taken in April to the effect that they are allowed to join as the rearguard of the 10 newcomers of 2004. I now hear comments, even in this House, about tracing a final external border for Europe, about restricting the solidarity contribution from the rich to the poor Member States, about the use of national referendums as a means whereby current Member States can reject newcomers and even about suspending any enlargement until such time as the people in France and the Netherlands get round to rubberstamping the Constitution that they emphatically rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Although my group does not condone the economic and military choices in that Constitution, or the democratic deficit that the text reinforces, our criticism is not levelled at the new Member States, with a lower standard of living, that seek to join the EU. Indeed, the contrary is the case; their admission could help the European Union focus more on common, large-scale and cross-border issues and less on unnecessary interference in matters that could be better evaluated and ordered on a smaller scale. Croatia and Macedonia are, in principle, welcome, as is Turkey, provided that it becomes more democratic and respects human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is opposed to making unworkable demands on newcomers. Financial and economic demands that impoverish large sections of their people and deprive them of social security do not contribute to progress, but to the corruption of society. If, however, the European Union wants to contribute to the quality of society, we must be tough on the environment, human rights and good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we now absolutely certain that near Rosia Montana, or elsewhere in Romania, no gold is being mined with dangerous chemical substances that result in streams of toxic water in that country and in neighbouring countries? Are we certain that the Kresna gorge in Bulgaria, being a vulnerable nature reserve, is protected against the increasing freight traffic by road? Are the new laws that are copied and translated from the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>actually implemented? Are the equal rights of the substantial Roma population guaranteed? What about the orphans and food safety? Sadly, we have not had adequate responses to those questions from either candidate country, which means that we cannot give our verdict about what should happen next until next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In a situation such as this, one would expect the highest authorities to display national harmony, but nothing could be further from the truth. The President and Prime Minister were at loggerheads in public over new elections. Commissioner Rehn’s efforts made it possible for this danger to the country’s political stability to be averted in good time, but for how long? All of this is taking place at a critical stage of Romania’s accession to the European Union. I would like to ask the Commissioner what he thinks of President Basescu’s political sense of responsibility in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called super safeguard clause applied by the Council to Romania’s accession date and to no other country’s identifies 11 specific problem areas, and I should like to touch on some of them. What, Commissioner, is the latest news on the tax benefits that the Romanian state promised the buyer of the steel magnet Ispat Sidex? Does the Commission regard Prime Minister Tariceanu’s concession to give Romanian farmers financial help with the purchase of tractors from the factory in Brasov as an infringement of the EU’s competition directives?</p>
<p class="contents">A second difficulty concerns solid border control by the Romanian authorities. That goes without saying, because once Romania has joined, no less than 1 457 km of the total national borders of 2 508 km will form part of the EU’s external border, quite apart from the issue of the control of the Romanian Black Sea coast. We are, after all, dealing with a corridor for smuggling people, drugs and arms to Europe. In short, the fact that training and funding problems are hampering the necessary recruitment drive of 4 000 Romanian border guards should be of major concern to the Commission. Will it take action?</p>
<p class="contents">Almost inevitably, the third difficulty will touch upon the sense of urgency with which the government gets the menace of corruption under control. What action does the Commission intend to take, though, when that fight against corruption at the highest level becomes more and more a political instrument within the governing coalition and within the executive? The new government should, in any event, be measured against its moral claims. That is something that the Romanian coalition should take seriously. It is then unacceptable to refuse to be open about what one possesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, our group is particularly appreciative not only of your speech but also of the systematic dialogue and discussion between Parliament and the Commission. With regard to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union, I should like to remind our observers that there is a very substantial majority in this Parliament in favour of their two countries. For us, it is not so much an enlargement as a reunification with countries of an unquestionably European tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament there is even a majority in favour of the accession of Turkey, so it is hardly surprising that there is also a majority favourable and attentive to your membership. However, the Commissioner's report highlighted real grounds for concern: to put it light-heartedly, I hope that the lateness of the Commissioner’s arrival here today (albeit amply justified) is not a foretaste of delays in the accession of our two brother counties to the European Union. However, problems do exist.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt – as already emphasised and now reiterated by us in this Chamber – that progress, even substantial progress, has been made. We are fully aware of the state and condition your countries were in after years of an oppressive leftist regime. We know the problems you have had to face in the past and therefore are highly appreciative of the progress you have made, although there are still serious problems which have to be solved – and solved quickly – if we are to avoid forcing the European Union into something I hope does not occur, namely a deferral of entry by one year or possibly more.</p>
<p class="contents">Our wish is for both Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union in 2007. However, some problems have to be solved – and solved by you. The observers at today’s session should take away with them Parliament's goodwill but also its concerns. There is much you can do in your own countries to move the reform process further forward. The delays that still exist must be eliminated, particularly in the areas of corruption and internal security. The events of recent days give us all cause for great concern in the areas of the environment and health, and there are worries on the conditions of the external borders. We therefore invite you to take up this great challenge, because we want to have you here with us in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember well the debate and vote that took place at the time, as well as the general mood in the House. In spite of the many criticisms voiced, no one disputed the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are part of the European family. This continues to be the case today, and in fact the opposite is true. Everyone, or nearly everyone, is delighted at the decision that has been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous speakers have already underlined the fact that shortcomings still exist in the fields of public administration, the judiciary and respect for human rights, in particular the rights of the mentally ill, as reported by Amnesty International. In spite of this, we welcome the efforts made by Romania and Bulgaria and their achievements to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption is one of the most difficult problems to overcome, since it is deeply ingrained in the psyche of people raised for generations in poverty, oppression and injustice under Communist rule. As a Pole, I understand this well, and I would encourage Romanians and Bulgarians to fight this scourge from within and without. The two countries should take today’s criticism as an incentive to undertake further efforts to ensure that accession can take place on 1 January 2007.</p>

First of all I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn for his statement and for his continuing strong commitment to successful enlargement of the European Union. We should all be conscious that the eyes of Bulgaria are on us today and both the tone and content of our message will be significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall I see the Commission’s report as positive, while focusing attention on the importance and urgency of outstanding commitments still to be fulfilled. I hope I do not detect from the Commissioner’s remarks any dampening of enthusiasm for the timely accession of Bulgaria. At this final stage it should not, in a way, be surprising if the Commission has been even more rigorous in its comments. But we now seem to be in a situation where the wedding has taken place, the marriage register has been signed and presents have been received, but the bridge and groom have been told they cannot walk out of the church together just yet, partly because we are not sure what the situation is like outside.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has continued in Bulgaria. It needs to be faster, but there has been a change in the external political environment. It would be quite wrong if Bulgaria were to suffer at all from any of this negative background noise. Certainly urgent action by Bulgaria is required in some key areas. It is insufficient merely to pass laws. I do not underestimate the political energy and commitment required to do even this, but legislation has to be robustly implemented and the results clear for all to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Bulgaria gave a mixed message in their general election on 25 June. They were not sure of the best way ahead. What is clear is that they must be able to have confidence in their authorities at all levels. The rule of law and therefore judicial reform, combating corruption and organised crime are the prerequisites for everything else, including economic performance. This is just one area of particular concern; there are, of course, others.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that the Commission is calling for improvements in the business environment including labour market flexibility. Forgive me if I remark that perhaps the Commission needs to put its own house in order and stop introducing new regulations which add to the costs and burdens of business and reduce competitiveness and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report today the Commission has sounded a warning bell, without making a recommendation either way concerning the date of accession. It will, however, do so in April and this will influence the decision of the Council and of this Parliament, which must of course be consulted. That means that we have a precious six months for Bulgaria to demonstrate solid progress and real results, so that the goal of accession on 1 January 2007 can be achieved. On the basis of today’s report, I see no reason why that date should be missed.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jan Marinus Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, in recent years, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has shown itself to be a consistent advocate of the EU’s enlargement through the accession of countries from Central and Eastern Europe. When those countries join, we can finally put an end to the division of Europe that has lasted dozens of years, and to the major inequality this has caused between East and West.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why on 13 April of this year, the Socialist Group, by an overwhelming majority, voted to endorse the accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania. Since there was a 20-month interval between the time of approval by the European Parliament and the planned date of accession, namely 1 January 2007, this approval was given in the full knowledge that in both Romania and Bulgaria, further progress should be made in a number of important areas before they can fully comply with the EU’s membership requirements. In my group, though, there was also the confidence that both countries should be deemed capable of taking the necessary steps prior to the ultimate accession and of actually implementing those.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the inclusion of a safeguard clause which makes it possible to defer the date of accession by one year, along with the firm promise by both the Commission and the Council to involve the European Parliament fully in a decision about a possible application of this safeguard clause has played a major part in our giving consent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group is consistent in its policy on the enlargement of the European Union. As was the case when the 10 new Member States joined last year, we want the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to be a success for the people of both countries, of course, without them presenting an unacceptable burden to the present European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we will not be using a fine-tooth comb to go through the reports presented by the Commission today about progress made in the preparation to accession in order to find arguments to wait for another year. As we see it, the areas of concern and criticism mentioned in the reports are mainly a guideline for the governments and parliaments of both Bulgaria and Romania to take the necessary measures in the time that remains. At the same time, these reports also identify the areas where both countries could use further support from the European Union in order to be able to achieve the intended objective of full membership of the European Union in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">It is totally irrelevant, for that matter, to our group’s support for the enlargement or our criticism of progress of the accession process, who and which parties are in power in either country. The only thing that matters is what those in power do in order to meet the predetermined conditions for full accession. We hope – obviously in the interest of the people of Bulgaria and Romania – that this opinion is shared by the other groups in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports presented by the Commission today do not fill us with the confidence that is needed to conclude at this stage that both Romania and Bulgaria will meet the conditions for accession on 1 January 2007 to a sufficient degree. There is no need yet. We can, however, see a reason for moderate optimism that both countries will be able to meet the set requirements at the next assessment, the one that really counts, in April of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Much will need to be done though, both in the decision-making process about, and the introduction of, missing legislation, as well as on the score of practical implementation; especially the fight against corruption and organised crime deserve most attention in this. On a personal level – because I have much experience in dealing with this problem – I should like to add that both reports are right to express the Commission’s concern about the situation of the Roma in both countries, and the fact the governments in both countries still have no adequate and effective way of addressing this problem. I think that this issue should carry a lot of weight in our final verdict. It is an important point to us, but also to the Roma in both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Following a period of stagnation and delays in connection with parliamentary elections and the problems involving the forming of government, the Bulgarian Government seems to have picked up where it left off with renewed energy and decisiveness. It is reassuring to establish that that country’s key political parties have joined forces in order to guide their country into the European Union together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to urge the key political parties in Romania, the Romanian Government and the country’s President, to demonstrate that same level of unanimity where the accession is concerned and not waste valuable time on political wrangling.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to announce that my group, the Socialist Group, obviously in cooperation with the Commission, will, in the coming months, be carrying out its own analysis of progress made in the accession process. In that way, this spring, we will be able to take the decision whether both countries are really ready to take on all responsibilities of EU membership in a well-considered fashion and according to agreements made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s work becomes ever more vital in the final months which bring to a conclusion the long and arduous trek that both nations – Romania and Bulgaria – have undertaken in their search for the promised land of EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the best report yet for Romania. It is a matter of pride to me that this comes out now, under the British Presidency. I want to congratulate not just Mr Quinton Quayle, the British Ambassador in Bucharest, but the entire diplomatic corps of all EU Member States who have put such time, effort and energy into assisting Romania in achieving her goal.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the enlargement minister from Romania in the diplomatic gallery with us today, as well as the minister for child protection and the minister for child adoption, Mrs Teodora Bertzi.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps, therefore, I could comment most warmly on the triumph of the reform of child protection that has taken place during the period under discussion, since 1999. That year, at the Council of Ministers in Helsinki, three challenges were placed in front of Romania: children, corruption and the civil service. The first challenge was tackled powerfully by successive governments, presidents and prime ministers. The result now is that Romania offers a model that has been widely acclaimed and applauded as providing, in some ways, even better services and better protection for her six-and-a-half million children than some EU Member States, and certainly other countries in the wider neighbourhood. I believe we shall learn more about that model as it becomes replicated elsewhere in the coming months and years.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, Romania has undergone a complete transformation from a country in 1990 that was dark, slow, tired, exhausted, with almost no life, no light, no fun, no laughter and little trade. Today it has been transformed into a nation that is once more alive and vibrant.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have to look at measures that will assist the public, particularly as regards public health – which is at a very low ebb, livelihoods and poverty reduction. Entering the European Union is indeed the long-term answer to achieving a rapid rise in levels of prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there remains one Achilles’ heel clearly identified in the Commission’s report today: corruption. Corruption is enemy number one of the people; it is enemy number one when you seek to reduce poverty; enemy number one when you are trying to improve health, livelihoods and futures of a population. Much must be done to fight this enemy, but I believe and know that it can be tackled and that in Romania it can be conquered. This has already happened in some sectors. Now the same effort and energy must continue in the other sectors, particularly in justice, which is so critical for the Romanian people.</p>
<p class="contents">I seek no time delay. I hope and believe that at some time in 2007 we will be able to say: welcome, Romania, you are now one of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The criticism of them is justified. My own experience of the problems that the Visegrad states have with accession to the EU and my own knowledge of the Romanian and Bulgarian accession agenda lead me to be very sceptical about 1 January 2007 as a deadline. You may well ask why this is so.</p>
<p class="contents">I was recently one of a delegation from the Human Rights Sub-Committee that went to Bucharest, and I regret to have to say that the talks we had there confirmed me in my views. We had the opportunity for discussions with representatives of the institutions of state, and also with various NGOs. These encounters reminded me of my experiences with regimes in the aftermath of totalitarianism. The government representatives were highly self-critical, but, in the final analysis, said little of any substance. It was in meetings with NGOs, particularly in private conversations, that the state of play in the various areas under negotiation was described much more clearly, and in terms at once more sober and more dramatic. The same was true, in varying degrees, of our conversations with these representatives’ Bulgarian counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing here with a reality that is not entirely what it seems to be. There is little point in signing documents if they are not implemented. There is no evading the conclusions with which these problems present us: the legal system is lacking in transparency, there is organised crime, problems with minorities and the Roma, corruption, and problems with agriculture and the environment. Even taking into account the natural disasters with which both countries have been afflicted, it is, regrettably, to be expected that they will find it difficult to make the grade in the short time available; they will have to make a very considerable effort to make it even by 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is supposedly founded upon certain basic principles. These include the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, and, perhaps even more importantly, the European social model, non-interference in the domestic affairs of Member States and solidarity. Last but not least, they also include the environment as a priority issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic question that needs to be asked about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is whether we really want to accept these countries into an EU of 27 as equals. Quite apart from whether the citizens of these new Member States will enjoy genuinely equal treatment – and it emerges from the reports that have been tabled that this is a far-off prospect, rather than a given from the date of accession to the European Union – one of the EU’s most important values, albeit one that is now frequently called into question, is the European social model. In my opinion, any attempts to liberalise social values along the lines of the Bolkestein directive on services are entirely inappropriate. I am not alone in this view, as proven by today’s reactions to Commissioner McCreevy’s speech in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow the low social standards in some of the new Member States to be used as a battering ram to reverse the social achievements of more advanced Member States. We should be aware that the welfare state and respect for environmental standards are among the most important of the European Union’s values. These values, and the resulting strength of the Community’s social foundations, ensure its superiority over models in which such values are not recognised, and which allow unrestrained liberalism to prevail over social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our duty to help the new Member States to achieve the best possible conditions and to negotiate appropriate transitional periods when Romania and Bulgaria join the Community, instead of harping on about problems in these new Member States that we ourselves face in our own countries. The Czech people enjoy particularly close and friendly relations with Romania and Bulgaria, and these relations date back many years. We are in favour of the two countries joining us on 1 January 2007, and we would like to congratulate them on moving another step closer to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A practical example would be the steel industry. In Ireland, the state-owned Irish Steel was sold to Europe’s favourite steel producer Mr Mittal for one pound. Five years later, just weeks after he collapsed Irish Steel with debts of GBP 50 million and no word of complaint from the then Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, we had Mr Blair writing to the Romanian Prime Minister recommending Mittal as a suitable custodian of Romania’s steel industry. No doubt Mr Mittal’s donation to Mr Blair of GBP 125 000 was coincidental.</p>
<p class="contents">The donations to Labour have continued, and again, coincidentally under the British Presidency, anti-dumping tariffs on steel produced by Mittal outside the EU have continued to be reduced by Commissioner Mandelson.</p>
<p class="contents">But what will happen once Romania and Bulgaria are on the inside? They hope, of course, for an increase in their standard of living, but with that comes an increase in the costs of production. Just as Mittal moved production from Ireland to Romania, where will Romania’s production go in due course? Would it be Kazakhstan or Algeria, Serbia, Bosnia? All of these countries’ steel industries have been bought with aid from loans from the EBRD and the World Bank</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, European taxpayers are subsidising the export of their own heavy industries. The sale of Sidex was seen to have helped Romania’s bid for EU membership. What will be the price for the next wave of candidate countries? Are the Romanian and Bulgarian governments happy to pay for EU membership with the jobs of their steel industries? What other industries have similar deals hidden away?</p>
<p class="contents">If Mr Mittal is successful in his rumoured takeover of Corus/British Steel, no doubt they will follow MG Rover into Blair-sponsored oblivion.</p>

They, as representatives of their peoples, need to know that the Romanian and Bulgarian people must, of course, after 50 years of Communist tyranny and servitude, have the prospect of membership of the European Union, and that it is self-evident that they are part of Europe – in utter contrast to Turkey, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither Romania and Bulgaria, though, nor indeed the European Union, will be able to cope with an over-hasty enlargement. If we bear in mind that last year’s eastward enlargement, involving the accession of 10 states, stretched the European Union’s financial viability to the very limit, and that the accession of Bulgaria and Romania can be expected to entail costs amounting to some EUR 44 billion, then we will know just how knotty this problem is.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because of financial problems such as these and, above all, the ongoing predominance of the as yet incompletely resolved problems that both these countries have with such things as burgeoning corruption, organised crime, unemployment and poverty, but particularly the outstanding deficiencies in the monitoring and control of their borders that this project of continued enlargement really does need thorough preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">What the European public expect of the applicants for accession is demonstrable progress in fighting crime, in making themselves better locations for economic activity and in creating jobs.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall focus on Rumania. We all know that the work done by this country to fulfil the commitments it has made and to be ready to join the European Union on the scheduled date did not end on the day the Treaty was signed, but that the Rumanian authorities had to continue to make great efforts. The report that you are presenting to us today is therefore very important, Commissioner Rehn.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the generally positive tone, the good progress of the economy and all the specific advances that you have mentioned and which demonstrate the Rumanian Government’s determination to fulfil its commitments. The information provided today also makes it clear that there are areas of concern in which efforts must continue or, better still, intensify; for example, in the fight against corruption, rigorously applying the legislation in force. This is one of the most serious problems afflicting Rumania, and on which this Parliament, and my political group as well, incidentally, have repeatedly insisted. I know that the Rumanian authorities are also aware of this serious problem, since President Basescu made the fight against corruption one of the key issues during last year’s presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important area, and one to which the Rumanian authorities must apply more energy, as the Commissioner has told us, is the proper operation of the control of borders through enhancing personnel and providing them with better training; the Accession Treaty also stresses the importance of this area. In fact, this is a key point since it relates to participation in a single space and a single market which, furthermore, must face serious and heavy migratory pressures at its external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Very notable progress has also been made, however, as Mr Rehn has stressed. I do not have time to go into specific areas, but I would like to stress that the priority attention paid by the Rumanian authorities to the issue of competition and State aid has yielded very good results. This is an area to which the Treaty attaches very great importance, as well as the effective date of accession. I am also pleased that progress is being made, as you have said, Commissioner, on the reform of the judicial administration, a particularly important area, to which attention must continue to be paid.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, during the months between now and the final report that the Commission will produce next spring, the Rumanian Government must attach absolute priority to compliance with the three outstanding tasks; during this year, the new government has made much progress, but there is still work to be done. The progress made must serve as a stimulus. The report presented to us today by the Commissioner will be read carefully, in a constructive but vigilant and demanding spirit. We must all be aware that the decisive moment for this process will be the report that the Commission has promised for April, including the possible presentation of the safeguard clause. In any event, the document being presented to us today is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the Bucharest authorities will react quickly and positively to the warnings that it contains. They will have our full support in this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission was quite right to point out that they have made progress in many areas, but that a number of issues are still outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to what Mr Wiersma said about Romania, I hope that political debate in that country will tend more towards a common European position and that the temptation to divide the country will be resisted. This is where the opposition, the government and the President need to be singing from the same hymn sheet. Turning to Bulgaria, I am persuaded that past omissions will be made good in the course of the process of forming a government. Some of this has already been done and some remains to be.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, quite obviously, be carefully observing what the two countries and their governments do to remedy the deficiencies that remain, including not only the major problem of corruption, but also the issue of the situation of the Roma, to which reference has already been made, and to which we, not only in this House, have returned time and time again, with – as I see it – progress being made. There are, of course, anxieties on this score about the possibility that it will not be security being exported to these countries, but rather problems imported from them, if great strides are not made in helping this disadvantaged group of people in the country itself.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things will need to be monitored if it is to be possible eventually, in 2007 or 2008, to come to a decision, and one that must take into account these countries’ well-being, for what matters, after all, is that they be enabled to take the right steps. I would like to invite you, Commissioner, to work with this House over the coming months, not only in the countries themselves, but also by improving the way in which the enlargement issue is communicated generally within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">People are, of course, to some extent, weary of enlargement, and that is hardly surprising in view of the past debates and disappointments, but we cannot simply give in to weariness and say that we are not interested. This debate is about how to persuade people of how important this enlargement is. I would like to see the Commission give us an assessment of the 2004 enlargement, for it might well have been said today that it took us to the limits of what was feasible, but I am convinced that it went very well. That is not to say that there were no problems, but it does, in fact, have the potential to make the European Union stronger, if we work through it together. That too must be debated.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else we, of course, expect of the new Member States is a strong commitment to Europe. When the newly-elected President of Poland says that his first two visits must be to the USA and the Vatican, that is something I have to accept, for I am certainly not going to interfere in his travel arrangements, but it is not surprising that there are those who wonder whether Europe, the unity that Poland joined, is not actually more important.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, we had a debate on social standards and social models in Europe, and it is in that area that there are fears that the standards that we have established with a great deal of effort will simply be broken asunder. It is surely not acceptable – and, in saying this, I know that I have my group’s unreserved backing – that we should, now that we are in a process of enlargement and integration, cut ourselves off again and leave our neighbours’ workers, capital or interests standing, so to speak, at the gate. We have to be reasonable about the way we plan the transitional process and try together, in so far as possible, to come up with a new social standard, rather than leaving the door wide open to social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Presupposing that we succeed in persuading our people of how important this enlargement is to the European Union, I hope that we will take the right decision early next year and that we will be able to set 2007 as the date of enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to Romania, on the basis of the progress reports over the past six months, reports I have received from Romania and my own observations, I have to admit in all honesty that there are still a good deal of major concerns left, many of which have been mentioned by other Members. I should like to touch on three of those.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the independence of the judiciary, which, according to the Commission’s progress report of September 2005, is put at risk by the major budget restrictions imposed by the Finance Ministry. I would like to know what the latest is on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as has been stated before, there is every evidence to suggest that corruption is still rife among the police, in the justice system and in the corridors of power. To what extent does the Commission think it can solve this by introducing more rules and regulations? Is it not, above all, a question of awareness, mentality, and therefore time?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are serious shortcomings in psychiatric care, which is not considered a priority, or at least that is what I gather from the recent developments in Romania. How does the Commission intend to press home the urgency of this problem? I would also like to hear from the Commission what, precisely, it regards as crucial if it is to be able to come out with a positive recommendation this coming spring and thus to recommend accession on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have told the House before, I do think it of really vital importance that we should adhere to the conditions and criteria that were once so carefully formulated. Candidate countries or countries with an ambition along those lines not only join an economic area, but also choose to take part in the political union, the European legal community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes a critical line, and that is something that I value. The question is whether the Council will seriously consider the Commission’s reports. It certainly did not do so in December 2004, when it was decided to round up the negotiations formally. As I see it, the Council’s absence from this debate is once again telling, whether it has other priorities or not. Let there be no doubt, though, I am in favour of both countries joining, but regard it as vitally important that this be done on the basis of what we have agreed to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since June’s elections, Bulgaria has had Ataka, a neo-Nazi party, in its Parliament. It obtained 8 % of the votes in June and now has 12 %. This party denies the Holocaust and, on its website, you can find discussions about how to castrate Roma and receive congratulations from the Klu Klux Klan.</p>
<p class="contents">Behind this promotion of racism and xenophobia are the former Communist agents who are building a shadow economy through fake privatisation and manipulations. Their strategy is to divert people’s attention from high-level corruption by raising anti-Roma, anti-Semitic and anti-minority sentiments in Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria has democratic politicians who want to fight corruption and poverty, but they lack support from us in the European Union. The EU has an obligation to fix the problems in Bulgaria because it has cooperated with the wrong partners for 15 years already. How does the Commission view the recent cases of violence between Roma and Bulgarians provoked by anti-Gypsyism? Secondly, do EC grants help put a stop to racism, or do they stimulate corrupt political structures? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Real unemployment in Bulgaria and Romania is terrifyingly high. Huge industrial and livestock units are closing. Traditional crops, such as vines and tobacco, have fallen apart or are on the road to destruction. Even infrastructure works such as irrigation works have fallen apart. Almost all the irrigation pipes, water channels and irrigation stations and their equipment have been destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">In Bulgaria, for example, overall agricultural production has fallen by more than 50% so that the products of the multinationals of Europe, whose interests you defend, can be sold.</p>
<p class="contents">With the restoration of the right to own land, the average size is 1.5 hectares or 15 decares, a very small allotment with, hence, zero margin for efficient cultivation. Thus, you will buy them for nothing, for a loaf of bread. The multinationals of Europe will buy up land in Bulgaria and Romania. However, you do not say as much, so that the invitees from Bulgaria and Romania can hear you, although of course they know all this.</p>
<p class="contents">The health and education system is breaking down. The Romanian Government, Commissioner, has the objective today of achieving the standard of living of 1989, which you condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk of democratic freedoms, of rights, but you say nothing about the legislative ban on the action of the communist party in Romania. You say nothing about the unprecedented prison sentence being served since February 1999 by the president of the Confederation of Romanian Miners' Unions, Miron Cosma, who was imprisoned for defending the interests of the miners being made redundant by the thousand.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation also has consequences for Greece. As wages are very cheap, this precise situation results in companies relocating to these countries, especially from the area of northern Greece, in order to increase their profits. Thus, the Bulgarian and Romanian workers, faced with the spectre of hunger, are forced to work for slave wages and, at the same time, there is pressure on workers in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">So welcome to the European Union, the land of promise, of 20 million unemployed, of 50 million in poverty, the European Union that crushes the rights of the workers so that big business can make untold fortunes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, however, is at issue is the timetable, for this is important. I wish to sound a warning about the problems that will be faced by the EU if, over a very short period, we accept as Members a large number of countries that are poor and economically undeveloped, that have little experience of democracy and of government under the rule of law and that have major problems involving corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the enlargement involving 10 countries that has just been carried out and of which the June List has been a strong supporter is giving rise to problems. To now accept poor countries such as Romania and Bulgaria into an EU that continues to be encumbered by an absurd agricultural policy and a badly managed structural policy and that is grappling with difficulties in preventing waste and corruption in its own system would be dangerous for the future of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves at what stage a country should become a fully-fledged Member State. Is development quickest when a candidate country is making efforts to obtain approval or after it has become a Member? I believe that the pressure to improve democracy, human rights, the judicial system and public administration and to set up a functioning market economy is strongest, on the one hand, before membership negotiations have begun and, on the other, before the country has been accepted as a Member.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report on the state of things in Romania and Bulgaria is unconvincing on these different points. We find a key sentence to the effect that developments have been inadequate in a number of areas, and the Commission provides long lists of what has not been done in terms of infrastructure, organised crime, tax systems and the treatment of minorities. In this situation, membership for both countries should be postponed until a later date. This would be in the long-term interests of both the European Union and the two candidate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Popescu’s statements have now been corroborated by the Commission, whose report states, in black and white, that corruption in both countries – not, therefore, only in Bulgaria – has taken on such dimensions that it is putting at risk the future of the EU’s internal market and the programmes funded by the EU. With regard to reforming the judiciary and administration, there are very few improvements noticeable, which means that corruption is running riot.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria and Romania are European countries that, just like the other Central and Eastern European countries, are entitled to join the Union, but they do need to be ready to do so. We cannot admit countries that have no rule of law to speak of. The Commission itself admits that countries that are, partly at least, in the grip of organised crime could damage the European internal market.

<p class="contents">The inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the EU is a historical moment. But let us leave the historical significance aside for a moment, and face the bare facts at last. A key issue of the current debate is whether the country report reflects the realities of Romania, and if it does, to what extent. On this occasion, I would like to concentrate on Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have to examine a number of areas, and not only in light of the official statistics, but based on everyday reality. The report of the Commission does stress some of the serious issues, such as the internal market, animal health regulation and food safety, or it remarks on the absence of institutions that would make agricultural assistance available to Romanian farmers. At the same time, significant measures have been introduced in respect of the reform of the judicial system. The Commission is appreciative of these measures, and Mrs Macovei, the Minister, is to be commended for them. But while we are hearing about resounding achievements in the area of political criteria and are informed that the situation of the 1.6 million Hungarians living in the country has been resolved, there have not been any actual changes. Like in the case of the Minority Act, none of the partial solutions have actually been accepted. Although the report still mentions it as a positive development, I must inform the Commissioner that the Romanian Senate rejected the Minority Act yesterday. And in the course of the debate there was hate talk and discrimination that would not bring credit to any democracy in the world. Hungarians living in Romania must have heard similar things at the beginning of the 90s.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the shocking vote yesterday, there does not seem to be any possibility of cultural or any other type of autonomy that would actually provide a solution for the large Hungarian community. To quote the chairperson of the competent expert committee of the Romanian House: ‘Such a thing is an impossibility in a rule of law state!’ My question is, what kind of a rule of law state is this? The legal framework for returning church property has been put in place. However, in practice, the return of church property is made impossible, the reclaimed buildings are being privatised underhandedly or the privatisation process is slowed down by successive lawsuits. Proprietary rights cannot be enforced. What kind of working market economy are we talking about here? First of all, we must spell out the problems, because naming the problems may help find a solution. Our task here in Parliament is to name the problems, and it is a considerable task. This is the most effective way of helping people living in Romania. By a willingness to see the real situation, together with and for those who ought to see it in Brussels and in Romania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to testify to the progress that I, as a member of our Parliamentary delegation, have observed take place in Bulgaria in the space of six years. A great deal of progress has been made, including progress shared by a large part of the people. However, achieving such progress has been very difficult for the people of Bulgaria because a great deal of effort was required of them. I believe that, in the West, we cannot appreciate the culture shock represented by a shift from a centrally-planned Communist economy to a market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">You have all noted that a large number of European <span class="italic">acquis </span>have been adopted, an action that has resulted in obvious progress being made in economic and political terms. Yet, you have also highlighted a large number of grey areas. Like you, I have to admit that the integration of minorities is a very difficult problem in these countries. I am thinking about the Roma community, disabled people, women and their role, and homosexuals. However, are we in a position to tell anyone what to do when we are encountering similar problems in our own countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria has problems with corruption, property rights and security. In order to overcome these problems, it needs to carry out a real reform of its judicial system and to start to implement this system effectively, which will give democratic guarantees to the entire population. There is a need for Bulgaria and Romania to step up their efforts before the next progress report, and for them to do so in the space of a few months. Yet, there is also a need for the EU not to waver in continuing to contribute its help, its technical assistance and its budgetary support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that, while we must be rigorous and demanding in our dealings with these two new countries, we must also realise that their arrival in the EU will add a new dimension to Europe and that, at last, we will together be able to turn the page on Yalta. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We said ‘yes’ but with reservations, invoking the safeguard clause stipulated in the Treaty which allowed for a one-year deferment if there were delays or unsatisfactory results in achieving the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I have followed the Romanian situation more closely as a member of the interparliamentary delegation, and I believe that, today, a cautious approach may help us to gain a better awareness of the situation in that country, where the educational system is still inadequate, corruption is still widespread, environmental, energy and economic policies still require strengthening, there is still no real answer to discrimination against minorities, and the average income of the population is too low.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of international adoption is also still unresolved and, after the moratorium and approval of the new law, it has now been blocked, with unfortunate and extremely damaging consequences for the children, those with the least protection, who should be the main beneficiaries of what we all refer to as ‘human rights’. The victims are the children who got to know their families but who today are unable to embrace them and live with them. The European Parliament must keep this problem under close scrutiny and ask Romania to comply with its institutional promises.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the areas of justice and border controls in relation to prostitution, which needs to be contained, and we must avoid the arrival of under-age girls in neighbouring countries, exploited by local organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is a process we cannot halt, but it cannot and must not merely be an economic process: it is also a cultural and democratic phenomenon to ensure peace. That is why I agree with the prudent comments of the Commission on the definition of accession for Romania and Bulgaria. The months remaining before the accession of these two countries to the Union will give them the chance of joining Europe without being at the bottom of the class, and will allow us to have the necessary and prudential assurances that accession will occur with full consciousness and on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, this is our ambition, in order to achieve the dream shared by Romano Prodi with the citizens of Europe when, as President of the Commission, he strongly supported enlargement and expressed the wish for a united Europe able to offer a robust political project, to restore confidence to those looking nervously at the major changes taking place in our time, and thus enable us to be the architects of an international action with a human face. That, in my view, is the Europe to which we all aspire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In mid-July, we received a visit from some particularly anxious Romanian farmers. They explained to us that the Romanian authorities had lost all control over GMO crops. No one, not even their minister, knows how many thousands of hectares are covered by these crops. On the other hand, it turns out that Romania is the country in which GMO crops reign supreme, with soya, maize, plums, potatoes and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on GMOs, Commissioner, is categorically not enforced and has been passed over in your report. I have not seen the Rosia Montana gold mine mentioned anywhere in the report either. The present Government, however, took a stand against this project, which violates the very concept of sustainable development, one of the pillars of our European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Romania also possesses the jewel in Europe’s environmental crown in the shape of the Danube delta. Its approach to managing the delta had succeeded, until now, in striking the right balance between promoting the various activities taking place in the delta and protecting its fabulous biodiversity. However, the way in which the delta is being managed today gives us cause for concern. Thus, the start of the hunting season, on 15 September, is harmful to the preservation of these natural surroundings, and this demonstrates that, as far as the environment is concerned, Romania is really not on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I entirely support Romania’s accession to the European Union but, in doing so, I call on the Romanian authorities to get to grips with the environment and to undertake effectively to protect it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has not, today, shown Romania and Bulgaria the yellow card, for that would presuppose that they were already on the pitch, but they are not – yet. That they are European players is not in doubt, but they are not yet in the stadium. What are they saying among themselves, and where are they in the league?</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made to the NGO ‘Transparency International’, which has also stated that corruption in Bulgaria has, indeed, become more widespread, and has recently moved Bulgaria down its Index, not only in terms of ranking, but also of points. What that means, if you agree with Baroness Nicholson’s view that corruption is humanity's enemy number one, is that Bulgaria is on its way off the EU pitch.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Romania, let me quote its newly-elected President, who has said, ‘I do not hesitate to say that almost every state institution is affected by corruption.’ Romania is not prepared for the European Union’s standards, and we should act accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The country is slowly recuperating economically and most probably it will meet the objectives by the date of accession. An increase in trade with Member States bears witness to this positive factor. However, one should look at Bulgaria’s judiciary system, a system which still has to make many changes because among many other most crucial factors, there is the fact that it still does not conform to the charter of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Organised crime is also an important worrying problem which the Bulgarian Authorities must tackle. For example, the resignation of five high officials within the office against organised crime, makes us ask a lot of questions and the Bulgarian Government should take immediate action before more harm is done. The proposals for a reform in the national service against organised crime should be revised so that the system will start operating with the least possible number of problems. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also disturbing to discover that a criminal gang has, for example, been exporting babies to Europe. This is because this vile trade is becoming frequent in recent years. The authorities should therefore continue working to break this vicious circle and it should be assured that the strictest measures are taken so that all those involved in this clandestine trade are caught. </p>
<p class="contents">Yes Mr President, fundamental rights are indispensable so that the Bulgarian people live as they deserve after long years of Communist rule. If Bulgaria does not adhere to these basic principles, I and a number of others in this Chamber will find it difficult to accept Bulgaria as a member of this Union. Here, there is no need for a transitional period, for we are not talking about economics or politics, we are talking about fundamental human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">Thus I hope that the Bulgarian authorities will overcome these obstacles so that they can join the European Union by 2007.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both the Enlargement Commissioner and my colleagues have already listed the shortcomings found in the two countries, and I am not going to repeat them, as I am certain that the observers will pass them on to their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I welcome the fact that following the elections on 25th June the new government of Bulgaria is headed by Socialists, because Socialists have always been pro-enlargement both in the new Member States and in the pre-accession states. In Bulgaria an agreement has been reached both among governing parties and opposition parties to support a successful implementation of the EU accession. As the Commissioner has mentioned, legislation has been speeded up in the past two months, and thirty laws have been introduced with a view to accession, regarding matters that had been criticised by the Commission, in areas such as the fight against corruption, judicial system reforms and organised crime. The introduction of these laws is still not sufficient, as the emphasis should now be on the enforcement of these laws, and I therefore invite both the Bulgarian and the Romanian Government to use the remaining period of time for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Hungarian, I would like to use this opportunity to say a few words about Romania, as well, as many of those present in this auditorium are aware of the fact that there is a Hungarian minority of a million and a half living in Romania. Their only possibility of joining the EU is together with Romania, and accession would enable them to live happily with us in a common Europe without borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have a natural place in the European community, and we look forward to their becoming Members before long. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are delighted to have our colleagues here in the form of observers. In that way, we are able to get to know them, and we shall be able to prepare each other for Romania’s and Bulgaria’s forthcoming membership.</p>
<p class="contents">We are impressed by the progress made in both countries but, at the same time, we must of course examine this progress, the implementation of the relevant measures, and any remaining problems. The Commissioner indicated a number of these problems: areas requiring further measures as a matter of some urgency. We need to be vigilant in the area of human rights, which is an area to which Parliament in general and the ALDE Group in particular always devote additional attention. We owe this to the people of the candidate countries, and we owe it to ourselves if we are to be able to defend European values.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption is a big worry, and the Roma – Europe’s largest minority – are marginalised in Romania and Bulgaria just as in many other European countries, with high unemployment, high figures for ill health and large and serious social problems. Unfortunately, discrimination and racist violence still occur, and too often it is on the part of the authorities. This is naturally unacceptable. Another storm cloud mentioned by certain colleagues has to do with children, especially those children cared for in institutions, among them children with mental disabilities. There are worrying signs that these children are being openly neglected, and that is of course unworthy of a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will increase its efforts to support Romania and Bulgaria in order to help them to cope successfully with these and other problems and to do so – as I still believe and hope it is possible for them to do – within the time frame for accession in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, I do not believe that the debate on enlargement is always balanced. Those who wish to put the brakes on enlargement talk about the danger of accepting poor countries and about the referenda on the EU Treaty having changed the mood in the EU which, they say, has become chillier. They say that the referenda were really not about the Treaty itself but about other matters. That is true, moreover. They were about other matters because we European political leaders did not show enough political leadership and because we did not manage to explain that it really was the Treaty, and nothing else, that the referenda were really about.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now make sure that we do not make the same mistake. Let us ensure that the current debate about Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the EU really is about that alone and not about anything else. We must show that we have visions and plans regarding enlargement. Enlargement is not about aimlessly accepting new Members whenever we want and whenever public opinion in our countries allows us to. Enlargement is about democracy and freedom in Europe but, above all, about European security, something I am surprised no one mentioned today.</p>
<p class="contents">To see Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession to the EU as an isolated phenomenon would be a mistake because many challenges await us over the next few years, such as the debate on Kosovo’s status, the referendum, Montenegro’s independence, continued discussions with Bosnia and Serbia and Macedonia’s application for membership. To postpone Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession unless it is absolutely necessary to do so would be a mistake in this very uncertain situation where the politics of security are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">No one, either in this Chamber or in Romania and Bulgaria, believes that we should accept any country unless it fulfils the criteria, but nor should we disqualify any country in advance. If it is the case that, following the referenda, Europe has become chillier, it is our task to warm it up. If Europe has become more selfish and closed in on itself, it is our duty to make it more generous and open. That is what differentiates those who represent public opinion from those who create it. That is what makes us European political leaders who accept our responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a second debate about whether or not Bulgaria’s or Romania’s accession should go ahead. That decision has already been taken and I am glad to see the observers here today. I would, though, like to make two observations, which are addressed to us ourselves and to the two countries in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with us ourselves: Mr Van Orden has called for tough action aimed at combating corruption and crime. In some of his press releases he has specifically referred to trafficking in people and drugs. He also, though, more or less openly stated that deferment of accession beyond the envisaged date of 2007 is absolutely out of the question. I would remind the House that, if we were to put the two together in the way in which he has, it would be to declare bankrupt the theory that accession to the EU provided an incentive for more domestic reforms. What incentive for reform is left, after all, when the pressure is taken off, if it is guaranteed that accession is going to go ahead anyway?</p>
<p class="contents">So let me make it perfectly clear that the date has not been decided in advance. That they will join is a given, but the date on which they will do so remains undecided; it is dependent on what is done by the countries in question during the time that remains, and by nobody else. There can be no input on the part of the European Union, nor can any kind of discount be given. I get the feeling that not every aspect of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> is equally important. I do believe that the EU public’s need for security may make the combating of crime and the securing of the external borders more important than the number of cars with insurance cover, although things might well look rather different from the motorist’s point of view. There are, though, or so I believe, different hierarchies of problems, and that is why every country will be judged separately. It used to be very comfortable to travel in convoy, with one country’s weaknesses being compensated for by another’s strengths, but those days are no more; from now on, every country will be judged separately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is still possible, even in light of the report presented by the Commissioner. But serious efforts are required, indeed. The Romanian Government deserves to be commended for the efforts made in recent months to meet the requirements. The government has done a lot, but a lot more remains to be done. The reform of the judicial system is stalling; action against corruption is tentative and unsuccessful. Neighbouring countries are seriously concerned about the condition of the environment. The opening of the gold mine at Rosia Montana has raised further worries. In this respect we expect the implementation of the strictest environmental protection standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We find the rejection of the Minority Act by the Romanian Senate yesterday particularly worrying. We hope we can count on the promise of Prime Minister Tariceanu that the House will accept this Act soon. In any case, we will hold him to account for this promise. We hope that members of the Hungarian minority will soon be able to choose to study at mother-tongue universities, we hope that there will be a perceptible change in the situation of the Roma, and we admit that the Romanian Government has made efforts in this respect. It has done more than its predecessor, but there is still a great deal to be done. Therefore, Romania has a real chance to join in 2007. We would like Romania to join in 2007. We, the Liberals, and I believe all factions of Parliament, will give her all the support in this respect, but most of the work must be done by Romania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to underline the sterling work of Commissioner Rehn and to remind all Members that the method of comprehensive monitoring reports we are adopting is the same approach used for the other 10 States which joined the Union on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">If we compare the degree of readiness of those 10 countries fourteen months prior to accession, we can see that the level of preparedness of Romania and Bulgaria is not dissimilar; indeed, compared to some of those 10 countries, Romania and Bulgaria are probably more advanced today.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Commissioner Rehn’s work has been thorough: he mentioned 140 areas investigated out of 29 chapters of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Where has he found real grounds for concern? In 10% of these areas. They are important issues, such as food safety, border control and the much-discussed prevention of corruption. Commissioner Rehn himself spoke of the energetic way in which Bulgaria has managed to recover the time spent on the elections, and Romania’s impressive catching-up on issues such as legal reform, competition and, in general, all those sectors in which they were requested to achieve alignment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because of what has just been said that, in my view, we should have confidence in Bulgaria and Romania, which still have fourteen months to go, and we must avoid any preconceptions – of which there is a hint from time to time in comments by some of the speakers – that we should already be making up our minds on the efforts of these two countries, their populations and governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I really believe that the words with which Mr Moscovici ended his speech, namely ‘friendship, confidence, but also rigour’ must be taken to heart. Rigour, Commissioner, certainly, but also support for the efforts of the two countries concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must state equally clearly that, having been carefully monitoring developments in each of the countries, we are concerned about whether their respective governments still have time to carry out the reforms and fulfil the requirements for their accession on the scheduled date.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to encourage our partners to give new impetus to the said reforms in order to ensure that they are complete by the date in question. We will not accept imposing any new demands on either of the two candidate countries, nor shall we ask more of either of them than was required of our countries when we entered in our day, but neither will it be acceptable to relax any of the conditions agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Henceforth, Bulgaria and Rumania are two different situations that we must assess separately according to the merits of each. It is clearly their respective governments, rather than us, who hold the key that will open up the doors of the European Union to their people. During this final phase of the process, we in Parliament and the Commission want to help rather than to hinder.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we note a differing tendency between the two countries. In Bulgaria, the political forces have been able to put together a government of national unity and everybody seems to be joining forces in order to move forward in the best possible way towards Community integration. On the other hand, it is very worrying to see in Rumania that the government appears to have embarked on an operation to harass the opposition, with a change of rules that interferes with the democratic workings of the institutions. Without evaluating the situation any further, we shall merely state that we believe that arguments amongst the country’s main political forces does not appear to be the best way to make progress on the consensus for reforms and for the negotiations with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation of Romania is more complex. The young government of the country is making serious efforts to eliminate the deficiencies and deserves to be commended for this. But they still have a great number of problems to tackle, in areas like the judicial system and internal affairs, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and environmental protection. Another crucial issue is that of the gold mine at Rosia Montana, although Foreign Minister Ungureanu had promised back in spring that he would solve this issue within six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Another heavy burden is the Roma issue. The new government endeavours to develop an effective system, but there are still many irregularities to be eliminated, things that are completely unacceptable to the EU. When Bulgaria and Romania join the EU, the number of Roma people in the EU will rise by approximately half, and this means that a long term strategy must be developed. The situation of ethnic minorities has improved considerably in the past decade, but it is still far from being satisfactory. For instance, why is the acceptance of the Minority Act such a huge problem? The rejection of the draft law by the Senate yesterday is a very serious negative development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to warn Romanian politicians to avoid making statements to the effect that Romania already extensively guarantees all the rights of ethnic minorities. Romania is still a long way from this. It is true that the largest ethnic minority community, that of the one and a half million Hungarians, has seen considerable development. Hungarians are present in the government and in public administration, and can therefore have their say in the internal and foreign policy of the country. As the representative of the Hungarian community in Slovakia, I would definitely like to see the Hungarian community in Romania join the EU as soon as possible, to live as Eurocitizens and enjoy the opportunities offered by the Union. It is the task of the European Parliament to inspect all of this consistently, but at the same time it must also provide maximum assistance. I trust that the safeguard clause included in our resolution will not have to be applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the whole, these two countries meet the political and economic criteria for membership of the European Union, and they have both made enormous progress towards democracy and a market economy over the past 16 years. In order to gain a full picture of this progress, we should remember their point of departure in 1989. Over recent years, we have seen a consolidation of democracy and a move from an electoral to a liberal democracy. As members of the European Union, Bulgaria and Romania will bring greater security to the European continent. In particular, they will help stabilise the political situation in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Being in favour of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union does not mean turning a blind eye to the problems that both countries must resolve before they join the EU, however. At present, these problems mainly relate to the implementation of the EU <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, judicial and administrative reforms and the fight against corruption. The Bulgarian and Romanian Governments must accelerate reforms in these fields and take effective measures to promote good governance in order to ensure that accession can take place on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The constitutional crisis faced by the EU Member States must not spread to those countries outside the EU that are on their way to becoming members. No country has ever been entirely ready for membership, and the EU cannot make demands of Bulgaria and Romania that it did not make of the 10 Central and Eastern European countries two years ago. The Romanian and Bulgarian Governments must now step up their efforts to tackle the problems they currently face. The citizens of the two countries must be made aware of the need for reform, and public opinion in the EU itself must be in favour of further enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, regarding the findings on political criteria, in my opinion the report should give necessary public administration reform, prosecution of high-level corruption and the fight against trafficking in human beings a lower profile. All the members of the public in this Chamber observing the debate must believe that Bulgaria and Romania are countries totally based on corruption, which is obviously not true. In my opinion we should do something about our European public administration reform and almost legendary EU red tape. I recommend that the high-level corruption wording, as used in the report, be only used in a very careful and limited way.</p>
<p class="contents">The part of the report concerning economic criteria is exceptionally sensitive. When we compare economic performance in the eurozone and the economic performance of Bulgaria and Romania, we can only envy their courage in undergoing deep economic reforms with stunning results. However, what is worth mentioning in the reform is the labour market. Unfortunately that is not so much a debate about Romania and Bulgaria as a profound debate about the unwillingness of the western European labour markets to open up to the free movement of labour from Eastern and Central Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, that is a message for the citizens here in the visitors’ gallery: the European Union does not have the keys to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a fact that Bulgaria and Romania have made significant efforts, since the last Commission report, towards the integration and full application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. It is a fact that no one can contest and no one can disparage.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also a fact that serious shortcomings are noted in the Commission report. Amnesty International has already pointed out certain problems with the protection of human rights, just as the Commission report has pointed out serious shortcomings in combating corruption, in reorganising the public administration, in modernising the judicial system, in combating piracy and infringements of industrial property rules, in integrating the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, in farming as regards plant health protection and the protection of animal health, in controlling the external borders, in state aid in the steel industry, in the environment and in nuclear safety. These are important shortcomings which not only affect the progress of the two countries towards their accession, but also affect neighbouring countries and the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues such as the protection of the health of animals, plant health protection, the environment, nuclear safety, state aid and tax, insurance and labour dumping also cause serious economic and social problems in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is in the interests of the European Union and the peoples of the two countries to remain firm in defending the strategy of enlargement and to make every possible effort to complete the procedure of the timely integration of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Balkans face serious developments and the integration of Bulgaria and Romania will contribute to peace and to the strengthening of stability and security.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the message must be clear. The accession procedure will proceed without discounts, but also without new terms and with the constant objective of the full integration and application of European principles and the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to point out that what is urgently required is the contribution of the European Commission to the full appropriation of preaccession financing aid for Bulgaria and Romania in the direction of the full application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.

In my speech, I should briefly like to focus on Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the Basescu government means well and tries to work hard on further reforms, so credit where credit is due. Even so, there are still a number of recurrent problems. First of all, there is the continuing corruption. Since honesty by decree is impossible, the government will need to do more than spell out its opposition to corruption time and again. If further confidence is to be gained, it will, in particular, have to tackle the people in the higher echelons of the civil service and prosecute former politicians who have been corrupt. Needless to say, the judiciary has its own role to play in this, but the government should make every effort to show the first emphatic signs of change as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is border control, the fight against cross-border crime, not to mention people smuggling. Progress will definitely need to be made on that score too, also given the fact that Romania will soon have one of the most extensive external borders, if not <span class="italic">the</span> most extensive, both in terms of land and sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point has to do with food safety and genetic modification, and my Dutch fellow Member, Mr Lagendijk, has discussed it in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point may seem less significant on the surface, namely the position in hospitals of people suffering from mental illness and the situation in orphanages. There is certainly a need for more progress to be made in those areas too.</p>
<p class="contents">Both in his speech and in his documents, the Commissioner has spoken in no uncertain terms. There are still major problems with 10% of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. We will need to see improvements if we are to commence proceedings on the planned date. Both now in the autumn, but certainly also in April, we will need to join with the Commissioner in examining whether it will be necessary to defer accession. We hope that it will not be, but if we have to defer, then so be it. We should also check whether, after a possible accession, certain chapters should be put on hold if the level of implementation is inadequate; the Council will need to look into this in detail and it is unfortunate that the Council is not present here.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I should like to say to Romania that we are strict where the criteria are concerned. We are not against Romania; it is not a yellow card, but rather a push for further reforms, a push for more freedom for the Romanian people and guaranteeing our values as Europe, to which we must very definitely hold fast during each enlargement round if we want to keep our credibility intact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Czech Social Democrat Party, on behalf of which I am speaking, has always backed the accession of these two countries to the European Union, and one need look no further than the votes held in this House for proof of this. I believe that my party will continue to back the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union in 2007. The reason for this is that we believe this accession to be the next step in a historical process, namely the gradual enlargement of an area of peace, prosperity and stability to cover the eastern parts of the European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Commission report that we are debating here today to be extremely well-balanced, and I should like to thank the Commission for having drafted it. It gives details of the progress that both countries have made in the fields of human rights, civil liberties and the political system, without of course forgetting the unquestionable progress they have made in economic terms. At the same time, however, it also highlights the problems that are still faced by both Romania and Bulgaria. Previous speakers have already mentioned many of these problems, which include corruption, food safety and other agricultural issues, border protection and public administration. The latter problem obviously also involves the capacity of these countries to absorb EU funds, to administer such funds in a democratic and transparent manner and to monitor their expenditure. Further problems include the protection of minorities, for example the Roma minority, which has been the subject of much debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite sure that it is still feasible for both Romania and Bulgaria to join the EU in January 2007, but there is one point I should like to stress, and I hope that the observers will take my recommendation, which is based on my experience of the Czech Republic’s accession to the EU, back with them to their own countries. I believe that if the two countries are to succeed in joining the EU, cooperation must be established there between all European political parties, irrespective of whether they form part of ruling coalitions or are in opposition, and of whether they represent social democratic, liberal or conservative views. If such cooperation can be achieved and efforts are made in this direction, then I am sure that in six months’ time, when this House holds a debate on the final report, we will come to the conclusion that it will be possible for the two countries to join in January 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to talk about a different matter: the fate of the EU directives prepared in the period between the closure of accession negotiations and the actual accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mining Waste Directive is currently in the reconciliation phase. This is the directive initiated by the Commission following the mine disaster involving cyanide in Romania in 2000. The disaster resulted in serious drinking water contamination and environmental pollution in Romania, the Ukraine, Slovakia and Hungary. We prepared this directive to avoid the possibility of a similar disaster in the future. The directive is expected to be issued in December. Commissioner, is it possible that the Commission and the Council may give Romania any concessions in respect of compliance with this directive? What guarantees can they give that this will not happen? Why do I ask this question? Because in spite of the fact that the Romanian mine disaster took place five and a half years ago, to this date none of the damage claims have been settled by the courts. The negotiation is stalling, as well, but the company that had caused the damage continues to operate undisturbed in Romania. Neither the injured parties, nor nature have received any damage compensation, in Hungary or in the other countries affected.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons why I support the EU membership of Romania is because membership would ensure that Romania is bound by EU regulations, and we would be able to enforce their implementation. Environmental protection, prevention of damage or the settlement of any damages caused is a basic right and obligation in civilised European countries. This is not happening in Romania yet. Whether it will happen or not, it depends on the Council and the Commission.

However, it is difficult to measure the qualitative criteria, the criteria at the core of the politicisation of the enlargement exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the fault of Europe, for failing to clarify the qualitative criteria in an objective, reliable and functional manner, for failing to lay down the political geography, its political limits, and for failing to define the dialectic ratio between deepening and enlarging.</p>
<p class="contents">If these major questions had been answered, we would not have the dilemma of Turkey, there would not be the uncertainty of the prospects of the Western Balkans and there would not be the speculation about Bulgaria and Romania. The crucial time for evaluating the readiness for accession of the two countries was when the accession acts were signed. Since then, the special transitional time for political, institutional and administrative adjustment has been correctly granted and extended. The remarks in the report about the state of accession readiness of the two countries presented today by the Commission are also correct.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, we must not overlook the fact that the rate of acceptance of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>in Bulgaria and Romania has been stepped up. Under no circumstances must it be the Union that disappoints the citizens of the two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of there being no automatic link between candidacy and accession, to which I subscribe, cannot be a belated claim, an <span class="italic">ex post </span>claim. Bulgaria, Romania and the Union of the 25 must up the ante, step up efforts and demonstrate a convergent and creative political will to make the Europe of the 27 a reality on 1 January 2007. If nothing else, the geopolitical and geo-economic restoration of the historical unity of Europe so dictates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to the Commission, the political criteria have been met; I do not believe that they have been in every respect. The law on minorities, to which reference is made in the Commission’s report, was yesterday voted down in the Senate, as Mr Duka-Zólyomi has already said. These rules in relation to minorities were, in practical terms, absolute minimum requirements, and even they were rejected. I regard that as shameful and as a flagrant about-turn on the road towards compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell Commissioner Rehn that, although I take a very favourable view of the large amount of space devoted to the Roma in the report, I do believe that the one and a half million Hungarians in Romania would have merited at least as much attention in it, and that it would have been better if their situation had been considered in rather more detail. Although the report discusses higher education, it fails, for example, to mention the fact that higher education is privately funded from abroad, and that the Romanian state therefore makes no money available for it, or that its failure to pay anything towards higher education in Hungarian constitutes a failure to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, and one that has as a consequence the fact that, of the 6.6% of the Romanian population who constitute the Hungarian minority, only 1.6% have completed college education. What this means is that the education system is keeping an ethnic group, and one comprising more people than some Member States of the European Union, at the bottom of the pile.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that this House, in the Moscovici report, called for better protection for minorities. We therefore need, ‘while maintaining the principles of subsidiarity and self-government, to ensure the protection of the Hungarian minority’. The Romanian Parliament and Government have, so far, voted to reject the initiatives the Commission has taken to this effect; here, too, action is needed, and I ask Commissioner Rehn to use what influence he has to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission report refers to the progress made in both these countries; and a great deal of progress has been made. At the same time, however, it notes that delays have emerged in certain sectors. The battle against corruption, the reorganisation of the judicial system and guarding the borders are some of the problems which need to be resolved more quickly. Particular attention also needs to be given to respect for human rights and minority rights, while the situation in the orphanages and psychiatric hospitals in Romania is far from satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">We are closely monitoring the reports by the competent bodies and hope that the necessary legislative reforms will be made more quickly. We also hope that Bulgaria will keep the promises it has made, especially about the nuclear power station in Kozloduy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I consider that the application of legislation – its practical application on a daily basis – is more important than its reform. The Commission needs to monitor this matter closely. I trust that these weaknesses will be rectified over the next 14 months, so that we can welcome these two countries as new members of the European Union on 1 January 2007 with open arms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important day for Romania and Bulgaria, and I welcome the observers here today. It must be difficult for them, because here we are pointing out some of their faults. However, we do it not in a mean-spirited way but to offer them some help to improve the situation. I would accept the premise of the report that progress has been made by both countries but that more is required.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to talk about Romania in particular and, even though others have dealt with the subject, specifically about the situation for young children, babies and adults with handicaps in institutional care. As Baroness Nicholson pointed out, while very good progress has been made on children’s rights – indeed, it is a model – it is disturbing that there are difficulties in practical terms. For example, many babies are abandoned in maternity hospitals; they cannot be put into institutions so they languish in maternity hospitals for months and, indeed, years. Recently, I met a toddler of 18 months in a maternity hospital. We need emergency fostering situations in those cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to young people with handicaps, there are examples of pilot projects working to close down institutions and to put up sheltered accommodation, but the implementation is erratic. There are huge difficulties in some counties: for example, only yesterday, some of the staff in Giurgiu County had not been paid. If these people are not paid, who will feed those who cannot feed themselves? That is something we need to address.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to agriculture, there are huge difficulties for both countries: they need investment and modernisation, and we must assist them with that. The uncertainties over the financial perspective are a worry. I would urge Mr Blair, the President-in-Office of the Council, to come to us soon with a resolution to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I am not obsessed with dates, but I am obsessed with delivery. What I am trying to do today is to highlight for those who do not have a voice that their issues are heard here in the European Parliament and that we will watch to ensure that we deliver for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is in the interests of the European Union and its citizens? Firstly, that the process of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession, which we wholeheartedly welcome, should actually be completed successfully. What I object to about it is the obsession with different accession dates. It is of course in our interest that Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia should become Member States of the European Union before the end of the life of this Parliament, that is to say before the 2009 European elections, but whether it is to happen half a year earlier or later strikes me as less important than the actual implementation of that which constitutes the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Mr Horáček is perfectly right to point out that what counts here is not what is in black and white, but what happens in reality. Over the coming months, the Commission, Parliament and the Council will be obliged to join with our Romanian and Bulgarian friends in observing how things actually develop in those countries, and passing judgment after they have done so, and not on the basis of this or that sentiment or resentment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important issue has to do with the Copenhagen criteria, which were devised expressly for the last round of enlargement and are supplementary to the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. We must not allow them to be softened up, for if they are, they will have a detrimental and dangerous effect on future enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is that, although we should, of course, recognise the accession of Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia as an important step, we should, once the deed is done, stop conferring candidate country status willy-nilly. Over the coming years, although we should, of course, hold out the prospect of eventual accession, no more countries should be recognised as candidates for it. South-Eastern Europe must have the prospect of membership, but the first thing we have to do for the moment is to consolidate the EU. Nobody, after all, stands to gain anything from joining a union at the same time as it is dissolving itself to the point of evaporation. What is needed, then, is the definite consolidation of this EU of ours, and Romania and Bulgaria will, without doubt, make their contribution to it. They are European countries, but they can make that contribution only on the basis of facts and of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appreciate the responsible way in which Parliament is handling enlargement policy, and I would like to continue the close, concrete and very viable partnership we have. Unfortunately, I cannot answer all the numerous questions that have been put in connection with this matter. I hope that we will be able to continue the dialogue in the Committee, and bilaterally in the form of urgent questions and oral debate. I will concentrate for now on two or three of the most important questions which have come up in this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been an emphasis in several of the speeches on how important it is for the legal system to function properly, and in fact the practical implementation of the legal system, which is to say the reform of the prosecution and court systems and specifically the effective adoption of these reforms, is absolutely essential for the preparations for accession. This is directly linked to the fight against corruption and organised crime. These reforms must therefore take absolute priority, be the first priority, not least because the influence they have will extend to all areas of life and society, whether it is a matter of access to health services or the corporate business environment. I would like generally to stress the importance of implementation with regard to legal systems as well as other areas. The time for devising strategies and drafting action programmes is over. They are in quite good shape. Now we need practical results: it is time for actions rather than words.</p>
<p class="contents">The most challenging questions in the area of Community policy are agriculture and the treatment of animal diseases. Both countries need to achieve standards that guarantee food safety throughout the EU. Inspections at external borders also need to be improved. On the other hand, there are also examples of good practice in this area: the reaction of the authorities to avian flu in both Romania and Bulgaria was positive. It was swift, efficient and professional, and was therefore encouraging for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members asked about genetically modified organisms. I am fully aware that genetically modified soya is grown in Romania. On the other hand, we have to consider that EU legislation will be applied in this area from the time of accession. As this soya production is not strictly on European Union soil at present, it is not a matter of contravention of EU law. If, at the point when Romania joins the Union, the EU has not permitted the production of genetically modified soya, Romania will simply have to obey EU legislation and destroy the soya crop. The Commission will be following this closely, and I can assure you that the situation will be under control.</p>
<p class="contents">The monitoring mechanism that we adopted in its improved form a year ago is yielding results. A good example is the reform of the legal system referred to and competition and state subsidy policy in Romania. These have moved from the category of serious matters of concern to one where work with a clear objective is still needed. The Commission will continue its close monitoring of Bulgarian and Romanian preparations. Before the report is drafted in April or May, the Commission will undertake tours of inspection with experts from the Member States to assess the most worrying areas of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to say that the best service we could do Bulgaria and Romania and the citizens of these countries is to keep to the terms of accession. Accordingly, these reports will point out not only the progress that has been achieved but, first and foremost, the flaws that are still apparent, thus ensuring that these countries and their governments receive support for their reform policies. Conditionality policy therefore acts as a force to change society, and that lies at the heart of enlargement policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Comparisons to football have been made in this Chamber. Mr Lagendijk started this and, as he thinks of himself as the incarnation of Johan Cruyff, no doubt for very good reason, I could probably say finally that, instead of a <span class="italic">catenaggio</span>-type hedgehog defence for Bulgaria and Romania, it is now worth putting some effort into an aggressive, all-embracing soccer match in the reform policies of both countries. Now is not the time for passivity, but for activity and determination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
