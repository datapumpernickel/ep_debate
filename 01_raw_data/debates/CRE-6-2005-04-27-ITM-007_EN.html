<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simon Coveney (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I welcome the presence of the Council and the Commission, who are here to listen to our deliberations on an important report. It has been a fascinating and challenging experience for me to produce the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EU’s policy on the matter. It is my first report in Parliament and I was glad to take on such a significant one. It was an honour for my party to be given the rapporteurship.</p>
<p class="contents">The title of the report is very broad-ranging and the report itself correspondingly deals with very many issues and very many countries. Seventy countries are dealt with in this report, where we shine a light on human rights abuses. The report deals with 70 different countries and eight thematic issues. Therefore, I was determined from the outset to give the report a very tight structure so that people interested in different human rights issues and themes in different countries, could navigate it quickly and efficiently, as opposed to having a lengthy report with no headings, requiring people to read a third, half or indeed the whole report to find the area in which they were interested.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparation process has been a detailed one. We debated this report in the Subcommittee on Human Rights on 23 November 2004, again on 31 January 2005 and on 17 March – St Patrick’s Day – 2005. The full Committee on Foreign Affairs has also had plenty of time to debate and contribute to this report. It did so on 17 January, 16 March and again on 29 March. The process has therefore been thorough. Consultation between the groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, has been constructive and positive and I wish to thank my colleagues in other groups for that process. From the outset I made it quite clear that I wanted this report to reflect the concerns of Parliament as a whole and not of any one group. I hope we have achieved that and that it will be reflected in a strong endorsement of the report tomorrow. I have no reason to believe that will not be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we get down to the real question: what has all this work been about; what useful purpose that can this report serve now and in the future? Let me outline the contribution I believe it can make. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, this report must set the agenda for Parliament and must be a guide for Parliament when it tries to influence both the Commission and the Council with regard to the direction they should be taking on thematic issues and the priority the European Union gives to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thematic issue is a difficult one politically. It concerns human rights and the fight against terrorism, which in many ways seems like a contradiction in terms. However, we are living in a modern world, where there are real terrorism threats both to Europe and to other parts of the world, on which the European Union must take a position. At the same time, we must be true to our values in relation to respect for human rights and try to get the balance right. I would encourage the Council in particular to look at the first thematic issue in detail. I believe the report makes a balanced attempt to answer that difficult political question.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thematic issue is children’s rights. I received a lot of lobbying on this issue, and mush attention was devoted to it. It is genuinely felt that the European Union has not responded comprehensively and could improve its policy in this area. Therefore, the report calls on the Commission to present, as soon as possible, a detailed communication on children’s rights, linking the issue with EU development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area concerns the impact that conflict situations have on women and children, leading to tragic consequences on a regular basis. It deals with issues such as rape as a war tool. Many thousands of women have been abused in the most horrific ways during conflict situations, as a tool of war. It also deals with the issue of child soldiers. Unfortunately, there are still tens of thousands of children who have AK-47s put into their hands and are sent out to war to kill other people. It deals with the psychological effects that has on those children as they grow older. I shall refer to the European Union’s response to that shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">The next section relates to the death penalty, an area where the European Union has had a lot of success in influencing its neighbours through the Neighbourhood Policy and has brought about a moratorium on the death penalty in many countries. Indeed, we are working towards achieving a ban on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also deals with trafficking in human beings, the role of international business and its responsibilities in the human rights field and, perhaps most important of all, the issue of impunity and the role of the International Criminal Court, which deserves the support of the European Union. It is my belief that in many parts of the developing world impunity is the single biggest contributing factor to continued human rights abuses, because people believe that they will not be punished or held to account for the horrific actions they either sanction or take themselves. This report very strongly supports the ICC. It also strongly encourages the European Union to persuade influential countries such as the United States to support the ICC.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also deals with many individual countries. I have been encouraged by the growing influence that the European Union clearly has on many countries in the world. Many ambassadors and representatives from different countries have come to me concerned …</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span><span class="italic"></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Coveney on this excellent report. As he has just said, it presents a very broad and very full picture of the human rights situation viewed from a number of angles.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever, human rights are at the heart of the international debate. The sixty-first session of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights has just concluded in Geneva. In March, the United Nations Secretary-General published his report entitled: ‘In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all’. He has therefore in a way put the question of human rights at the centre of our concerns for the peaceful development of our world.</p>
<p class="contents">You do a similar thing in your report. You paint a picture of the human rights situation in the world, an uncompromising picture which shows that we must continue to be concerned about human rights. It also calls for even more decisive, even more committed action in defence of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always been keen to defend and promote human rights; it is a key part of our external policy. In the light of the challenges of globalisation and in view also of the ongoing deterioration in respect for human rights in many parts of the world, the European Union needs to make greater efforts to promote and defend human rights, first of all internally with the governments, but also with civil society, non-governmental organisations, national parliaments and international bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that must be at the very heart of our defence of human rights is a commitment to resolving conflicts, conflicts which are often the very source of contempt for the human person. You condemn a number of cases in your report, with your tragic review of human rights violations in many parts of the world. In this connection, I believe the UN Secretary-General’s report, reform of the United Nations system, the prominence given to human rights with a link between UN reform and greater respect for the Charter and the Declaration on Human Rights are very important.</p>
<p class="contents">May I simply say that the European Union is first of all a community of values, a community of values, incidentally, which is better rooted in the draft Constitution, especially through the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This community of values that we aspire to be requires us to defend the principles of democracy and respect for human rights in the world. These values are and must be our guide in choosing between the tools we have available for conducting our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand, Mr Coveney, that I cannot reply in detail to all the issues raised in your report or to all the extremely useful and extremely rich headings it contains. I will therefore confine myself to a few of the questions you raise, while assuring you, on the Council’s behalf, that our services will continue to study this document and take account of the many suggestions you make there.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore highlight a number of aspects whose importance justifies dwelling on them more particularly, beginning with dialogue. We try to raise the issue of human rights wherever we have the opportunity and with all our negotiating partners. That is also why human rights are always an integral part of every agreement we conclude with partners, even if they are mainly economic agreements. We have in that way begun a ‘human rights’ dialogue with China, making clear that human rights are not a luxury of rich developed countries but something that must go hand in hand with economic development. We have also started ‘human rights’ consultations with Russia. This is one aspect of the ‘four common spaces’ approach that we are hoping to capitalise on at the next summit with Russia on 10 May. At this very moment, too, an EU troïka is discussing ways of resuming the human rights dialogue with Iran. Human rights are also an integral part of our relations with Teheran on other important matters: respect for human rights cannot in fact be separated from the other fundamental questions on which we are working.</p>
<p class="contents">This is long-term work, we know. Even if it is difficult, not to say impossible, to quantify the results gained from these human rights dialogues, we believe they are an essential tool for advancing the cause of human rights in the different countries concerned. The need to find common ground with our negotiating partners obviously does not mean that we need not make regular appraisals of those dialogues. Our aim is to improve the situation on the ground, and definite results like respect for the rule of law or the release of political prisoners are signs that we are having success with such dialogues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to strongly emphasise the support we give to human rights organisations in a number of countries, as you also do in your report. It is unacceptable that European Union funds devoted or allocated to human rights organisations in some countries should be blocked by their governments; I believe the President of Parliament brought this home forcefully when visiting one of those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word about a subject that is close to our hearts: respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism. This is first of all a moral question and then one of effectiveness. Those who think they can weaken respect for human rights on the pretext of fighting terrorism are in a sense giving way to the terrible blackmail of the worst enemies of democracy, the terrorists. We cannot go down that road. The attacks of 11 September 2001 have indeed made terrorism one of the European Union’s priorities, but we have said, and we said it again recently before the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, that the efforts made to fight against terrorism must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Moreover, on 21 September 2001 the Council stated that the fight against terrorism should be inseparable from the respect for fundamental freedoms on which our civilisation is based. At the recent session of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, the European Union played an active part in negotiations on this subject, contributing to the adoption of a resolution on respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism. That resolution provides for the appointment of a special rapporteur and will therefore help to strengthen the protection of human rights in the fight against terrorism. The cooperation, to which you refer in your report, between the Personal Representative on Human Rights recently appointed by the Council's Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP and the EU’s Counter-Terrorism Coordinator is entirely consistent with our policy in the matter and we are keen to develop it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention some other questions to which you attach great importance. First, the rights of the child. We always speak of the rights of man, but we should as a matter of priority pay attention to the often calamitous situation of the child victims of conflict and also of poverty. I believe the European Union has a special part to play here, and we shall have to see how we can step up our activities in support of children’s rights. In this connection, I would also like to point out that the draft Constitution makes explicit reference to the protection of children’s rights. I believe we should extend our activities to this end, at the level of our development aid and in the context of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of the rights of women who are the victims of conflicts, and that of strengthening the European Union’s action to prevent all forms of trafficking in human beings, of which women and children are generally the main victims. This is an area where the European Union needs to step up its action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to underline the freedom of information and the right to information. Your Parliament has done a lot to encourage this right. Journalists are often imprisoned, tortured, harassed in all kinds of ways and, today, taken hostage. This is a good time to spare a thought for those journalists who have been held hostage in Iraq for more than 100 days.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue you raise in your report is the future Fundamental Freedoms Agency and the risk of duplication resulting from the large number of bodies concerned with human rights. We decided back in 2003 that the mandate of the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia should be reviewed and that we should consider making it into an agency. The Commission then embarked on a large-scale public consultation. The very large number of individuals and organisations that expressed their ideas on the future role of the Monitoring Centre and its conversion into an agency for fundamental freedoms and human rights clearly shows the extent to which citizens feel they are affected by human rights issues. We can only welcome that. Following this consultation, the Commission began to draft a proposal for a regulation based on the many ideas received. The proposal will then be examined according to the normal procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is therefore premature to discuss this agency here, I would nevertheless like to stress that, given the scale of the task, there will never be too many of us concerned with protecting and defending human rights. We are aware of the problems and we intend to strengthen cooperation between the various bodies concerned. Our aim is to strengthen all the instruments and all the bodies that serve human rights, working together and in coordination so that our action will be effective while avoiding any duplication, since that would be an irresponsible waste of our resources.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joaquín Almunia,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to begin by apologising on behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who has not been able to come here today, and also by saying how pleased I am to be able to replace her to discuss an issue which is so essential to our model of society, of political and civic community, and to our European project.</p>
<p class="contents">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights begins by pointing out that ‘recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world’. All of us, in carrying out our responsibilities and in our daily and private lives, have the duty to promote and protect the rights of all human beings everywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s report on human rights that we are discussing this afternoon makes an extremely important contribution and I would like to begin by paying a warm tribute to Mr Coveney on his excellent work, which illustrates once again this Parliament’s firm commitment to human rights. The report contains extremely important food for thought and many very useful recommendations; there are too many of them for me to respond in detail to all of the issues it raises, but, as usual, the Commission will follow up this debate by responding to every one of the report's recommendations in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to certain points raised by Mr Coveney in his report. Specifically, I would like to make some brief comments on three issues: firstly, on the rights of children, in particular in armed conflicts, secondly, on human rights activists and, finally, on the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the rights of children, the Commission is pleased that the report places emphasis on this point. In recent years, the European Union has implemented an effective framework for integrating the rights of children into its policies and programmes, in cooperation with UNICEF, we have launched a specific training programme on the rights of children and, last September, we established an Interinstitutional Group on this issue. The Commission plays an active role in the application of the European Union’s guidelines on children and armed conflicts approved in 2003: we regularly raise the issue in our dialogue with third countries and with representatives of groups involved in armed conflicts. For example, during her visit to Sri Lanka in March, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had the opportunity to place particular emphasis on the importance of eradicating the use of children in these conflicts. The Commission supports a wide range of projects dealing with the different aspects of this problem and, following a thorough analysis, we have decided to direct funds from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights towards support and training programmes in third countries. The aim of these programmes and these resources is to make progress in the application of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to point out that the group of commissioners on human rights places particular emphasis on this issue. My colleagues have reviewed the work of the Commission in this field and are currently considering the best way to prioritise this issue; one of the possibilities being considered is the approval of a communication, as suggested by Mr Coveney in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wished to refer to human rights activists. In his speech to the United Nations general assembly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that human rights activists are our eyes and ears and that they represent our collective conscience. They are a crucial source of information on the events taking place in third countries. We, therefore, the European Union, depend on them, on human rights activists, to provide us with information. This means that we have an immense responsibility to protect them, we must focus on improving the follow-up and communication of information and, in this regard, a firm commitment on the part of the European Union's missions and the Commission's delegations in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is determined to play an active role in implementing the guidelines on human rights activists. To this end, our campaign prioritises ‘promoting a culture of human rights’, which is one of the four key elements of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. Furthermore, we place particular emphasis on supporting local human rights organisations in third countries. The programming for that Initiative for this year and next year provides for more than 50 European Commission delegations to implement a microprojects plan that will represent more than 30% of the total budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to refer to the International Criminal Court, an institution of vital importance to the international promotion of peace and justice. The Commission considers the Court to be one of the fundamental components of a regulated international order. Thanks to this Court, those guilty of mass violations of human life and dignity know that the international community is going to call them to account and we all hope that this will reduce the frequency of these crimes, but in those places where they take place and where national systems do not wish or are not able to act, the international community now has a complementary system of criminal justice, enforced by means of the Court, which must distribute justice in an impartial, transparent and effective manner. This is the only way to ensure that it is seen as a legitimate institution and to ensure that many other States sign up to the Rome Statute which established the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union believes that there are three fundamental principles in relation to the Court. Firstly, the principle of the Court’s universality, and to that end we are campaigning throughout the world to increase the number of ratifications of the Rome Statute, and I am pleased that, in March, 77 ACP countries jointly agreed to include a commitment to ratification of the Statute in the new Cotonou Agreement, which will be signed soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe that the principle of the Court’s integrity, which has been attacked by some countries, is fundamental. For example, the bilateral immunity agreements proposed by the United States undermine the very concept of the Court. The Commission is also concerned about the system of sanctions imposed by the United States on those countries that refuse to sign those agreements and we are continuing to express our concern about these issues in our dialogue with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third principle of the Court is complementarity with national judicial systems; international justice is not a replacement of national justice. We therefore support the reconstruction of legal systems in those countries in which the judiciary has not been able or has not had the will to tackle mass violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption on 31 March of a United Nations Security Council resolution on the situation in Darfur, which refers for the first time to the International Criminal Court, makes us very hopeful.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you, on behalf of the Commission, that the large number of countries and issues dealt with in the report will be an immense help when we begin our work soon on the European Union’s annual report on human rights. I would therefore like once again to thank, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, Mr Coveney and the European Parliament as a whole for your excellent work and to point out once again that we are always prepared to cooperate with Parliament in this task.</p>

<p class="contents">This report on human rights in the world clearly demonstrates the inescapable and total commitment of the European Union, in general, and this Parliament, in particular, to the cause of human rights, which must not be preached to any one region, country or continent, but which must be of global or universal significance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we in Europe must demonstrate intellectual modesty when approaching this task, and that we must take the view that, before launching ourselves into the task of putting the world to rights, we should first take a look at our own house.</p>
<p class="contents">In applying this reference to human rights, which the European Union implements by means of the democratic clause in the association and cooperation agreements, we must not show double standards and we must apply them equally to all countries, large, medium or small.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must be rigorous in our demands for respect for human rights, that we must be precise, that we must not indulge in exaggeration and, Mr President, we must take a generous view of the progress being made by many developing countries in their legislation and their real situations. Because the European Union’s action, Mr President, must be geared towards promoting these processes, stimulating them and providing incentives in order to ensure that human rights eventually take hold in every region of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to refer to three of the many important aspects presented by Mr Coveney in his report that have attracted my attention in particular. Firstly, the reference to the case of Somalí Mam and to the work she has been doing to combat child prostitution and to defend the 91 girls kidnapped from one of the reception centres in which she carries out her social work. It is also worthwhile focussing on certain cases relating to the application of the death penalty in countries such as the Philippines. I would also like to take advantage of this forum, Mr President, to refer – and I believe this is relevant within the context of this discussion of human rights – to the Spanish citizen Carlos Ayala, a European Commission official based in Bogotá, where it appears he has been kidnapped in strange circumstances. I would like to draw the attention of this House to this case, and to ask that the consequences and causes of his disappearance be clarified and, of course, call for his release.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by congratulating the rapporteur and expressing my hope that this Parliament will vote for this report tomorrow morning by the large majority it deserves.</p>

Firstly, on children and armed conflict, we welcome the emphasis on children’s rights. We have specifically sought to widen the definition of child competence to include messengers, spies, cooks and porters, because children in all these roles are vulnerable to risk. On the issue which divides this House, we insist that rape is a tool of war and therefore, access to full reproductive health rights has to be one of the human rights we defend in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, on human rights and business, a major faultline has been identified in our debates between the promotion of corporate responsibility by companies themselves and public authorities using our responsibility to ensure the principle of corporate accountability. The UN norms on business and human rights form the best basis from which to develop a set of global standards for the human rights responsibilities of transnational corporations and we must support them.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, on terrorism, the report is right to condemn terrorism in all its forms, as well as to insist that all actions to combat terrorism fully respect international human rights and humanitarian law. But the references in the report to targeting the democratic process and to the relationship between fundamentalism and terrorism go too near, we contend, to equating Islam and the Muslim peoples of this world with terrorism. I accept that is not Mr Coveney’s personal intention, but we wish to see that wording withdrawn to avoid any confusion. Muslims are as committed to peace and non-violence as all other religions – and none – in this world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have sought to ensure that paragraphs 210 to 230 of the report address the specific instruments to promote human rights that we have as a European Union: the human rights dialogues, the human rights clause in our agreement with third countries, our representations in Geneva and New York, the actions and implementation of the guidelines and the European initiative on democracy and human rights. I invite other political groups in Parliament next year to join us in focusing more exclusively on holding the Council and the Commission to account on how effectively these instruments are used. I invite the Council in its response this afternoon to say that it will submit its own annual human rights report to this Parliament so that this report next year can be a response to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Coveney. His compliments to the shadow rapporteurs are more than returned. He has done an excellent job and it is a very good report.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Johan van Hecke, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the 2004 human rights report has turned out to be an honest and balanced document, and I too should like to thank the rapporteur for his efforts. Initially, though, it was to be feared that this report would be marred by the same lack of consistency and coherence as the human rights policy of the Council and the Member States that very often demand sanctions against poor countries from the south but turn a blind eye to serious human rights violations in more economically interesting countries. It would have been unacceptable if Parliament had once again agreed to human rights being made subordinate to economic or commercial interests. Thanks to the rapporteur’s openness and willingness to listen, however, the report as it stands does not evade the more delicate points. All problems are tackled, irrespective of the size or economic interest of the countries involved. It is high time, I think, that the Council and Member States followed the same course; if not, the European Union is at risk of rapidly losing its credibility as protector and guardian of human rights worldwide. This was once again evident recently during the 61st meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, where no resolutions were submitted on China, Russia or Iran. There is, I believe, a clear need for better coordination, more circulation of information and less ambivalence. I am pleased that the report takes note of positive developments, including in a number of developing countries, particularly in Africa, despite the major political and economic problems with which the black continent still has to contend. The successful reconciliation process in Rwanda, Burundi and in other countries illustrates that progress is definitely possible. Africa is at a turning point and the European Union must continue to support the fragile, early successes on that continent. The Coveney Report is right to press for closer cooperation with the International Criminal Court in the fight to ensure that crimes do not go unpunished. After all, democracy and reconciliation go hand in hand with justice. Quite a few developing countries, however, are under enormous pressure from the United States to undermine the Criminal Court’s good work. If the European Union and the Member States are really serious about the ICC, they must give those countries that refuse to bow to US threats economic and commercial compensation using all the means at their disposal. The ICC has meanwhile launched inquiries into the situation in Congo and also Northern Uganda where the population continues to suffer at the hands of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and their terrorist activities. Entire villages are being massacred and burnt down; children are abducted and used as soldiers or sex slaves, yet it would take only a small-scale, limited military effort to put the LRA out of action for good and to put a stop to the most serious human rights violations in the world. Unfortunately for the population who have to experience the cruelties on a daily basis, Northern Uganda has no oil, coltan or other raw materials that might induce the international community to take an interest in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has tabled a limited number of amendments, one of which stresses the need for enforcing the arms embargo against China until such time as the Chinese Government demonstrates that new anti-secession laws do not entail any aggression in respect of the Taiwanese population. If this amendment is approved, my group will support the Coveney report with even more conviction.</p>

This time, however, we really must express our admiration for the work Mr Coveney has done; he has listened very hard and worked meticulously to produce what really is a full, clear and fair report. We can all see that successfully appraising the human rights situation country by country is not an easy thing to achieve. I would therefore like to add my own sincere congratulations to all those that have been addressed to him.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains a tremendous number of positive points and my Group is particularly pleased with the balance it achieves in the matter of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism. That is a subject which I believe is attracting a lot of attention internationally, at European level and in this House, and what we are seeing today – I mean what has just been decided following the UN session – will, with the rapporteur’s help, enable us to make very significant progress in the matter. My group also welcomes the extension of civil and political rights to economic and social issues with an important chapter on the social responsibility of business.</p>
<p class="contents">When we consider the amendments tomorrow, I would like us also perhaps to recognise the right to development as an inalienable human right, as the UNDP’s work on the degradation of ecosystems and the effects of pollution on our ability, on a world scale, to achieve the Millennium goals invites us to do and as was stated in a United Nations declaration in 1986. The Johannesburg summit also reiterated the essential nature of respect for environmental and social standards and human rights. I will be inviting you to consider these questions tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I believe the most important thing about this report is probably the ability, an ability we can continue to develop in the years ahead, to analyse the European Union’s instruments for protecting and promoting human rights and democracy in the world. I believe that is an extremely important chapter. Everyone today can see to what extent the European Union’s credibility, people’s expectations of it and what it will become with the hoped-for adoption of the Constitution are focussed around the question of human rights and democracy, and I do not believe we will be able to get a European way of doing things accepted in dialogue, in credibility and in equity if we are incapable of making considerable progress internally, between our institutions. If we really want all our mechanisms to be monitored and evaluated, the European Parliament must be involved, and kept informed about, every action decided in accordance with the guidelines and with the structured human rights dialogues and be involved in all the measures taken by the Commission and the Council. Our policy will be more effective and more coherent if we have better interinstitutional dialogue.</p>

It is, in reality, an extensive report, full of statements with which we can agree, which are simplistic at times and marked by a certain desire to please. At the same time, however, the report is very careful – and on this point I disagree with Mr van Hecke – to avoid disgruntling the European Union’s economic and political partners. It can be argued that this report is very weak towards the strong and, all too often, very negligent towards the weak.</p>
<p class="contents">Many examples can be cited: no mention is made of the tragic situation of the Kurdish population in Turkey, which is yet to join the European Union and thus should have been included in such a document. There is an unwillingness, however, to upset relations with Turkey. With regard to Iraq, there is a reluctance to single out US responsibility in the treatment of prisoners: virtually nothing is said on the subject of Abu Ghraib. Regarding Colombia, again no criticism is made of the role of the government and its relationship with the paramilitary forces. The Israeli Government is asked to stop building the wall, but is not explicitly denounced for it. Aside from that, no reference whatsoever is made to the lack of respect for freedom of information in Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore say that, in some ways, this document has not made the best of the opportunity presented and that, if it remains in its current state, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will not be able to lend their support to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new Palestinian leadership must put a stop to terrorist acts directed against Israel. The Council, the Commission and Parliament should also endorse this urgent appeal; if they do not, we might as well give up all hope of a resumption of the peace talks. Meanwhile, the forthcoming Palestinian parliamentary elections present the European institutions with a serious and urgent problem, in the shape of participation by Hamas, the Islamic organisation that features on the EU’s terror list with good reason. In fact, Hamas is expected to achieve good results in the ballot. How do the Council and the Commission intend to respond to that? Israel’s Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, fears that, after the parliamentary elections, the European Union will no longer consider Hamas a terrorist movement, and he is prepared to continue talks about a peace deal only as and when the Palestinian militant groups are completely disarmed and dismantled. If I remember rightly, the European Union made the same demands of the Palestinian Authority years ago. What will the Council and the Commission say to the Israeli Prime Minister? Whatever the case may be, you cannot tell this House that the inclusion of political parties with a military arm, in other words terrorist units, would be of any benefit whatever to the democratisation process in the Middle East, a region in which I would urge you to act consistently. A clear and principled European position of this kind will help the Israelis and Palestinians to reach a reasonable political settlement on human rights and human lives in that region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, we believe there are parts of it that could be improved, and the matter of the arms embargo against China is undoubtedly one of the latter. If I may, however, I should like to focus on a number of amendments to the report which were rejected by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and which have now been tabled again in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard certain Members invoke reproductive health rights during almost every debate in the House in recent months on issues such as measures to combat AIDS, women’s rights in Europe and throughout the world and our humanitarian policy objectives. Bearing in mind the WHO’s definition of reproductive health rights, the implication is that we are being asked to vote on abortion. I am prepared to believe that all the Members of this House, and indeed all of us in Europe, are acting in good faith, yet I find it impossible to understand that abortion can be alluded to so frequently and with such flippancy, when it is something that a great many people all over the world believe to be morally inadmissible and cruel. This is the reasoning behind a great many of the amendments to this report. Even if not all of us are certain that human life is present at conception and during the first stages of pregnancy, there is surely no one who would argue rationally that we can be 100% certain that human life is not present during those first days, weeks and months of pregnancy. No one can be sure of such a thing. In this day and age, no one can rule out the possibility that abortion is an attack on innocent and defenceless human lives. The fact that we cannot be certain means that we should ask ourselves whether it is worth taking a risk when the stakes are so high. Do we want to be viewed by future generations in the same way that we now view those who were racist or who supported slavery? Do we want to be viewed as a society that realised it was unfair to discriminate against people on the basis of their race or origin, but that was entirely oblivious of the fact that it did itself discriminate against people on the basis of their stage of development? In order to prevent the risk of this happening, we should avoid making any reference to abortion or reproductive rights in our documents. I am quite sure that every single one of the objectives of our humanitarian policy could be achieved without any mention of abortion and reproductive rights, and this would allow us to act with a great deal more unanimity and solidarity. I thank you for your attention, and I would ask you not to view my comments as a statement of political confrontation. I am speaking in good faith as someone who believes in European unity, and who believes that Europe’s task is to pursue moral policies that do not attempt to impose on the rest of the world solutions to issues upon which we ourselves are divided in Europe.</p>

When this report then establishes that Moldova’s competing parties did not have equal access to the media in the previous ballot result and could not count on impartial coverage about the campaign, I am pleased that the rapporteur is concerned about such values as free expression of opinion and an independent press. In countries such as Algeria and Saudi Arabia, too, those values, according to this report, are trampled underfoot on a massive scale. This report, though, is very selective – after all, you do not talk about rope in the house of a man who hanged himself. Indeed, it could have occurred to the rapporteur that Belgium, which is, after all, the country in which this Parliament is based, suffers the same ailments as Moldova, Algeria and so many other countries. In my country, VRT, the public broadcasting corporation, which is funded by all Flemish taxpayers, has, in totalitarian fashion, decreed that it will not invite the largest party in Flanders, the <span class="italic">Vlaams Belang</span>, to appear, which amounts, in effect, to censoring it. So it is that Flanders’ only opposition party is formally denied access to the public broadcasting corporation and gagged in the best tradition of the former East Germany. From now on, a politburo of left and far-left editors-in-chief, not unlike the Soviet Union’s former People’s Commissioners, will decide whether reports about my party can be broadcast; only those that depict the party in a bad light will be. No greater obsequiousness and venal sycophancy in respect of the establishment has ever before been displayed in the EU by publicly-paid journalists. The freedom of expression and the right to information from varied sources has become a joke in Belgium; this is completely at odds with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I would urge all my fellow MEPs, irrespective of their party political allegiance, to sign the written declaration which we submitted today to lodge their concern about this <span class="italic">Gleichschaltung</span> of the media in my country and to denounce the totalitarian attitude of Belgian radio and television. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have always supported the highest civil and political rights and good governance for all states. Democracy is the ideal form of government that enables the full consent of the peoples involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the world is a complex place and a number of issues remain relative rather than absolute. For instance, a balance must be struck between a state’s right to defend itself against terrorist action and the need to ensure civil rights for prisoners. This is illustrated by the Guantánamo Bay situation. The United States felt that its national security was threatened after the 9/11 attacks and therefore had to detain large numbers of suspects until the lack of danger could be proven. Now of course many have been released. Another case is the reference to the condemnation of the security fence built by Israel, which has dramatically reduced the number of Palestinian suicide bombers who cross into Israel to kill innocent Israelis. Yet many of my colleagues here believe that the fence represents an annexation of Palestinian territory by Israel, although the final borders will be settled only through a land-for-peace deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is impunity, which of course we all rightly condemn. It is also a tricky issue as we have seen in countries such as Algeria, or, in the past, South Africa. The parliament of Algeria is currently debating an amnesty for all those guilty of crimes against detainees, in the interests of peace and reconciliation and turning over a new page. Regrettably perhaps, sometimes the carrot of amnesty is the only way of guaranteeing a lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been also involved in the report on Uzbekistan and the question of a carrot-and-stick approach to this Central Asian republic which has no traditions of human rights or democracy and is now taking firm steps in that direction, something that must be encouraged. This House must also look more closely in general at the human rights clauses in the EU Association Agreements in countries such as Syria, which continue to be one-party dictatorships. In the case of Syria, there is also the issue of support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I remain deeply sceptical of the need for an EU human rights agency within or outside our borders. This would duplicate the work of other bodies such as the United Nations, the OSCE or the Council of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would not dare do otherwise, therefore, and I thank him in my turn.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to say that the report on human rights is a virtually impossible exercise. There are in fact at least three traps into which it can fall. The first is for there to be no consistency between one human rights report and the next. I would like to tell Mr Szymański we voted in favour of the right to reproductive health as a human right last year: I hope we will do the same this year. The second trap is that of double standards. I am, for example, amazed to find a whole paragraph on Morocco, which has made constructive efforts on human rights, but to find only one line on other countries that are blatantly violating human rights. It is the law of the genre. A third trap is perhaps lack of transparency. We have in fact compromised in some areas, and as they stand some paragraphs suggest we have been less critical of great powers than we would have liked. I will say no more about that; it is somewhat inevitable in an exercise like a human rights report.</p>
<p class="contents">More seriously, I would like to say that it is clear that there are some paragraphs which my party will not accept, paragraph 78 in particular, which condemns the Council for lifting sanctions against Cuba. I would like to tell the Council that I welcome this act of openness. I do not think that economic sanctions have ever helped democracy; on the contrary, they have served to completely harm and weaken nations. There are therefore some paragraphs, some amendments to which my Group will be particularly sensitive and which will determine its vote at the end of the day. That has, however, nothing to do with the qualities of the rapporteur, whom I thank once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is human rights abuses in Kashmir and the second is the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to start by discussing paragraph 49 on Kashmir. I would firstly like formally to thank Mr Coveney for his approach in dealing with this matter and the way in which he has been open to considering representations made by my colleague Mrs Lynne and myself. Through a process of dialogue between our respective offices, paragraph 49 is now an adequate recognition of the position.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I welcome the dialogue between Pakistan and India, but we must not forget that the people of Kashmir are also stakeholders in this process. We cannot expect real lasting peace in the region unless they are able to play their full and proper part in the dialogue. Equally, I welcome the recognition of the role of the Indian military and police in carrying out abuses and call upon the Indian Government to do all within its power to end such abuse immediately. Equally, I urge the wider world to recognise that this burning issue between two nuclear powers deserves external input to facilitate dialogue between the stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the fight against terrorism, I welcome paragraphs 101 to 108 as they deal directly with issues pertaining to the current situation in many countries, including some European states, where citizens who follow the Islamic faith are being targeted in a systematic fashion for no reason other than the fact that they choose to follow the Islamic faith or they are perceived to be Muslim. This has been explicitly admitted by government ministers at a national government level and is something against which we must take a stand as a parliament. I am therefore encouraged by the above paragraphs, as we are taking a stand on the issue of the unnecessary and disproportionate erosion of civil liberties undertaken by governments against their own citizens under the guise of the prevention of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to highlight paragraph 111, to draw attention to the use by some states of torture by proxy and the potential reliance on evidence obtained by such means. I am saddened to say that there are reports of prisoners being removed from within the EU to outside countries, for evidence to be extracted by the use of torture. As a parliament we are duty-bound to disapprove of such activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate Mr Coveney on this report that deals with a sensitive area in which the European Union’s credibility is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the context of the proliferation of the trade and association agreements that the Union is promoting, therefore, we must not allow human rights to become a lesser requirement, but rather they should be the very essence of those agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at some examples. With regard to China and before lifting the arms embargo, we must take advantage of the dialogue on human rights we have set up with that country in order to promote internal political changes leading to greater democratisation and improvements in the institutions and justice systems, placing particular emphasis on the so-called three Ts (Tiananmen, Tibet and Taiwan), as well as the abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Morocco, we must also take advantage of our privileged relationship as neighbours to condemn the repeated violation of press freedom, which, amongst other things, would involve Rabat lifting the sentences handed down to journalists such as Alí Lmrabet, observing international law and promoting the Baker plan as a framework for a fair and lasting solution to the conflict in Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">Mexico is another case in relation to which we must insist, on the basis of the association agreement with that country, that the Mexican authorities tackle violence against women with greater determination and political will. Furthermore, we must express regret at the increasing persecution suffered by certain indigenous groups and anti-globalisation activists as a result of their public criticisms of the government.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Colombia, the European Union must reiterate its concern at the constant violation of human rights in that country and the growing threat faced daily by human rights activists. We must therefore urge the Colombian authorities to protect these people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union must promote a series of binding regulations for companies in order to make them responsible for the possible negative impact of their activities on the environment, the social and employment situations of people and peoples and human rights in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, charity begins at home, and in the countries that will one day be part of that home. It is therefore wrong that countries applying to join the EU should be exempt from the assessment. The Kurds and the Turkish democrats do not welcome that exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the spectre of double standards looms large over the report. For example, the report rightly welcomes progress made in Morocco, yet omits the fact that journalists can still be put in prison for referring to the Sahrawi people in Tindouf as refugees and not as hostages.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last point concerns terrorism. I welcome the fact that the report cites hunger and poverty as contributory factors to terrorism and that the fight against terrorism has often eroded the very values that could actually defeat it. The rest, however, remains unsaid. There is not a single word on ongoing military and colonial occupations and the way in which they result in violence against innocent people. Can there be any doubt that Israel’s pursuit of both the fence and the settlements mortgages any lasting solution for peace and human rights in the region, or that the result of the notion of pre-emptive war is, tragically, there for all to see in Iraq?</p>

I particularly liked the fact that he not only clearly identified human rights abuses, he also identified and praised efforts to end such abuses where these efforts are being made. I trust this report will receive widespread and deserved approval. Will we give an equally positive response to the people who, through courage or desperation, flee these human rights abuses and arrive legally or illegally at our borders? I hope so.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the Council that, unfortunately, the EU countries’ response to victims is often to close the door. There is the case of two Ukrainian doctors who risked their lives to expose local Ukrainian businesses that market organ tissue from 20-week-old babies, purchased, birthed and kept alive during the painful harvesting process. After attempts on their lives, the doctors escaped to Ireland last September. They are still in a holding centre with no assurance of being granted asylum and facing the possibility of deportation and death.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not support proposed amendments that would change this constructive report by introducing yet another human rights abuse – abortion – into the already abusive situation of war.

Human rights are no longer being violated in our countries in the way they were for 50 years, firstly during German occupation and then under a Communist regime. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that human rights are still continually and grossly violated all over the world, and this is something of which we should be thoroughly ashamed. The motives behind these violations are quite basic, yet they are intolerable and there should be no place for them in the world today. One of these motives is religion, with Catholics being persecuted in a great many countries. In modern-day China, for example, Catholics are deprived of any rights, and the same is true in a great many other countries. The burning of churches and related events in Indonesia must surely still be fresh in your minds. Another motive is nationality. I find it astonishing that a country like China can persecute people it calls its own citizens, especially given that these people are not in fact Chinese citizens. The people of Tibet are actually entitled to a country of their own. I find it equally astonishing that the world can stand by and watch, and that there have even been calls to lift the embargo against China. This embargo has no real effect, of course, but it testifies to our moral beliefs, and we should act in accordance with such beliefs in this instance. As far as Chechnya is concerned, I find it incomprehensible that Russia can now be considered a political partner like any other, when this is a country that not only murdered a moderate Chechen politician, but also acted in a barbaric manner by refusing to give up his body, and said that he had been buried in an unmarked grave because he deserved nothing better. Similar instances of countries acting like outlaws by persecuting their own citizens can be seen in Cuba and Belarus. This was also what happened in Darfur, and yet the world does virtually nothing in response to events of this kind, although I am of course aware that these issues have been discussed in this House. Persecution of this kind is equivalent to hunting Pygmies with the sole aim of treating them like common game, and it is an extremely serious problem. In colonial times, countries took responsibility, to a greater or lesser degree, for ensuring that order prevailed in their colonies. Today, however, we are frequently confronted with what amounts to conspiracies between entrepreneurs. The latter corrupt local rulers in order to exploit the former colonies in a way that surpasses even the exploitation they suffered in colonial times. These entrepreneurs are not subject to any kind of checks by their home countries. In fact the opposite is true, as they have the backing of these countries. In view of this, I would ask for an investigation to be opened into the following case, which has been covered by the press. A case has been filed with the Paris Military Court regarding the complicity of French soldiers in the genocide and crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda in 1994. Institutions such as the European Parliament have a duty to act as guardians of fundamental human rights, and to monitor the world’s largest countries in order to ensure that they are not collaborating in these gross violations of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a point we must stress in connection with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, because human rights are being violated in countries that border the EU. These violations are not going on in remote and exotic places. They are going on next door to us, in the very same Europe we live in. A second key issue is the fight against terrorism, as the latter is the greatest real threat facing the international community. What is needed is solidarity between EU Member States, yet this is currently lacking, for example with regard to the ‘black list’ of terrorist organisations. This is one instance where there is a real need for the united Europe to speak with one voice, instead of the large Member States of the old EU looking out for their own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the report should have highlighted the fact that religious minorities, and especially Christians, are being persecuted in certain African and Asian countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A remarkable part of this report is dedicated to the countries in Eastern Europe that might in the future become members of the EU family, namely Ukraine, Moldova and even Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress some points which are of great importance for improving human rights in that region. As part of the European Parliament’s delegation, I had an opportunity to observe parliamentary elections in Moldova. Although the election results have been recognised by the international community, it is clear that the elections did not meet certain obligations with respect to a fully competitive electoral process, especially in relation to fair access to the media and impartial coverage of the campaign. In addition, arrests of opposition MPs and other actions against peaceful demonstrations constitute clear violations of fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression, association and assembly. Even a meeting of international observers with the President of the country and ‘number one’ on one political party’s electoral list was used for his party’s campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is to call on Ukraine and Moldova to crack down on smuggling to, from and through Transnistria and to develop effective anti-corruption programmes for the customs, border guard and tax services, as well as the police. On the election day, we observers from this House were not allowed to enter Transnistria, but it was clear that people in Moldova and Transnistria in particular had to face all the negative implications of that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, we should again remind Russia to withdraw its so-called peacekeepers and ammunition from Moldova and specifically from Transnistria, as without this precondition our recommendations to fight corruption, organised crime and the illegal export of weapons will remain gestures of our goodwill but will not become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The elections in Ukraine demonstrated the huge potential of civil society in the countries bordering the EU and in those in which the European Union serves as a basic point of reference in political, economic and cultural matters. Evidence of this democratisation can be seen, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, in the adoption of a constitution and the holding of elections in Afghanistan, in the free elections in Palestine and Iraq and in the major public demonstrations in Lebanon, as well as in the steps that have been taken towards liberalisation in other countries. In Belarus, which is one of the EU’s neighbours, the public is rebelling against authoritarian forms of governance, and a democratic breakthrough can be expected in this country too in the near future. One of the European Union’s current priorities should be to help civil society in Belarus in its struggle for fundamental human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeing improvements in the human rights situations in a number of countries. In December 2004, Uzbekistan issued a decree granting an amnesty to 5 400 prisoners. In August 2003, Uzbekistan’s Parliament, the Oliy Majlis, adopted amendments to the penal code which mean that torture and other forms of inhuman treatment are now deemed to be crimes for which individuals may be prosecuted, at whatever stage of the criminal process they are committed. At the same time as demanding the release of all remaining political prisoners, the European Parliament should call for the independent judiciary to be strengthened and for further reforms to be carried out in the field of human rights, whilst acknowledging the efforts Uzbekistan has made in terms of measures to prevent torture and to improve the situation of detainees. We should also welcome the fact that steps have been taken to end press censorship in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, many people turn with confidence to such important global institutions as the EU or the UN when they feel to be victim of or witness to abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, however, stress that in those situations where people’s rights are the most flagrantly violated, the victims often lack the strength or the resources to be able and know how to defend themselves or point attention to them. This is why it is so important for the European Parliament to follow, in cooperation of its various committees, not only the drafting of the conventions and their ratification status, but also their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed and ratified by almost all the countries of the world. I am, however, convinced that there are a number of European countries where the rights of children do not receive adequate attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, at the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I made an attempt to insert a reference to Article 32 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to Mr Bowis’s report on patient mobility, but my suggestion was not supported by my distinguished colleagues.

I should like to mention three points from it: first of all in my capacity of Vice-Chairman for the delegation in Central Asia. The report is right to put its finger on the sore spot in a number of countries, Uzbekistan, in particular. I know that the Uzbekistani Government claims there are no political prisoners, but you can also get politicians behind bars on a different charge, which has happened, and has not been resolved as yet. This is, in fact, also evident from the Council of Europe’s report further to the most recent parliamentary elections in Uzbekistan. The second point which illustrates that international pressure can be effective, is the situation in Kyrgyzstan. What matters now is for that region to be taken seriously and monitoring to be continued. The third point concerns the freedom of the press in Kazakhstan. Only recently, Irina Petrushova was locked up on account of possible offences completely unrelated to her work, except that she happens to be the most prominent journalist for the opposition newspaper in Kazakhstan. We in this House must continue to put countries like those under pressure, because we have a great deal in common with them; they can take a step forward and we can help them achieve this. My final point concerns the situation in Iran and that country’s way of dealing with people who do not adhere to the main religion, in this case Islam. It was found once again recently that Hamid Pourmand, a former army colonel, had been sentenced to death, his only offence being that he is a Christian. For that reason, he should not have served in the army, although his religious conviction was known. An appeal from this House, in this specific case where a death sentence is pending, is of the utmost importance. I should once again like to congratulate Mr Coveney, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will take this report very seriously as an asset in our foreign policy in the field of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the approval of the amendment which ensured that human rights issues in the Western Balkans were dealt with under a separate heading.</p>
<p class="contents">As the leader of the Hungarian Socialist delegation and as the president of the Intergroup for historical national minorities, constitutional regions and regional languages, I find a major shortcoming in the report’s treatment of national minority rights abuses which are not given due emphasis despite their importance. Although national minority rights abuses are observed in a few instances, in the case of the Western Balkans, they are not even mentioned. It is absurd to think that problems in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina or Serbia can be settled without assuring national minority rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I see two fundamental problems: one of perception and approach, which simplifies national minority rights to human rights. Although we cannot speak of minority rights without human rights, the assurance of human rights in itself does not guarantee national minority rights, which require additional rights as well as special modes of practice and preferential treatment. Another predicament is that the EU lacks minority protection standards and an adequate monitoring system, as these are not part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. The position is paradoxical, since, in the case of the new Member States, the situation of national minorities was part of the 1994 Copenhagen political criteria for joining. Continuous monitoring of the national minority situation by the Union had a very positive effect on national minority issues in the new central European Member States. Why do not we do the same with regard to this report? Why is not there a separate section for national minorities among the thematic issues? I therefore suggest that a whole chapter is dedicated to national minorities in next year’s annual report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In days gone by, while we were still behind the Iron Curtain, we would listen eagerly to the voice of the free world. This voice reached us over the airwaves thanks to radio stations such as Radio Free Europe, the BBC, France International and the Voice of America, and it gave us hope that one day we would witness the dawning of freedom and civil liberties. In the same way, our wish now is for all those suffering persecution for their views or their religious beliefs, and all those held in bleak prisons by dictators under various pretexts, to hear that they have not been forgotten by this House, which lies at the very heart of Europe, and that we are demanding their release and an end to persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done. At the same time, however, there are a few comments I should like to make on the report. Paragraph 12 calls on Moldova and Ukraine to resolve the Transnistria issue, yet it is obvious that no final and complete solution will be found to the problems surrounding this self-proclaimed republic unless Russia is involved, as the latter is backing Transnistria.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor have been in jail in Libya for five years following absurd accusations that they knowingly and intentionally infected 450 children in a Benghazi hospital with HIV. The Commission should demand the release of these prisoners, who have been sentenced to death and whose appeal is due to be heard in a month’s time. I should also like to call on the Commission to pay particular attention to the discrimination suffered by Christians and Christian churches in Muslim countries. Eritrea is the only country mentioned in the report as a place where Christians are persecuted, and no reference at all is made to their fate in Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose that the Commission should prepare a detailed report on the situation of Christian churches in the Middle East, Africa, China and Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the story of an impossible report, and we must express our gratitude to Mr Coveney, of course. It is impossible because it will always be unbalanced — it deals with the entire world — inconsistent — we only have to look at the paragraph on Venezuela for example — and furthermore, every year it is original — because we are not consolidating any of the positions this Parliament has adopted in previous reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Its usefulness is very relative, Mr President, but nevertheless, this report says some very important things. I believe we must redefine the European Parliament’s position on this report: many of the positions adopted by Parliament in other reports and resolutions have no connection whatsoever to our annual report on human rights. Our parliamentary work must focus mainly on making contributions to the report already produced by the Council and in that way it would be possible for us to influence the human rights situation in the world effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and despite the fact that we have been through a very long and very complicated process of achieving a consensus amongst the political groups, I would like to address the Members on the right of this House to ask them to show consistency or responsibility, or if they like, simply compassion, and to support our position on women and girls who are raped, victims of abuse during situations of war or conflict, who need protection before and after they are attacked, and many of whom are made pregnant by their attackers and who must have access to voluntary termination of the pregnancy.

EU standards mean the erosion of standards as principles. In many important cases it is difficult to conclude what has higher priority in our spectrum of common values: real respect for human rights or cheaper gas, gas that is likely to erode our principles and, in the end, Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To the repeated remarks of my colleagues that Russia is very important, my response is: yes, but the truth is more important. I am not going to criticise the great work done by Mr Coveney. I congratulate him. I am only concerned that the common mood of erosion has given rise to gaps or appeasing manoeuvres in so many of our documents. There is often a conscious or subconscious concern not to be too explicit, not to be too hard, not to irritate people even if they are wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Is anybody here concerned about the 40 000 Chechen children killed during the Russian military operation? Do colleagues appreciate the barbaric humiliation inflicted on the body of the assassinated legitimate president? We do not dare to state simple facts: that Russia is not yet a country of shared values, that it is a country whose government allows unfair business practices in its desire to join the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">For many of us, the priority of peace in the Caucasus became a principle indirectly promoted by Russian diplomacy: the integrity of the cemetery.

In reality, it is logical that within such an extensive report, which addresses issues in 70 countries, there may be ideas about which people will not be in complete agreement. In contrast to what has been said by a succession of Members from the European left, however, I should like to point out a few brave positions adopted by the rapporteur with regard to major economic and political powers, towards which this Parliament all too often adopts an ambiguous and diplomatic stance, in a cynical attitude of <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span>, it could be said, to protect foreign trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to China: the Commission and the Council have announced their willingness, if not actually their intention, to abolish the arms embargo. It is true that some progress has been made with regard to human rights, and it is true that China remains a prominent figure in the fight against terrorism, and that it is exerting useful pressure on North Korea to stop developing nuclear weapons. That is not enough, however, and the report recognises it. Above all, I should like to add that there is no need to allow China to exploit existing disagreements between the European Union and the United States on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also referring to Russia, which, in the tragic Chechen crisis and in its running of the country in general, cannot resist adopting measures that have little in common with our own vision of democracy. The report also adopts a clear and precise position on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by wholeheartedly endorsing the idea that, in my view, lies at the heart of this excellent report: no economic or commercial consideration should ever lead the European Union to deny or downplay the existence of human rights violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason why this House’s reports on human rights are important political statements is not that they are binding in law, but that they make a political impact and that conclusions can be drawn from them. Much of what is in this report – and this is what is weak about it – cannot absolutely be described as having to do with human rights issues. Let me give a number of examples.</p>
<p class="contents">We all regard Kyoto as an important issue, but it does not exactly have much to do with human rights. Social rights are important, but they belong in another category. They are not human rights in the traditional sense of the word. The right to an abortion is not a human right; it is a violation of a human right. More to the point, it is not for the EU to tell any country what to do about it; the rule of subsidiarity applies.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this further by quoting Brecht. In his ‘The resistible rise of Arturo Ui’, he wrote: ‘The womb he crawled from is still going strong’. By that he meant the anti-Semitism and racial hatred preached by Hitler and the Third Reich. We cannot be indifferent to anti-Semitism in Russia, particularly when it is propagated by the political class. When 20 members of the State Duma call for Jewish organisations to be banned from Russia, we have to respond, and, likewise, we have to understand that Russia has also been behind the terrible fighting and violations of human rights in Chechnya, and that politics underlies much of what appals us in Beslan and elsewhere. While suicide bombings are indeed murder, they are also carried out in response to political circumstances and causes.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not expect too much of reports on human rights, even of those originating from this House. It is an unfortunate fact that human rights alone will not bring about the political solutions that are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only that, but nor must we apply double standards. It is not acceptable that we should refuse to allow a country like Croatia to enter negotiations with the EU because of its lamentable failure to arrest a general who is suspected of human rights violations, while at the same time opening negotiations with Turkey, which – as we can read in press reports – is continuing to be extremely dilatory about implementing the Copenhagen political criteria. I do not want to hold the Turkish Government responsible for the country’s most popular reading matter turning out to be Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’ – of all things – but you do have to wonder what is going on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tragedy is that its very breadth confirms how widespread human rights problems still are throughout the world and how vital it is that those of us who care about such issues must make sure our voices are heard and that they prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight just one issue as raised in paragraph 49, on human rights issues in Kashmir. I congratulate the rapporteur on the way he has worked with all political groups on this sensitive subject. I am happy to accept his compromise wording but I would still like to have seen references not just to the region of Kashmir but also to the sufferings of the people of Kashmir. This is after all a people issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous paragraph, number 48, makes clear that the largest functioning democracy in the world is India, a country that I much admire. In my judgement, this should inspire India to assume greater moral leadership in the subcontinent and this means working not just with Pakistan, but with all stakeholders to ensure that human rights abuses are resolved with urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday the President of Azad Kashmir came to the Parliament to open an exhibition at the start of EU-Kashmir week, the first time there has been such an occasion. As a Vice-President of the all-party group on Kashmir in the European Parliament, I said then and repeat now that the people of Jammu and Kashmir should take great heart from the fact that this group is genuinely all-party and genuinely represents all nationalities, and that this Parliament remains committed to ensuring that their voices can be heard loud and clear here in this Parliament. We must all look forward to the day when, with our support, the voices of the people can be heard equally loudly and equally clearly in the land of their fathers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members of the opposition have been kidnapped and murdered, elections rigged, demonstrators imprisoned and the press gagged. On top of all of this, the authorities have recently banned citizens from studying abroad without their consent, and imposed restrictions on trips to work legally in other countries. Polish citizens are also being given the opportunity to experience the ‘blessings’ of this kolkhoz-style Communism at first hand, as several of them have had their lorries and cars confiscated for transporting three cartons of cigarettes. I find it quite astonishing that we can stand idly by, and even draft European principles of cross-border cooperation, when not a day passes without us hearing of fresh violations of human rights in a country that is a direct neighbour of the EU. Only yesterday, more than 40 demonstrators were arrested for attempting to commemorate the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. The efforts of the Commission and the Council have merely served to hold back the process of transformation in Belarus, as nearly six months have passed since Parliament’s resolution on the matter, and precisely nothing has happened. Projects intended to promote civil society have got stuck at the stage of analysis, discussion and ordered debates at countless seminars and summit meetings. The Commission does not believe that funding radio stations to broadcast from neighbouring countries would provide added value. In other words, it does not perceive any benefit in values such as freedom of the media, or in providing a source of information other than the Belarussian propaganda. There is now talk of pursuing a common policy on Belarus with Russia. In this connection, I would ask what kind of human rights we would be able to protect in Belarus by cooperating with Russia, and how we would be able to protect them. Would this entail waiting until the hysterical dictator has wronged even more of his fellow citizens? Alternatively, should we leave it to the Americans to come up with a solution to problems in a country bordering the EU, merely because we are more interested in what is going on in Madagascar? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It in fact reflects the great sensitivity of the vast majority of Europeans to this problem. Many Europeans are actively involved in promoting human rights, in fighting to defend them wherever in the world they are violated. Young people especially are particularly interested in promoting human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the message you are sending with this report, and also with this debate, must first of all be a message to young people to show them that the Europe that is being built is a Europe that conveys its human rights values to the world. I believe Europe’s image in the world is closely associated with this human rights message.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those who have said that in themselves human rights alone cannot be the answer to every political problem. A human rights policy cannot replace a foreign policy. Any foreign policy worthy of the name, however, one that is based on values, must give an important place to the defence of human rights. As President-in-Office, that is the message I take from your Parliament, from your report, and I think all the Member States, like the Council, will be attentive to what you have to say. It is true that there is no single solution and there is no easy solution. We cannot treat different situations in the same way, but the basic message remains the same everywhere and the Council must also make that message, which your Parliament has expressed, its own in the policies it puts into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issues we have dealt with have ranged from the fight against terrorism to the violation of the rights of minorities, and they include a whole series of violations of human rights at many levels. You have mentioned many countries and many regions of the world, from practically every continent, and we all agree that we have a great responsibility as representatives of the European institutions and of the will of Europe’s citizens to do our duty and to realise our desire to protect human rights and incorporate their defence into all of our policies, and, in particular, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, into our foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to confirm the Commission’s commitment, and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner’s commitment in particular, to intensifying the dialogue with Parliament and with the Council, with a view to consolidating the approaches set by European policy in this field and by the suggestions and recommendations expressed by Parliament in its report, and would repeat that, in relation to each and every issue that requires a response, the Commission will do so in writing and its response will be available to you as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I went to Venezuela on two occasions last year, and was there at the time of the recall referendum, won by a landslide by President Chávez. It was clear to me that the Venezuelan Government had had difficulty in gaining access to the media, in particular to the various private, opposition-controlled television stations; indeed, the European Parliament delegation was a victim of this. Point 84 of this report is unacceptable, given that it is, in fact, the Venezuelan Government that is seeking cooperation with its neighbouring states.</p>
<p class="contents">I also visited Cuba recently, along with a delegation of Members of three different political groups in Parliament. It is appalling that point 78 of this report does not contain one word about the US blockade of Cuba and that it singles out this country for special treatment and overlooks all of the consequences of the permanent US blockade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
