<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oomen-Ruijten (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it came as a surprise to me as well that this debate was being squeezed in today. The topic of frontier work has fascinated me for over 21 years, the length of time I have served in politics, in the Dutch Lower Chamber, but also in the European Parliament. It fascinates me not only because I am faced daily with problems which frontier workers experience when they live in one Member State and work in another, but also because the mechanics behind it are quite considerable, mechanics which have to be adjusted annually. It also fascinates me because it demonstrates that parliaments, national parliaments that is, are not getting things moving quickly enough. Another reason why it fascinates me is that what politicians appear unable to sort out, the European Court of Justice manages to settle, and Member States are always being lectured about putting right any existing mistakes. This brings me to a remark which I would like to make <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no axe to grind with the European Commission. It is particularly the Council, the members of the Council, who are unwilling to grant frontier work the flexibility it needs, and so we politicians, national politicians that is, leave this for the European Court of Justice to solve. I think this is no longer acceptable, or necessary, for that matter, and that we must make every effort, and employ all means, in order to change this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want in my report – and I would like to thank my fellow MEPs who have helped in the drafting, as well as predecessors who have worked on this dossier – is four things. First of all, I would make an urgent request to the Commission to draft a directive which provides for frontier effect reports. This request has been put to the European Commission and the Member States since 1990. Such reports would oblige Member States, when changing their legislation on social security, taxation or public health, to draft an assessment straight away in order to study the impact on frontier workers. Why? Not because this will make amends, but because it will help us to operate in a preventative manner; and help us to prevent problems from arising.</p>
<p class="contents">My second request to the Council is at long last to incorporate the amendments in Regulation 1408 without any further delays. I believe this dossier has been with the Council of Ministers, the Social Affairs Ministers, for two years now. It includes a number of improvements for frontier workers, as well as – and Mr Doorn mentioned SLIM yesterday – a whole host of provisions which make everything more simple, easy and more readable. The Council must do something about this; Parliament has codecision rights on this dossier. However, the Council must decide unanimously, and I hope that something can be done there.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in my opinion, the Commission should be more alert when it comes to all bilateral taxation agreements which are being concluded, in order to check whether the principles, whereby tax law should be brought into line with social security in the country of employment, are being upheld. This is to prevent problems arising and to prevent people from falling between two stools. As far as this is concerned, the Commission should get its act together a bit more, and check and verify the bilateral taxation agreements more, also in the preliminary phases.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point I want to make concerns medical expenses, or the possibility of benefiting from provisions for medical care in another Member State. Court judgments have been passed on this. This is another area where politicians have let themselves down. There are judgments of the Court of Justice, Kohll-Decker being the most prominent, and I know a few people from my own region, which is a border region, who went to Court. Mr President, neither the Member States nor the Commission have ever submitted any notes to Parliament on this matter. That is shocking. We should not leave matters in the hands of the courts; we as politicians must be able to do something about this. I know very well that when the previous Commissioner, Mr Flynn, was in office, a note was being circulated. I know that the outcome of this was thought to be unpleasant. But it does mean that for once – and I would like to push the Commission in this respect – we had clarity and transparency. The position of active frontier workers, but also that of post-active frontier workers is at stake here. As far as Kohll-Decker is concerned, it applies to all people who live near the border.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the MEPs to vote in favour of the report and certainly also for the amendments which I have tabled. The reason for this is that frontier work is no longer a problem of the old Union of the 15. It impacts on the day-to-day running of the market, also with regard to the candidate countries. I would therefore call for the broadest support possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many and varied are the situations and problems that we continue to encounter in the European internal market, one of the key aspects of which is the freedom of movement of frontier workers. These are problems which cause the people to question the <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Being an MEP in a region bordering Luxembourg, Belgium and France I can identify with all the facets of these issues. Why is a German pensioner, who is undergoing dialysis, only permitted to have access to this for a limited period of time when holidaying in France? The mother of a family in Germany is immediately entitled to child benefit for her second child, but not if her husband works in Luxembourg. Is it permissible for an aunt who is insured in Belgium to be cared for in a nursing home near her family in Germany? Pension entitlements acquired in Italy are subject to enormous outlay before they reach the German pensioner. And why should an honorary mayor working in Germany suddenly have to pay tax on his whole salary, which he earns in Luxembourg, because he receives an expenses allowance? Luxembourg firms are fighting against additional expenditure and additional costs, and so jobs are at risk. This is why people decline the office of mayor.</p>
<p class="contents">The list goes on. Frontier workers must be flexible, so as to be able to cope with the confusion of laws on both sides of the borders. Those who look for a job over the border within the European internal market need legal certainty in a united Europe, particularly in the sphere of social legislation. We MEPs from the border regions in the European Union call upon the Commission and the Council, to provide for more cross-border social justice. We have achieved a great deal, but there is still much to be done. The report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten illustrates the legitimate demands of the people in the border regions. The internal market must also be completed within the labour market if we want to make Europe an integrated whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Ria Oomen-Ruijten for the sound cooperation we enjoyed within the framework of this report. I thought it was a splendid idea to dust down a number of requirements which this Parliament put forward in 1998 further to an own-initiative report and following my own report which is based on a frontier workers petition. It has to be said: not a great deal has happened legislatively speaking over the past three years. We have often said that border regions are good barometers for European integration. If this is the case, then I do not think integration is in terribly good shape these days, because, except for the European Court of Justice, little progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I also regret the fact that the frontier effect test has not even been included in the social agenda and that the Treaty of Nice has not made any decisions with regard to Regulation 1408/71, which only complicates matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the world moves on, and in all manner of countries, tax reforms are under way, social security legislation is in full swing, statutory schemes are being supplemented with additional schemes, and quite a few countries, in a bid to reconcile work, family and leisure time, are coming up with all kinds of schemes for career breaks which will only apply to the country’s own citizens and unfortunately not to frontier workers. I am therefore in total agreement with the European Commission, which intends to institute an inquiry into the Belgian career break scheme, which – I regret to say – does not cover Dutch citizens, whilst the Dutch scheme does apply to Belgians.</p>
<p class="contents">Frontier workers have an added disadvantage compared to other citizens who avail themselves of the free movement of persons principle. They often work in one country and live in another, and pay taxes in one country and their social contributions in another. To have some coherence between the tax policy and social security system in one country would already be something, but to expect this to happen between countries is nothing short of utopia. As a result, frontier workers continue to be at the receiving end of this unsatisfactory situation. Even the most dyed-in-the-wool European federalists among us dare not dream of a time when we could ever achieve the utopian vision of a harmonised social security system or harmonised taxation across Europe. We must therefore look for creative solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two. First of all, the Oomen-Ruijten report is right to breathe new life into the EP requirement on compulsory frontier effect reports on the part of the Member States in all legislative changes which pertain to social security and taxation, with compensation for frontier workers to balance out any drawbacks, a practice which, in fact, is already being implemented in some countries, albeit with some reluctance. Accordingly, my group has some difficulty with the fact that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten toned down the text at the time. We believe that the test must remain in place as a matter of urgency and that compensation must be made compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must have the courage to take the conclusions reached in 1998 a little further. We were unable to halt the Russian roulette for frontier workers at the time. We must, at long last, opt for one levy principle, either in the country of residence or the country of employment. I think there is a whole raft of arguments in favour of the country of employment. I think that, accordingly, my group will be voting against the amendments tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and against those of Mr Manders who wants to eliminate this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this report will emerge from the plenary unscathed and that frontier workers can at long last make some more headway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She, herself, has also indicated that this is an important issue for which little is being done, for which politicians hardly have any consideration, and, as we can see, it is extremely difficult to lend this matter some clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, I have some observations in this respect, which is also apparent from my amendments. I, myself, live in a border region and every day, I see people from my area who commute to another country. Whether this is Germany or Belgium, they cross the border at any rate.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have noticed is that the regulation on social security, No 1408, also applies to workers who decide to move to the country of employment and actually live there. I welcome clarity in this matter, and I have tabled two amendments to this effect. I agree with this position and I have also told Mrs Oomen. But I do believe that we should include a caveat so that, if it transpires that after eighteen months or two years, an assessment should be made and if, based on this assessment, it appears that frontier workers are suffering disproportionate drawbacks, a different choice can be made, and I would like to see this caveat included in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen takes the country of employment as the guiding principle. I believe that it is not so evident that the country of employment principle always works in the interests of, and benefits, the frontier workers. I am of the opinion that we work to live and not the other way round. For that reason, I believe that all the money and certainties we obtain on the shop floor should be brought to bear in our living environment.

<p class="contents">I have included the above in an amendment. I would therefore ask my fellow MEPs to vote in favour of this amendment. I have also tabled two amendments to Articles 6 and 7 to have these deleted, because I believe that the Commission is not competent to take measures to intervene in bilateral agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share many of her criticisms and frustrations about the scope, implementation and speed of change to Regulation 1408/71.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Petitions, it is clear to me that there is a considerable and growing number of residents, including third-country nationals and frontier workers, for whom the current arrangements are not working satisfactorily. Enlargement will make a complex system of coordination even more complex and it is not surprising that many citizens simply do not believe that the Union takes the free movement of citizens as seriously as it takes its commitment to the free movement of goods. We have to find a way of simplifying things for citizens themselves and for the administrators of these systems. It would not be surprising if we were to hear an increasing number of calls for a single European agency that would deal directly with national administrations on the citizens’ behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for a directive concerning frontier effect reports is to be welcomed. At least these would be proactive and could hopefully deal with some of the problems before they arise, which would make a pleasant change. It is also clear that as more countries integrate their taxation and social security systems, we need to take action to tackle the resulting anomalies, which can result in double payments. However, the key issue is that Member States need to prove their commitment to free movement by tackling problems openly and in a spirit which favours residents of the European Union.</p>

As more and more Members come into the Chamber, I would like to announce a welcome innovation. We have today opened a smoking zone behind the Hemicycle, a lovely sunny place with lots of good views. I hope that all colleagues who continue to ruin their health by smoking, will find themselves comfortably installed outside the Chamber and will stop smoking in the non-smoking zones. I hope everybody has heard that.</p>
