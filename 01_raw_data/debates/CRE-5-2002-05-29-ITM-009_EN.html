<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiori (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, it is a pity that the Commissioner is not here because I wanted to start my reflection on the own-initiative report of which I am the rapporteur by saying, on the basis of today’s debate, that I am sure he will find the atmosphere in the agricultural sector much more friendly than that in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of our own-initiative report is the mid-term review laid down by the reform known as Agenda 2000: it is an analysis stage which comes after a phase in which the second major reform of Community agricultural policy was introduced; over recent years, Community agricultural policy has taken on a much stronger, much more definite connotation than that intended by the signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1999. This is because European agriculture is going through one of the most difficult, complex and sensitive periods of change in the existence of the common agricultural policy, and the difficulty currently facing agriculture – a difficulty which is quite obvious to the farmers, for whom the European effort is a major point of reference – was also mirrored in the preparatory work for the report, in the debate in committee and in the difficulty of putting together a report with a broad consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, there are two major philosophies underpinning this own-initiative report: on the one hand, there is the school of thought which asserts the need to preserve the current framework of the common agricultural policy and declares itself to be virtually opposed to any change which could alter the nature of the objectives or principles of the common agricultural policy as we know it; on the other hand, there is the school of thought which calls upon us to intervene with hefty measures, measures which would considerably alter the current legislative framework, to take into account the crisis situation in a number of sectors, to take into account eastward enlargement, under negotiation with the European Union, to take into account the WTO negotiations and, most importantly, to take into account the need, of which farmers are perfectly aware, for a direction to be found for the market and for production systems too which will guarantee an acceptable level of income in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore one of the thorny issues we need to address. The MacSharry and Agenda 2000 reforms ensured – so it is written – a reasonable and stable income for producers. It is no longer possible to monitor or verify this in many European countries. Apart from anything else, we do not yet have an analysis framework providing accurate data on changes in producers’ incomes which would allow us to carry out a review of the effects of Agenda 2000 in terms of income too.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been many exchanges of opinion and ideas, and I would like to comment on some of them for I have tabled a number of amendments on points of importance to me which have been the subject of lengthy debate. Firstly, we call for a direct aid system where the granting of direct payments is decoupled from production. This is certainly a viable method of dealing with the changes taking place in the agricultural sector, but the minimum level of income received by holdings must be taken into consideration as a parameter. We do not have this information at present and, above all, we cannot even remotely hope to make the income of holdings dependent solely on State intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are two instruments which have been on the table for a long time: modulation and degressivity. Modulation has thus far been voluntary. In the Member States in which it has been applied, it has not yielded the results that might have been expected. I realise that modulation is a system for transferring resources and funds. It is a perfectly good system. Transferral, under the present proposal to switch from a voluntary to a compulsory system, is certainly a viable working instrument, but, if it is diminished by a mechanism which does not allow review or analysis according to the formula we have identified in the own-initiative report, then I can see it causing holdings major revenue problems and requiring very close analysis. Consider, for example, a large farming country, France. Just a few days ago, the Minister for Agriculture revealed that there was a surplus of EUR 300 million in the modulation system developed and updated over the last two years, which remained in the hands of the State and was not redirected to the agricultural holdings. If we then propose to combine modulation and degressivity, applying them side by side, we will find ourselves in the situation, clear from any econometric model, where the income of holdings is falling by, in the case of a medium-sized holding of 100 hectares, almost 30%. This aspect therefore warrants a great deal of attention.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close with one last point. I have been accused of failing to include the concept of multifunctionality in my own-initiative report. Well, my task was to produce an own-initiative report firmly anchored to the first pillar. The aspects relating to changes in the development of agriculture are dealt with exhaustively in Mrs Rodríguez Ramos’ report, with which I identify, which I voted for and which I fully support.<span class="bold"> </span>However, in the context of a report, such as Mrs Rodríguez Ramos’ report, on rural development in the world, we must on no account forget that agriculture is an undertaking, it is an economy, and it needs a first pillar which allows Europe to assume a strategic position on the major international commodities, especially in the light of the decisions of the US Government relating to the Farm Bill.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rodríguez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, this is an own-initiative report on the interim review of Agenda 2000 in relation to the second pillar – rural development. We believe that rural development has to consolidate a multifunctional agricultural system across the Union, and that rural development therefore needs to be one of the European Union’s priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and second pillars are two indissociable instruments of the common agricultural policy and should, therefore, complement each other and be used for the benefit of a multifunctional agricultural system that will enable many farms to be maintained across the European Union. We think that the first and second pillars complementing each other is the only way of preventing a dual system of agriculture from being created within the European Union, with one type only looking towards the markets and depending solely on market aid while the other has its back to the agricultural markets and depends on aid that is disconnected from production.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not and would not be a good model for the first and second pillars to be like two sealed and unconnected compartments and for all the multi-functionality to be concentrated in the second pillar, on rural development. Mr Fiori, as you have just referred to my report, I have to tell you that I think that your view is wrong and ultimately inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Multifunctional agriculture must enable us to combine market management and management of rural areas and enable farms across the current and enlarged Union to exist and be viable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Agenda 2000 created the second pillar of the CAP, rural development, and we welcome that. However, we have to criticise the fact that it has a meagre budget: 10% of the total CAP budget is what we devote to rural development. We therefore ask for a greater budgetary allocation, a budgetary strengthening of this pillar, so that it can meet the challenges that it is faced with.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also been unhappy to see that the uneven application of rural development measures by the Member States does not always produce a positive result for the rural areas of the Union. This is particularly the case for those areas that are most rural, most remote and which are lagging the furthest behind, which are not finding a truly satisfactory solution to these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore propose that, without diminishing the powers of the national authorities, we should establish priorities under the second pillar of the CAP in order to move forward in defining a core of priority measures at Community level that guarantee sustainable development in the Union. We also propose that the Commission define a new typology for rural areas to enable us to set priority measures for each area and also to help us to apply different percentages of co-financing according to the various rural problems that exist in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask that, as part of the interim review of Agenda 2000, there should be compulsory and uniform modulation of aid under the first pillar. Mr Fiori said that voluntary modulation has failed. There should, therefore, be compulsory and uniform modulation of aid under the first pillar, in order to use those freed-up resources, not only for the measures that we can currently use them for, the agro-environmental sector, early retirement and reforestation, but also for all the measures established in the regulations on rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that as part of this measure and in the interim review we should strengthen the eco-conditionality of aid and establish a link between the disbursement of direct payments and the provision of services within a multifunctional system, extending eco-conditionality measures in favour of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ask for the Community support framework for rural development to be simplified through the creation, on the basis of the two EAGGF Guarantee and EAGGF Guidance sections, of a single agri-rural fund for the whole of the CAP. And on the occasion of this report in favour of multifunctional agriculture and of a different multifunctional agricultural policy, I would like to finish by asking for codecision for Parliament on agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of all, I would like to speak to Mrs Rodríguez Ramos' report. As shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE group, let me express my heartfelt gratitude for the good cooperation with Mrs Rodríguez Ramos. Agenda 2000's mid-term review is a very important stage for agriculture, as the further development of the common agricultural policy is very important specifically in a global context. The right course must be set at the right time, so I welcome both these own-initiative reports to an extraordinary degree.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the considerable attention paid by Mrs Rodríguez Ramos in her report to rural development, with all its demands, problems, opportunities and possibilities, in a favourable light. Its continued promotion within the second pillar of the CAP really is an important matter of concern to me, although such promotion must not be to the detriment of the CAP's first pillar. It is also important to emphasise the multi-functional agriculture by which jobs can be created, and which also has many other beneficial effects on rural areas as a whole, on their environment, the economy and the maintenance of the cultivated landscape. I would also like to point out that the promotion of all farming concerns, above all those belonging to young farmers, in all Europe's regions, is a matter of great concern to me as rural structures depend on the concerns' existence and on the latter's willingness to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture is to be strengthened and steered towards sustainable development in many parts of Europe, although its competitiveness must not, of course, be disregarded. I urge that care be taken to maintain guarantees of food safety. Consumer confidence and the quality of agricultural products are important principles in the agriculture of today. What is important to me is that this mid-term review should not be taken as an opportunity to generally call into question the existing rules of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, a ‘mid-term review’ means reviewing Agenda 2000 and the current rules. Necessary adjustments must of course be made in response to the results of this review, but Agenda 2000 has to be transposed, and its long-term implications have to be reviewed. Moreover, the problems of enlargement must under no circumstances be mixed up with the discussion we are having today on Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review. The European agricultural model must be secured for the future as well. If compulsory modulation of compensatory payments is to be advocated, it must also be ensured that the Member States cofinance it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to sum up by saying, by way of emphasis, that the promotion of rural development must – as already said – under no circumstances be to the detriment of the CAP's first pillar, but additional funds need to be made available for it to be extended. We Members of Europe's Parliament therefore look forward with great excitement to the Commission's proposals, in response to the mid-term review, for positive development of agriculture, forestry and rural areas, and thus for the future of farmers in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now more than ever before, all the policy’s COMs must promote or enhance the multifunctionality of our agricultural policy in order to guarantee food safety, sustainable development, rural development and territorial cohesion, in addition to animal welfare. This is what our fellow citizens now expect from Europe’s agricultural policy. This is what forms the basis of the European agricultural model, the recognition of which we must forcefully promote on the international stage. In other words, we need an agricultural industry that does not ‘produce more’ but ‘produces better’.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make ourselves clear on this issue, however. If, on the one hand, European agriculture has no future other than to respond appropriately to the expectations of European citizens, there will, on the other hand, be no genuine multifunctionality unless the policy that is implemented provides its actors with sufficient income to enable them to make a living in all the Member States. Consumers and taxpayers must shoulder their responsibilities in this area. This means that we, as politicians, must concern ourselves, with the same degree of commitment, with both the needs of modern society and with agricultural incomes. In this area, I would warn against any approach that aims to limit the CAP to receiving only public funds for multifunctionality under the consolidated rural pillar, and submitting other areas of agricultural policy to market deregulation. Furthermore, I condemn the policy of the United States which, by means of excessive public support, will help to bring down world prices and flood our markets with GMO products.</p>
<p class="contents">When all is said and done and to sum up, I personally plead for a restored CAP which, first and foremost, is based on a budget equal to its priorities, with public support that is distributed fairly amongst farmers depending on modulations. Secondly, a CAP that is based on an enhanced market management policy that promotes quality products and reduces our reliance on certain imports, such as those of vegetable protein. And thirdly, a CAP that is based on a policy relating to agricultural incomes which guarantees the continued existence of farms in all the Member States. Any change to the CAP that dismisses these three requirements would deceive both the citizens and farmers of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not have much to add when it comes to Mrs Rodríguez Ramos’ report, but I have a few comments on Mr Fiori’s.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important that we think about whether we should retain agricultural policy or develop it. We have to realise that improved communications, both physical and electronic, are making us increasingly dependent on the world around us. This makes it impossible for us in the EU to isolate ourselves and conduct a completely separate agricultural policy. We have to take into account what is going on in the world around us.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations of the World Trade Organisation are becoming increasingly important and are setting the standard for what we do. This is emphasised by the fact that the countries of central Eastern Europe will soon be included in the EU. An enlarged EU will in fact be the largest player on the global food market. Therefore, we must also take on the role of the most important player when it comes to pushing development forward. Now that the US has increased its agricultural subsidies, the EU must seek to be the driving force behind further opening up the global market, involving the developing countries in that market and thus making it work better. This would also create an opportunity for the developing countries to demonstrate, through their growth, that they are a purchasing force on the global market due to their having an enormous need for food.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe it is important that we think this through both ahead of the interim report and ahead of a new agricultural policy after 2006. Being aware that a functioning global market is much more important for the farmers of Europe may be a much greater guarantee of their obtaining a reasonable income than an increasingly fragile political support system which we no longer particularly agree that we wish to develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The financial perspectives have been respected, and what is more, expenditure has been far below what was budgeted. With regard to the price of cereals, in my opinion, the real need is for the price differential for oilseed crops to be restored in order to correct the strategic deficit of vegetable proteins. However, there should be no experiments with durum wheat or rice in order to prevent the risk of cultivation disappearing. With regard to the system of milk quotas, we should refrain from any experiments that could have disastrous consequences for mountainous areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the interim review of Agenda 2000 should under no circumstances lead to what I would call a radical reform, with budgetary restrictions, with the prospect of enlargement. However there could be reforms of certain aspects of Agenda 2000 that have shown signs of not working or of lacking in efficiency. For example, the application of modulation should be compulsory and uniform across all the Member States, and the scope for use of the funds freed up through it should be considerably extended.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to rural development, I have a few comments to make: political bargaining could be a threat to achieving objectives set for rural development. The requirement of co-financing, as it is currently designed, creates a deficit of rural development measures in the poorest regions, which are the most needy ones, and the predominant measures in some countries frequently have little to do with sustainable rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the report by Mrs Rodríguez Ramos deals with these problems very well and it will therefore receive the unreserved support of my political group. With regard to Mr Fiori’s report, it should be recognised that it has some structural problems, possibly due to the large number of amendments that he received. Mr Fiori knows that my political group, and I personally, made a considerable effort to reach a consensus on some aspects of the amendments that I had tabled, and I thought that the final result of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development reflected agreements between all the members of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I was surprised by the final amendments from Mr Fiori that will be voted on tomorrow, and I would like to say, with all due respect, that I do not share the opinion that he has just explained to us, that we need to set an economic, business-like view, which should also exist in a large proportion of agriculture, against modulation policies. I think that public policies should refer to specific objectives, such as sustainable development, job creation and social criteria, and that under no circumstances should they be incompatible with that business-like, economic view of agriculture. I have a difference of opinion with Mr Fiori on this issue and if his amendments, which remove modulation, are adopted, I will advise my political group not to vote in favour of his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet agriculture, just like other economic activities, is in dire need of clear prospects for its future development. The mid-term review of the CAP must be used as an opportunity to confirm the objectives set by Agenda 2000 and to reassure farmers that the negotiators are determined to defend our crops and to firmly establish the European agricultural model at the international talks. This task has been made all the more difficult by the Commission defying the views of the Member States in the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the CAP is to produce a wide-range of crops throughout the Union. Its two pillars must be made consistent in order to guarantee farmers a decent income, the major part of which must be based on the price of products. The common organisations of the market and their market regulatory instruments must continue to play an essential role whilst reinforcing the rural development pillar. The latter must also enable farmers to meet society’s new expectations in terms of quality, environmental protection, animal welfare and financing the additional costs that the market is not ready to assume. However, the second pillar can also become, on the one hand, a tool for innovation by encouraging, for example, varied farming activities, crop diversification such as vegetable protein, and, on the other hand, a tool of the future by encouraging the setting-up of young farmers, in particular by helping farmers return to their activity whilst enabling older farmers to leave the profession in dignified conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of rural development is not, however, to tackle all the environmental, social and territorial challenges of the countryside. This is not the role of the CAP either. Its role is to draw up land development policies which fall within the remit and are the responsibility of the Member States by virtue of subsidiarity. The agricultural budget cannot become a substitute for the insufficient financing of projects that have anything other than an agricultural vocation. There might have been the temptation to do this for projects with purely environmental objectives such as the LIFE programmes, to take just one example.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, enlargement is a further challenge for our farmers. We must ensure that they do not bring into question the already fragile circumstances in both Member States and candidate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every one of us has his own personal preferences when it comes to this important topic, as both the discussions in the Agriculture Committee and the number of amendments submitted bear witness. Both rapporteurs deserve a great deal of gratitude for having made very serious attempts at incorporating in their reports, as much as possible, the well-founded concerns of Members of this House. As a basis for the balance sheet, the mid-term review must be an option for the future; in other words, Agenda 2000 must be a valid and binding framework up to 2006. It is on this basis that the common agricultural policy must be developed further.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that the situation in a globalised world market means that all tendencies towards regionalisation have to be rejected. Our common agricultural policy has to be planned on a long-term basis and capable of being worked out by anyone, which means that we must not lose sight of the objective of using streamlining as a means of dismantling bureaucracy. The production types society desires are, above all, to be achieved more by incentives and not so much by commands and prohibitions. One major question is that of how we care for rural areas and keep them alive.</p>
<p class="contents">The efficient promotion of young farmers is indispensable in this. We also want the second pillar to be strengthened, but what, in the area of agriculture, is meant by this? The objective must be to make clear that environmentally friendly services and maintenance of the countryside do not ‘cost nothing’, but maintain an accountable market value. Reliability and competitiveness for the farmers and hence greater freedom for their business operations when their performance is considered as a whole is the first objective. First-rate product quality, no matter what the production type, and the required income from it, is the second.</p>
<p class="contents">Monitored safety right along the production chain, Commissioner, is our third objective in further development of the common agricultural policy, and it is an indispensable one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of having a model based exclusively on production, we must instead redefine a multifunctional agricultural policy which provides social balance and job stability, land management and respect for the environment. I believe that this political choice is, without doubt, the right choice. However, it also brings a challenge with it, that is, to reform the European common agricultural policy so as to adapt it to the requirements of the twenty-first century in order to guarantee a future for the European agricultural model in an increasingly globalised economy. This is an ambitious project but one that is crucial. We must allocate the resources to achieve this ambition by gradually re-allocating a significant part of the Community budget of the ‘market’ pillar to the ‘rural development’ pillar, whilst encouraging all types of agricultural businesses, and particularly the most fragile. This is because Europe must not sacrifice the crops that it does not consider sufficiently profitable on the altar of outright profit.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am also speaking to you on behalf of the producers of the outermost regions, who sometimes feel abandoned when faced with the breaking up of many COMs imposed by the WTO under pressure from the Americans. The sugar cane/sugar/rum industry provides almost 40 000 jobs in the French overseas departments; the banana industry provides 65 000 jobs in the West Indies and the Canaries. It is important not only for the survival of these regions, but also for the defence of the European agricultural model. If we cease to support these crops, we shall be leaving the way open to Latin American multinationals, which consider the respect of social and environmental standards, or even human dignity itself, to be of secondary importance. And we will be turning our back on the agricultural industry that we wish to build, an industry that is committed to environmental preservation, consumer protection and an industry that is concerned with the economic, social and also territorial cohesion of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am especially pleased with the principles written in the report by Mrs Rodrígues Ramos, according to which, in the future it must also be possible to carry out agriculture in all the existing and future areas of the EU. I hope that the Commission notes the message contained in the report that factors associated with different climates and growing conditions should be better taken into account in EU agricultural policy in the future than is the case today.</p>
<p class="contents">The most overwhelmingly important issue in the reports, modulation, is linked to the matter mentioned above. Everyone talks about it but it has not yet been decided how it can be realised. Nor is everyone enthusiastic about it. In the ELDR Group we have started out from the view that modulation is required. It is true that in existing EU policy, too much money is distributed to large farms and even also to the most productive areas in the European Union without the EU guiding the use of this funding to promote structural or sustainable development. Therefore, modulation should also be a way for funding to be reallocated for use by the EU as a whole for the sake of food quality and safety.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main issue is to maintain payments under the common market organisation, with quantity regulation needing to be achieved, as planned, by means of financial compensation. This long-term approach has been one of the main pillars of the success of the common agricultural policy and it should not be underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly appropriate to increase competitivity at national level by means of cooperation models for developing rural areas as an economic factor in professional farming. This presupposes high-quality production and a high degree of ecologically sound farming. The main substance of both reports is that the multifunctionality of the European agricultural model needs to be secured in the long term. Moving away from this model would mean standing still with regard to an approach that our citizens in the regions have only just begun to adopt. What is lacking is a broad social debate about whether the risks of multifunctionality can be accepted. I think they can.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to say that I am against any economies of scale. This is not something that the European agricultural model has called for up to now, and that is a testament to the common agricultural policy's scope for development and general possibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the Dutch Government failed to come up with the goods. It expressed its view of the countryside by purchasing areas of outstanding natural beauty. An outmoded view. By buying up farmers, the countryside disappears and is replaced by an artificial park landscape. This is why I have tabled an amendment which should prevent this improper use of rural subsidies in future. </p>
<p class="contents">Rapporteurs Mrs Rodríguez Ramos and Mr Fiori consider depopulation as one of the key problems facing the countryside, and consequently base their vision of rural policy on this premise. They are basing their assumptions too much on the problems in their own Member States in this matter. For example, depopulation is not a problem for the countryside in my region. The Dutch countryside is, however, threatened by urbanisation and being turned into wasteland. If the farmer can no longer acquire sufficient income from agriculture, he will look for all kinds of secondary activities. Some of these activities affect the landscape, and it is also sad to see barns only being used as garages for caravans. The European rural policy should consider these problems too. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fiori is doing this Parliament a disservice. After the report on human genetics, this is his second report in the space of one year. We would have liked to have sent a signal to the Commission by the mid-term review as to how we view the common agricultural policy. Instead of looking for a common denominator, the rapporteur based his report on the Italian agricultural model, something which positively underwhelms the other Member States and this Parliament. The report has become a paradoxical document which gives neither this Parliament nor the Commission, and certainly not the Council, anything to go on.

The interim review is, therefore, key.</p>
<p class="contents">The common agricultural policy is currently undergoing a major change, due to the challenges that the European Union has to face, particularly with enlargement to the East and the negotiations with the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is preparing to undertake a review of the CAP in 2003, which could be the prelude to a more in-depth reform planned for 2006. One of the key elements in this debate is the modulation of aid from the market policy in order to transfer funds to the second pillar, to rural development, where we have been left short; in this way we will achieve a policy that many think will be more consistent with the agreements obtained at the WTO, as well as easing the path to accession.</p>

We all want farmers to contribute to the sustainable maintenance of rural areas, but those areas cannot live without farmers, and what is more, if we try to achieve the final objective at any cost, we run the risk of using the wrong methods, because although we all want greater rural development, this cannot take place if it endangers the profitability of farming. Any change made by the European Union to direct income aid must be done without damaging the income of farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we accept the modulation of CAP aid, that modulation must take place according to parameters that do not put paid to the competitiveness of farms and that take into account the economic inequalities of the European Union. We must therefore be extremely careful when passing on this message to society. That careful attitude is, I think, what inspired the European Commission to decide to postpone the presentation of its proposal to revise the CAP for 2003 to 10 July, once the United States has passed its new farming law. This new law represents a u-turn in United States policy by reintroducing a clear support for prices, which could place Community producers at a clear disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot give in to the whims of any country when the future of its farmers is a stake. I would like the European Commission to present its proposals to the European Parliament and very carefully weigh up the impact that the Farm Bill is going to have. We should demand a report from the Community executive on that impact in order to be clear about this. If we have to opt for modulation, it should be approached with care, taking a careful line that will not lead us to a point of no return for our farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coresponsibility levies were increased during the recent review, while quotas were kept well below requirements and actual production, with the result that prices and farmers' incomes have collapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">Intervention prices and minimum prices have been slashed or abolished, leaving small and medium-sized farms prey to speculation by unaccountable industrial traders. Decisions have been taken, such as to abolish tobacco subsidies, which will devastate huge areas in the Mediterranean countries, already among the poorest in the European Union. Τhe entire production and food chain is being adulterated for the benefit of the huge food companies, resulting in well-publicised food scares, and not one proposal of any substance has been made to restructure plant production or deal efficiently with phenomena such as BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">This appalling situation will only be turned round if the principles and guidelines of Agenda 2000 are revised during the mid-term review of the CAP. The odd minor improvement is a mere distraction, concealing what is a very ugly situation for small and medium-sized farmers, who are inevitably ousted from their land, which is then concentrated in the hands of a few capitalist-type companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I first became a Member of this Parliament, the Union was a lot smaller than it is today. There were 9 countries with 20 million farmers. Today the Union is much enlarged and there are only 6 million farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have not succeeded in our original aim of maintaining the population in rural areas. Nevertheless, the people of the European Union have not seen the common agricultural policy as a great failure. They recognise that it has given us security of food supply. They recognise that the quality of that food has improved over the years and, in spite of the fact that, from time to time we have scares and always will, the consumers of the European Union are relatively happy that we have given them a safe product.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that while we spend, relatively modestly, something like 0.4% of the GDP of the Union on this policy, the farmers, for example in Denmark and the United Kingdom get an average of about EUR 19 000 per capita, but if you go down to the bottom of the list, the half a million small farmers of Portugal get EUR 1 500. So it is not a socially just policy. Ireland is somewhere in between at EUR 11 000 per capita. We have not succeeded in establishing a socially just situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, and in addition to having done what I said, we have also saved many rural areas; many habitations in towns, villages and communities have been saved by the policy. We must re-design it in a way that will make it more socially just. We must not forget that the business of agriculture is about producing food in the first place and we must ensure that food is safe.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things worry the farmers of Europe at the moment: the excessive paperwork they are required to do and the restrictions that are being imposed on them. Food is being imported from other areas like, for example tinned food, chicken and other things, for which they cannot guarantee the safety and they are not happy about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing is that we cannot see the future because we cannot get an agreement with the Americans. We have to establish a system by which traceability of food, wherever it comes from, will be assured and we have to reach an understanding with our competitors in the world markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to very sincerely thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Fiori and Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, for their work, and I would also like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, under the chairmanship of Mr Daul, for its extensive contributions to the debate on the mid-term review. As I see it, both reports fundamentally address what the shape of the common agricultural policy we want for the twenty-first century should be. Trying to answer this question has stimulated a wide-ranging discussion of new ideas. And new ideas are exactly what we need!</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a debate of this kind needs to build on two principles. Any future common agricultural policy needs to be sustainable across the board – economically, socially and also environmentally. Furthermore, it must match what society wants and address the challenges of the moment. But just what does society expect? The answer is not necessarily as clear and straightforward as we might instinctively imagine. Agricultural policy needs to take account of various aspects. The citizens of the European Union know very well that agriculture does not just produce food these days. They therefore expect it to fulfil a variety of roles. It is therefore up to us to support all those functions.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the interests of society, we should not forget that farmers are also part of our society, so that their needs also have to be taken into consideration if we are to ensure that our agriculture is socially sustainable. We need to look at society's expectations as a whole and at the same time to consider the concerns of rural communities. I have always said that reform of the CAP is a continuing process. We began that process back in 1992, ten years ago, and we now have an opportunity to carry it forward with the mid-term review. This mid-term review will also give us a chance to establish what adjustments we should make to instruments under the CAP in order to meet society's expectations more effectively. I say that because if things are going wrong in a given sector, we need to act now. We cannot wait until 2006, even if the Berlin Summit did not stipulate any specific review remit. I am pleased that the Fiori report specifically recognises this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also intend to take account of the possible impact of the US Farm Bill in our analysis, and also of the work due to be published by the US Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute, the FAPRI, probably at the beginning of June. The draft of our mid-term review will then be presented on 10 July. That will above all make it possible for us to take on board the comments you have made in your reports and in this House today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fiori report contains a great many specific ideas, but because of the divergence of interests in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I assume in this House in general, they are not always totally consistent. For example, on the one hand the report calls for a system of direct aid not linked to production, but on the other hand it calls for production-related aid to be increased in various areas. Of course, all these points need to be discussed in detail. However, you should not forget that careful preparatory work is also needed for those sectors for which no review was agreed upon in Berlin, such as sugar, fruit, vegetables, olive oil and so on. Only then will the Commission be in a position to make any proposals. So we will not be in a position to present a second package until next year.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to rice, however, I do not think that we should wait for the impact of the Everything But Arms initiative to be felt in full. I think that we should be considering now how to react to the challenges associated with that initiative. I am pleased to see that although the Fiori Report deals primarily with markets, that is to say the first pillar of the CAP, it recognises that rural development should be given a higher profile. I therefore consider the references to eco-conditionality very interesting. Although the US Farm Bill has now been adopted, we should keep up our efforts to make our common agricultural policy more viable for the future. I say that not only because the new Farm Bill is very much a case of do as I say, not do as I do. This policy belies all the United States' talk over the years about a trade-oriented agenda. That is unacceptable and you can be sure that I will continue to criticise this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am also just as convinced that we in the European Union should not make the same mistake and back-pedal on the common agricultural policy. Just the opposite, in fact. We should continue along the present path of reinforcing the multifunctional aspects of our agricultural policy. This will particularly help us in the WTO context, where the Americans' behaviour has been sharply criticised by most of their WTO partners.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to Mrs Rodríguez Ramos' report. The motion for a resolution generally takes the same line as the Commission on the future direction and role of rural development policy. In particular, I believe that the further transfer of funds from the first pillar to the second pillar gives an important signal. If we transfer some 10% of agricultural expenditure from the EAGGF to the second pillar we will not be able to achieve the much-vaunted objectives adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Gothenburg Summit in July last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the common agricultural policy is expected to contribute to sustainable development. It is to attach greater weight to promoting more healthy and high-quality products, environmentally friendly production methods, renewable primary products and the protection of biodiversity. That is why I also support the statement in the Ramos report that the first and second pillar of the common agricultural policy were conceived as a coherent whole and must complement each other.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the budgetary implications of Agenda 2000? As has been confirmed today, we have used EUR 2 billion less every year than was originally envisaged. We are therefore using taxpayers' money very responsibly, and that is why, with an eye to enlargement, we have suggested that direct payments should be made over a period of 10 years, so that on the one hand the fifteen Member States are not overstretched in budget terms and on the other hand so as not to obstruct the restructuring process in the candidate countries. However, it is also evident from this that the agriculture budget, as the budget of the only fully communitarised policy at EU level, should not be exploited to finance other policies, especially if we are expecting the agricultural sector simultaneously to perform services that it can never afford to provide on the basis of market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by addressing a further point that goes beyond the mid-term review but which is nevertheless important for the future, and which is therefore something that we need to bear in mind when we are considering how to develop the common agricultural policy in future. As far as I am concerned, just like the new Farm Bill, this issue is not sufficiently covered in the two reports. No matter how willing I was to support the Everything But Arms initiative to support the world's poorest countries, because it helped us a great deal in Doha and will continue to help us, I nevertheless feel that I need to urge some caution about the idea of extending these principles to all developing countries. I do not want to cover all the issues that have occurred to me during this debate; I would like to restrict myself to just two.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union is to open up its agricultural markets to developing countries without any restrictions, then mechanisms need to be found beforehand to prevent multinationals persuading farmers in developing countries to abandon their traditional land management methods for large-scale monoculture of products suitable for export. Because that would achieve exactly the opposite of what Parliament has demanded on many other occasions. If, in addition, genetically modified plants are cultivated in developing countries, for example for fighting disease and improving food provision, the EU cannot at the same time refuse imports solely on the grounds that they contain GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring food safety and food quality are issues of vital importance for the acceptance of the common agricultural policy. These issues therefore need to be gone into in greater depth if we want to address our consumers' justified concerns. I would like to emphasise that point too in the mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs once more for the enormous effort they have devoted to bringing together and coordinating widely varying views and interests in a convincing way.</p>
