It is in fact the continuation of a process that began when the European Council decided to extend the European Union’s common strategy for this region, a region to which a number of Member States to some extent also belong. We have therefore demonstrated the EU’s substantial interest in and firm commitment to this region.</p>
<p class="contents">This extension will allow the European Union’s relations with the Mediterranean region to be examined in the light of the European Council’s assessment of the strategic partnership for the Mediterranean and the Middle East in June 2005, of the Barcelona Process in the context of its tenth anniversary in 2005 and of the development of European neighbourhood policy over the same period. This commitment was reiterated at the recent Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting in The Hague on 29 and 30 November 2004, which confirmed the centrality of the Barcelona Process, backed up by the European neighbourhood policy for the Mediterranean. It is a process whereby the European Union and the Mediterranean partners work together towards political, economic and social reform objectives involving the societies concerned. Those same objectives are also taken up in the European Union’s strategic partnership for the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. More than ever, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is an essential and special regional framework for dialogue and cooperation between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The meeting in The Hague was the second ministerial meeting following the meeting held in Naples and preceding the one to be held in Luxembourg on 30 and 31 May 2005. In this context, preparations have already begun for the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, which will be marked in Barcelona in November 2005. Ministers have also agreed to undertake an overall review of the process and declare 2005 the year of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the European Union’s political and security dialogue with its Mediterranean partners is concerned, the Hague ministerial meeting confirmed the progress that has been made with cooperation in counter-terrorism, regional security and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as European security and defence policy. Partnership measures like the holding of a diplomatic seminar in Malta, cooperation in the field of civil defence and disaster management, or the Euro-Mediterranean Study Commission or EuroMeSCo network of foreign policy institutes, are making a substantial contribution to bringing the Euro-Mediterranean partners closer together. These efforts are also aimed at the implementation of political reforms and cooperation on human rights and democratisation, and are based on civil society through commitments entered into either by way of association agreements or, where necessary, as part of European neighbourhood policy. In this connection, the action plans agreed with a number of partners give a central place to human rights, democratisation, good governance and strengthening the rule of law. In like vein, the creation of the Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue of Cultures is a key step in the implementation of the Barcelona Process’s social, cultural and human partnership. All members of the partnership must take advantage of its inauguration to increase the visibility of the Barcelona Process on both sides of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe this is an historic moment, especially as far as the Middle East conflict is concerned. I believe the Barcelona Process should both accompany the relaunching of the peace process and also benefit from its relaunch, and I believe Europe’s future is also the future of the Mediterranean region, the future of its development, the future of cultural exchange and the future of cooperation with those who are very close to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrero-Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to participate in this debate on EU-Mediterranean relations. The European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the Barcelona Process. I wish to express my gratitude, especially to many individual Members who are enthusiastic supporters of Euromed relations, for your role as a driving force behind the Union's active involvement in this region. I have had a great personal interest in this region ever since I became aware of how crucial the peace process is for the Middle East. As my colleague has just said, there is a real moment of hope, although we know that the process is a fragile one. I visited the region the day before Sharm el-Sheikh. I had the chance to see the leaders who have taken really courageous steps. I told them that we have to go on and that both sides have to consolidate this new path to peace in the Middle East, especially by seizing the opportunities of, on the one hand, the platform – the Quartet – and, on the other hand, the roadmap. A successful disengagement in Gaza is a priority for all of us. Two days ago, the Israeli Government took a very courageous decision when Prime Minister Sharon and his cabinet decided to do that. We know that this is a risky process, but we must do everything possible to make this happen.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Mediterranean partnership, the tenth anniversary of which we will celebrate this year, the European neighbourhood policy, under which we have already adopted five action plans for the southern Mediterranean countries, is also <span class="italic">very</span> important. The European neighbourhood policy means emphasising our common bonds through geography, history, trade, migration and culture by bringing these countries, as a ring of friends, closer to the European Union. The neighbourhood policy does not replace the Barcelona Process, but is there to reinforce it by means of a tailor-made bilateral process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a brief word now on Lebanon. We are all shocked and saddened by the assassination ten days ago of former Prime Minister Hariri. Mr Hariri was one of the main architects of the agreements that brought the long-awaited end to the civil war in Lebanon. He was a man committed to peace and reconciliation, to the reconstruction of the war-torn country and also to the promotion of cooperation and stability in the region. The best tribute to his relentless efforts would be to ensure that free and fair parliamentary elections, under full Lebanese sovereign control, take place in May.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is in the interests of Lebanon and of the stability of the country that the circumstances of this criminal act, and the identities of those responsible for it, are clarified as soon as possible. I spoke out at a very early stage in favour an international investigation, which I believe the United Nations will now carry out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also attached the utmost importance to a full and prompt implementation by all parties of UN Security Council Resolution 1559. This resolution calls for free and fair elections without foreign interference, the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the disbanding and disarmament of all militias and the extension of government control to all Lebanese territories.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have already mentioned, 2005 will be <span class="italic">the </span>year of EU-Mediterranean relations. Since there are signs that the cycle of violence between the two sides can be broken, we have to do everything we can to consolidate the ceasefire and secure withdrawal from Gaza, and then move forward with the roadmap for a two-state solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In March, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will meet for the second time in Cairo. I regret that I will be unable to attend. However, three weeks ago I met the members of the political bureau of that Assembly in Brussels, where I also attended a debate. At the end of May, Euro-Mediterranean ministers will meet in Luxembourg for the seventh Barcelona Conference. In November, we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the partnership, and the Commission is already in the process of preparing a communication to the European Parliament and the Council to mark the occasion, containing specific proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall outline those proposals very briefly. The first is to increase the impact of our policies by contributing to the pursuit of reform, peace and stability in the region. The second is to bring the partnership closer to our citizens' concerns. The Barcelona Process has, to a large extent, been an intergovernmental process. It is high time that we asked ourselves what the partnership can do for people's concerns. How can we tackle more successfully such issues as education, employment, gender equality, democracy, the free movement of persons, and migration rights? These are the questions that affect the day-to-day life of our citizens, and our partnership should address them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give you some thoughts on the priorities for the years ahead. We should reflect on how we can best make use of the Barcelona Process to contribute to this new momentum in the Middle East peace process, as well as to safeguard peace once we have it. We should also address political reform with our partners – Members will be aware of the G8 initiative. I was at the Rabat forum – Members will be aware that Cairo will now be postponed to a later date. I want to go there because I believe we can do a lot to achieve the same goals in complementary and parallel ways.</p>
<p class="contents">We should address the practical aspects of counter-terrorism and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The European Union has an impressive record in democracy building, including in the new Member States. I think we should use this experience to build democracies and support these countries' reforms: what we Europeans have to do is to try to encourage reforms, not impose them.</p>
<p class="contents">Education is one of the most fundamental issues for the future of the region. Therefore, the European Union and our partners should increase spending on education, and I will do what I can with my own services to foster more education projects, at elementary level, at the level of vocational training or at higher, university and university exchange levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We should set a target date for eradicating illiteracy and focus on the critical issue of improving the quality of, and access to, education, especially for girls. Together we could organise schemes for student exchanges: I think this is crucial, if we consider what Europe and the United States have done since the war and how important that has been.</p>
<p class="contents">We should promote the study of European integration. In trade and economic relations, we should reconfirm the 2010 target for free trade; agree a roadmap with a timetable for free trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products; decide on a timetable for the liberalisation of services; accelerate south-south free trade – the Agadir process was very important; use the neighbourhood policy to help partners to eliminate obstacles to investment; and hold a meeting of transport ministers to extend transport corridors to the Mediterranean with the financial support of the EIB.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of migration and social integration, we should promote a joint cooperative approach to managing the movement of people. We should also implement European neighbourhood action plans and commitments on the social integration of migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The broader Middle East and North African initiative is a very interesting one. The Commission will certainly be very much involved in it, in a complementary but parallel way, and I hope that together we can achieve important goals, in terms not only of democracy, reform and the modernisation of these countries, but also of a real common partnership.</p>

With all our neighbours, we want to pursue a policy of dialogue, partnership and, if possible, friendship.</p>
<p class="contents">Our parliamentary group – like the House as a whole – actively supported the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the best tribute that we can pay to our late fellow-MEP Mr Renzo Imbeni is to make this Assembly a genuinely effective and forward-looking parliamentary body. With our support, and together with our colleague Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos, it was Renzo Imbeni who created this Parliamentary Assembly. Let us honour him by doing good work there.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to work towards joint solutions with our partners in the Mediterranean region, your personal commitment to which, Commissioner, I regard as very commendable. I myself would have welcomed a Commission decision to appoint a Commissioner responsible solely for the Mediterranean region, but I have no doubt that your tremendous involvement will amount to virtually the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task, then, is to discuss the future of the Mediterranean region with our partners, and, to the Arab and Islamic world, we say this: we want partnership rather than a clash of civilizations, and our relations with the Arab and Islamic world are among our key policy priorities. This includes achieving peace between Israel and Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">To President Bush, who is visiting Europe from the United States, we say this: let us make a joint effort to ensure that Israel can exist within secure borders and Palestine can exist within secure borders. After all, both countries – if I may call Palestine a country – are represented in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and we must use our opportunities there to bring peace to this region.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge Syria – with which we are about to conclude an Association Agreement – to renounce all activities that encourage terrorism, and to give Lebanon a genuine chance. Its former Prime Minister, Rafiq Hariri, has been assassinated along with his bodyguards, and we must find out who is responsible. We urge Syria to make its contribution to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final comment: we want partnership, we want economic contacts, we want political contacts, and we want guaranteed human rights across the Mediterranean region. This too is a significant contribution to dialogue, partnership and peace in the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Precisely for this reason, we hope that the Union will have a more important political role in this area. The Mediterranean is now our priority, because that is where the greatest challenges lie regarding peace, security, the fight against terrorism, development, respect for rights, protection of the environment and positive management of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The neighbourhood policy must strengthen the spirit of Barcelona, in line with the partnership method which we could today steer in the direction of codevelopment. Ten years on from the Barcelona Intergovernmental Conference in 1995, although the results have essentially not lived up to the expectations created by this process, we must, in any case, acknowledge the progress made with regard to mutual relations and the improved application of the MEDA programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We are encouraged, then, by the resumption of dialogue between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority following the presidential elections in Palestine. At the same time, we are aware of the complexity of the whole Middle Eastern situation and we are concerned by the situation in Lebanon, following the bomb attack which caused the death of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. Moreover, we would urge Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and, in the same vein, we hope that Israel will pull out of the Golan Heights. This all means that the time may have come to resolve the whole Middle Eastern conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we appreciate the role played by Egypt, but at the same time we are troubled by the internal situation of that country where, precisely in the past few days, Mr Ayman Nour, a member of the Egyptian Parliament, was arrested and detained.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we are calling for a more incisive and coherent role for the European Union in the field of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in the whole region. The neighbourhood policy should have more appropriate instruments and institutions. We would therefore invite the Commission and the Council to take greater account of the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, a fundamental democratic instrument which should be supported and strengthened, and which was established through the efforts of men like Mr Renzo Imbeni. The Assembly is taking its first steps: it is the first time that it is meeting outside Europe, in Cairo, and we hope that it can hold an extraordinary meeting, presided by you, President Borrell Fontelles, precisely on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So far as the new prospects opened up between Israel and Palestine are concerned, I want to repeat what I have already said many times in this House. If, as we all hope, a peace agreement is reached, the experience gained from decades of conflict resolution in such situations shows that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to do without the services of peacekeeping troops if the incidents that inevitably happen under such conditions, because local warlords are incapable of accepting peace, are not to degenerate into conflagration. I think a European force would be more likely than any other to be accepted by both sides for such a task. My question to the Council, Mr President-in-Office, is therefore: is it not time we prepared ourselves for that?</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the situation in Lebanon, as you have all reiterated, we and the international community have repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territory. Has the time not come, Commissioner, for us to call on Syria finally to heed these calls before the association agreement on which negotiations have now been concluded is signed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My colleagues have referred to the despicable and abhorrent assassination of Rafiq Hariri, following which a question mark now hangs over that part of the world, just when a glimmer of light was appearing in the Middle East that we want to foster and see grow.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to go beyond the wishes we have been reiterating for 10 years and think about how we can really achieve some progress on the main issues regarding democracy and human rights in that part of the world, because it is those fundamental issues that underpin the fight against terrorism, the issues of peace and stability and development. As the Arab Bureau never tires of saying in its different United Nations development reports, it is on this fundamental issue of democratic foundations, of individual and collective freedoms in that part of the world that we need to work.</p>
<p class="contents">We have several ways forward. The Commission also has several ways forward, which it has set out in a communication in the form of 10 extremely precise recommendations. I believe that appropriate tools, the national action plans, the creation of the human rights subcommittees as part of this process, that is to say the new neighbourhood policy, are really needed to help us to implement those 10 recommendations, which as you said, Commissioner, go beyond the purely intergovernmental approach in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what the strength, the potential power of this Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and also of the Euromed civil society platform is all about, because we are all aware that our ambitious aims of democracy and development in that region can only come about with the deep commitment of those societies themselves.</p>

<p class="contents">The first of those areas is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We are all aware that the cease-fire that has been declared is very important for Palestine to be able to conclude its democratic election process. A cease-fire is not the same thing as peace, however, and Israel continues to take prisoners while it releases prisoners. Israel continues to redesign the West Bank wall while it prepares to abandon Gaza. The truth is that it is planning to turn Palestine into a Bantustan. Europe has everything to gain from being clear on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">You also spoke very generically, Commissioner, about the second aspect, immigration. Historically, the Mediterranean has been a sea of communication, a bridge between people and a thoroughfare for trade and cultures. We Europeans, however, have turned it into a modern-day moat, in which, over the past ten years, 4 000 men and women have drowned their hopes. Our duty, Commissioner, is not to turn the countries of the south into the policemen of those seeking better living conditions, but to replace the current immigration policy with one that seeks to strike a balance in migratory flows in both directions. This is the only way in which we will have the moral authority to address the issue of human rights without hypocrisy. This is the only way in which we will be able to condemn, for example, the appalling conditions suffered by the thousands of Sudanese treated as slaves in Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona Process will either be a large-scale Euro-Mediterranean pact, whereby peace, democracy and human rights are exchanged by means of economic and social integration, or will be nothing more than a letter of intent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the Lebanese would not either, but reality is different. Years of Syrian military presence on their own territory is smarting ever more, and the cowardly assassination of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hariri, is now turning a remorseless spotlight onto this international grief about a lack of Lebanese sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">How could the European Union, given this situation, ever conclude an association agreement with Beirut? And how can the Council and the Commission now present Parliament with a similar agreement with occupier Damascus, as if Resolution 1559 of the UN Security Council which demands Syria to pull out, did not mean anything to Brussels? I drew some strength, though, from the Commissioner’s attention to observing this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, that self-same Resolution 1559 stipulates the disbanding of the Lebanese Shiite terrorist organisation Hezbollah, which, armed to the teeth and trained by its patrons Syria and Iran, operates from the south of the country against Israel. This is nevertheless time for the Council and the Commission to take action in respect of Damascus and Teheran. Such European political decisiveness also promotes the new opportunities for the Israeli-Palestinian settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that recent statements by the present Palestinian leadership leave the European Union no other choice. Those statements are unambiguous. Hezbollah is not interested in Palestinian negotiations with Israel and puts up no less than USD 100 000 for Palestinian suicide attacks. Palestinian circles therefore, do not rule out terror from Hezbollah against its own negotiators.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Council to be resolute and finally place Hezbollah on the European list of terrorist organisations. Only then will the Member States be credible in respect of the United States and, certainly not unimportantly, just as much in respect of the non-Member States across the entire Mediterranean.

This is a bitter pill to swallow, but we have to face the facts pragmatically and without hypocrisy. The social, economic, cultural and human partnership between the two sides of the Mediterranean is proceeding on a foundation of uncertainty and contradictions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona Process has moved forward slowly, in particular with regard to the implementation of the MEDA programme, whose pace has quickened only in recent years. The European Union has been incapable of playing a significant, decisive role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The outrageous trafficking in illegal immigrants between the two sides of the Mediterranean is a continuing sign of the failure of the cooperation policy that was hoped for between the countries of departure and the countries of arrival.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to remain optimistic, however, and we welcome the positive signals coming from that area. The changed behaviour of the Libyan Government towards international terrorism, the recent breakthrough in relations between Israel and Palestine and the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly all give us reason to hope. The European Union needs, at last, to take on a more powerful political role in order to bring about a genuine climate of cooperation, growth and peace in the area. Otherwise, this tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Conference, this 2005 dedicated to the Mediterranean, is likely to be seen just as a year marked by our weakness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must be involved in transforming the Mediterranean region into an area of peace and cooperation. You will understand, therefore, that, although I agree with the statements made by Mr Schmit and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I believe they are short on ambition and political determination.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that we are stuck in a rut. Forward progress is being made, but the will to press for more and better progress, and for what is actually required right now is lacking. There have been many references to an alliance of civilisations, and the Euro-Mediterranean relationship is the best possible example of such an alliance. Unilateralism has no part to play in it.</p>
<p class="contents">A shared model of values and objectives is called for. This must include democracy and full respect for human rights, security, negotiated solutions to all the conflicts in the region, on both shores of the Mediterranean, and the fight against terrorism. It must, of course, also encompass disarmament, aid for sustainable development, respect for the environment and forward-looking management of migratory flows.</p>
<p class="contents">The Prime Minister of Spain made all this very clear yesterday at the meeting in Brussels, when he explained how the Union conceives the Euro-Mediterranean process.</p>
<p class="contents">It so happens that 2005 has been declared the Year of the Mediterranean. This must not be an excuse for yet another calendar full of pretty pictures. There are more than enough of those around already. In addition, the Association Agreements have proved to be effective instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">A parliamentary process is under way too, in the shape of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly due to meet in Cairo in the near future. There are other goals to be met also, such as the free exchange area that should be in place by 2010, with a new social dimension. This is all to take place in the context of a new neighbourhood policy, with five new Action Plans and even the launch of South-South cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the verdict on the Euro-Mediterranean process has to be positive. Obviously, there are shortcomings, but we Europeans are sometimes inclined to indulge in too much self-criticism. There are bound to be shortcomings, but we are building on everything that has been achieved over the last ten years. A dose of ambition is now called for, and we need to make more of the successes.</p>
<p class="contents">A Euro-Mediterranean Summit will be held in November. This will be an occasion for a political commemoration of the Barcelona Process through the launch of new measures. It seems most appropriate that an Extraordinary Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is also to be held in November, bringing a political dimension to the aforementioned celebration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can lead to tangible results helping the citizens regain hope for their future whilst respecting them as what they are. Such a future must be characterised by stability and gradual economic growth and also by full respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on two particular issues in the agenda, because I feel they are particularly important to the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is absolutely crucial to engage civil society in this process, ensuring that the citizens, their organisations and associations understand that their future lies in their own hands, not in the hands of top politicians. Secondly, trade needs to be given a real boost. It must be effectively promoted and a genuine free exchange and free trade area set up. I refer to South-South free trade amongst themselves. Too many of their borders are still closed. Of course, there must also be a South-North free trade area in which we are involved. This will be achieved by setting up a genuine free trade area between the European Union and the Mediterranean area. I believe these two issues are of vital importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a few years ago, this region was largely at a standstill as far as democracy-building and human rights were concerned. We are pleased that Turkey, for example, has signalled its intention of playing a more prominent role in the dialogue with the Arab world, notably on the issue of women's rights and democratisation. This shows that the European Union's policy of gradually bringing Turkey closer to Europe is the right one. Furthermore, despite all the problems, the emergence of a younger generation of leaders – in Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain and indeed Syria, for example – has created the opportunity for a cautious opening towards democracy. We expressly welcome the release of political prisoners and the increased scope for political opposition. The issue of women's rights in Morocco and the debate about the introduction of a divorce law in Jordan are just two examples that I would like to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with the Middle East conflict. A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will help to ensure that hopefully, the spurious excuse that this conflict makes democracy impossible can no longer be used in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not managed to achieve everything and must relaunch the whole process more effectively. This year, 2005, could be our opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we wanted an area of lasting peace, and these ten years have unfortunately been more difficult than the previous ones in terms of relations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, whose conflict has in some ways affected the stability of the Euro-Mediterranean area. Today, however, tangible facts appear to show that it is possible to overcome misunderstandings and tensions and resolve the ten-year-long conflict in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must mention a positive accomplishment: the launch of the Anna Lindh Foundation, based in Alexandria in Egypt. We expect it to play a major part in boosting cultural exchanges between all countries in the Euro-Mediterranean area, and in the growth of a dynamic civil society which is as pluralist as possible in those countries which are still lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could and should consider links between the Foundation and other more minor Euro-Mediterranean satellite cultural centres located throughout the area, which can equally spread the same messages of friendship, mutual understanding and peace among the peoples of the Euro-Mediterranean region, and which serve as cultural, research and training centres, including for the many immigrants in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we wish to obtain the necessary impetus from the ups and downs of these first ten years in order to look ahead with renewed confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A clear example for me is the illegal/irregular immigration tragedy that exists in an alarming way in the Mediterranean. I believe that the European Union could have treated this phenomenon with more energy and urgency. This is not a situation that pertains to this region alone and therefore the 'burden-sharing' principle, not the 'burden-shifting' principle, should be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an international issue and it requires an international solution, possibly joint initiatives between the United Nations and the European Union. While I appreciate that recently there was more commitment from the Council and the Commission, I hope that the necessary funds will be available so that these intentions can be translated into effective results. Without any doubt, the Barcelona process was fundamental so that the Euro-Mediterranean policy is given the due importance. However, it may be the case that, as happened with the Lisbon agenda, the time is ripe for this process to be reviewed so that, in the first place, we gauge how successful we were in achieving our aims successfully, as in the case of the creation of a free industrial trade area in the Mediterranean. In my opinion, we should revive this process, if need be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the Middle East programme as a whole, we know that stable development – through better economic and social conditions and through democracy-building – is very important. However, we also know that this will only work in the long term if the Middle East is able to solve its own problems, because they are the cause of, or an alibi for, many others. That is why the present situation in the Middle East is immensely important, especially since I believe there is a real chance, for the first time, of reaching an agreement. I say this on the basis of my visit there, when I met with leading representatives of the Palestinians and Israel and each ascribed positive motives to the other. That is the crucial difference compared with the previous situation, and it is the key basis on which to build a successful process.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that the Middle East Quartet now meets together in the region at last. It should not just rely on the written roadmap; it should visit the region as a joint body. We must ensure that we support the framework conditions that will facilitate an agreement between the leaders of the two sides. This includes bringing clear influence to bear on Iran and Syria in order to stop Hezbollah from wrecking the peace process from outside. We must support President Abbas so that the Palestinian people can see that peace benefits everyone. That is why assistance must be provided very swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">I do realise, Commissioner, that this House has always taken a very critical line on this issue. What is needed now, though, is swift action. This does not mean that something should be done through some programme or other at some point in time; it means making it clear, preferably before the parliamentary elections in summer, that it is worth taking the moderates' side. In this way, the cycle of violence can be broken, which is essential if the Israeli leaders are to secure the necessary support from their own people by being able to say to them that the peace process means no more terrorism. Prompt action is therefore required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s position on the sovereign right of nations to self-determination has always been very clear. It has consistently rejected any form of overt or covert occupation, be it in Palestine, Iraq or other countries of the world. For a great variety of reasons, however, most often political and historical ones, action has rarely been taken against foreign forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the death of Mr Hariri, whose unknown assassins are still on the loose, again raises this question and many others. Should we or should we not ask the Syrians to refrain from all interference in Lebanese affairs? My answer is yes. Should they at last put an end to the state of emergency in which their country has been for over 30 years? Yes. Should they thoroughly democratise their society and release activists from prison? My answer is clear, it is yes. Should they withdraw their troops from Lebanon? Yes, and they have started to do so. Should we, as General Morillon suggests, make signing the Syria-EU cooperation agreement dependent on these conditions, and in particular the immediate withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanon? That is my question to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is crucial. Mr Hariri’s death has both everything and nothing to do with the answer. This assassination must certainly be fully investigated and there must be an international inquiry. Having said that, I really want to ask the Council whether it is appropriate to sign an agreement that has been awaited for so long, since it is the last of the MEDA agreements and has been deferred so many times. Once it is signed, whether we like it or not, this agreement will inevitably be in the spotlight, and we, the European Union, will be forced to justify our idea of European foreign policy and its democratic basis to public opinion. That is no idle question, it is a question that I ask myself and that we are all asking ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During that time, Europe has been greatly preoccupied with its own organisation and enlargement. It has not always given its southern flank the attention it deserved. At the same time, the Israel-Palestine conflict has blocked the overall development dynamic by capturing all the attention in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Today there is an urgent need to get the process moving again. Tools are in place: association agreements, a neighbourhood policy and in particular the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which is a great democratic step forward in this process. There is also the establishment of the Anna Lindh Foundation to encourage dialogue between cultures and civilisations. Furthermore, there is the idea, which is already well advanced, of setting up a Euro-Mediterranean development bank to promote employment, health and education in the countries of the South. Other civil society organisations are being formed.</p>
<p class="contents">All these projects are making progress, but two things are essential if they are to be effective. The first is to get the wind of political reform blowing, and the nations of the South are ready to back it. The second is to establish a just and lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. The present circumstances are favourable but very fragile. Europe needs to be more committed. All these projects are converging towards greater peace, security and shared prosperity, but much too slowly. Europe has understood that there is no war of civilisations, but that an alliance of civilisations is necessary, because after dismantling a wall in the East, Europe now has to build a bridge to the South. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, as shaped in Barcelona in 1995, has become embroiled in the Arab-Israeli conflict and has not brought about the expected results. Today, the European Union should, alongside the implementation of the roadmap for Palestine, take the initiative, within the framework of the Quartet, to design a roadmap for peace between Israel and Syria. We now need a holistic approach to peace, democracy, security and stability in the Middle East. Syria, like Israel, should respect the decisions of the UN Security Council on Lebanon and withdraw its troops. At the same time, we need to re-evaluate the Barcelona Process within the new framework of the European neighbourhood strategy we have designed, in order to avoid overlapping policies and initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">May I close by saying that the European Commission and the Council are being called on to follow up the initiative of the former President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, who in 2002 created the initiative for dialogue between the peoples and the cultures of the Euro-Mediterranean area, and the relevant proposals which the Committee of Wise Men took at that time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without doubt, a great deal can be said about the past, the present and the future of Euro-Mediterranean policy. I wish to comment on two or three points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns Euro-Mediterranean policy and the situation in the Middle East. It is a fact that a new wind is blowing at the moment in the Middle East and that is a positive thing; however, history has shown that we always need to approach the peace process with restrained optimism and, in all events, with the will to contribute as the European Union not just economically but also politically.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the countries surrounding Israel and Palestine; the new situation in Lebanon following Hariri's murder, relations with Syria, which require attention and, without doubt, the role of Egypt, which has always played a stabilising role. I think that we need to look very carefully at our relations with Syria in the future. Here too there are numerous proposals and numerous alternative solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment concerns Iraq. It is a fact that, at the moment, we are on the path of reconstruction. We had the results of the elections, which give a full map of what is happening in this country and, of course, we need to approach our relations with Iraq one step at a time, with the first important element of our assistance being in shaping the new constitution. As for relations with Iran, and we know about the current debate, I am one of those who would say to you, be careful with the nuclear power, because I am against nuclear power, against nuclear weapons but, at the same time, I would tell you that the approach needs to be an approach with diplomatic means, not with troops and wars. Wars do not resolve problems, they exacerbate them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, having thanked the Commissioner for the efforts she has made for Euro-Mediterranean policy, can we please all agree that the European Union needs to be present in the Mediterranean, especially in the Middle East, politically as well as economically? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The time is ripe to remember objectives that are just as topical as ever: the establishment of a common area of peace, stability, and security and of an area of shared prosperity and the bringing together of nations and cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Javier Solana stressed in June 2004, this partnership is strategic for Europe, always assuming that Europe gives itself the resources to match its ambitions. First of all, the Barcelona Process must be the first pillar of the European neighbourhood policy, in as much as that policy proposes going much further than mere cooperation, extending to a degree of political and economic integration. The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will have to provide the democratic framework for that; it needs to be further strengthened. The European presidency of the EMPA must enable a balanced partnership to be consolidated. We should be talking about codevelopment based on common values: democracy, good governance, the status of women, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue.</p>

In Amman, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly’s Committee on Economic, Financial, Social and Educational Issues attempted to reinforce these signs and give them short- and medium-term objectives aimed at protecting the citizens and development. Violence has reared its head, though, and Hariri’s death has demonstrated the urgent need for the EU to strengthen its role as an active partner. In Parliament, as in Amman, we all consider peace to be a desirable and necessary factor in prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East, EUR 60 billion is spent every year on arms and cutting this amount by half will release absolutely crucial funds to support development throughout the region. Accordingly, in this Year of the Mediterranean, and in years to come, the EU must have a clearly defined, practical role. Economic and regional integration into more globalised markets, such as the EU, must be guaranteed, and the 720 million inhabitants of the Euro-Med area therefore represent a more significant market than China, a fact that should be taken into account by businesses looking to make investments.</p>
<p class="contents">Education and training are key elements in creating an industrial workforce. The Commission should therefore seek to support measures that encompass the countries of the MEDA Programme and thus open up new horizons. In order to develop employment, the EU must contribute towards the creation of jobs in industry and support and promote microcredit institutions. Development and joint initiatives are absolutely crucial, in areas such as water, energy, transport, infrastructures and tourism, to enable social progress and economic and regional integration.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are crucial if this whole drawn-out story is to have a happy ending and if these people are to dream once again of a prosperous future, and this Year of the Mediterranean is setting a perfect example. We therefore hope that the EU can be the driving force behind the whole of this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The countries concerned are neighbours to many Member States, and there are a whole series of historical, political, economic, cultural and human links between us. We need do no more than think of the considerable number of citizens of those countries resident amongst us.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the situation of the countries on the southern shore varies. Most of them are facing great challenges, however. By way of example I could mention the need to make progress on democracy and respect for human rights, social and economic modernisation, administrative reform and the improvement of public services, especially education. This is because young people make up a large proportion of the large populations of these countries. I am glad Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner emphasised education. Combating terrorism and the mafias involved in illegal immigration more effectively is a further challenge facing the region, as is the fight against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the Member States must encourage its neighbours on the southern shores of the Mediterranean to rise successfully to these challenges. Dialogue, aid and genuine cooperation at different levels will all help. For instance, greater political and economic liberalisation and improved education will ensure greater stability in those countries. Progress of this kind will also help to defeat extremism and fanaticism, because the latter tend to flourish wherever there is poverty and ignorance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to be aware that the prosperity and stability of those countries is inextricably linked to the prosperity and stability of our own. We have a shared future. We cannot afford to neglect each other, and we must cooperate closely.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic European instruments designed to allow us to achieve these objectives are the Barcelona Process, the European neighbourhood policy and the action plans. I am delighted that the Anna Lindh foundation is soon to be launched, and that this House will shortly assume the Presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years have passed since the start of the Barcelona Process, but we must continue to foster it, so that the citizens of the countries on the southern shore do not feel that an enlarged Europe has forgotten their problems. Consequently, strong support must be given to the Barcelona Process. This year, 2005, has been designated the Year of the Mediterranean, which presents a splendid opportunity to revitalise the Barcelona Process, just when the prospects for the Middle East peace process are so much better, as many previous speakers have pointed out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we see how Mahmoud Abbas is adopting a pragmatic position, and what Israel’s first reaction is like, but also how the people in Lebanon are claiming their right to freedom and self-determination in a historic manner, I think it is of great importance for Europe to be giving the right signals. What are those signals?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we, along with the United States, should press for breathing new life into the roadmap, but also, as Mr Brok said a moment ago, give support to the Palestinians at this particular time, so that the people there realise, the sooner the better, that the pragmatists and moderates can really offer benefits. Thirdly, we must also give a clear signal, clearer than before, to the ill-intentioned, by which, in particular, I am referring to Hezbollah, to which our attitude in Europe is really odd.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Hamas, we said at one time that it was, as a whole, both politically and militarily wrong. Where Hezbollah is concerned, we are still two-faced, because in their case, we say that the military side is wrong, but we can deal with them at a political level. There is no longer any reason to sustain that division, for that division is implausible. There is a leader, Mr Nasrallah, who is the political and military leader, and who claims that they are an organisation. Equally, the second man in the organisation, Sheikh Naim Qassem, says that they are an organisation, that politically and militarily speaking, they have the same objective: ‘Political activity is integrated into resistance operations, it is a inseparable part of the political activity’. That is what was said by Hezbollah’s Number Two, and should there be any doubt left, I should like to quote Hezbollah’s representative in the Lebanese Parliament, the one we have dealings with, who states: ‘Hezbollah is an organisation in which all the fighters are simultaneously politicians and fighters. The manner in which some in the West seek to betray Hezbollah does not deceive us’.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford to be naïve any longer, particularly at this time. We must send the right message to the Palestinians, Israelis and the Lebanese who want freedom, by taking a firm line with the evil-minded like Hezbollah. I know that during the last Council presidency, the Dutch Government tried to move away from this two-faced attitude and place Hezbollah as a whole on the list of terrorist organisations. I think that the people in the Middle East deserve that signal from the EU as a whole. I would like to ask the Commissioner, but also the Council’s representative, whether they would like to elaborate on this. Why are we still two-faced in our dealings with Hezbollah, and when will we at last come to fight the organisation as a whole by fire and sword, as we do Hamas?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Barcelona Process is based on the principle of mutual benefit. On the one hand, Member States are primarily keen to tackle issues such as immigration, terrorism and human rights. On the other, Mediterranean partners are eager to increase their standard of living and benefit through economic aid and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is, of course, to address the gap between the Union and the Mediterranean region. Reduce the prosperity gap, and you slow migratory flows. Address the democracy gap, and you consolidate regional stability. The theory is simpler than the practice. The Barcelona Process has tried to do all this, with moderate results. We have been lacking in three areas: visibility – convincing people that we are in this together on all issues; prioritisation – trying to do everything, but ending up doing little; and implementation – through financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely, if Member States see tangible results, they will be more forthcoming in committing funds. Our Mediterranean partners are asking for more money in order to produce these results. Ingenuity is needed to break this 'chicken and egg' situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The prospects have rarely been so good. It is the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, there are peaceful developments between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East – something that would have seemed impossible only a few months ago – and President Yushchenko is here with us today – from an eastern part of the neighbourhood where democracy and human rights are increasingly being asserted.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important that we, in this European Parliament, make a positive contribution to this neighbourhood policy process. In the countries themselves, too, we see that the mood is changing. Only a few days ago, delegates from Morocco told me that when they launched a human rights dialogue with the Council within the EU-Morocco Association Council, all the other neighbours said to them: 'Have you lost your minds? How can you talk about human rights with the EU? It will only backfire on you when the EU starts to interfere.' However, the impact is positive. The dialogue is taking place and it means that they have an opportunity to talk about the human rights of Moroccans in the European Union as well. In other words, it is a productive dialogue, and one which will undoubtedly have a positive effect on all the other neighbours too.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are on the right track and now we must become more ambitious. We always said that if corruption in the Palestinian Authority is addressed, if there is an end to terrorism, then we Europeans must help out with even more money if necessary. That means that we must be prepared to support this process on our own initiative. Mr Brok has undoubtedly voiced the opinion of the majority in this House, Commissioner. In other words, if you take action now, you will have our backing. The prediction that chaos would break out after Arafat's death has proved wrong. What has broken out is peace; anti-corruption measures are now in place, and we Europeans should support this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a final comment on Syria, which Mr Eurlings has already mentioned. Mr Solana's comments are unacceptable in this form. We must now make more demands on Syria as well. All our Arab neighbours are keen to support the peace process and Syria must now be judged by whether it combats Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria. If it fails to do so, it cannot be a good partner for EU policy. This must be made clear and, in this respect, the Commissioner has been rather more forthright in her comments than Mr Solana in recent weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I believe this debate has shown first of all that Parliament is an important, not to say essential, partner in relaunching the Barcelona Process. A number of suggestions have been made and I will try to come back to some of the points that have been raised.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I would like to say that the democratic project, the project of democracy for the Mediterranean, is a European idea. With the Barcelona Process, we have effectively advocated this idea of defending democracy in this region. In this context, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is an important step, since we all know that democracy is also a form of apprenticeship. Apprenticeship in parliamentary government, in parliamentary democracy, takes place first of all in this context of exchange. As we all know, not all members of parliament are nominated or elected in the same way. However, I believe this assembly is a step in the right direction. You have been entrusted with an important task, one which I might almost go so far as to describe as democratic education, but also education for peace and dialogue, since this parliamentary assembly brings together those who today are enemies or perhaps were yesterday. I believe this form of dialogue is an extremely important point. Moreover, the presidency will have the honour of being present at your deliberations at your Cairo meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that has been addressed at length and is of concern to the Council is the situation in Lebanon. Since the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri, the internal situation in Lebanon has become extremely delicate. I have noted that a number of comments, not to say demands, have been made. I can tell you that so far as Lebanon is concerned there is perfect agreement between the European Union and the United States, and that is something which clearly emerged from yesterday’s talks. In the context of the crisis into which Hariri’s assassination risks plunging the country, UN Resolution 1559, which initially was backed by one European country and the US, is taking on a completely new dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Our attitude towards Syria is not one of weakness. I believe we have tried to work with the Syrians. We hoped, and continue to hope, that Syria will rejoin the train of reform and democratisation. We also know and have to recognise, however, that the forces in support of such a development are probably still very much a minority and are very weak. That is why we may have to move to another form of dialogue with that country, and there is, to say the least, some doubt about whether the agreement will be signed on schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word about Hezbollah. I do not believe there is any ambiguity, and we all know that Hezbollah is politically active, since it has members in the Lebanese parliament as well as being involved in other activities. However, the mere fact of putting it on the list will not solve the problem. I therefore believe we must monitor this Hezbollah question very closely. We also have to look at Hezbollah’s attitude to the present situation in Lebanon. I have to say that the threats made by some leading members of Hezbollah concerning the stability of Lebanon do not inspire confidence and we shall therefore probably have to take other measures in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as Syria is concerned, I would simply like to say that there was at least one positive point that gave us hope when, after long negotiations and long discussions, Syria agreed to the non-proliferation clause. That was a glimmer of hope that we could persuade Syria to adopt a more responsible attitude in keeping with the principles upheld by the European Union and the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the peace process, I believe we are all agreed that it is essential if we are to give fresh impetus to the Barcelona Process and to dialogue with the Mediterranean region. I therefore agree with Mr Morillon when he says that Europe must make plans in preparation for the time when peace has been reached. I can assure him that the authorities responsible for these issues in relation to peacekeeping forces will certainly not neglect such preparation and planning.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with a point that is particularly close to my heart, namely immigration, since I am also responsible for handling it during our presidency. The European Union has no intention whatsoever of building a new wall between one shore of the Mediterranean and the other. Reference has been made to the thousands of people who try to cross the Mediterranean and perish in the attempt. They are not the victims of a wall between Europe and the other shore of the Mediterranean. They are above all victims of poverty, destitution and oppression. They are also, however, the victims of traffickers, of criminal gangs who financially exploit their despair. I therefore believe we must work with our partners on the other side of the Mediterranean to fight against these criminal practices and activities. These matters are all included in the Hague programme, which also brings this very issue of immigration into the new neighbourhood policy approach. I therefore believe that our approach to immigration, especially with our Mediterranean neighbours, must form part of a much more global approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, the Justice and Home Affairs Council will hold its first debate on the Commission’s Green Paper, which has also been presented to this House by my fellow Commissioner Mr Frattini. It is a green paper on legal immigration. I believe we must adopt a partnership approach and try to find solutions for ordered, controlled but legal immigration, which, once people arrive in Europe, will allow them to be integrated and participate fully in life in our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This applies to the Euro-Mediterranean platform that has been in existence for ten years, the Action Plans and of course to the Mediterranean peace process also. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have to do everything so that this small, first step of the peace process can be consolidated, and it must be consolidated on both sides. Mahmoud Abbas has to dismantle the terrorist structures and get rid of illegal arms and the tunnels. The other side must make an effort too. I gave both leaders this clear message. The Israelis have to do everything possible as well. First they have to release prisoners, giving the Palestinians confidence so that they do not use weapons any more. The Israelis must also go back to the table. They must guarantee freedom of movement for the Palestinian people and for goods. Only when the economy starts to flourish can there be a chance for real peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Brok and Mr Laschet mentioned, we now have to do everything to support this peace process, including politically, within the Quartet. I am very proud to be a new member of that. The next quartet meeting will be held in London. There we can go on supporting this process, step by step. Yesterday we talked about it with Condoleezza Rice and President Bush. They have now nominated a security coordinator for the area to help address future incidents. This is important in order for the process to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gaza disengagement will be very difficult. It will now be a coordinated disengagement. Sharon has already said this. This has been one of the long-standing challenges. Now it is a promise. We must make financial efforts, too, and give the Palestinians everything.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to pay tribute to my predecessor, because he supported the Palestinian Authority in very difficult circumstances. I particularly wanted to mention that. I want to do the same, but of course in a transparent way. 'Quick Start' projects can be started up on top of what we are already doing as soon as the withdrawal from Gaza begins.</p>
<p class="contents">We provide help in the fields of education, health and job creation, and we often work with UNRWA. We will also start up investment projects, for instance with the sea port. I have already announced this. So, you can see we are not taking this process lightly. On the contrary, we take it very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague from the Council has already gone into great detail with regard to Lebanon. For us, it is very important to show Lebanon that now, the first steps towards a democratic process must be consolidated by elections. We are currently considering different options, including election observation and support, but negotiations in that regard are still ongoing with the Lebanese. We hope we can make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we talked about the broader Middle East with Condoleezza Rice. This is an excellent opportunity to use the momentum that is there to move ahead with the peace process, our neighbourhood policy, the Barcelona Process and the new American engagement to aim for the same goals. All this must be done in parallel. We want to make use of what we have already done.</p>
<p class="contents">We have given an enormous amount of money under the MEDA Programme. At the end of 2004, EUR 1002 million was committed in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, including EUR 160 million for Iraq. With regard to Iraq, payments amounted to EUR 1 125 million. In 2004 we committed about EUR 700 million and paid EUR 800 million, so the payments/commitments ratio is 115%. Improved performance goes hand in hand with the enhancement of the quality of programmes. I appeal to you to support us when it comes to the financial perspectives and the European neighbourhood policy instrument. That is the instrument that will really help us to act.</p>
<p class="contents">We gave EUR 320 million to Iraq last year, particularly for health, education and basic needs. We have just mentioned another EUR 200 million that we want to give to support the population and the constitutional process. We are ready to designate experts that could work together with the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to help in the integrated mission for police training, and for training connected with justice and the rule of law in order to enhance institution-building. We are also working to build up the ministries of trade and energy. I am ready to join my colleagues from the Council and Mr Solana in a Troika and go to the region to support the Iraqis as soon as a new government is in place. Yesterday, a new international coordination conference involving the Americans was announced. That is an excellent idea for creating a stable and prosperous Iraq in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
