<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, it is a privilege to be here today to discuss with you an issue to which this Parliament and the Dutch presidency attach great importance: arms export policy and the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. I shall begin with some comments on the report on the Council's Fifth Annual Report and on the motion for a resolution. Please allow me to start with some general remarks about the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">The Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was adopted in 1998, and it is no exaggeration to state that it has become one of the more successful instruments of our common foreign and security policy. Arms export policy has traditionally been veiled in secrecy. It was considered to be an essential element of undiminished national sovereignty in which interference by others was, to put it mildly, not welcome. However, since 1998 we have witnessed increasing transparency, increasing inter-state consultation and increasing harmonisation in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is impressive progress, and the success of the Code of Conduct is also illustrated by the interest taken in it by third countries. I am not only talking about countries aspiring to become Member States of the European Union, but others too. The Code of Conduct is a useful tool that can help them establish an efficient and responsible export control policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dutch presidency attaches great importance to further harmonisation of the European arms export policy and to making that policy even more transparent. One of the priorities of our presidency is the conclusion of the first review of the EU Code of Conduct. We hope to be able to finalise this review before the end of the year. I stress that I use the words 'first review' on purpose. It is important that we see the Code as a living document which should regularly be held up to the light, and take into consideration internal and external developments and views. Hence I am sure that this will not be the last review of the Code.</p>
<p class="contents">In its endeavours to enhance transparency, the Dutch presidency has also stressed the importance of increased dialogue with the European Parliament. On 1 September the Committee on Foreign Affairs held a debate with the Dutch chairman of the COARM working group on the EU Code of Conduct and the current review. The committee's rapporteur, Mr Romeva i Rueda, participated in a conference on the review of the Code on 30 September in The Hague. We have also invited Mr Romeva i Rueda to an informal meeting with the COARM working group on 3 December to discuss Parliament's report. Furthermore, we have invited Mr Romeva i Rueda to participate in a meeting which the presidency is organising, together with the Czech Government, in Prague, to inform the candidate countries and Norway on the implementation of the Code. We think it is important that the parliamentary role in European arms export policy is highlighted in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would like to make some more specific remarks on the draft report and on the motion for a resolution. The European Parliament report refers to the Council's 2003 report. Since then a lot has happened, most importantly the review of the Code of Conduct. Some of the points addressed in the report are being discussed in the framework of this review. In this respect I should mention the following points.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament report welcomes the common position on arms brokering. In the present review there is already consensus to extend the application of the Code to brokering activities. The same is true for licensed production overseas, and transport and trans-shipment. Licence applications for these activities will become subject to the criteria and practices set out in the Code of Conduct. Furthermore, the Code should also be applicable in cases of so-called intangible transfers of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Outside the context of the review of the Code of Conduct, we have made progress in areas such as outreach. I have already mentioned the seminar in Prague in December. In September, Member States agreed on a more coherent approach concerning outreach. The Council Secretariat will keep a database on the outreach activities of the individual Member States so as to achieve better coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has also been made in the further development of the denial notification and consultation system – one of the core elements of the Code. Consultations on denials are now taking place in such a way that all Member States are informed about the consultation. Only the final decision of a Member State as to whether or not it will undercut the denial is not automatically shared with all the partners. Furthermore, an electronic database is being developed by the Council Secretariat, which will contain the denials notified by Member States, as well as information on the consultations they have undertaken. This database will contribute greatly to the efficiency of bilateral consultations and the transparency of their outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Much time has been devoted to the status of the Code. Parliament expresses a clear preference in its report for making the Code legally binding. You may be aware that there is no consensus on this issue in the Council: about half of the Member States are in favour of making the Code legally binding, but the other half opposes it. However, there is something more important than the question of whether the Code is politically or legally binding. That is the actual content of the Code and the way it is implemented, because changing the status in itself would probably have little or no effect on the arms export policy of individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Romeva i Rueda report stresses the importance of increased transparency. I agree and am therefore pleased that the Council's 2004 Annual Report will be more transparent than previous ones. We hope that further steps can be taken, probably as soon as next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The transparency of the national reports is also of importance. The Dutch presidency, together with SIPRI, recently organised a meeting with Member States on how to improve national reporting. I am sure that subsequent presidencies will follow-up this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution also advocates a monitoring system to control end-use. This is an area where more work could be done. A recent US Government study shows that, in the case of the US, between 15 and 20% of authorised exports to so-called 'vulnerable' destinations do not end in the hands of the indicated end-user. We have no figures for the EU, but there is no reason to think they would be dramatically different. We will therefore, as a first step, organise a meeting on post-shipment controls where we will be briefed by the US authorities on their experiences with post-shipment control programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to probably the most politically sensitive issue. I know that the EU arms embargo vis-à-vis China attracts the special attention of this Parliament and of many national parliaments. I take note of the appeal in the resolution not to lift the arms embargo. The issue of the future of the arms embargo is still under discussion in the Council. It is therefore not possible to discuss this issue in detail. However, let me say that the Dutch presidency is well aware of the various concerns expressed by parliaments, the public, NGOs and also by important partners like the US and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">One such concern is the human rights situation in China. The EU takes every opportunity to discuss human rights issues with China, and monitors carefully the developments on the ground. All these concerns are taken into account in the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also discussing measures supplementary to the Code of Conduct that should prevent an increase in the flow of arms and military technology from Europe to China should the embargo be lifted. The aim of these measures is to increase transparency and intensify consultation among Member States. It is not yet clear when this discussion will be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Dutch presidency is pleased to see that the European Parliament pays so much attention to the important issue of arms export policy. As I said earlier, increased dialogue on this issue between the Council and Parliament is one of the objectives of our presidency. Progress has been made or is under way on many of the points mentioned in the report and the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">There are areas where further progress is possible. The transparency of the national reports is one; harmonisation of the interpretation of the criteria is another. However, we can say that the glass is already more than half full. Please be assured that the Netherlands will do its utmost in the remaining six weeks of its presidency to fill the glass even fuller. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> First of all, I apologise for appearing in front of the House for yet another farewell appearance. I am starting to know what Frank Sinatra must have felt like, as he staggered on making farewell appearances until he was into his seventies. I hope this really is the last afternoon that the House will have to endure me, but that is in Parliament's hands.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members know, given the way in which the common foreign and security policy operates, this is not an issue on which the Commission takes a lead. Nevertheless, we have an obvious interest in the overall development of our relations with China, which by and large are excellent, and the arms embargo naturally operates in that context. As Parliament knows, the embargo was imposed by the European Council in 1989, following the events in Tiananmen Square, the early stages of which I was able to witness at first hand as the then vice-chairman of the Asia Development Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, China has intensified its campaign to have the ban lifted. That campaign continues in the run-up to the summit between the European Union and China next month. The Chinese authorities consider the embargo to be evidence of discrimination against them; they argue that the ban is obsolete. They claim that it severely hinders the further development of bilateral relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we have acknowledged that positive change has occurred and that the political situation in China has moved on since Tiananmen, China's observance of some basic human rights, notably in the area of political and civil rights, continues to fall well short of international norms. Without making any direct link we have, therefore, consistently told the Chinese authorities at the highest level that the lifting of the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take the sort of concrete steps in the field of human rights that would convince the European public that that was an appropriate course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that a number of Member States are favourably disposed towards lifting the embargo and have made that view public. Others believe that it is premature, citing concerns about human rights. Human rights were an issue that figured prominently in the resolution passed by this House last year against lifting the ban.</p>
<p class="contents">Those Member States arguing for lifting the ban use the rationale that the controls introduced in the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on arms sales render it nugatory. I acknowledge that this argument is not without substance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very keen to move forward with our important strategic partnership with China, a country that is rapidly emerging as a global player across the board, and is now, amongst other things, our second largest trading partner. That is one of our top foreign policy goals in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, given the underlying logic of the embargo and the significant political and symbolic issues involved for both sides, it is understandable that some Member States argue that the lifting of the ban should take place against a background of positive and tangible steps by China to improve its human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say a few words on the European Parliament’s report on the operation of the EU’s Code of Conduct on arms exports. The strength of the Code of Conduct is closely related to the China embargo debate, since it will guide Member States' export practice if the ban is lifted. Responsibility for the arms trade currently rests with Member States, but the Commission is fully associated with its consideration under the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the rapporteur for putting together a substantial document which merits very careful attention. It challenges Member States to attain more stringent standards on the control of arms exports. Amongst other things, it asks for more transparency, not something that is normally immediately associated with the arms trade. It also seeks further controls and limitations on such trade, inherently difficult areas for those Member States with significant arms industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the report focuses primarily on improvement in European practice, its scope is global. Recognising the European Union’s potential to promote best practice around the world, it advocates, among other things, an international arms trade treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget – and I am sure Parliament has not – the sobering fact that around half a million people die each year as a result of violence linked to small arms and light weapons. As you are well aware, the Commission is regularly involved, with other international organisations and NGOs, in dealing with the consequences of inappropriate or illegal arms sales. We are also implementing some specific projects to reduce destabilising accumulations of weapons around the world. A pilot project initiated by the European Parliament is under way to see what else can be done. More certainly needs to be done. I particularly support the idea of an international agreement to strengthen the control of conventional arms sales. That is why the Commission has, as part of wider EU efforts, strongly supported the adoption of an international Code of Conduct on arms exports based on the European Union’s initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are currently considering how to improve the Code of Conduct and we are encouraging these efforts to strengthen EU controls on conventional arms sales. The success of this endeavour will be a factor in the ongoing China arms embargo debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know the importance of China as an economic partner and a political player in the world in the coming decades. China is, to a considerable extent, regaining the position that it had in the world until the middle of the 19th century, when it was still responsible for probably 30% of global GDP. The historic recovery we are witnessing is, on the whole, extraordinarily beneficial to the rest of the world. China's integration as an open economy into the world economy is good for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not in any way demeaning to us or the Chinese if we regularly make it clear that there are other issues that concern us, such as issues of human rights. I am sure we shall in due course see an improvement as the political situation in China matches the economic one. It is impossible these days for any country to remain completely self-contained. It is impossible for a country to open up its economy whilst keeping politics under absolutely rigid control.</p>

<p class="contents">We in this Parliament frequently condemn violations of human rights in different parts of the world and we frequently adopt resolutions to that effect. We have condemned murders, torture, abuse and wars, and we constantly condemn the extreme poverty in the world suffered by thousands of peoples and millions of people. Meanwhile, our governments are still authorising arms exports, which not only makes these people’s situation even worse, but also leads the buyers to spend huge sums of money for military purposes, when the social and development priorities of their countries require that it be spent elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000 in New York, 189 countries signed the Millennium Declaration committing themselves, between 2015 and 2050, to putting an end to poverty, guaranteeing universal access to essential medicines and equal opportunities for men and women, as well as ensuring universal literacy and primary schooling, amongst many other things. In order to achieve these objectives, the governments must dedicate at least USD 60 000 million per year to the application of that Millennium Agenda. Nevertheless, despite the fact that it is extremely difficult to find money for these purposes, world military spending between 2002 and 2003 increased by USD 64 000 million, and between 2003 and 2004 a further USD 50 000 million had to be added.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the European Union, which export a third of the world’s conventional arms, have a considerable responsibility here. In 2002, which the report we are discussing refers to, the European Union sold arms and military equipment worth EUR 21 000 million to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Morocco, India, Pakistan, Angola, Turkey, Iran, Algeria, Colombia, Israel and also Iraq, as well as many other countries, which, according to a strict interpretation of the European Union’s Code of Conduct, should not be buying European arms. Where is the problem? It has already been mentioned; the problem lies in the fact that, on the one hand, that code is still too vague and, on the other, that it is not yet a legally-binding instrument and criminal penalties cannot, therefore, be applied in the event of its violation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has always been the most pioneering of the European institutions in terms of demanding that European arms exports be governed by a strict code of conduct and at the same time that these exports be consistent with the European Union’s constant messages in favour of preventing armed conflict and promoting peace and development. So, after ten years of working professionally on this issue, I must congratulate the Dutch Presidency in particular on the efforts it is making, not only on the review of the code of conduct, but also in terms of making this text much braver, more consistent and, ultimately, more effective. But it is not yet sufficient and we must therefore remember – as the report points out – that we must insist on the need to revise the text of the code, to make it stricter, to demand that it become a legally-binding instrument – although we do not yet have consensus, we must work to achieve it – to demand that governments increase transparency and improve the information they provide on authorisations and refusals of licences, to call for the code also to be applied to the export of material which can be used for torture or executions, to demand that the European Union create instruments to improve the registers of arms intermediaries, whether they operate from the European Union or whether they are registered strictly within it, and that the legislation controlling exports be harmonised upwards. Finally, amongst many other things, the report calls for the European Union to co-lead at international level the adoption of an international arms treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, since this debate is taking place at a time when certain European governments are suggesting that we need to lift the arms embargo on China, we should take this opportunity to once again reiterate that it would be a mistake to do this. There are at least three reasons for this: the clearly unsatisfactory human rights situation in that country, which has been condemned many times by several NGOs; the fact that, since China is the world’s top importer of conventional arms, broadening the military market even further would undoubtedly speed up the arms race in the region and, finally, the numerous risks of aggravating certain unresolved conflicts such as that between China and Taiwan or the pressure being put on Tibet – which has yet to be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I would appeal to the Council not just to listen, but to take into account and respect this Parliament’s proposals and recommendations, with a view to eliminating once and for all the blatant contradiction of, on the one hand, complaining about poverty, wars and violations of human rights, while on the other, fanning the flames of violence in many places through our arms and our silence, something which is incomprehensible to millions of victims.</p>

We estimate that arms imports in fact account for over 20% of the developing countries’ debt. In those countries, military spending often far exceeds the health budget or the education budget, and sometimes it even exceeds both put together. It is therefore crucial to these countries’ sustainable development that they significantly stem the flow of arms imports. It is not possible to live for very long in a world in which USD 900 billion goes on military spending, whereas only USD 325 billion is spent on agricultural subsidies and only USD 60 billion is set aside for development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, to take just one example, between 1995 and 2001 in Sub-Saharan Africa, military spending rose by 47% and life expectancy fell by four years. Yes, the European Union’s Code of Conduct on arms exports has existed since 1998. Yes, EU countries have made progress. As a matter of urgency, however, we must go further, especially given that other powers, such as the United States, Russia and China, do not practise such self-restraint. I feel that the measures laid down by Parliament’s Committee on International Trade will indeed make it possible for us to go further, even if they fall short of what some of us had hoped for. It is essential that these measures be adopted because they will help us to establish a different mindset. I should like to give particular mention to the complete harmonisation of the policy on Member States’ arms exports in the medium term, helping arms manufacturers to change direction and diversify into other products in order to prevent social crises and the loss of skills, the creation of a European agency for the control of arms exports and, most importantly, the creation of a tax on arms exports that will benefit the victims of conflict and the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, if the EU adopted those proposals and turned them into practical legal measures, that would represent considerable progress and would provide the impetus for putting pressure on countries such as the United States, China, Ukraine, Russia and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">What would be even more effective would be if all of this could lead to measures aimed at controlling the origin of capital in tax havens set up in EU territory. By doing that, we would be taking a step towards saving the human race.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude, if I may, by quoting Albert Einstein: ‘Either the human race will destroy arms, or arms will destroy the human race’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel the same way as he does about Frank Sinatra: I keep on hearing his voice, and Commissioner Patten’s as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Passing on to arms exports, while I think we really can be justified in saying that the Code of Conduct has resulted in progress where arms exports are concerned, I must also say that this progress has not been enough. We are very pleased to learn that the Presidency of the Council is conducting negotiations with a view to clarifying a number of points in the Code, and I hope that these negotiations will have a successful outcome. I also see it as very important that these rules should cover not only sales, but also their mediation and brokerage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not, however, the legal basis that is the actual problem where arms exports are concerned; the real problem lies in the different ways in which these legal bases are applied in the various countries within the European Union. It is on this problem that we must focus our efforts — for a start, by declaring the Code to be legally binding. If this cannot be done at Community level, there is nothing to prevent the Member States from doing it, and, indeed, a number of them already have done so. This is the road down which we must go; whilst, on the one hand, we must aim to eventually stop treating intra-Community transfers of defence equipment as exports, this can be done only when every country in the European Community applies the rules relating to this uniformly and with rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the question of the embargo on China. My group takes the view that this strategic partnership with China is what will take us into the future, and that we must seek to bring it about. We are aware, though, that there are a few problems left outstanding, such as China’s approach to human rights, problems that have to do with Taiwan and Tibet, and so my group’s position is that the conditions are not yet in place that would allow us to lift this embargo on China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are very sorry because the EU could still benefit from ‘his way’.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the proliferation of nuclear arms calls to mind apocalyptic scenarios, the fanning of the flames of conflict by the trade in conventional arms does incalculable harm to the development of many communities, and leads to death and to the violation of the human rights of millions of civilians throughout the world. According to the strategic safety approach adopted by the EU, the main threats that we must address are regional instability, failing states, organised crime and international terrorism, all of which are threats that might be exacerbated by unchecked arms exports to buyers outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, we have seen efforts by EU Member States to improve controls on exports of conventional arms originating in, or passing through, Europe. There remains much to do, however.</p>
<p class="contents">As Socialists, we argue that the Code of Conduct on arms exports must become binding, and that national and European legislation must be adopted with a view to increasing transparency in the activity of arms brokering. The scope of the prohibition of exports of certain instruments, such as those used in torture, or anti-personnel mines, must be widened. The sale of arms to governments or groups in conflict zones must be subject to tighter control, in light of information obtained by the control mechanisms set up by the United Nations Security Council to enforce arms embargos. EU governments have a responsibility – one that they must not shirk – to press ahead with internal laws aimed at ensuring that companies and individuals breaking arms embargos declared by the EU or by the UN Security Council are seen to be punished.</p>
<p class="contents">As Socialists, we support measures to mitigate the effects of the arms trade, such as the creation of a tax to assist victims of armed conflict and to combat poverty, as recently proposed in the current UN General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU can and must go further. With measures such as those identified in this Resolution – of which we voted in favour – and extending the binding enforcement of the Code of Conduct, not only to our partners in the enlarged Europe, but also to our new neighbours, so that there can be a common European arms market, in which the recently set up European Arms Agency plays a control and regulation role.</p>
<p class="contents">As Socialists, we have tabled practical amendments on this Motion for a Resolution calling on the Council and Member States to maintain the arms embargo on the People’s Republic of China and to ensure a coherent approach as regards arms embargos in general. The embargo was imposed following the Tiananmen Square massacre and has been maintained ever since, due to the serious human rights problems that persist in China. This is despite the fact that China has opened up to the outside world and has recorded extraordinary economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003, Parliament delivered an opinion through a specific resolution on this issue and recommended maintaining the embargo. Parliament’s reports, along with those of various human rights non-governmental organisations, have, year after year, highlighted grave concern over human rights violations in China and Tibet. One resolution on the suitability of the arms embargo as a means of bringing about significant change cannot lead to a lifting of the arms embargo, at least for as long as there is no binding Code of Conduct on the export of arms and instruments that may be used for internal repression and torture. The entire scheme must be consistent in this area, yet the recent decision to lift the arms embargo on Libya is inconsistent and leaves the EU open to accusations of double standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only then can the Code become an efficient and effective instrument of control, legally binding, and with sanctions for non-compliance. Let me make specific reference to paragraph 20 of the report, which calls for the EU to maintain its embargo on China. Lifting the embargo now would be an especially poor message; it would, I think, be a classic example of hypocrisy and of a selective approach to the defence and protection of human rights around the world. The values and standards by which the EU sets such store would then once again be taking second place to crude mercantilism. The prospect of fat juicy orders for German submarines and French aircraft appears to be reason enough for some to thwart the arms embargo on China. To do so would make the EU look like a horse-trader selling his principles for a handful of pieces of silver, and that, Mr Nicolaï, is just not on under a Dutch presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot, indeed, supply weapons to a country seeking to use military force to secure the unity of its territory and now making continual threats of military action in the Straits of Taiwan, where over five hundred rockets have been set up. The idea that the Code of Conduct could impose tight restrictions on arms exports is thus a false excuse. The risk of China passing on weaponry to developing countries has not gone away. No matter what, the lifting of the arms embargo <span class="italic">hic et nunc</span> cannot be an option for our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr von Wogau – whom I congratulate on his position on the lifting of the embargo, in other words, his desire not to lift it – that at the same time the restrictive nature of the Code cannot be left in the hands of the Member States. It is clear that certain Heads of Government have few scruples when it comes to China. Have we not heard Mr Chirac say that the embargo belonged to a different era? In this context, I should call on these Heads of State, whose eyes have clearly been opened wide by the enormous market that China represents, to go and take a closer look at what is happening in stadiums, at what is happening in Iveco trucks and at what is happening in a number of places where summary executions are carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that China is the current world champion of human rights violations and, failing that, the world champion of capital punishment, which goes on unchecked and in entirely unacceptable extrajudicial conditions. I should like to ask if violating the Code, which, as everyone has said, the lifting of the arms embargo on China would represent, should not also be condemned if expressed verbally, as some Heads of State have done. I welcome the fact that the Council is seeking to reform the Code and urge strenuous efforts to prevent such statements, which clearly harm the credibility of many policies pursued by the EU in the field of respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order to avoid this it is absolutely necessary that the Code of Conduct should become legally binding and that we set out strict sanctions against businesses registered in the European Union which do not respect it. It is also essential for the Union to commit itself to demanding that other countries, such as the United States, Russia and China, adhere to the Code of Conduct, in view of the fact, as well, that over 50% of world arms manufacturing takes place in countries that are members of the UN Security Council.</p>

Among the greatest beneficiaries of the Italian arms trade is Saudi Arabia, which is certainly not an example of a country that is respectful of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we certainly must maintain the embargo on arms sales to China, and, moreover, that the protection of human rights must take absolute priority over the economic interests of profit.</p>

As we are talking of values with regard to this particular case, however, I should like to draw your attention to a number of other cases. Poland, which at the time was experiencing difficulties, was once persuaded by one of the most important countries in the world to stop sending arms to a South-East Asian country. In agreeing to this, Poland did significant damage to its economic potential. The country in question promptly took advantage of the opening left by Poland, and made a clear profit in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Code of Conduct is a necessary and rational solution, but I should like to emphasise at this point that if it is to serve any useful purpose, it must be formally binding throughout the European Union. An international agreement must also be signed, and the latter should at least be approved by the United States and Russia. If it turns out that by taking the lead we will impoverish our societies and economies in the name of the so-called values at which we excel, and that others will take our place, increasing their advantage over our economies and the opportunities we have to influence the global situation, we will actually reduce our chances of improving the enforcement of human rights throughout the world. I am in favour of lifting sanctions against China, as they are ineffective and reduce the EU’s opportunities for economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate is part of our reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union exports death, although it must be said that it exports it mainly out of Europe, as during the past five years as much as 80% of EU arms exports went to countries outside Europe. We should not let ourselves be carried away by the wishful thinking of pacifists who would like to rid the world of wars and arms, as such fancies lack any basis in reality. We can and must control the production and sale of arms in the EU, however. We must also be firm in demanding this of the future EU Member States. The Committee on Foreign Affairs has adopted amendments I tabled to this effect. The countries involved are of course Romania and Bulgaria, and also Croatia and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Polish citizen, I should like to draw your attention to an initiative taken by the Polish Government. Together with the Swedish Government, it has already organised five informal meetings of COARM, the Working Group on Conventional Arms Exports, with the participation of both old and new Member States. I should also like to lend my wholehearted support to item 28 of the motion for a resolution, concerning an export ban on all equipment used for the death penalty and torture. At the same time, however, I have my doubts as to whether the proposal in item 40, concerning a special tax on the arms trade, is realistic. I do not believe that a further tax would help bring about peace in Europe and the world, although it might appease the consciences of bureaucrats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also understandable that China, a sovereign state, should seek to reinforce its defences to protect its security and territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that a little progress has been made in improving respect for human rights, and that China remains a protagonist in the fight against terrorism and is exerting useful pressure on North Korea to stop developing nuclear weapons. However, it is also true that Beijing is trying to exploit the differences between ourselves and the United States on the subject. I am astonished that no one in this House has drawn attention to this dimension: our transatlantic relationship, which for us must remain of primary importance, will be affected by the more or less unified approach that we adopt towards the growing power of China.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to take account of the strategic, albeit precarious balance that currently exists in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is a model of democracy from which China is still very far removed. If, therefore, we intend to lift the embargo for reasons of <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span>, for economic and political reasons, rather than out of respect for democracy, we should be able to do so only by binding the Chinese People’s Republic to clear and continuous progress on human rights, as the Commission’s representative has moreover said today. We must try at least to discuss – I do not mean harmonise – our position with that of the United States and those European countries that are currently opposed to removing the embargo.

That is of course a requirement if we want to bring about a truly responsible European policy. It is quite simply a pity, as Mr Nicolaï said, that a number of countries are still resolutely standing in the way of a binding framework of this kind. Three important test criteria are a conventional human rights policy and of course the resultant practice in a given country, regional tensions in a specific field and also the ratio between what a country spends, on the one hand, on combating poverty, and, on the other, on its defence budget. It is against these yardsticks that the attempt by China – and now also by a number of countries within Europe – to have the arms embargo lifted must be measured. The human rights situation is still a matter of concern to the EU, and rightly so. China may well have signed up to essential treaties, but what it does in practice is another matter. The treatment of dissidents, of ethnic and religious minorities, and the large-scale imposition of the death penalty are, to put it simply, very worrying. Tight restrictions on freedom of expression and on workers’ rights, as well as on the right to form trade unions and to go on strike are also still giving cause for serious concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point about regional development is also self-evident. Tensions are apparent at the level of global politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with the economic aspect. China is of course undergoing enormous social changes and is, in economic terms, extremely dynamic; it is also characterised by hardworking capitalism on a vast scale, and by massive economic growth. In this, a lot of people have lost out, though; there is inequality in the shape of some 200 million people in search of work, living below the poverty level, accompanied by all the social unrest that results from that. In such a situation, economic change needs to go hand in hand with fundamental political reforms and social democracy, so I wholeheartedly endorse the position my group has taken in this House, that being that the arms embargo must not be lifted now, while also stressing the need for dialogue with China, which is a towering actor in both economic and political terms. We in Europe must try to foster the process of democratisation and offer to help resolve social problems. We must help China to play its part as a global actor effectively and fairly, for that is in the interests of the international legal system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The arms embargo against China was the EU’s response to the events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. It was our way of showing our abhorrence of what happened to thousands of peaceful demonstrating students. Since then, the world has changed. China has changed, but not the regime. China is the world’s largest dictatorship. Hundreds of thousands of dissidents are oppressed or imprisoned in labour camps. The country leads the world in terms of executions; human rights are infringed every day; freedom of expression is severely restricted, and all opposition is in principle banned.</p>
<p class="contents">The regime would thus seem not to be changing, and now we are discussing whether we should lift the embargo, in spite of the fact that no changes have occurred. What kind of signals does this send to the surrounding world and to China? China presents good trade opportunities, and we must trade with China; but we must not forget with whom we are dealing. We cannot betray all the thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of democracy activists, political prisoners and young people who secretly surf the Net to find out what is really happening. All these people have their hopes pinned on Europe. Are we to betray them by selling weapons to the regime that oppresses them? Are we to have European missiles and submarines directed against the Democratic Republic of Taiwan?</p>
<p class="contents">No, we must be consistent. It is our credibility that is at stake, and that is more important than the French mirage aircraft, the Swedish JAS Gripen or German submarines. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is counting upon you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to stand up for human rights and retain the embargo and to send that message to the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Day-to-day practice – and I include my own country in this – indicates that there are still plenty of loopholes, that definitions are unclear, that prohibitions are sometimes ignored, and that commercial considerations all too often take precedence over respect for human rights. The result of that is suffering to an unacceptable degree, an unacceptable number of people suffering oppression, and an unacceptable number of people killed. Hence, therefore, our House’s justifiable demand for a stricter formulation; hence also the justifiable demand for this Code to be made binding in law; hence also the need for more monitoring, including of end-users.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is right that the embargo on China should remain in place, and so countries such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Scandinavian countries, Poland and the Czech Republic, which, in the Council, are still saying that they want the embargo to stay, have my full support.</p>

Contrary to what one speaker has just argued, the arms embargo is no anachronism. Maintaining the embargo is, first and foremost, about human rights. It is not about China’s immense population, and the extraordinarily interesting economic potential it offers, inducing us to suddenly throw our principles in human rights matters overboard.</p>
<p class="contents">If France – to name but one country – gets what it wants and the embargo on China is lifted, the European Union will lose all the credibility it has. This is not just a human rights issue; it is also about the fact that China constitutes a positive threat to Taiwan, which is a democratic country. Over 600 rockets are trained on Taiwan, and it is disgraceful that we are even contemplating supplying new weaponry to a country that is threatening a democracy in such a fashion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is on this that the Presidency should try to agree, while acknowledging that, although there have indeed been improvements over recent years in the way in which human rights are handled in the People’s Republic of China, they have not gone anything like far enough. It is evident from the way in which religious freedom, freedom of assembly and association and the freedom of the press continue to be brutally repressed in the People’s Republic of China that it simply is not enough to cast a veil of economic interest over it.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Council to draw a clear line here and to say that we acknowledge the improvements, but that they are utterly inadequate. China, under its new leadership, must make the first move. I agree with the previous speakers that we cannot lift the arms embargo while prominent representatives of the government in Beijing are threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force, as they did yesterday. It is not acceptable that armed force across the Taiwan Strait should be a means of making policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten has always shown us the right way to go. We have always called for political dialogue between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan – a political dialogue on which both states must embark. I hope that the Chinese political leadership will indeed take the first approach, that of resuming dialogue through association. At a time when the People’s Republic of China is threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force, lifting the arms embargo would send completely the wrong message. I think we are all agreed on that, and, at the Summit, the Council should do some straight talking to that effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, there is nothing wrong with legitimate arms trade and legitimate EU arms exports consistent with a working code of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly and more importantly, effective control of arms exports is an essential part of a coherent policy that meets EU objectives on peace, respect for human rights and democracy. As many speakers have said, conventional arms kill more that half a million people a year, that is one person every minute. There are 639 million small arms in circulation in the world produced by over one thousand companies in a least 98 countries. It is essential therefore that the EU have a strict arms code policy that equates with EU values if we are to offer global leadership on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must also continue to promote an international code of conduct. The export of small arms in particular to third countries which do not uphold values of democracy and human rights creates greater instability, not just in the regions to which the arms are exported, but for the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that uncontrolled arms exports undermine global security. The voluntary code of conduct in the European Union has had some success; we need to build on that success. Continuing the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports on a voluntary basis in the future does not go far enough. I support the recommendation that the voluntary code becomes a legally binding one. This would be a bold step but one that can allow the European Union to increase its control, in a more realistic way, over the export of arms from European Union countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on the recommendations in the report that a tax be imposed on arms exports. It is my view that if the industry in Europe abides by a binding code of conduct and the only arms being traded are legitimate and consistent with that code, it is then inappropriate to burden the industry with an extra tax.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the lifting of the embargo on arms in China, I support the rapporteur's view that the ban should remain in place. While I welcome and support the dialogue and the development of a positive relationship between the European Union and China, removal of the arms embargo in the immediate term is still premature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, we are opposed to the Code becoming legally binding. We sense that there are often fine political decisions to be made and that these are best taken by politically accountable ministers rather than by judges. Some of the information on which decisions are based is highly sensitive and confidential and should remain within the domain of government. We certainly would not wish to see the European Court of Justice involved in this area. In any case, a legally binding ban would merely present another opportunity for certain states to exercise their hypocrisy, as we have seen, for example, with the efforts by some to evade the European Union's targeted sanctions against regimes in Zimbabwe and Burma or, indeed, the efforts by certain states to circumvent UN sanctions against the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the Romeva i Rueda report, some of its provisions would simply be counterproductive if adopted. For example, it calls for the publication of information on the number of licences refused, stating the reasons for refusal. The published details on licence applications that have been denied would give unscrupulous arms manufacturers and dealers knowledge about which goods are wanted by whom – effectively a rogue traders' customer list.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have adequate laws in the United Kingdom, but want to encourage other states to meet our own high standards. You can be sure that any new EU law would be gold-plated and rigorously enforced in Britain but ignored in other countries. We spend a lot of time policing ourselves in Europe, but the main problems are countries which are not bound by any scruples or international rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only are unlawful killings in wartime on the increase, but equipment is being misused by soldiers, paramilitaries and police to kill, wound and commit terrible atrocities against civilians in peacetime as well.</p>
<p class="contents">On current trends, by 2020 the number of deaths and injuries from war and violence will overtake the number of deaths caused by diseases such as malaria and measles. Although the EU Code of Conduct was welcome as a first step, export controls across the EU still have many weaknesses and loopholes and we need the political will to implement the changes required to add to and tighten up the Code criteria, to regulate licensed production overseas, to apply the Code to weapons components, to strengthen arms embargoes and to ensure that all EU Member States publish annual reports on arms exports, which Austria, Greece and Luxembourg have failed to do. Otherwise the rules will continue to be bypassed.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the helicopters used against civilians and insurgents by the security forces in Nepal contain EU components. German Deutsche AG diesel engines bypass EU embargoes by going to China and to Burma and the production of military small arms has been shifted to Malaysia, a country that has aggressive export plans for these arms and would not be subject to the EU Code.</p>
<p class="contents">As already indicated in operative provision 11, this should not stop at Europe. The British Conservatives hypocritically preach that others should do what they claim is done in Britain. I am proud of what Britain has done, but I want to see an international arms trade treaty. They will not support that in this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to endorse the view expressed in this debate that there are many hurdles to be overcome before the embargo against China can be lifted. First, it is crucial that any decision to lift the embargo should not adversely affect stability across the Taiwan Straits. Second, we need to understand fully the impact on the flow of arms if the embargo is lifted. Third, we should express our continuing concerns about China's human rights record and any decision must be subject to its progress in meeting human rights standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament for their remarks on this very important matter. Let me start with the sensitive issue of China.</p>
<p class="contents">Strong opinions have been expressed about human rights and other concerns, such as regional conflicts. It was stressed that the Council should not lift the arms embargo on China, with almost all the Members of Parliament present expressing the same sentiments. Mr Van Hecke mentioned the Dutch position. However, everyone knows that I am here not as a representative of the Dutch Government, but of the Council presidency. Nevertheless, the Dutch Government is facing a very critical Dutch Parliament, which is almost unanimously of the same opinion as this Parliament. That is also the case in other countries. I listened very closely to your remarks and share many of your concerns on this matter. These are currently also being voiced in the Council, and I must make it clear that even if this embargo is lifted, a restrictive EU export policy will be applied. It is important to be aware of that.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, many Members of Parliament mentioned the issue of the Code's status and stressed the importance of it being legally binding. Mr Van Orden, on the other hand, mentioned the issue of judicial consequences and the possible increase of the role of judges, which is also under discussion in the Council. I understand the arguments but you must be aware that positions are divided in the Council. The content of the Code and how we implement it is of greater importance than its status, which would probably have no effect on the arms export policy of the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Czarnecki, who stressed the importance of aspiring Member States applying the Code of Conduct. That is one of the reasons that the presidency organised a seminar to help these countries in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Agnoletto stressed the importance of urging other countries – the Russian Federation and the US – to apply this Code. We are in regular contact with these countries, aiming to maximise cooperation in this field, thus making export policy more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr von Wogau raised the issue of differences in the interpretation of the criteria, which is indeed an important point. I agree and have already told Parliament that harmonisation of the application of the criteria is an important objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In another question, Mr Henin asked about post-shipment controls. As I stated in my initial remarks, post-shipment controls are essential to ensuring that arms go where they are meant to go and do not fall into the wrong hands. Unlike the US, the EU Member States do not apply such controls, at least not on a regular and systematic basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue has been identified as a priority in the Sixth EU Arms Export report. As a first step Member States will in the near future organise a meeting with US experts in order to be briefed on the US programme. On the basis of this briefing, Member States will have to decide how best to move forward this important issue both nationally and jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">There were also questions from Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Gomes about the trade regulation on torture equipment. This draft regulation is at present being discussed in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gomes also asked about taxation of the arms trade. We are aware of the various suggestions made in that regard, including those by Member States of the European Union. However no concrete detailed proposals are currently being discussed within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by commenting on what Mr Romeva i Rueda said in his introduction. On the one hand he paid compliments to the presidency for the review of the Code of Conduct, but on the other hand he said it was not enough. In a way I agree that we should go further, and that this should not be the final step. It is indeed a first review and we should continue our efforts. I very much appreciate Parliament's strong commitment to this issue and the active role that Parliament has played.</p>
