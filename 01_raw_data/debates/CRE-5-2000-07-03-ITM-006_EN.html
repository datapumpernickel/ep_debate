<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guterres,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. –<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome this opportunity to say, before I start, that the Portuguese Government fully shares the sentiments expressed in the tribute paid to Mr Pflimlin, and that we too, wish to express our sincere condolences to his family and to his country.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Portuguese Government, now that we no longer hold the Presidency of the Union’s Council, I should like to express my unequivocal gratitude for the exceptional cooperation that we have seen between Parliament and the Council. This cooperation was a result of the great commitment shown by this institution. I should like to highlight the crucial contribution made from the outset by Parliament so that the Intergovernmental Conference would be able to open on time. I also wish to highlight the fact that the conciliation procedure for the framework directive on water was pursued up to the very last minute, up to the very last opportunity for conciliation, and, as a result of your understanding, was concluded successfully. </p>
<p class="contents">Now that these six months are over, I think that we can say quite simply that we have fulfilled our duty. We have fulfilled our duty towards a European ideal and on the basis of our view of the world today and its problems. Today’s world is politically unstructured and is therefore incapable of fully guaranteeing that peace, stability, human rights and democracy hold sway. The world has become global in terms of the economy and the markets but it has not yet found a way of regulating this global market and economy. It is furthermore a world in which we Europeans sometimes feel, in certain fundamental areas of technological development and technological change, that we are simply marking time and that we have been left behind to some extent compared to other parts of the world which appear to have been more dynamic over the last few years. </p>
<p class="contents">Hence the various elements of our strategy for these last six months. Our first priority was to work on creating the right conditions to make the European Union the world’s most dynamic and competitive economic area, based on knowledge, within the next ten years. We will achieve this through high levels of employment, economic growth and social cohesion. The second part of our strategy was to strengthen political union in Europe, on the basis of our universal values and by cementing Europe’s role as the leading architect of a new design for international relations, one that is more multipolar, more balanced and more equitable. The third and final element was to improve the lot of our citizens and to improve the area of European citizenship because, ultimately, any strategy must always be drawn up and implemented for the good of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us focus for a moment on the first objective I mentioned, that of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economic area in the world in the next decade. This was the main reason for holding the Lisbon Summit, the objectives of which I presented in this Chamber. I think that I can say that these objectives have been fully achieved. We feel that we have defined a strategy creating conditions which make sustainable growth of at least 3% possible in Europe and which will enable us to reach a level of employment of around 70% in ten years. This is an essential foundation for sustaining our own systems of social protection and is based on four fundamental pillars. The first involves preparing the European Union for the knowledge-based economy through mechanisms which will facilitate action for the information society, for science and technology and for training and education. The second pillar consists of achieving the economic reforms that are essential to competitiveness and innovation, through expanding the process of economic reforms necessary to create a fully integrated internal market and through new policies for innovation and business. Thirdly, we must strengthen the pillar of social cohesion, based on employment, on reform to make our social protection models sustainable and on combating social exclusion. Finally, the fourth pillar consists of coordinating macroeconomic policies in order to guarantee both the stability that we have already achieved which has provided a basis for the euro, with low inflation, low public deficits and also a macroeconomic environment which is more favourable to growth, employment, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">These four elements of the strategy have already produced tangible results. As a result of the excellent cooperation developed with the Commission, the Santa Maria da Feira European Council has already considered the action plan for the information society, the first set of decisions on the European Scientific Area, certain crucial aspects of promoting our policy for businesses – the European Charter for Small Enterprises – the multiannual programme and a whole range of other measures that have been planned for reforming the markets, particularly the financial markets. These include the European Investment Bank’s Initiative 2000 for Innovation, Entrepreneurship and the Information Society, and the High Level Group reports on the sustainability of our social protection systems and on combating social exclusion, which have already lead to a working Social Protection Committee. Finally, the Council has considered the Commission initiative on combating exclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">What this shows is that the Lisbon strategy was not merely a one-off, but is being rapidly implemented, and we must highlight the extremely important role that the Council is playing at the moment. As well as a strategy, we have defined an open method of coordination which is so extensive that it covers everything from policies on the information society, science, education, training and combating poverty, to policies on business, innovation and economic reforms. At the same time, this coordination will also cover the revision of our schemes and systems for social protection, employment, and fundamental concerns about cohesion. We have defined an open method of coordination in all of these areas, with the opportunity to establish guidelines at European level, with indicators for benchmarking that are currently being selected, with national initiatives that can be compared and coordinated and with the ability, therefore, to bring about the convergence of economic and social policies at Union level, in an open form of coordination that represents a fundamentally innovative development in the functioning of the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">This coordination is also being supported by a strong desire for political leadership at the highest level with regard to economic and social reforms. Hence our decision to hold a European Council meeting every spring which, on the basis of a set of indicators of structural change that are chosen by the Commission and of a report by the Commission itself, the European Council can set the main priorities in the field of economic and social policy each year. The Council would thereby demonstrate the political leadership which is crucial to the work of all the other Council bodies and of the various committees.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">To this, of the events of the last six months, we can add the entry of Greece into the euro and the decision taken at the Feira European Council on the tax package. This is not a final decision. It is merely the beginning of the end but we have been waiting for this beginning of the end for twelve years. This was incomprehensible in a Europe that has been able to develop a single market and a single currency that already includes most of the Union’s Members, but which has, until now, lacked any understanding of taxation, which is an essential component of any political and economic system. </p>
<p class="contents">We want a Europe which is able to compete coherently, but also a Europe which is politically stronger and more united. In this respect, I should like to emphasise the extremely important steps that have been taken in order to give credibility to our common European security and defence policy. Interim political and security committees and the interim military committee are up and running. Military staff have been appointed. The preparatory work will enable a forces management conference to be held in October. Rules for coordination of the European Union and NATO have been defined, as have methods for consultation at institutional level with the six NATO countries of the European Union and with the group of fifteen countries that comprises all the candidates for membership of the Union. The reforms will enable us to implement the decisions taken in Helsinki, since they will be further backed by the creation of the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management, which has already taken up its duties. These reforms will also be accompanied by a set of programmes also run in line with the methods of Civilian Crisis Management that we hope to see established by the police officers at the Union’s disposal, with the aim of having 5 000 officers by 2003. We hope to be able to deploy a thousand officers within the space of a month.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The common European security and defence policy is therefore a pillar of credibility for our political union, which naturally includes the institutional reform that was on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. Over the last six months, the aim of the Council Presidency has been to work hard to ensure that the Conference’s work could be concluded before the end of the year, as this is essential for making the first round of enlargement possible. With this in mind, we focused particularly on a detailed report on the points arising from Amsterdam and we were able to include the issue of closer cooperation on the agenda. The Fifteen have finally reached consensus on this issue, something for which we have worked very hard and which we consider to be an extremely important condition for greater European integration within an enlarged but heterogeneous Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is clearly a fundamental debate on Europe’s future. The Presidency sought to focus the IGC’s work on guaranteeing its success in order to allow enlargement to take place, but, clearly, none of us can ignore this debate. This applies to those who can see – and I am now speaking strictly as a Portuguese citizen – that our institutional model must be improved, without being changed radically, as well as to those who may hope for a shift towards an intergovernmental approach by the European Union. Personally, I shall continue to fight against this with all my strength…</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">...but this also applies to those who feel that we need to take a new leap forwards in redefining the Union and to move directly towards European federalism. </p>
<p class="contents">We will always be receptive to this debate, but I would simply like to draw Parliament’s attention to one crucial aspect. No federal system in the world can be strictly political. No political federal power can forego a strong federal budget and strong federal competences.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, a vague, abstract discussion at institutional level, which does not fully weigh up the financial and tax-related consequences of this federal model, is, in our opinion, a meaningless discussion. We are fully prepared for this discussion, but every aspect of it must be considered, because this is the only way in which it will make sense. </p>
<p class="contents">For the moment, however, what the Council Presidency has tried to do with regard to institutional matters over the last six months is to concentrate on establishing the appropriate conditions for enlargement. The work on enlargement has moved at a great pace over these six months. We were able to close 78 dossiers for negotiation with the candidate countries and open 52 dossiers for negotiation, and it must be emphasised that, in order to open a dossier for negotiation, the Fifteen Member States must reach a common position on the issue. With all the countries of the Luxembourg Group, all dossiers for negotiation are currently open, with the exception of institutional and various other matters. Even where the countries of the Helsinki Group are concerned, a significant number of dossiers have already been opened and many others have been closed. At this point, I must stress the extremely important and dynamic role played by the Commission in speeding up the pace of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In our vision of the world, in which we want Europe to be the leading architect of a new design for international relations, which is more balanced and more equitable, the Union clearly needs to maintain a very lively and active set of external relations. This is what we have tried to achieve over the last six months in close cooperation with the Commission, and speaking of the Commission, I would like to welcome Vice-President Patten’s presence here. There were two totally new events: the EU-Africa Summit and the high level Summit with India, the most heavily populated democracy in the world, which is now enjoying normal relations with the European Union at the highest possible level. There was all the work that enabled us to close negotiations on renewing the Lomé Convention and on the agreements with Mexico and South Africa, the opening of negotiations with Mercosur and extremely hard work on the Euro-Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern fronts. There has been action on fronts related to Asian and Pacific countries, in the transatlantic relationship, in the relationship with Russia, with other countries of Central and Eastern Europe and even with Central Asia. There has been progress in approving a common strategy for the Mediterranean and an action plan for the Nordic dimension of the European Union, which, in my opinion, combine perfectly to address the problems of both Northern and Southern Europe. This demonstrates that our vision is not unilateral and is not aimed in any particular geographical direction, but is based on a genuinely universal vision.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this period, of course, there has been a constant source of concern: the Balkans. This concern was exacerbated when, at the start of our work, we had, in addition to the magnitude of the problems that we were facing, the bitter taste of knowing that the international community itself was “balkanised” in its dealings with the Balkans. I would here like to pay tribute to the excellent cooperation of the High Representative, Javier Solana, and the Vice-President of the Commission, Christopher Patten, who ensured that the European Union was not balkanised, but instead, acted in a coordinated and integrated way in the Balkans during this time. The Union also managed to join the Stability Pact, which finally saw the necessary funds raised to be able to support countries and maintain coherent action in a whole range of extraordinarily complex situations which I do not have time go into here.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that we have a great deal of work ahead of us. We know that we are facing enormous obstacles, starting with the fact that Serbia is not a democratic State. This is a fundamental problem, which makes any strategy for the Balkans extremely difficult to implement. We also know, however, that we, the European Union, have not been balkanised and we are now acting in an integrated way. I would also like to thank Parliament for its efforts in solving the problem of financial support for Montenegro, which we felt was essential, in order to send a very clear message to all those who are trying to establish democracy in that area. </p>
<p class="contents">We also mentioned the problem of the area of citizenship in developments under the third pillar, following the Tampere Summit, with regard to the strategy on drugs and the external dimension of the this pillar. These are extremely important issues, such as immigration, which is a fundamental pillar of the development of our external relations and the way we see our societies developing over the next few years. I must, however, stress the work that is in progress on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as this Charter is a milestone in the definition of European citizenship, citizenship which I would like us all to see in light of the values of the enlightenment. In other words, European citizenship should be seen in light of the values of political rationalism rather than some form of political populism, excessive nationalism, religious fundamentalism or demonstrations of xenophobia or racism. It is in this context that a sense of European citizenship has been perceived to emerge, and that is why we must forge ahead with the project for European civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Madam President, by wishing President Chirac, who I am sure will be present in Parliament tomorrow, and the French Government, every success in their work leading the European Council for the next six months. I hereby assure you of the total cooperation of the Portuguese Government from this moment onwards.</p>

I am sure that we all agreed with everything you said about his role as one of the architects of Europe and of democratic accountability in Europe. Can I also say that it is a privilege to follow that characteristically eloquent and politically perceptive speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Before saying a few words myself about the recent European Council in Feira which I attended with President Prodi, who is not with us this afternoon because he is attending a meeting in Paris with the new presidency, I would like, on behalf of all my colleagues in the Commission, to pay tribute to the hard work, skill and energy that the Portuguese government has devoted over the last six months to the presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This ensured the success not only of the Lisbon and Feira summits, but of the day-to-day work behind the scenes that is vital in carrying Europe towards its ambitious goals. I would just like to add that it was a great pleasure working with the team of Portuguese ministers, as well as an extremely rewarding experience. We recognise how many of them, like the secretary of state, worked at a spectacular rate which would certainly have got them the man-of-the-match award during a number of the 90-minute matches of the last few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council on 19 and 20 June was a very valuable meeting of important consolidation. The agenda was very broad and I simply want to focus on what seemed to the Commission to be some of the most important highlights. First the heads of state and government confirmed that Greece meets the necessary conditions to enter the third phase of economic and monetary union. Greece will join the euro zone from 1 January next year which I hope will send messages to one or two other countries, including the one I know best.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I notice that Mr Helmer is not here to join in the applause.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Second, the European Council took stock of the progress made in implementing the economic and social agenda adopted at Lisbon. The Council gave, as the Prime Minister said, renewed encouragement to the work that has already been begun, particularly on the e-Europe action plan, research and enterprise policy and the extremely important subject of social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In September the Commission will submit its proposals for indicators that will allow us to measure how well we are performing in meeting the goals set at Lisbon. These indicators can then be used as the basis for the synthesis report to the European Council in spring next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, some progress was achieved on completing the internal market. In particular Europe's energy markets are to be further liberalised and air transport will be made more efficient by creating what has come to be called a single European sky.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the Council welcomed the broad economic guidelines for 2000 and recommended their adoption by the Council. These guidelines reflect the need to sustain growth and to continue pursuing macro-economic policies that promote stability. The guidelines lay particular emphasis on the quality and sustainability of public finances and the need to continue reforming Europe's product, capital and labour markets. The Council restated its commitment to carrying through reforms that are essential to enable Europe to become a truly knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Feira meeting we were shocked, as you said Madam President, by the news of the tragic death of 58 illegal immigrants hidden in a truck in Dover. The European Council issued a strong condemnation of this traffic in human beings and the Council renewed its commitment to Europe-wide action against the criminals involved in such activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy at Dover underlines Europe's urgent need for a common immigration and asylum policy; a point that I notice much of the media –including in the country I know best – has been making. The Commission will be putting forward proposals on these matters before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Trafficking in human beings is a serious international crime that no one government can tackle single-handedly. There has to be a common European definition of the crime and vigorous cross-border cooperation to ensure that those who perpetrate it are caught and are punished. Our citizens expect no less than that, and we must live up to their expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens also expect swift and positive action on food safety, especially in the wake of last year's food scandals. The Commission has been working energetically in this area. The European Council expressed strong support for what we are doing. The Council committed itself to making progress on setting up an independent food-safety authority, as soon as Parliament has delivered its opinion. I am confident that this opinion will be given by the first October part-session at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">At Feira a last minute breakthrough was achieved on the tax package – a lot of midnight oil and quite a lot of breakfast went into that successful outcome. This complex agreement involves the directive on the taxation of savings. Before the directive is adopted, discussions will be held with the United States and key third countries, such as Switzerland, in which we hope to promote the adoption of equivalent measures internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile the coexistence model will continue, with European Union countries either exchanging information or levying a withholding tax themselves. The directive should be adopted by unanimity no later than 31 December 2002. Agreement on this, as honourable Members will recognise, was not easy, especially for Member States that have a strong tradition of banking secrecy. We welcome the positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In the areas for which I have some responsibility, there were also, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, some important developments at Feira. We took stock of the European Union's relations with Russia and the situation there, including in Chechnya, in the light of the recent EU-Russia Summit, which I think was regarded as fairly successful. It is too early to judge President Putin's economic programme; however, our basic message is that a sound programme will be vital to boost investor confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">On Chechnya, there have, it is true, been some recent <span class="italic">moderately</span> positive developments in response to international and European Union pressure: for example the recent ECHO mission was able to take place and western humanitarian agencies have greater access to the area. The conflict nevertheless continues and we still have considerable concerns. In particular, we want to see much greater access for humanitarian aid agencies. We want to see genuinely independent investigation into reports of human rights abuses, and we want to see a real dialogue between the Russian government and the Chechens.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the adoption of the common strategy on the Mediterranean. The presidency should take particular credit for driving that through. It will help our efforts to strengthen the Barcelona process. The Commission will be presenting proposals to reinvigorate the process later this month. The Mediterranean Strategy is global, covering all countries in the region and including the consolidation of peace in the Middle East. After years of conflict and tension in the Middle East, the time is clearly ripe for peace. We welcome the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. Our expert mission has returned from South Lebanon and we are considering what we can do to help rehabilitation in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">At Feira, Javier Solana and I presented a follow-up report outlining what had been achieved in the western Balkans since Lisbon. The Prime Minister again referred to the importance of that.</p>
<p class="contents">The key challenges for the month ahead will be continued support to Montenegro, the strengthening of the Serbian civil society and the Serbian media, support of the Kosovo elections and to UNMIK and support for regional integration. I was in Kosovo again last week for what was my fourth visit and I also visited the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on Friday. I saw once again the challenge we face, but also the impact that we can have when we work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to add a couple of points. First of all we were enormously grateful to the delegation from Parliament that went recently to Kosovo and was able to confirm that our team there is doing a good job and that there is not an absorption capacity problem as far as the assistance is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council and Parliament will support the proposals we have put forward for a new regulation to govern our financial assistance to the Balkans. If we want to speed things up, then it is important to speed up the consideration of things like our new financial regulation. I hope that we can also expect strong support for the proposals that we have put forward for asymmetric autonomous trade measures for the region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important if we want those countries to trade more together that we should give them greater access to our own market here. That would give them the best sort of assistance in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, I would like to say something briefly about the EU-India Summit. That summit was entirely a consequence of the initiative taken by the Portuguese presidency last autumn, although I know that there are many Members of this House like Mr Dupuis who have been active proponents of a closer dialogue with India for many years. We have sometimes, in the Union, underestimated the importance of India and underestimated the importance of developing our economic and political relationship with it. India is the greatest democracy in the world. At every election, more people vote than in the European Union, the United States and Canada put together. It is a democracy which shares many of our values and had a tradition of political tolerance when we still believed in the divine right of kings.</p>
<p class="contents">What we managed to achieve at the meeting last week in Lisbon was an important step forward. I hope that in the new year we will be able to start the round table meetings with representatives of civil society in India. I hope that we will be able to inaugurate the think-tank network with India and that will see a further development and strengthening of our relationship with that extraordinary and important country.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Feira Council crowned an extremely successful Portuguese presidency. Above all it laid the foundations for a number of important decisions which will have to be taken later this year at least. The Prime Minister mentioned some of the constitutional discussions that we have started to have in the European Union. I am tempted to follow him down some of those highways and byways. But perhaps I should leave that for the time being to my elders and betters, although I promise not to take a vow of <span class="italic">omertà</span> on the subject. Obviously we need to have some important political debates. The German Foreign Minister, albeit speaking in a personal capacity, made a speech which breached the dam and all sorts of remarks and arguments are now flooding through. I have always believed it is better in politics to talk about important things rather than sweep them under the carpet. I am sure we will be doing that in the next few months although it is important for us to concentrate on the real priorities for the IGC before Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish the Presidency of the French Republic every success in carrying the process forward. I very much hope that they will have as much success as the Portuguese Presidency. I am sure they will be as engaging to work with.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pacheco Pereira (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Prime Minister, I hope you understand, as a former Parliamentarian yourself, that in Parliament it is on political issues that we should focus our debate. There are at least two questions that I wish to ask you with regard to your speech. First of all, I was surprised to hear you criticise what you called ‘a shift towards an intergovernmental approach’, because, if one thing has occurred in the six months of the Portuguese Presidency, it is that the Council has actually become stronger at the expense of the Commission and Parliament. This was also clear from your words when you described the Employment Summit as ‘showing a strong desire for political leadership of the Union’, demonstrating that, in fact, you see this as leadership by the Council at the expense of the other two institutions. It is therefore worth tempering words and intentions with reality. </p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the most uncomfortable issue of the last six months, which I admit you would not really want to discuss here, that is, the Austrian question, we see the extent of the shift in recent months. There are aspects of the Austrian question that are very dangerous for the future of the Union. The impasse in which the Union found itself at the Feira Council shows exactly why this shift is so dangerous. First of all, it replaced the principle of collegiality in Union decisions with a greater emphasis on bilateral action between Governments. If anyone should never have acted as spokesperson for the Fourteen, it was you, as President of the European Union. You should never, under any circumstances, have acted as spokesperson, even if you felt that Portugal should agree to the sanctions against Austria. As a result of your action, the Austrian question has become a European Union issue. From the institutional point of view, this issue will clearly taint the European Union’s internal relations unless it is quickly resolved. We all know that in order not to lose face, the basis of a resolution has already been negotiated. This basis of a resolution, however, is a sign of weakness: weakness, essentially, on the part of the Fourteen countries that have taken a political initiative and do not know how to get out of it. In contemporary politics, the trend towards handing political decisions to experts and judges shows just how weak politicians are. These sanctions originated from a political measure and the same people who initiated them should have had the courage to take the decision to lift them. This should have been done at Feira. </p>
<p class="contents">As to the Intergovernmental Conference, unfortunately I do not have much speaking time left, but I must say that dangerous trends are being followed there too. I am not against closer cooperation, but it must be made quite clear that closer cooperation falls within the area of the Union’s sectoral policies and is not an institutional or political matter. Otherwise, at some point in the future, we will have two European Unions, a first- and a second-class Union. This situation would put an end to what has been the driving force of the European Union and the European Community since the Second World War. Closer cooperation must therefore not lead to a two-speed Europe. Instead, it must enable whoever wants to do so to move forward more quickly in terms of sectoral policies, but not in terms of the institutions, or else we will risk splitting the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to echo our President’s tribute to President Pfimlin, who, as well as being a predecessor of mine and a great friend, was the person who welcomed the Spanish and Portuguese MEPs when we arrived in this House, precisely because we had built a community of values in our countries of the type we are now trying to strengthen. I believe that this is an essential point because the Prime Minister of Portugal, over recent months, has indicated that he is firmly committed to defending these common values.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Guterres has paid Parliament a compliment by saying that relations with us have been good over this six-month term. I would like to return this compliment because, during my years of experience in this House, I had never known a Prime Minister to appear three times during a Presidency, but he has done just that. By showing this courtesy, the Portuguese Presidency has taken a significant step.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not just pleased that he has come here, but also that there have been two issues fundamental to this Parliament on which he has helped us positively and demonstrated his political sensitivity. I am referring to the Statute of MEPs, on which the Portuguese Presidency has continued the work started by the Finnish Presidency, and the Statute of the political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The high point of the Portuguese Presidency was undoubtedly the Lisbon Summit, and furthermore I am happy that Prime Minister Guterres has indicated this in speaking of the knowledge society, because I believe that this is the key to the European Union’s investment in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Lisbon Summit I would like to highlight the importance which my group attaches to the triangle of employment, social cohesion and competitiveness, which is absolutely essential to us, and which is already part, not only of the Portuguese Presidency’s plans, but also of our policies, and which has been strengthened in Feira.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the importance of the agreement which has been reached on taxation, because the European Union cannot make progress in the social field if the increasing discrepancy between employment incomes and capital incomes persists. In this respect we cannot invoke banking secrecy. If we are to progress in a serious and socially just way, it is very important that we take the step of dealing with all these incomes jointly, and, furthermore, I believe that this is a good first step in relation to the process of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental point is the progress in the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency began this, took it forward up until Feira and responded positively to the European Parliament’s suggestion to broaden the agenda, not only in relation to our requests but also to the Council’s compromises. I would like to point out firstly that, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, although it has still not been included, an important step has been made in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else, and in this regard I do not believe that President Guterres is going to criticise his Secretary of State. Last week, in different articles, I and the Secretary of State himself, both said that the method by which the convention was proceeding, that is to say, with the active participation of European and national parliaments, representatives of the governments and the Commission, is much better than Intergovernmental Conferences behind closed doors. I hope that Mr Seixas da Costa’s personal opinion can be endorsed by the out-going President of the Council, because I believe that would be very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to the debate on federalism and constitution, which fortunately has woken the issue of Europe from its lethargy, I would like to point out that it is not an academic or an <span class="italic">ex novo </span>debate, and that it must be held while respecting, and on the basis of, the current institutional balance. I agree with the challenge set by President Guterres when he said that we have to talk about federalism in all areas. Fine. The problem is that we have monetary federalism, but we still do not have economic federalism, when we need to defend the euro and defend it seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like to make a final observation in relation to an important decision taken by the Portuguese Presidency bilaterally with thirteen governments. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency was acting seriously and prudently when it proposed the decision of the fourteen countries. I must say that the European Parliament and the Commission have been on the same wavelength since February and the Portuguese Presidency cannot be criticised for defending our community of values in the face of a decision of a political party to form a government with another party whose ideology and beliefs are absolutely contrary to our common values. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency has shown signs of patience and perseverance and has defended our common values.</p>

The past six months have certainly seen some highly creditable work on the various aspects of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I mainly have in mind the activities carried out within the context of the IGC. The Liberals believe it is crucial for there to be further institutional reform before enlargement takes place. In particular, I would point out that qualified majority voting in the Council and Parliament’s codecision powers will have to be extended if we want the European Union to be more efficient, more democratic, more open and broader.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Liberals are also delighted that a solution has been found in the form of an agreement on the exchange of information concerning the taxation of income from savings. This could provide the impetus for better fiscal coordination within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is probably safe to say that the most outstanding achievements have been the decisions taken on the wider introduction of modern technology, the promotion of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce and the realisation of a knowledge-based society with a view to creating more job opportunities. The decision taken by the Council to develop a system of best practice for public administration is also to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As far as external relations are concerned, the Liberal Group welcomes the idea of a summit between the European Union and the most democratically advanced countries in the western Balkans. EU policy ought perhaps to be given a higher profile over there, in support of the ongoing stabilisation process.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are two comments I would like to make. As a Belgian national, I am delighted with the progress made in respect of food safety and that an undertaking has been given to set up a central food agency before the end of this year. As an MEP I have no intention of letting the matter of the uniform statute for MEPs drop. I hope we will be able to reach agreement on this during the forthcoming French Presidency. Indeed, we must. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as the results of the Feira summit are concerned, however, we are rather more sceptical. In recent weeks a debate has broken out between the governments of the Member States about the future of Europe, and even about having a constitution. In stark contrast to these competing visions, however, is the way in which preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference are shaping up. It even seems that the images of the distant future conjured up by a good many ministers are actually intended to conceal the European Council's inability to resolve the issues it has set itself. Since Maastricht this European Council has been putting off the problems, the unresolved questions and the necessary reforms. Many of these were already left unresolved in Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">The public's confidence in the EU has now reached an all-time low in all the Member States. In eastern Europe frustration is growing at the EU's hesitant attitude. The real initiatives – highlighted by Parliament in all of its resolutions for years – are in some cases not even being discussed in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference. The most important objective is surely to create and develop a European democracy and to eliminate the democratic deficit. In Feira we did not see a decision to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty, one of the decisions most eagerly anticipated by the people of Europe. An alternative approach to the Intergovernmental Conference, which this Parliament has repeatedly advocated, was not even mentioned. I think that, instead of making people want to enshrine the prevailing system in a future constitution, the European Council will have given everyone cause to consider the system's gross shortcomings, manifest in the current Intergovernmental Conference. A procedure for adopting a constitution has not been planned or launched; there is barely a definite notion of doing so. Questions remain about parliamentary and judicial control in the second and third pillars, as they do about the status of European parties and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither are there any tangible plans for meeting the second challenge, to create a social dimension to European integration. I believe that all of this has serious consequences for the degree of acceptance of the EU by those on the inside and also for the expectations which the eastern European countries have of us. We still have a few more months, but the work will have to pick up speed and increase in gravity and depth at a much greater rate than we have seen so far! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was even repetitive where certain fundamental policies are concerned and made no changes to weightier issues. It was a disappointment for that very reason. Predictably, the main themes, ranging from enlargement to the CIG, via the Charter of Fundamental Rights, were largely put off for the Nice Summit. This is certainly why it became necessary to come up with a last-minute agreement on timetabling the tax package which, in the end and in essence, is restricted to waiting for another agreement a few years off, which will still be dependent on its unlikely acceptance by third countries, which are precisely today’s tax havens. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not surprising that this virtual agreement should have been particularly warmly welcomed by those who have never been keen on a greater balance between legislation on capital and labour and who have always opposed mounting any joint action against these tax havens for tax evasion, fraud or the movement of large sums of money. On the contrary and in the name of the completion of the internal market and the follow up to the Lisbon Special Summit, we have seen new pressures for speeding up the process of liberalisation and deregulation of the labour market. When the broad economic policy guidelines for 2000 were approved it was accepted that constraints resulting from the Stability Pact would have to be strengthened and provided for, which suggests that there will be further and greater problems, particularly in the social domain. The reasons for the large demonstration organised by the trade union movement at the Feira Summit are therefore understandable and the fact that tens of thousands of people took part in this demonstration definitely made it one of the most striking features of the Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also grounds for concern in another area, however. I am referring to the revision of the Treaties. Almost the entire task has been left to the French Presidency and the most important aspect in this area has already moved beyond the normal institutional framework, into bilateral summits and various conferences and statements. Nevertheless, in this area, we cannot let pass without comment the fact that the Feira Summit did not only fail to include the revision on the agenda but that it spoke about ‘a form of closer cooperation’ in the singular. We already had deep-felt concerns about what has up until now been known as ‘closer cooperation’, given its profound and unmistakable connotations of the creation of a hard core, a vanguard or a pioneer group. This would therefore mean a multi-speed Europe, headed by a political cabinet. The adoption of this new wording, because it is undoubtedly much more indicative of such ideas, increases these doubts and makes us extremely apprehensive as to the kind of European construction which some people are advocating. The worst thing is that other people seem to be distracted… </p>
<p class="contents">I reserve a final word of disapproval for the obvious trend towards the militarisation of the European Union. Proof of this is the fact that we are developing our own military capabilities, clearly in tandem with NATO. We still think that the OSCE is still the most appropriate framework for developing the European Union’s security system. We also take the view that the prevention of crises and civilian crisis management should prevail over any interventionist action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is evidence that we are united on the path of cooperation and that we do not take the imperial route of some countries dominating others. In addition to this, it works well, as the Portuguese Presidency has clearly demonstrated. The fact that the Portuguese Presidency was a success and that comments on it have been universally positive confirms and reinforces the truth of this situation and our belief in it. As a Portuguese citizen, a non-federalist and a European, I can only be delighted, in spite of our political differences. Those who wish to see the Union’s system of a rotating presidency changed are wrong. It is not true that only the large and powerful countries can preside over the Union. The presidency can and must be divided between Member States, since this is symbolic of the fact that we share a common path. </p>
<p class="contents">If there is one negative side to this six-month term, it is the Austrian question. The Portuguese Presidency alone cannot be blamed for the mistake, as I have to call it. It was a mistake committed by everyone, when they pushed the ‘Fourteen’ – and what is this ‘Fourteen’ anyway? – to excess and into an impasse. In the European Parliament alone, 406 Members supported this disastrous move. We cannot develop a short memory once we realise our mistake. Austria held elections and will continue to do so. Free elections. They did nothing that constitutes a violation of the Treaties and their guarantees. The real issue is the violation of fundamental principles with regard to a Member State, which sets a dangerous precedent of arrogance or tyranny. It has never been clear why the Presidency of the Union became involved in a course of action that was supposed to fall under the terms of bilateral relations. </p>
<p class="contents">Today there is growing embarrassment. Everyone is wandering around with a torch, looking for a graceful way out. There will certainly be a way out, but I doubt that it will be a graceful one. It is now the responsibility of the French Presidency to find it. It has always been said that the French authorities were largely responsible for the mistake that was made, so it is therefore appropriate that they should now resolve the problem. </p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Presidency attempted to bring some basic realism back to certain fundamental issues. With regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the presidency made its position clear at the Feira Summit, keeping strictly to the terms of the mandate granted to it by the Cologne European Council. It is amazing, hearing some of the ideas that are being bandied around, how far some people wish to force us to go beyond the limited suggestion made in Cologne. We shall see! </p>
<p class="contents">As to the IGC, the signs given at the start of the French Presidency are, in contrast, quite worrying. We are all aware of the differences of opinion and the difficulties that already existed. Given such a situation, how are we to interpret the French Presidency’s recent initiative to go to Berlin and announce a completely different agenda for the future of the Union? Jacques Chirac’s speech to the Bundestag was ill-judged and ill-timed. It showed a lack of vision and a lack of respect, from what one can see. It served only to create distrust in an atmosphere that is already very sensitive. This type of speech is not pro-European, and in fact, is clearly anti. The authors, from the French UDF, of a recently published draft European constitution, made it quite clear: any Member State failing to comply with the constitution would lose its place in the Union and be reduced to the status of a mere partner. What kind of madness is this? Where is the sense in such a contradiction? </p>
<p class="contents">A final word: the French Presidency has the responsibility of not ruining what the Portuguese Presidency has managed to achieve through basic realism. Any idea of a pioneer group does not correspond to the idea of European cooperation that unites us. This obsession with hard cores or pioneer groups will only serve to create a perverse dialectic and an increasing and divisive tension between the countries who see themselves as leaders and those who do not want to be led and will not accept this. This is not the Europe to which we belong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to offer the Portuguese Presidency my sincere congratulations on having successfully managed this initiative, which is very important, in my opinion, even if the press itself has not yet realised this. It is important because, as Mr Patten said, India is a democracy, the largest in the world, and it is a country located at the heart of Asia, at the very heart of an Asia which, at the start of this new millennium, I think represents the greatest danger of the next century, much more so than the issues we have been discussing already today, like Austria, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">We must tackle the issue of China. China is as close to us now as were the totalitarian regimes before the Second World War. Yet we pretend not to notice, we continue to deal with China on a priority basis. We should be putting all the weight we possibly can behind India and attempting to make China see that Chinese citizens truly deserve to have democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the shift to an intergovernmental form of administration is evident, Mr Guterres, and that it is not solely dependent on the personality of the Commission President, Mr Prodi. I believe that Parliament too must take considerable responsibility for having undermined this body that is central to European construction, but I think that the Council is continuing to exacerbate the sideways shift and that we must, as a matter of urgency, change course and put the Commission back at the centre of the Community’s construction.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that in terms of foreign policy – you also spoke of defence policy – we are making no progress towards Community construction. Absolutely everything is based on an intergovernmental approach. We have not managed to grasp just what is our scope for input to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We cannot ask Mr Solana questions. We do not know what matters he is dealing with. As the European Parliament, we do not have any scope to intervene. We do not know what tasks you, the Council, have given him.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the fact that relations are not more acrimonious than they are and that there is still a degree of politeness and some superficial agreement is due only to the two personalities holding the key foreign policy positions, Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana. I think that if anyone else were involved, the balance between the institutions would already have been upset. I believe that in the course of this intergovernmental conference we cannot avoid starting to plan and set ourselves an agenda for the reform of the European Union providing for gradual communitisation of the common foreign and security policy. It is just not possible for us to go on exacerbating the sideways shift in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot envisage any sort of foreign policy which is not, in the medium term, managed directly by the Commission, or by a Commission Vice-President. Similarly, I think it would be dangerous to disregard the question of how each country is represented within the Commission, even if a good number of my fellow Members are experiencing some amnesia on the subject in plenary. I think it would be premature, and I think that Portugal cannot be unaware of this issue, to reduce the number of Commissioners to less than the number of Member States. I think the only condition which could possibly allow us to make this leap forward and rid the Commission of its ‘national’ status, involves electing the President of the Commission by universal suffrage.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the countries which are not large – to avoid describing them as something else – should weigh up this proposal carefully. I hope that Portugal is concerned about it – but I know that other Member States, Belgium, Luxembourg and others too, are talking about it – as I think it is an urgent matter and that it would be much more important to start to tackle the question of the ‘check and balance’ system operating between our institutions than to engage in sideways shifts that are liable to freeze any further progress and put it on hold by discussing constitutions or Charters of Fundamental Rights, without even having any legal basis for this charter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The precedence of EU law may be dated back to the judgements given in 1962 and 1964. The right of veto in accordance with the Luxembourg Compromise prevailed from 1966 to 1986. The changeover to majority voting may be dated back to the Council of Ministers’ new rules of procedure from July 1987 and the Single European Act’s majority provisions for the internal market. The possibility of closer cooperation was introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, but unanimity is required, and that possibility has never been made use of, except in areas where there was already unanimity, for example in connection with EMU and cooperation under the Schengen Agreement. With the Feira Summit, the EU’s Member States acknowledged for the first time that closer cooperation could take place without the agreement of every country. Feira put the issue on the Intergovernmental Conference’s agenda. It is too early to say whether the outcome will be a general clause or whether earmarking will be introduced, but the initial breakthrough has occurred, and the principle of equality between countries has in that way been abandoned. From now on, Germany and France can set the pace, even if Great Britain and other Euro-sceptic countries wish to see cooperation take a different direction. Formally, changes to the Treaties will still require unanimity but, in reality, it will soon be possible to increase cooperation without waiting for the stragglers. Those who want to see further integration have good reason for congratulating the Portuguese Presidency, but for those of us who want to see more democracy and equality between the countries of the Union, the Feira Summit is no cause for celebration. I also believe that the sanctions against Austria ought to be lifted, and preferably sooner rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, there will be results on one or two further fronts thanks to the indisputably conscientious and ambitious work done there. Inevitably it was an intermediate and preparatory summit which did not deliver satisfactory results on fundamental issues and it was therefore disappointing, and above all not very spectacular, apart from the only item not on the agenda – that is, Austria – and it was therefore also a rather thankless task for the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">But what it really will be remembered for is a missed opportunity to return to normal relations within the Community. Neither in Feira nor in the ensuing days did the presidency succeed – against the wishes of the majority of Parliament – in smoothing the way back to normality. The further humiliation of Austria was at the very least tolerated. This will be the enduring image of Feira. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That may be true, Prime Minister Guterres, for the routine tasks. The image people have of the Portuguese Presidency will not, however, be determined by whether or not routine tasks have been completed, but by two events: firstly, by the fact that as President-in-Office of the Council you have had a hand in imposing the sanctions on Austria, and secondly, by the complete lack of progress in the Intergovernmental Conference. Why does this matter? Posterity's opinion of us as a generation of European politicians will not be determined by the successes which you listed; it will be determined by whether we succeed in carrying out the historical duty of our time in the Union, which is enlargement towards the east, the reunification of Europe after a century of European civil wars.</p>
<p class="contents">To make this possible we need to reform ourselves in the Intergovernmental Conference, and no progress has been made here at all so far. This must be noted. There is no doubt that this is a difficult business. The candidate countries themselves are having to make their contribution; we must of course be ready for enlargement and we cannot make enlargement conditional on the success of the Intergovernmental Conference. After all, it would be disastrous if our lack of ability to reform became a yardstick by which enlargement was judged. That is why we need to put more effort into making progress here. The fact that, for example, the French President has made a proposal to draft a European constitution enshrining the division of responsibilities is a major step forward, because dividing up responsibilities would create the confidence necessary for more majority voting in the Council, which is one of the most important preconditions for its ability to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The example of Austria is harmful because you are painting a picture of a European Union which interferes in the internal affairs of a country. This is not the kind of European Union which the people of Europe want; neither is it what the candidate countries want. It is regrettable that this has happened under your presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am doing so for other reasons, as I have already said here over these six months, but above all, because I feel that this Presidency has made three important marks. Firstly, it has adopted a new political stance. Secondly, it has made a commitment to building a Europe with a social conscience, which provides a practical response to the problems of European citizens, and thirdly, it has established a new dialogue, based on the universal European values that have been asserted and developed over these six months. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the new political stance in its relations with Parliament, which my colleague Mr Barón Crespo has already mentioned. I would like to contribute a further example, of which there can never be too many. This concerns the number of subjects that were opened up to codecision and then closed during the six months of this Portuguese Presidency. Above all, there is the respect with which the Portuguese Presidency always treated this Parliament, which will certainly have contributed to future presidencies adopting a new stance in their relations with Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the Portuguese Presidency’s assertion of civil values and respect for human dignity. Here I must return to the Austrian question, Prime Minister, to ask you and to ask myself what would be the attitude of many of those who are today criticising the Portuguese Presidency for having had the courage and the determination to condemn a xenophobic and fundamentalist agenda if the Fourteen Member States and the Presidency itself had remained silent? We prefer to praise the Portuguese Presidency for its courage, determination and boldness, although others might prefer to highlight its silence, perhaps even its cowardice. We think that this was an important statement to make, not just within the Union, but beyond it as well. It has clearly been understood, because when the Austrian Government announced its programme, it put considerable emphasis on the protection of human rights and, above all, on its acceptance of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to focus on other political issues related to the second mark made by the Portuguese Presidency, this Europe with a social conscience that I mentioned, which has earned the praise of many people, in particular the Secretary-General of the European Trade Union Conference, which also held a demonstration in Oporto. The Secretary-General highlighted quite clearly, however, what the presidency was able to achieve by discussing issues such as full employment, the social agenda, a society that remains true to the values of the European social model and that is based on knowledge and information. These points are, today, at the centre of the European Union’s political agenda and will never again be relegated to being second- or third-class issues or merely the responsibility of the Member States. This debate continues to raise questions: why are many of those who criticised this Council three months ago for not having reached – in their opinion – substantial conclusions, today criticising the presidency for placing too great an emphasis on the intergovernmental approach precisely because these conclusions have been successful? </p>
<p class="contents">The third and final mark made by the Portuguese Presidency is that it has asserted Europe’s new position in the world. You have already talked about this, Prime Minister, in relation to Mexico, South Africa and the EU-India Summit. The same applies to the EU-Africa Summit, which we feel was a key point, a turning point leading to the creation of a new, necessary relationship between the European Union and Africa. The European Union cannot continue to be hypocritical in its treatment of Africa and the Summit was a major step in this new approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, these three marks mean that that you are drawing a conclusion here and confirming a desire. Your conclusion is that European ambition is not the heritage of large countries alone. The conclusion is that the desire and commitment shown for constructing and proving allegiance to the project by its founders are also the heritage of those who, even in remote and even small areas in territorial terms also have ambition and take pride in being Portuguese and, at the same time, European. The desire is that the reasons we have today to feel proud will not end or die out with the Portuguese Presidency. They must remain alive so that we can continue, as a Member State, to develop this project and confirm these values and a culture which is our own, which deserves our respect and above all, which is worthy of our every effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the other side of the coin is the outcome of the Feira summit, and in my view the results for all fifteen Member States were more than disappointing.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to make three points. Firstly, the Presidency Conclusions say of the Intergovernmental Conference that significant headway is being made. I have to say that I find this difficult to understand because really everyone knows that in fact the Conference is not making any progress at all. Since then, additional ministerial meetings have been arranged and today the German press reported that in French Government circles even a failure is not being ruled out in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, many action groups and non-governmental organisations, but also a majority of the European Parliament and national parliaments, are calling for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated in the Treaties. But no mention was made of this in Feira. There was no clear affirmative answer as to whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be legally binding, and I should like to agree with my colleague, Mr Voggenhuber, from the Greens that this is not the way to counter scepticism about Europe in our countries. The public do not want yet another grandiose-sounding piece of paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, it was not until paragraph 50 that the Heads of State and Government expressed their shock at the tragic deaths of the 58 refugees in Dover. I, Mr President-in-Office, am shocked that it did not occur to the Council to do anything more in response to this terrible tragedy than to step up the fight against so-called illegal immigrant smuggling. No thought was given to making even the slightest adjustment to the EU's policy of a European shield with its sometimes fatal consequences for people in need. But in my view this is precisely what is urgently required to prevent tragedies such as the one in Dover from being repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need most of all is a return to international standards of refugee law and application in full of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. Drastic policy changes are required here precisely so that we do not continue to encourage those who make money out of trafficking in human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to taking stock, I am bound to say that although there has been a great deal of rumination over the past few months, all this brainwork has produced little in the way of tangible results.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I would cite the postponement of the decision on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Its status was originally to be clarified during the Portuguese presidency, but nothing came of it. No doubt a decision will be rushed through during the French presidency. This will make it impossible for sound democratic control to be exercised.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The decision making in the field of the CESDP also demonstrates the lack of unanimity amongst the Member States. It may be true that a number of interim committees have been set up and it has been determined how often negotiations should be undertaken with third countries, but the objective of the whole operation is still vague to this day. It will not be established until the Member States make known, during the capabilities conference this coming autumn, what it is they actually want to contribute to this risky European project. A strange order in which to do things. As a rule, we think about objectives and requirements before we look for the ways and means.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The ambiguity of Europe’s intentions is even more apparent in Annex 2 to the presidency’s conclusions on relations between the European Union and NATO. It says on the one hand that the autonomy of Community decision making must be taken into account, yet at the same time, the spirit of the EU-NATO partnership is lauded to the skies.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In short, after all these years, Europe still does not know what it wants. Therefore, as far as I can see, there is also little point in extending the Union with all manner of interesting institutions. The Portuguese Presidency has shown yet again that it is high time the tasks and competences of Europe and the national Member States were given clear definition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A so-called Community of values cannot end at Lake Constance. The work of the presidency will surely only be credible if the values which are to be defended are binding on all the Member States of the EU and are not employed arbitrarily and on demand as political propaganda by individual politicians against a democratically-elected government of an EU Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of his lasting legacies is an understanding of the continuing need of the strength of the three political institutions of the EU and for mutual respect between them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perhaps inevitable as we are discussing the ending of the Portuguese Presidency that, with the recent speeches in Berlin, the memory is going to focus more on the second half of the IGC than the first, but I would like at this stage to record my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency for their assiduousness in consulting the Parliament both here in the plenary and in the Constitutional Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin speeches by Foreign Minister Fischer, visionary and controversial, by President Chirac, controversial but not visionary, and by Prime Minister Blair, neither visionary nor controversial, which threaten to overshadow the memory of the Portuguese Presidency, leave certain questions in the mind which the Portuguese Presidency can still help us with.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I understand that Prime Minister Jospin has said that he would rather see no agreement in December in Nice than an unsatisfactory institutional reform. Could the Portuguese Presidency confirm that sufficient work has been done to ensure that agreement can be reached in December?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on enlargement, could he confirm that there is still the political will in the Council so that candidate countries, this House and the public of Europe can expect to hear target dates announced for the first wave of accession? This is something that the Commission and many in this House would like to see.</p>
<p class="contents">My last question on close cooperation would include Commissioner Patten, if he is able to demonstrate that he has not imposed a vow of silence. Is it the case that the Council still attaches importance to the democratic interplay between the three institutions and that closer cooperation will not inevitably mean greater decision making by one institution, by the Council, to the detriment of Parliament and Commission and, by implication, the people of Europe?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I only hope that the French Presidency will follow in its footsteps.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is at the most crucial crossroads in its history. The Helsinki resolution on major enlargement raises the existential question of the institutional structure needed in order for the European Union to function with 28 Member States. And it is certainly not the present structure.</p>
<p class="contents">I subscribe fully to Mr Seguro’s well-placed comments on the multiple successes of the Portuguese Presidency. However, apart from the question of closer cooperation, nothing was added to the Feira agenda, which was limited to the Amsterdam leftovers. This attitude on the part of the leaders of Europe causes a problem for the following reason: the purpose of this intergovernmental conference was supposedly to lay down the institutional requirements for enlargement. However, surely these institutional requirements include safeguarding the credibility of the European Union. And how can this credibility be safeguarded without a Charter of Fundamental Rights, without a radical legal response to the undemocratic conduct of certain countries, without a common foreign policy and defence policy and without turning the Treaties into a kind of constitution?.</p>
<p class="contents">If no progress is made before Nice, this state of affairs will raise a huge dilemma for the European Parliament when it comes to approving enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments to make on this. First, we perceive the power to approve or reject enlargement granted to us by the Treaties as an historic responsibility, not as the power to impose our views. Secondly, if our decision to approve or reject enlargement is to be historically responsible, it must be made on the basis of whether or not we consider that adequate institutional changes have been made in order for the European Parliament to welcome 10 or 11 new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly before Feira, and this was no coincidence, an extra-institutional dialogue was instigated by the Foreign Ministers of France and Germany. An extremely interesting dialogue, with new ideas which, overall, strengthened the European vision, irrespective of whether you agree or disagree with it. But, nonetheless, a dialogue which refutes the current logic on which the Intergovernmental Conference functions and, at the end of the day, a dialogue between France and Germany. But did this extra-institutional dialogue perhaps affect the wording of the Feira resolutions? Is that perhaps why the conclusions on institutional matters were so brief? Perhaps Feira, in conjunction with the Franco-German dialogue, means that the Intergovernmental Conference was bypassed before it even finished. I hope not.</p>
<p class="contents">What stands out with Feira is that it limited itself to just one addition to the agenda: closer cooperation, which is therefore registered as an urgent and crucial issue. On that, I have this comment to make: I think that it is important for the future of the European Union that we debate the problems and I think it is right to protect it from the risk of being brought to a standstill by the current veto. I also think, however, that the institutional unity of the European Union needs to be protected. Mr Brok and I stressed this several times at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have one question: have we indeed made clear to the candidate countries that the debate on closer cooperation mainly applies to them at the moment and that we are in a hurry to complete the arrangements before new partners join the European Union? The central tenet of the Franco-German dialogue is clear: we need a two-speed Europe. I think that Feira will go down in the history books not so much for what it said but mainly for what it did not say on institutional issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The future of Europe depends on two major issues: democracy and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy: the Intergovernmental Conference does not appear to resolve the issue of the alleged democratic deficit, and so-called closer cooperation on its own will not suffice. Greater democracy means guaranteeing full authority to adopt legislation and initiatives to the peoples’ elected representatives. It means independence for Europe from the United States and therefore greater autonomy for NATO. Greater democracy means political control of the economy and its institutions, starting with the Central Bank, and not the reverse.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment: the e-Europe action plan may serve to prepare the citizens to become Internet shoppers but it will certainly not create jobs. Employment policy is short-sighted and biased towards the market.</p>
<p class="contents">A completely absurd ideological process is currently developing in which the State is replaced by the market, and it is absolutely clear to us Communists that the Union must change direction completely.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolutions on the European Security and Defence Policy and the new rules governing collaboration between the Union and ΝΑΤΟ are highly positive, even if certain aspects of future developments are still somewhat obscure. The Portuguese Presidency referred to federalism and to future issues in general, but without, for example, raising the matter of own resources and without a spectacular increase in own resources, enlargement will become practically impossible and politically painful.</p>
<p class="contents">Mentioning closer cooperation as the Union's main means of progress gives the impression that we are preparing, formally, for a two-speed Europe. Only if this cooperation is confined to certain sectors will it remain the driving force behind the Union. We were delighted with the confirmation of Greece's accession to the euro zone and if this presages the accession of all those who are still outside the euro zone, then so much the better. In essence, as far as employment, competition and environmental and public health policies are concerned, the Lisbon Summit made minor concessions to the citizens of Europe, but not enough to meet their real needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Feira Council neither surprised nor disappointed us. However, we must concede that, institutionally, the Union is in a rut. At the same time, certain parties responsible for European policy are voicing various ideas in the press which the citizens of Europe can follow, but without the opportunity to take part in any debate. Europe will be complete once we are all involved, including those who want no part in it. And it must be a Europe which gives hope to all its citizens, whose fundamental rights will, we trust, be incorporated in the new Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am consequently obliged to confine myself to a few brief and far from comprehensive comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal, quite rightly, focussed the European debate on growth and employment. If we are to gain the full benefit of the internal market, we must, in my opinion, intensify the economic aspects of the European Union. I am not referring to an economic government. Such a term only leads to confusion, and indeed who would wish to be governed solely by a government of Finance Ministers? Europe does, however, need more effective coordination of national economic policies, given also that we now have an independent single monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not that we Socialists wish to see a policy of economic coordination against the central bank, but we do wish to see constructive dialogue between the decision makers in monetary policy and the decision makers in national economic policy, with each party, obviously, having to retain its own autonomy of action and decision making. This essential coordination is aimed at maximising the advantages to the Community of a common economic policy action. A few simple rules must be set within the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, but more especially within the Euro-11, requiring every Finance Minister to justify to his fellows the broad outlines of his draft budget or tax reform or any other national action likely to affect the European Union as a whole. This sort of coordination between national economic policies, which I would term ‘discretionary’, would make it possible to gradually direct national schemes towards jointly defined objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the internal market also necessitates new regulations in order to guarantee workers’ rights in the event of business mergers or buyouts, in order to avoid relocations for reasons of fiscal or social dumping and in order to guarantee basic public services for all sectors of the population, especially the most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major priority, as Portugal understood, is to strengthen the social rights of European citizens. A more open and more flexible economy requires new guarantees of security for workers, for example, the right to lifelong training. Any request for increased mobility or adaptability should necessarily be matched by seamless social cover throughout the territory of the European Union, as regards the transferability of pension rights, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialists expect the upcoming French Presidency to ensure that the draft social agenda makes rapid progress and is substantial in content.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal has helped e-Europe to make progress. At the moment, information and communication technologies are crowned with all the virtues. The possibilities are apparently endless – communication without frontiers, democratic access to information, trade and communication – but the dream quickly comes up against the realities of the sociological and economic world. The phenomenal development of the Internet within our societies must not blind us to the fact that there is a digital divide and that the gap between info-rich and info-poor is increasing in developed countries and, more especially, in the third world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would have so many more things to say but, unfortunately, my speaking time is running out: 240 seconds is really not very much at all. I should like to emphasise that Portugal and President Guterres’ entire team have deserved well of the European Union and that France now has the opportunity to prove that even a large country can complete a successful presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Early on, I, together with various organisations, approached each new presidency with an explicit demand for a Council programme for SMEs. We were always rewarded with fine pronouncements but rarely with deeds. Now the Council, under Portuguese Presidency, has come up with a charter. I am pleased about that but, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I want you, with your last breath as President, to guarantee me the following.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, that the implementation of the charter is and remains a matter for the Council itself. Education and training are matters for subsidiarity, a message your Council never tires of drumming into Parliament. As I see it, looking after fledgling firms has never been one of Europe’s tasks, whereas the general climate is, as is keeping complex legislation to a minimum. But making European legislation correspond with national legislation for example, including the legal hotchpotch that usually results, that is your concern.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Benchmarking is all well and good but a European Union that bases its entire policy on such a fad is suffering from a dearth of policy. Follow the example of the United States for once.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Lifelong learning is the responsibility of the Member States. And woe betide you if you fail to get this off the ground quickly given current demographic trends. On-line access for companies. You must ensure that companies in your own country enter the digital age, including the section of the business community that still do not have computers on their premises.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The internal market and gaining access to it, that is the stuff that European issues are made of. But it is for Member States to ensure that they have sufficient easily accessible complaint procedures. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, more often than not it is the Member States themselves that institute measures which impede the market. This is a scandal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Take for example the difficulties that contractors encounter if they want to work over the border. Parliament intends to keep a critical eye on the Council when it comes to the implementation of the charter in the Member States. We are holding you to your word and want to see the deed that follows the word. All that remains is for me to convey to you my best wishes for our former colleague Mr Cravinho, who I hear is seriously ill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

India – and Commissioner Patten made this point – whose importance is often underestimated, has finally received the recognition which, in the light of its economic and political dynamism, it deserves. In the end the time was not wasted in exchanging pleasantries. It was possible to sign real agreements. It is not only for us, the EU, as India's largest trading partner, that it is important for further protectionist barriers to be dismantled and for liberalisation to be able to continue. The response to the reform process is significant additional investment from Europe. In mid-April our SAARC Delegation – of which I am Vice-Chairman – was able to see very clearly for itself in Delhi how much progress has already been made in restructuring the economy. In the new economy – information technology, for example – we are once again the most important partner. But we will only be able to take advantage of these well-trained technicians and qualified employees if the idea – which has not been thought through – of having a system of green cards is finally dismissed. A green card with a time limit will not work at all. We need cooperation between European and Indian companies. Employees can then be posted anywhere and they will have clear contracts which are valid throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">At the summit, think tanks, contacts with NGOs and new networks were discussed. We have shared values. All the more important then are the respect for human rights, ethnic minorities and dissidents and the abolition of child labour. This is in no way a uniquely western way of thinking; these values are at the root of a shared democratic consciousness. The fight against unemployment and exclusion needs to be fought with the same intensity as the fight against terrorism and crime, and this was agreed by both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope now that the meeting of political and economic leaders will be the first page in a new book in which young people from universities, schools and businesses will also play their part. So Mr President, let us support exchange programmes so that people can meet one another, understand one another's way of thinking and in the future work alongside one another! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, I would like to focus on what passes for a decision on the taxation package. I see from the conclusions that the European Council has approved an ECOFIN report, the statement in the Council minutes and the agreement and principles of the fiscal package itself. That is quite a mouthful but there is still a lack of substance as far as I can see, and I am convinced we are being short-changed. I have the feeling that every pertinent question goes unanswered and that, unfortunately, this does nothing for Europe’s credibility. After all, the people will not even know after this European Council whether there is actually to be a European system governing income from savings, or whether it will be put on the back burner so as to be rid of this annoying dossier. It may well be that a timeframe has been agreed, but each stage is absolutely beset with conditions. Nor do people know if banking secrecy is to be abolished, or whether any progress will be made in the implementation of the other elements of the fiscal package.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, knowing as I do that the Council presidency has gone to enormous lengths to make something of the aforementioned fiscal package, I would appreciate it if the President-in-Office of the Council could respond to two questions that I have. Firstly, is the taxation of savings merely to be postponed or is there a chance of it actually being abandoned? Secondly, would you not agree that as long as the unanimity ruling applies to fiscal decision making, it will be impossible to make the internal market a reality where the tax system is concerned? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish above all that you had not had to take the blame for a policy possibly cooked up for you by others. The longer this policy remains on the boil the more indigestible it is, not only for my country but also for the whole European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, you cannot help but notice a certain contradiction in the fact that these measures were intended to be entirely political and were also taken at political level and yet to find a way out of this blind alley – which is entirely desirable and in everyone's interests – a solution is now having to be sought by means of a legal instrument. It was not least for this reason – since these measures are of course devoid of any legal base – that Parliament's President, Nicole Fontaine, pointed out at the beginning of the Feira summit that the European Parliament had adopted a resolution on 15 June calling on the Council to analyse relations between Austria and the other 14 Member States, and to draw up with all the parties concerned a procedure which would enable a solution to be found which would be acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">This procedure seems to have been established: the President of the European Court of Human Rights has been appointed and he in turn will nominate three wise persons who will report on Austria. In this context I must say that it is regrettable that no timetable was drawn up here. That would have made the exercise easier. It is very regrettable that even before this forum starts work its conclusions are already being prejudged by the future President and the work of the forum is coming under pressure because people are acting as though it were politically irrelevant.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only hope that people accept the political relevance of this report from this legal institution and that a golden goal will be scored here under the French Presidency, namely an early end to the sanctions against my country! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Feira a clear delimitation of responsibilities between European level and the level of the Member States was not discussed; the lifting of the absurd sanctions against Austria was not discussed, and neither was a really workable compromise on the taxation of savings interest discussed. The conclusion reached postpones the problem for 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, issues were debated which at the present time do not belong on the European agenda. With how many countries should we actually begin further negotiations? We must at long last develop phased procedures to govern cooperation between the European Union and countries in central, eastern and southern Europe, which meet the needs of both parties including where these stop short of full membership. What is the position on compliance with the convergence criteria when admitting further states to the euro? Sustainable stability must be proved by all countries which want to join the euro zone, but also by those which are already in it. Only in this way will it be possible to boost the strength of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need closer cooperation on the social dialogue – that goes beyond the powers of the European Union! We do not need more centralist regulation in this field; if we really want to unleash the forces of growth in the EU we need more competition between the individual national social security systems. Only the results in the field of security and defence policy are to be welcomed. Here Europe needs to act; here we need more Europe. That is what the people of the EU rightly expect of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon you as a matter of urgency to put an end at long last to the sanctions against Austria – and we do not need a report from the Court of Human Rights to do this either, as the media is in any case monitoring the situation on a daily basis – and to concentrate your efforts on the real European issues! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Summit again pointed to the importance of rapid enlargement, yet the candidate States are still looking to the EU to adopt positions from which it is ready to negotiate. </p>
<p class="contents">We must be more vigorous about the process of European integration and must not begin to be in two minds about it. The candidate States must not be required to wait for an unreasonable length of time. A new political will is required that will produce more tangible results than Feira did. At the same time, it is a question of being clear about <span class="italic">how</span> the institutional questions of enlargement towards the east, qualified majority voting and the numbers of commissioners and MEPs are to be solved. The EU must be able to operate effectively following enlargement, too. At the same time, issues internal to the EU must not delay the enlargement process. The processes must therefore run parallel. </p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement, there also comes the demand for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. There should be no getting away from the fact that constitutional conditions are to apply. There is nothing controversial about that. However, the EU Charter puts the EU’s development in a new perspective. We must show what kind of EU we want. Is it to be one which offers new opportunities and which is more competitive, innovative and entrepreneurial, with more small and medium-sized businesses? Or do we prefer more publicly financed welfare and a weak currency? </p>
<p class="contents">The Charter Convention ought perhaps to be given an increased mandate to draft proposals for constitutionalising the Treaties, because the issues are so closely interrelated. There is undoubtedly a direct link between the prelude to a new treaty and the actual contents of the treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">A parallel development could create new political openings and constitute progress, because the various interests would be directly dependent upon one another. To bring about parallel processes of enlargement and deepening, a decision in principle could be made in favour of a binding Charter for the constitutional portion, but not for the portion concerned with issues other than those of principle. The Convention would then certainly know what status the Charter was to be given and could see it as the prelude to constructing the new treaty. Both those whose priority is enlargement and those who give priority to a deepening of the Union would then meet with success. A development of this kind would make it possible to admit new Members early on and, at the same time, equip the Union well to operate more effectively for a long time to come. </p>
<p class="contents">We have an historic responsibility to overcome barriers and not to intensify conflicts in the way that happened in the case of Austria. We need to replace short-term initiatives with long-term, in-depth cooperation. I believe that, in that way, our basic values, which form the uncontroversial part of the Charter, could be used as a lever for enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You should have heard the discussions we had in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and at the meetings with the trade unions in the interunion association. Every paragraph was analysed and Lisbon was expected to open a new chapter in social history. When I consider Feira, I see that of the twenty five and a half pages of the presidency conclusions a mere half a page is devoted to social protection and social inclusion. I would go so far as to say that this would not be particularly untoward were it not for the fact that even the half-page fails to add anything new. The same applies to employment policy and the European social agenda for that matter.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, two priorities that were already established in Lisbon are repeated, i.e. pensions and poverty, whilst on the other hand, four objectives set in Lisbon are picked up on again, i.e. the committee for social protection, the open coordination method, the programme for social inclusion, the participation of the social partners and the social responsibility of the business community. The paragraphs that deal with this are actually nothing more than a reprint of the Lisbon paragraphs. Nothing new has been added.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If Feira is to have any lasting significance at all, from the social viewpoint as much as anything, then this will be down to the agreement on taxation of income from savings, all assuming this eventually leads to a directive. Only then will the Helsinki principle not only seem self-evident, it will actually be enforceable, i.e. all citizens residing in a Member State of the European Union will be obliged to pay the tax due on all their income from savings. In this way, funds will also be released for social policy and social security will not have to find the money to cover a lack of income owing to fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been many difficult questions during the spring, but Portugal has shown that it is a country which takes European issues very seriously. The Feira Summit was in many ways an interim meeting prior to the French Presidency. Unfortunately, the outcome of the Summit was partly overshadowed by the tragedy in Dover, which really raises an issue which urgently needs to be taken up at EU level. </p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is delighted by the progress which has been achieved on, for example, the tax package and civil crisis management. We are pleased to have it confirmed that Greece is soon to be a member of the currency union. We are delighted about the formulations concerning enlargement. For liberals such as ourselves, no task is more important than that of unifying Europe. Where the reforms and the Intergovernmental Conference are concerned, we are disappointed, however. We should like to have seen more concrete results. Countries are still protecting their positions, and the debate about the EU’s future has only just begun. It is a welcome and wholly necessary debate. It must be conducted in all countries, in an open and unbiased way, and involve the citizens of all Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Minimum reforms in Nice will not be enough. Our citizens expect something more. They expect the EU to take proper steps forward towards an open, democratic Europe which can operate effectively with up to 40 Member States. We need to discuss the issues surrounding a constitution. The EU needs a constitution which, in a simple and understandable way, makes it clear what the EU is about and where responsibility lies. </p>
<p class="contents">The baton has now been handed over to France. I feel a certain unease faced with the different signals emanating from the French Presidency.

As a Parliament, we had a particularly attentive and considerate opponent, which pleases us greatly. But the Council is, and remains, an opponent as far as we are concerned. As MEPs we are still far from satisfied. The Council appears to be the least willing of all the European institutions to hear the call for democracy and transparency. The Council swears by the Member States through thick and thin, although it is such a struggle to get them to cooperate.

<p class="contents">I should like to address some of the central issues that have arisen in this debate. Firstly, the danger of a shift towards an intergovernmental approach. I am particularly happy to speak about this subject because I have, for a long time, publicly advocated the need for the Union to move gradually towards a single pillar structure. Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency has proved that it does not want to see a shift towards an intergovernmental approach. Firstly, at the Intergovernmental Conference itself, the Presidency tried to include the European Parliament to a much greater extent than was provided for in the Helsinki decisions. Secondly, the Lisbon strategy entrusted the Commission with a set of essential tasks, highlighting the Commission’s crucial role in all aspects relating to the method for open coordination between the Union’s economic and social policies. </p>
<p class="contents">Before the Feira Summit, we also held a forum attended by representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the Council, Member States, and also the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Economic and Social Council, the Committee of the Regions and our social partners. I therefore fully agree with all those who feel that the Union’s true nature must be preserved as a Union and strengthened as such, and that a shift towards an intergovernmental approach is highly undesirable. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Intergovernmental Conference. It was not the Portuguese Presidency’s responsibility to conclude the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. It was to do what we did, which was to produce a very detailed report on all the positions and all the possible alternatives on matters arising from what have become known as the ‘leftovers’ from Amsterdam. At the same time, we tried to generate a consensus, which did not exist in Helsinki, guaranteeing that closer cooperation would be included on the agenda of the Conference, as we feel that this is intimately related to issues of extending voting by qualified majority within the Council and, perhaps, also the Council’s relationship in procedures for codecision with the European Parliament. This is also connected to the idea that closer cooperation is not designed to destabilise the European Union, but must be undertaken within the Union framework and must not contain any mechanism for arbitrary decisions or for exclusion. Closer cooperation has the potential to be, under the Union’s rules, a crucial instrument for strengthening integration within an enlarged and more heterogeneous Union. The next question would be: will it be possible to conclude the IGC? To my mind, the issue is now quite clear. I see the Intergovernmental Conference, as we all do, as a set of changes which are necessary for enlargement, and the options are today quite obvious to everyone. This report identifies these options very clearly. If the political will is there, IGC could be concluded within a month. The question is whether the essential will to commit ourselves exists, because we all know what the possible commitments are: either we wish to make these commitments together or we do not, and my conviction is that there will be the political will and that, therefore, it will be perfectly possible to conclude the work on this during the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I feel particularly comfortable with this issue, because the Portuguese Government has always recommended that a Charter of Fundamental Rights should be included in the Treaty. As is also clear, we have always tried, without being instructed to do so, to include this item on the agenda of the Feira Summit, and to ask the chairman of the Convention to present a progress report to the European Council. The European Council would not be able to take a decision on including it on the IGC agenda until the Convention itself had decided whether or not the content of this Charter should be legally binding. The Council, however, did decide that this issue would remain in the open so that, as soon as the Convention gives a clear ruling on the issue, the Charter of Fundamental Rights could be included on the agenda of the IGC. My desire, the desire of the Portuguese Government, is that this Charter should become a fundamental instrument of the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, various speakers have said that enlargement cannot be delayed. The evidence that I can give you is that there has been no delay in the last six months. As I said a few minutes ago, we closed 72 dossiers for negotiation in six months. Even in relation to countries whose negotiations only started during the Portuguese Council Presidency, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Malta, I can say the following. With regard to Latvia, eight chapters were opened and five were closed; in relation to Lithuania, eight were opened and five were closed; eight and six for Slovakia; five and five for Romania; five and four for Bulgaria; and in relation to Malta, eight and seven. This shows that we were working at top speed, in excellent cooperation with the Commission – and I must here emphasise the role of Commissioner Verheugen – in order to move forward as quickly as possible with the work on enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Summit laid down a strategy. Today we all recognise the fact that we are going to be living in an information society with a knowledge-based economy. The big question is whether or not this society will be inclusive, whether or not everyone will share in it. The essence of this strategy’s vision of Europe is that it must be inclusive, and the European answer to making it inclusive is what we call an education-based society, which is essentially concerned with lifelong education and training, as has been stressed today. Three months after a huge range of decisions were taken, it was not the Feira Summit’s task to conclude the process. Nevertheless, the Feira Summit has already approved a set of fundamental documents. For example, we have discussed small businesses and the European Charter for Small Enterprises has been approved. We have talked about the information society and the information society action plan has been approved. Much has been said about combating poverty, and three extremely important reports are already under consideration, which will enable decisions to be taken in the short term by the Commission, on fighting social exclusion and by the High Level Working Group, now the Committee on Social Protection, in the field of social exclusion and the sustainability of retirement pensions. In other words, I am genuinely convinced that we can make very rapid progress. In line with what Commissioner Patten said, the Commission is preparing the set of indicators for September, which will enable us to give form and content to the various forms of policy coordination that have been defined. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the tax package, it is not by chance that we have been waiting twelve years for an agreement to be concluded. When it takes twelve years to conclude an agreement, it is because the agreement is far from easy to conclude. An agreement that is not easy to conclude is not a perfect agreement, but it is a necessary compromise. I am firmly convinced that the political will that was present in this agreement will also be present when it comes to implementing it. Therefore, in response to the questions that have been put to me, I think that the timetable will be adhered to. In terms of unanimity on tax matters, the basic problem is that the decision on whether there can be decisions that do not require unanimity must itself be reached unanimously. There has so far been no indication that this unanimity can be reached within the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to briefly mention two other issues. The first concerns the incident at Dover, which shocked us all. What lies behind the incident at Dover, however, is that we have to recognise the inability that Europe has shown to date to fully understand the phenomenon of an ageing population. What this means is that Europe must have its own immigration policy and also the ability to work together on this immigration policy with the home countries of those who wish to come and work in Europe. At the same time, from a social point of view, we need to guarantee a series of measures that will enable these people to integrate harmoniously into our societies. This is the key issue and this is the issue on which the Commission has now been instructed to work in certain crucial areas, which, we feel, will result in very important decisions for the European Union in the near future. </p>
<p class="contents">Here we come to the crux of another issue that will be extremely important for life in our societies in the coming decades: our ability to live together with different people, to promote tolerance in our societies and to combat xenophobia and racism in their various forms. We must do this – and let us be quite clear about this – because xenophobia and racism do exist in our societies, in all our countries. They are a social phenomenon, and it would be appalling if political movements, particularly those with aspirations to govern, were to attempt to use xenophobia and racism in order to win votes. I would like to make it quite clear… </p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">... I would like to make it quite clear that this runs completely counter to European values. If we have to accept the fact, for reasons of the sovereignty of States, that these political movements might hold governmental positions in our States, I have to say in all honesty that, in my opinion, a political movement that uses xenophobia as a means of winning votes and gaining power does not have the same set of values that I do. I do not, therefore, have any problem with winning or losing face with regard to the action that I, my government, and the governments of fourteen other Member States took when, in Austria, a party came to power, which in our opinion, did not respect these basic values. Having said this, I also wish to say that we, the Portuguese Presidency of the Union, were greatly concerned to do something, which has never been easy, as you will all be aware, to ensure that Austria participated fully in all of the Union’s work. In addition to this, we were concerned to ensure that Austria’s representatives were treated with the proper respect, including the FPÖ Government representatives to all Council bodies. The Presidency sought to do this because it was convinced that the government of a sovereign State such as mine has the right to hold a particular opinion regarding the government of another sovereign State, and I do not relinquish this right because I am a representative of a sovereign State. The workings of the Union are another matter, however, and I feel that, as far as the European Union is concerned, it is our duty to fully ensure that the Union functions as it should. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, with regard to the decisions of the fourteen Member States on relations between their governments and the Austrian Government, a procedure is currently being defined which will enable us to reassess these decisions when the time it right. These decisions were, as I said, taken strictly at bilateral level, and have not affected the workings of the Union, because the Portuguese Presidency has not allowed them to. Nor has the Presidency allowed these decisions, in the face of great pressure for it do to otherwise, to affect Austria’s presence or respect for Austria’s representatives in any of the Union activities over which it was our duty to preside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The honourable Member asked me how I saw the relationship between the institutions – between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. I can answer very directly: in my own area it is a subject about which I have made one or two speeches recently. I am absolutely clear that I do not want to see any increase in the Commission's competences in the area for which I am responsible. I want us to manage those competences more efficiently, and I want us to be allowed to exercise those competences fully to support the development of a common foreign and security policy. In my judgment it is not a question of our seeking to take new powers, it is a question of our seeking to exercise the powers that we have already been given by the Treaty. We should be trying to exercise those powers in a way that is even more democratically accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give the honourable Member an indication of what I mean. We have to apply to the budgetary authority – to Parliament and the Council – for the level of our commitments in external relations every year, but we should be involved in a much more open dialogue with the budgetary authority about the direction in which those spending commitments should go. There should be a more serious exchange about our political priorities. So, to answer the honourable Member again, I want us to manage much better what we are already charged with doing. I want us to be allowed to get on with it, and I want us to be as accountable as possible to this Parliament and to the Council for what we are doing. Our aspirations are as simple and as straightforward as that, and they have the great advantage of reflecting what is written in the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to pay one last compliment in the direction of the Portuguese Presidency at the end of its term. It was, I repeat, a great pleasure to work with the Portuguese Government, with its ministers and its extremely hard-working officials. Speaking as somebody who during the course of a fairly long and not, I hope, entirely misspent political life, has sat under a number of chairmen, I do not think I have ever sat under a chairman who was better, more competent, more decisive or more courteous than the Prime Minister of Portugal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
