This historic step demands of us, above all else, understanding, an understanding that must be profound rather than merely superficial, a real comprehension rather than just a random encounter. We need languages as a vector if this understanding is to be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this place, we will soon be representing twenty-five states and over three thousand years of cultural history. Many cultures and many languages are far younger and hence less deep-rooted, so there is, in all of them, concern about their own identity. I believe that these concerns do not need to persist, and would like to give you the example of the South Tyrol, from which I come. We have benefited from the European Union. The Austrian minority in South Tyrol – speaking German and Ladin – has been greatly strengthened by the EU, by a policy of openness on the part of Italy and by developments in the European Union. It is my belief that this minority has become a bridge between Italy and Austria, between the German-speakers and Italian-speakers. That is why I would like to dispel the misgivings of the minorities, the small linguistic communities within the EU and of those who will be joining it.</p>
<p class="contents">This report seeks to value and maintain languages and cultures and to strengthen all of them – not just the official languages, but also the regional and less-used ones. Europe is a mosaic, and a very beautiful one, and we want this mosaic to be conserved rather than becoming a cocktail. In the Europe of Fifteen, there are at present over sixty minorities. Another sixty will be added from the ten candidate countries. This wealth of languages makes for diversity and enriches us, and it will be possible for many of these minorities to function as bridges between States. The Commission, with its action plan and its inclusive approach, has recognised that at the right time. I would like not only to single out Commissioner Reding for specific mention, but also to express due gratitude to her for this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Action Plan on Linguistic Diversity is the right way forward. I am grateful to the Members of this House and to those who, in past parliamentary terms, have made substantial contributions towards this end, above all those in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport who have helped to improve this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament played a leading role in this. From 1981 to 2001, it has taken the initiative with the Arfé Report, the Kuijpers Report, the Reding Report, the Killilea Report, and, most recently, the Morgan resolution; now, with this resolution from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, it wants to go one step further. This is a decisive moment before enlargement, when we are able not only to express our positions on the work that the Convention has completed, but also to offer proposals. The Year of Languages 2001 was important, but it was not enough. The learning of languages must not be limited to one year, but must become and remain a continuous process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking the rapporteur very warmly for his commitment, as it is a commitment to languages and therefore to human beings and to our citizens. It seeks to create a multilingual and multicultural Europe where we advocate diversity, because as far as we are concerned that is Europe’s real wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ebner, both you and the Commissioner want the same thing. We now have to decide how to achieve it. I would like to go on to look at the two legislative proposals contained in the report. The first concerns an Agency on Linguistic Diversity. Although I do feel that such an agency would be useful, we must stop and think before launching such an undertaking. A feasibility study would be a vital stage in the considerations; it would provide us with a detailed assessment of the existing instruments, including those relating to regional and minority languages.</p>
<p class="contents">My services have carried out an evaluation of all of the activities relating to regional and minority languages, and a report should be published at the beginning of next year, which will serve as a first step on this path. I am sure you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that a feasibility study on the creation of a Cultural Cooperation Observatory – the Ruffolo report – is already under way. I feel that it would be useful to learn the lessons of that experience before embarking upon a new exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the importance we place on the Council of Europe’s activities in the field of languages. I agree with you: we must coordinate the efforts of the Commission and the Council of Europe. Before going any further in terms of creating an agency, there should be an exchange of ideas regarding the methods for greater coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to the adoption of a multi-annual programme. I must admit, Mr President, that this poses a problem, as the Commission cannot accept this recommendation. It is not a question of substance, as you know very well that we are of the same opinion in that respect. I have already had several opportunities to talk to you about this issue. I have supported the idea that in the current circumstances the best way of promoting regional and minority languages is through an integrated approach. I am totally convinced of this, as a separate programme would, in my view, mean further isolation of regional and minority languages.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for just the opposite, that is, giving them greater recognition. We must ensure support for these languages by making use of the possibilities provided by the existing programmes. Moreover, the European Year – you will no doubt agree – was an experience that integrated regional and minority languages. The implementation report demonstrates that regional and minority languages now occupy a prime position.</p>
<p class="contents">After careful consideration, the Commission decided to present an action plan, which the rapporteur has already mentioned and which I have brought with me today. You should have received a copy. If not, I have some copies here that you can have. Would the President like one? President Roca, your copy awaits!</p>
<p class="contents">This action plan is based on the conclusions of the Helsinki Conference on regional and minority languages, organised under the aegis of President Ahtisaari in October 2002. Mr Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, if you like, I will outline this action plan, adopted on 24 July, in greater detail and talk to you about its implementation. The plan envisages the integrated approach I spoke about, as we must focus on the opportunities for financing within the framework of existing programmes and ensure that there is more awareness of these opportunities and that they are better utilised. As a result, thanks to the budget passed by Parliament, on 31 July the Commission published a call for proposals and the projects should be submitted by the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to say that we should take advantage of the discussions on the new generations of programme because if we truly want to implement a concerted action for languages, the new programmes should incorporate a significant multilingual element.</p>
<p class="contents">Before ending, I would very briefly like to mention some of the points in the report. As far as the definition is concerned, I believe we are in agreement: we should use that of the Council of Europe, as set out in the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages and the Mercator network, I know that many of you here are very interested in these instruments and hope that they can continue to operate. I can tell you that the proposal for a decision establishing an action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture is currently being negotiated. A total of EUR 5.4 million is being set aside to fund the Bureau and the Mercator network for the 2004-2008 period. You can therefore forget any concerns regarding this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the annex to the motion for a resolution sets out 20 different requests. I must stress that most of these requests go far beyond what could be implemented within the framework of the two legislative initiatives proposed by Parliament itself. I do not want to go into detail, but would remind you that many concrete initiatives to promote regional and minority languages are contained in this action plan and that substantial funding is already available.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan aims to bring everything together and to present to the citizens in all their diversity the possibilities the European Union can offer them, the opportunities recommended in the action plan for languages, in other words the opportunities, Mr Ebner, that have exactly the same aim as your report: to turn this grand European linguistic mosaic into a great table for Europe’s cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Spain is a country with great wealth when it comes to languages, and there are many regions or Autonomous Communities in which Castilian is co-official – as the official language of the Spanish State – with another language, such as Catalan or Basque, amongst others. Above all, moreover, I must say that we feel very proud of this. We in the People's Party always try to ensure that one of these co-official languages does not thrive to the detriment of another, for the good of our citizens and in order to have a totally bilingual population.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Spain already channel enough money towards the promotion of languages and, for this reason, we do not agree with channelling more Community budget for this purpose, bearing in mind all the existing needs at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that certain points in this report – and we agree with its general basis – do not entirely respect the principle of subsidiarity and even violate the principle of proportionality and Community legislation. We have full confidence, however, that, this being the case, the European Commission will play its role as guardian of the Treaties and put right anything which is not correct in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something which is also included in the draft Constitutional Treaty and we are particularly satisfied with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining linguistic diversity, as expressed through support for lesser-used languages, contributes, apart from anything else, to social cohesion, to preventing conflicts and, of course, should not in my opinion operate along lines of quantitative parameters, along lines of majorities and minorities. I take the same view of minority languages. They have an intrinsic value and should be dealt with as such.</p>
<p class="contents">There are in fact millions of Europeans who, alongside the official language of their country, speak a minority language, mainly within their communities, and this is a tradition from generation to generation which we all respect. That is why it is important for cultural ties to be used creatively for the purpose of communication and exchanges and not, of course, to isolate a community; this would be particularly negative and we have seen it happen in the past. It is therefore important for our strategies as regards minority languages to be characterised by an open spirit of cooperation, by scientific research and association with the wealth of cultural elements which surround them. Promoting cultural cooperation and exchanges is the best way of offering the public the area of European culture we all want to create.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present era of globalisation, concentration of resources and the prevalence of monolingual situations, maintaining minority languages must be addressed as a source of primary elements which have the freshness and verve to claim their expression over time, despite their limited extent. However, it should be stressed that it is only by opening these cultural communities up to dialogue that we shall find a fruitful solution. That is why I think that the Commission study is important and we await its results with great interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe there is a group of languages which forms a significant part of its heritage. We see this in this Chamber: 11 working languages and nine new languages which will be incorporated on the enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe there are unitary states, nation states and also multinational states – states made up of several nations with their own languages. In my case, in the Spanish state, there are several nations. I belong to the Catalan nation, the language spoken by more than 7 million people – in other words, more speakers than two of the current official languages of the European Union, and more speakers than six of the languages of the 10 candidate states.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner herself, Mrs Reding, was rapporteur for a report on the linguistic diversity in Europe in 1990. At that time the European Commission was asked to take account of the particular circumstances of the Catalan language within the European Union. In this regard, we can say that the steps recommended by Parliament – by means of the Reding report – at that time have not been taken: that official texts in Catalan should have validity and that the Commission should also regulate a form of incorporation of Catalan into the linguistic system of the European Union, since it is a language spoken more widely than many of the languages which are working languages and official languages here. We are not asking, under any circumstances, that Catalan should be a working language – the European Union's linguistic system is quite complex enough – we are simply asking for recognition of its validity as an official language and that it may participate in the wealth of this cultural mosaic. In this way we will be able to satisfy that plurality which Robert Schuman – as the President mentioned at the beginning of the sitting – spoke of during his lifetime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, through Mr Ebner's report we are at last putting that into practice and supporting language learning and multilingualism, including minority languages, like the language I am speaking now, Welsh, my mother tongue.']</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank the interpreters for translating the first part of my address – which was in Welsh – to be understood by the rest of the Members here.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to begin by congratulating and thanking Mr Ebner for adventuring in the task of writing a report on European minority languages and presenting so many constructive ideas to further respect for multilingualism in Europe. We all know how sensitive this issue of minority languages is in some countries which consider them a threat not only to the integrity of their state culture but also to their territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of minority languages is a matter very close to my heart, because I am, myself – as are many others in this Chamber – a speaker of a minority language. Minority-language speakers are no different to speakers of other languages. We only want to live a full life through the medium of our language, whilst not giving up, of course, the pleasure of learning and mastering many languages which open doors to cultures and windows to a better understanding of others.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that minority languages are back on the European agenda. For many years we have been in a stalemate over the legal funding for minority languages in Europe. The Commission and the Council have dragged their feet on this issue for far too long. Therefore, today's debate in Parliament is a major step forward which should ultimately lead to new legislation. Minority languages must be sustained and promoted if we are to live up to the claim of a Europe of diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">At this important juncture in Europe's future, with new members joining the Union, the European Parliament is again leading the cause for greater respect for minority-language speakers. I wish Mr Ebner well with his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The variety of regional and lesser-used languages across the continent of Europe is an integral part of our unique cultural heritage. We are culturally richer due to the fact that so many of these languages have survived in this multimedia globalised age and are still used on a daily basis. Credit is certainly due to the Commission, which has consistently supported the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the rapporteur's idea of creating a European agency to assist the various aspects of language policy. We recognise that the area of culture and language policy is primarily a national preserve. Nevertheless, I am convinced that by pooling a certain amount of our resources and experience, we can bring about improvements which would have Europe-wide benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Ireland, and in the neighbouring United Kingdom, the predominant language is an ever more global English. If against this backdrop lesser-used national languages such as Gaeilge, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh, which we heard so eloquently spoken here this morning by Mr Wyn, can thrive, there is no reason why any of our minority languages have to die out. We often talk about Europe's cultural heritage. The preservation of language diversity far outweighs preservation of architectural or artistic heritage, important as they may be, because language is a living thing. It is part of our very identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is vital to safeguard and promote these languages. A heritage of our past, they cement peoples and territories and add the specific characteristics and cachet to numerous regions throughout Europe, like here, Alsace or Catalonia – Northern Catalonia – from which I come. Mr Vallvé, we are the symbol of geographical diversity for the same so-called minority language.</p>
<p class="contents">I do wonder, however, about the means of fulfilling this objective and, in particular, the need for a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning. How, exactly, is it going to operate on the ground to promote this learning? Would it not be better to apply the subsidiarity principle and work at national level, much closer to local level? That would make it possible to respect cultural traditions and the administrative and constitutional organisation of each state by encouraging them to promote, first and foremost, the learning of regional and minority languages from nursery school and, then, the organisation of cultural events such as twinning and school exchanges that would encompass the identity and history of the people. We must not rob the Member States of their power of action in the field of training and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I see Amendment No 5 as a step in the right direction, as it encourages ongoing support for minority and regional languages in a context of political neutrality and independently of any mercenary, financial considerations. We must also provide a legal basis for these actions so that we can get out of the mess caused by the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and allow European funds to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, as a member of the Disability Intergroup, to say how pleased I am to see the reference to sign language, which, according to the Council of Europe, is used by more than 3 million of our fellow citizens. There could perhaps have been greater emphasis on these languages as their users face the same problems on a daily basis as the people using the languages covered by this report. It is essential that all the members of the Union ratify the Council of Europe’s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. After 2001, the European Year of Languages, I hope that the excellent links we have with the Council of Europe can continue to grow, especially with the secretariat of the Charter. That would seem to me to be a pragmatic and effective way of encouraging and developing the use of our regional languages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret, however, that the report did not seek to define its subject and has left this to the Commission, which is invited, in paragraph 2, to lay down criteria on the basis of scientific elements. As legislators, it is precisely our role to determine these criteria. Thus we would undoubtedly have had to distinguish between regional languages and minority languages. Minority languages may be national or official languages in a Member State, one example being the German-speaking population in the Alto Adige region or South Tyrol, as mentioned by the rapporteur. Although these people speak German, it is more questionable whether German can be considered a regional language in Alsace as the Alsatian dialect, which is undoubtedly Germanic, is substantially different.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as regional languages are concerned, what exactly are they? Are they, for example, the langue d’oc in the south of France, or its distinct components, Provençal or Gascon? Above all, we must not forget that many of our national languages are themselves threatened. Indeed, the Parliament itself provides its own delegations travelling abroad only with interpreting services into English, as was recently the case with the delegation to Japan, and that leads me to believe that we are going down a dangerous path. My own language, French, is unfortunately losing ground every day as a language of international communication, but the very existence of others is threatened. I am thinking of Gaelic in Ireland and the languages of the Baltic states, which have only just escaped Russification.</p>
<p class="contents">We must certainly develop regional languages, and that is my conclusion, Mr President, but we must ensure that we do not undermine or weaken our national languages. We must ensure that there is no artificial reconstruction of abstract languages that are removed from the regional realities. We must ensure that we do not establish a restrictive and authoritarian system. The regional languages will contribute to our cultural wealth only if they meet these three conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the enlargement in 2004, some 6 million people will be added to this. In the Netherlands too, we have the phenomenon of a minority language, Friesian, which enjoys official recognition as such. As has been said before, linguistic diversity is a heritage of which we Europeans are proud, and so we should be. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union rightly recognises the cultural and linguistic diversity. In future, this will also form an inherent part of the European Constitution. The European Parliament has always made a case for protecting linguistic diversity and regional and minority languages. Various resolutions have been adopted in this respect. A budget line was created for this purpose as early as 1980. In 2001, the European year of languages was particularly intended to draw attention to the importance of languages, to language diversity, and to stimulating language teaching. This involved not only the major languages, but also lesser-used regional and minority languages. It was a sound initiative. Nevertheless, there is still a great deal left to be done in this area. I am therefore pleased that a plan of action is now being drafted in order to hammer this point home once more. I myself have spoken in favour of greater attention being given to sign language. We know that about 1 in 1 000 people – some 15 000 people in the Netherlands alone – are born deaf or become deaf before they reach the age of three. To them, sign language is an essential means of communication, so I am pleased that this component has been included in the present report. It would be good if sign language could be considered a minority language. Deaf people are often excluded from many areas of society on account of their disability. Their language deserves as much attention and support as do spoken minority languages. I sincerely hope that the Commission will manage to present a legislative proposal on language diversity by the end of this year. Peace in Europe is not only about effective economic cooperation. It is, above all, about demonstrating an interest in, respect for, and understanding of, people from a different culture. Language is an important key in this.</p>

It is not, however, meant only to be used, but should also emphasise and reinforce European consciousness. As we have already heard said many times today, one essential part of this richness is linguistic diversity, which we have taken on as our cultural heritage and must pass on as a matter of cultural responsibility. Put into practical terms, this means that we need institutions to take on this work, financial resources to make it possible, and voluntary organisations to give support in the performance of these tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Being myself from Austria, a country in which six recognised ethnic groups and their minority languages are represented – three of them, including Roma, in my very small federal state of Burgenland alone – I know how difficult it is to meet all the demands involved in using languages properly and in maintaining them. Whilst it is the individual states that have responsibility for minority languages and for their support, the European Union cannot evade the obligation to take action to back them up in this; we are talking here about 40 million EU citizens and 60 regional and minority languages. The European Year of Languages was, as we have heard, a great success; it also sent the right signals and pointed us in the right direction. Now is the time for what we have learned to be put into practice, and I would agree with Mrs Martens that sign language must absolutely be included, as the deaf must be able to participate in social and political life.</p>
<p class="contents">Multiannual programmes for linguistic diversity are desirable and should be pushed through. International exchanges of experience and courses of study, cross-border projects and so on, should be brought together under one roof, and I believe it to be absolutely necessary that EBLUL be given a legal basis enabling it to make full use of the financial resources provided for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today is therefore a particularly well chosen time to present the report on regional languages and cultural diversity. I want to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Ebner for all the hard work he has done. As many in this House have pointed out, we now need practical efforts in order to make further progress with this work. I believe that, as Mr Ebner said, developments will increase the need for measures on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to share our various experiences of linguistic diversity and language learning. I therefore believe it important for a relevant institute to be set up. I nonetheless believe that there is no great difference between how matters look at present and what is discussed in the report, where there is explicit talk about what are called language baths. This is an extremely good method, which has been used to good effect in South Tyrol, Catalonia and Finland. I see no mention of it in the Commission’s action plan, but I am glad the plan states that the universities must review their language policies so that English is not so dominant.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, however, to emphasise that we must investigate, and go more deeply into, the issue of an institute for linguistic diversity and language learning. I am convinced that such an institute is needed. I also wish to thank the Commissioner for mentioning the conference in Finland.

<p class="contents">Those that are more equal than others are the official languages of the Union. The others, although equal in dignity, are not equal in law.

Linguistic diversity is being destroyed in Europe. In short, I believe that the solution to this problem does not simply lie in supporting languages or minority languages, because this is not enough, it will not suffice; I believe that the solution lies in a difficult and uncomfortable word: Esperanto. Let us try it at least! According to studies, this language, as a technical and neutral language, could be learnt and, therefore, chosen as a political language in place of other languages. To use other languages, which represent and bring with them a culture, as sole languages or as bridge languages, would be to encourage the predominance of one culture over another, which is what is already happening now. With Esperanto this issue, this shortcoming, does not arise. If it is true, and I believe it to be so, that this language is as easy to learn as is claimed by many international studies, then I believe that the European Union should at least try exploring this avenue. Funding and support are not enough when facing the destruction of linguistic diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Knowing our neighbours’ language and culture better means understanding them better and respecting them, and so I see language as performing an essential task in the sense that knowledge of other people’s languages promotes peace. If we look more closely into the trouble spots in and around Europe, we discover that a lack of respect for those who are different – which involves languages – has very often brought about the trouble in the first place and led to the situation in these places worsening. I therefore see language as being about more than knowing and respecting others. I see language as the best peacekeeping force that we in Europe can deploy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes clear, though, that, in an ever-expanding Europe, there is increasing awareness of regional cultures and also of regional languages. Belonging as I do to the German-speaking community in Belgium, I can see that respecting this is not a luxury for those regions that enjoy autonomy, but something I regard as a European fundamental right. It is for that reason that governments have – as we have just heard said – the primary task of guaranteeing the cultures of smaller regions and their right to have their voices heard. We should then, at the European level, give consideration to what additional instruments we employ. We appreciate Mr Ebner’s work in representing us in this House. We know that German is spoken in Italy and Belgium …</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is a very positive move that in the new draft Constitution the Union’s linguistic diversity is being recognised. Under Article 3 the Union will respect the wealth and diversity of its cultures and languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I do hope that at last we are moving on from speech to action in the area of language policy also. Throughout the current parliamentary term we have encountered almost insurmountable problems whenever we have tried to steer funds from the Union’s budget in the direction of minority languages. The reason has been the absence of any legal basis. Fortunately, we have been able to avail ourselves of multiannual programmes such as Socrates and Culture 2000, not forgetting the European Year of Languages 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Ebner, has done an excellent job. I agree with him that the EU should have an Agency on Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning. There should also be sufficient resources allocated to it for it to function effectively in an enlarged Union. With enlargement the number of regional or minority language communities is estimated to double from the present number of approximately 60. We must also give our support to the proposal for a multiannual programme on linguistic diversity and language learning.</p>
<p class="contents">No agency or action programme, however, will solve the problems that EU citizens who speak regional or minority languages encounter in many Member States. The right to an education in one’s own native language in particular should be guaranteed in all Member States. For this there has to be investment in the training of teachers of regional and minority languages.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be limited scope in future budget headings in respect of internal policies for financing activities to encourage the use of regional and minority languages. I hope that more resources under the Structural Funds can be directed towards such activities. We should also inform speakers of regional or minority languages of such possible resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By speaking in my language, I would have liked to have stressed the reality of this European Union which we are building amongst all of us on the basis of respect for our own cultural diversity. I believe we are all concerned, not just the green ecologists, when the biodiversity of nature is threatened by man's actions. However, we often forget human biodiversity, one of the main manifestations of which are the different languages and cultures which are sometimes not respected or protected, but rather there is simply an attempt to eliminate them, for the sake of the commercial convenience of uniformity and globalising tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I believe that the individual, the person, is above commercial and economic interests, I would advocate constant support for national, regional and minority languages, independently of changes in political power, as well as decisive support for multilingualism so that we can build our Union without it becoming a confused tower of Babel.</p>

I would say, and this is, indeed, most significant, that the rights of freedom of the rapporteur have, in a sense, been violated in this House: when Mr Ebner mentioned his region, he called it – as is his right – <span class="italic">Südtirol</span>, and in the Italian translation it was adapted to the bureaucratic name fixed by the Italian centralist State and translated incorrectly, as ‘Alto Adige’.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, as he rightly said, quoting the great Europeanist, Dr Silvius Magnago, is a wonderful mosaic of nations and should, therefore, see its unique ethno-linguistic character as a precious gift to be defended and valued.</p>
<p class="contents">I will continue and conclude in my mother tongue, which is Piedmontese: '<span class="italic">Voeui bin rimarqué si ma son che in Piemunt, che l'è la mia regiùn, ancöi as parlan …. ancura – a parte el piemunteis, che l'è na lingua straordinaria con una bela literatüra e na gramatica che risale adiritüra al Setzent – due aute lingue minuritarie: lusitan e il valzer che s'parla anche in Valdusta. </span><span class="italic">Tant'el piemunteis que le aute lingue minuritarie l'han sübi e sübissen ancura adess, en tel 2003, n'upressiùn gravusa da la parte de le Stat centralista italian, e l'è certament l'un dei mutivu per ingagèr nost cumbatiment per uteign sübit il federalismo, in Italia, e duman la piena libertà e l'autonomia del nost bel Piemonte e de la Padania libera.</span></p>
<p class="contents">[I would like to add that in Piedmont, which is the region I come from, not only is Piedmontese still spoken, which is an extraordinary language with beautiful literature and grammar that dates back as far as the eighteenth century, there are two other minority languages: Ladin and Walser, that are also spoken in Val d’Aosta. Both Piedmontese and the other two minority languages have suffered and continue to suffer now, in 2003, from serious oppression by the centralist Italian state, and this is certainly one of the reasons for fighting to obtain federalism in Italy without delay, and demand full freedom and independence for our lovely region of Piedmont and for a free Padania.] </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In contrast to Welsh and Basque, you would probably not have had to submit your speech beforehand. We would have had it translated for us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Ebner for his initiative in producing this report. Along with Mr Grosch, who has also already spoken, he represents linguistic minorities in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I think the South Tyrol and Eastern Belgium are, along with other places, successful examples of how minorities make for enrichment rather than for instability and also build bridges. In Eastern Belgium and the South Tyrol, multilingualism can be heard, and, above all, seen. This visible multilingualism is something we have not yet achieved in this Parliament building, where what we can read is all in one single language.</p>
<p class="contents">We find nonetheless, in our fifteen Member States and ten candidate countries, which are stable democracies, a repressive reflex towards minorities and their languages, mainly for reasons of history. I want to make it perfectly plain that there are no separatist or extremist languages, but, if anything, only separatist or extremist people, with whom we have to deal by means of policy or the criminal law. That is why linguistic minorities as such cannot be generally suspected of imperilling the unity of the nation by using their language. For this reason, I find it quite incomprehensible that not all Member States have ratified the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Council of Europe’s framework convention on the subject. I would call on those states that have not yet done this to do so. It will not endanger their national unity or territorial integrity. Those who have problems with this leave themselves open to the suspicion that they are very insecure and believe it self-evident that their own language and culture can only be safeguarded by restricting others rather than through their own attractiveness. I would urge a bit more boldness on those who still hesitate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So congratulations on this good report. Allow me to comment, however, on a single area of concern: as a Catalan speaker, I am aware of the existence in Europe of languages spoken by millions of people which are not thought of as being minority languages or regional languages and which – despite having official status within their autonomous region – are not state languages and are therefore not languages with official status in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To deal with the problem of the institutionalisation, the status and the function of these European languages is perhaps the fundamental key to deciding whether the policy of a future European agency for linguistic diversity or the policy on the European institutions is really going to be faithful to the slogan of the future constitutional Union: united in diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we have heard many minorities speaking up for themselves. It is unfortunate that we do not have today interpretation into sign language, as we did with the Lynn Report. I am grateful to the rapporteur and also to the Committee for finding room for sign language in this report and in this programme, which opens the door to its being recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members have expressed the view in this debate that sign language should be promoted as a health resource. I think this would profoundly violate the rights of the deaf minority. Sign language is not a crutch or a wheelchair. Not only is it a language used by 15 000 people, but we should also bear in mind that it is the only language in which these 15 000 people can carry on a conversation. For recognising them as a linguistic minority and acknowledging that their language also contributes to the diversity and richness of European languages, I am grateful to all who have had a hand in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
