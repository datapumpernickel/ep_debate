Since it is crucial that European rules be laid down for this internationally operating sector as a matter of urgency, I am delighted with the agreement reached with the Council. It was a long time in coming and was preceded by much discussion. It was equally the subject of intense debating in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I should like to convey my gratitude particularly to the shadow rapporteurs, for the good cooperation, thanks to which, and to the confidence that has been put in me, I am able to present this agreement to this House, and one that enjoys the broad support of the groups in the House at that.</p>
<p class="contents">There was no lack of hitches in the process whereby the agreement came about; the particularly hectic voting in the Committee on Transport and Tourism springs to mind, and the fierce negotiations we held with the Council were gripping to the very last moment. On behalf of Parliament, I should like to thank the British Presidency, and particularly Mr Twigg, for his successful commitment. Indeed, he has managed to convince the Council that important concessions to Parliament were necessary. I should also like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his constructive contribution to this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to this agreement, Parliament has made considerable progress in key areas from first reading. I am pleased that Parliament has opted in favour of steering a realistic course in this. The agreement only provides for the possibility of Member States passing on infrastructural costs and not, or rather not yet, external costs, because a clear and transparent calculation model is lacking as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement does, though, considerably reinforce the environmental elements in the directive. For example, as of 2010, Member States will be required to vary the toll charges according to euro class. Toll variation is an ideal tool to promote clean road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, from 2012 onwards, Member States will be required to impose toll charges from 3.5 tonnes upwards, with exceptions, because excessive administrative costs and a negative impact on the environment should, of course, be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament regards it as essential that the agreement should contain a clear and explicit road map for passing on external costs for all transport modes, as well as an impact assessment. I can tell Commissioner Barrot that it is crucial that we gain more insight into this impact before we reach a decision. After all, we would like a positive impact on the environment and on the shift in the modes of transport. I am picking up many contrasting signals in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also remain sensitive to the economic importance of the transport sector, which is already dealing with the effects of the enlargement and high fuel prices. I should like to ask Commissioner Barrot to confirm here in this House that the Commission will be presenting a model and an impact assessment in two years’ time. This will enable us to revisit this topic during our term in office. Perhaps he could also confirm that the Commission, as soon as the report and model are ready, namely in five years’ time, will present a proposal for the directive’s revision, for that, too, is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal goes on to make statements about the future. I should like to single out two of them.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the consumer must pay, but it is, of course, not the intention for the consumer to pay twice.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the money that the consumer pays should be invested in infrastructure and sustainable transport. Parliament has taken a firmer line on this than it did at first reading, and I am pleased by the Council’s willingness to accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Socialist Group in this European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, who have signed this agreement, for their support, and let me say that I hope that other groups will follow suit. Unanimity is important if we are to send out a strong message to the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. (FR)</span> Madam President, Minister, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, ladies and gentlemen, if we are on the verge of reaching agreement with the Council on such a sensitive proposal in second reading today, it is mainly thanks to the excellent work and, if I may say so, perseverance of your rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool. My warmest congratulations to you, Madam.</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind you of the approach underlying the proposal for a directive. Its main purpose is to find answers to the imbalance and potential inefficiency facing the European transport system today. These problems were identified in the White Paper on the common transport policy. Our response is to say that if transport users are gradually made to carry the costs of the transport they use, that will help to reduce pollution and congestion and release further funding for investment in transport infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">The text we are examining today amends the present directive, which dates from 1999 and provides a framework for the imposition of tolls and user charges on Europe’s motorways.</p>
<p class="contents">The present directive is both restrictive and ineffective. Restrictive because it prohibits the imposition of tolls on any road infrastructure other than motorways. It also stipulates that infrastructure costs are the only factor to be used in calculating the level of tolls. It is nevertheless ineffective because it does not specify any method for implementing these provisions. The lack of a method of calculating infrastructure costs is detrimental to fair competition and encourages discriminatory treatment of users.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed several amendments in response to this situation. First of all, a geographical coverage extending to all the trans-European road network. Then, a start should be made – only a start, it is true, but a start nonetheless – at taking account of external costs: restrictions on the practice of discounts, and the introduction of the principle of earmarking toll receipts. While Parliament was able to give its opinion swiftly in first reading, the Council, Minister, found it more difficult to reach a decision. It took four meetings of the Council to come to an agreement, and I in turn would like to thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that transit states want to pass more of the external costs of road transport on to users. Peripheral states, for their part, want to ensure that transport will play its part in integrating their national economies into the single market, and this difference in stance between transit states and peripheral states makes discussion difficult, but it has also enabled us to find this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the three institutions have been working very hard to reach an agreement in second reading. Thanks to the European Parliament’s amendments and thanks to you, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, significant improvements have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">The text that is now on the table brings us back to the concerns to which the Commission has drawn attention in the form of declarations. The first is about the stage you have reached on the road to internalising external costs. Under the new directive, a toll mark-up will allow a partial internalisation of external costs and may be applied in mountain areas. The proceeds of this mark-up will have to be used to fund alternative transport infrastructures. The new directive will also allow greater variation in tolls to take account of vehicle pollution or road congestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of analysing the internalisation of external costs, I am pleased to say that the Commission will be able to prepare and publish the models and impact analyses requested by Parliament in the next two years. The Commission will be able to assess the need for further Community action on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concern is this directive’s geographical coverage. On this point, the new directive will allow the Member States to apply tolls and user charges to all roads. Your amendments also seek to ensure that when the Member States apply tolls they follow clear principles for their calculation so that they are fair, non-discriminatory and consistent with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the possibility of a toll mark-up in urban areas is concerned, the compromise you propose is reasonable. It is perfectly clear that if the Member States wish to introduce urban charging systems in order to reduce pollution and congestion, they are free to do so, and the example of London seems most interesting in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of the vehicles covered by the future directive, you have defined the timetables for including vehicles over 3.5 tonnes within the scope of the directive and the exemptions from it. These are wise proposals that will allow the directive to be implemented better.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has no difficulty in welcoming Parliament’s amendments, which reflect the compromise negotiated between our three institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful to you for the opportunity to say a few words in your debate on the Eurovignette dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mr Darling addressed the Committee on Transport and Tourism in June he said that the UK would do all it could to secure an agreement between the Council and Parliament during our Presidency. However, he also warned that this would not be easy because the Council had little room for manoeuvre. I know that this is also true for Parliament. I am therefore very pleased that Parliament and the Council have been able to work together to bring this important and highly political dossier to what, I hope, will be a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly congratulate Mrs Wortmann-Kool, your rapporteur, for her hard work and the dedication to find an agreement acceptable to both Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments to the existing directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles will make a real difference. In particular, they will allow Member States to do the following: levy charges on all roads rather than just motorways; charge goods vehicles down to 3.5 tonnes and not just vehicles of more than 12 tonnes; benefit from much more scope to vary tolls to influence hauliers’ behaviour to reduce congestion and pollution; impose a mark-up in mountainous regions to combat congestion and pollution and raise new funds for major trans-European network projects. The directive will provide for the Commission to develop a model for the assessment of external costs in no longer than two years.</p>
<p class="contents">This model, together with an impact assessment, will, if appropriate, allow the Commission to bring forward a proposal for further amendment of the Eurovignette directive. I am sure that I do not need to say that these are important achievements on a new directive which will balance the interests of the peripheral states and transit countries, hauliers, environmentalists and, most of all, will benefit the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate all concerned once again for managing to find a compromise that satisfies both the Council and Parliament.</p>

The draft is extremely simple, and I hope that it remains so. We can say ‘yes’ to the compromise negotiated by the rapporteur during the informal trialogue. Doing so will enable us to conclude one of the very difficult European transport dossiers this year, at second reading, whilst striking a balance between Europe’s requirements as a business location – with free movement of goods in the internal market of 25 and more – and an infrastructure costs directive that also takes very much better account than previously of environmental concerns and the health of the people having to live along European transport routes. If we say ‘no’ we shall see a different situation; there would then be a great risk of our dismissing the legislative mandate as a failure and returning to national level.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and, I hope, most of the other political groupings in this House will support the rapporteur’s proposals, both because they are good and in recognition of the rapporteur’s work. With this dossier, she has shown that even Sisyphean tasks can be completed successfully. I am much obliged to Mrs Wortmann-Kool.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also much obliged to Commission Vice-President Barrot. He and his staff have brought great expertise and even greater commitment to bear to promote and facilitate this compromise. <span class="italic">Merci, Jacques! Vous êtes vraiment un homme des montagnes!</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am also much obliged to the British Presidency. I cannot imagine that it has received much praise over the last six months, but here it is deserved.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say a few words as an Austrian. Fifteen years ago, we set ourselves the objective of reshaping European transport policy to include regard for environmental and health concerns. At that time, we received pitying smiles. Now, the day has come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this definition is true, Parliament has made full use of its possibilities in the face of the widely differing interests in our countries, and also in our parties. We are particularly obliged to the rapporteur for her excellent negotiating skills.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this legislation so fundamentally important to us Social Democrats? It brings about a Europe-wide changeover to a system of transport infrastructure costs and thus to fairer user financing of the infrastructure that is calculated on a uniform basis. Differing toll rates and arbitrariness will now be a thing of the past in Europe. At the same time, the legislation means embarking on the ‘polluter pays’ principle, with which we wish to make progress, including by charging for external costs, by the end of this parliamentary term – as both the Commissioner and the Council have told us. Embarking on a system of traffic management via variable toll rates and the fact that these are to be variable from 2010 is important to us in transport-policy terms. This constitutes a real gain in quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Toll mark-ups in sensitive regions can be used for cross-subsidising environmentally friendly modes of transport, and it is also possible to add toll mark-ups in conurbations and charge tolls on parallel and diverted traffic, which is a current problem in Germany in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">From 2012, charging tolls on lorries weighing 3.7 tonnes or more will be the rule. The burden of proof for exceptions rests with the Member States, and we have defined these fairly narrowly. I am sure that good transport-policy sense will rule out any exceptions, as the shift in the volume of freight transport to lorries weighing under 12 tonnes in Germany has now resulted in an artificial increase in traffic volume there.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we can support this compromise, which we have all achieved together, as a whole, and I eagerly await the next steps we shall take and the discussions we shall hold together here in Parliament on the internalisation of external costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Obviously we could – or perhaps should – have gone further. Charging for infrastructure will yield all its benefits only when two principles can be fully combined: the principle of ‘the polluter pays’ – and on the roads negative effects arise in terms of the environment, safety and congestion – and the broader principle of 'the user pays'. Only by combining these two principles can the two aims be made to converge, namely allocation, which in our case means influencing the modal shift, and recovery of the inherent cost of charging.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s compromise only provides for application of the ‘user pays’ principle. In terms of ‘the polluter pays’ we shall just have to be satisfied with the fact that the shift from financing infrastructure out of general taxes to financing it at least partially out of tariffs is a precondition for any internalisation of external costs, which we have been promised after yet another in a long series of evaluations by the Commission, which, as we have been repeatedly told, will be completed within the next two years.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are also other types of reference in the measure to the principle of ‘the polluter pays’. The reference is clear where variations in the amount of the toll are permitted in relation to the emission category to which the vehicles belong and to the day or time of use of the infrastructure, or rather less obvious where the possibility of a toll mark-up is allowed where a route crosses sensitive areas such as mountainous regions. Incidentally, this latter rule can certainly help overcome difficult situations such as that currently affecting the section between Turin and Lyon in the Susa Valley.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, however, this directive addresses environmental problems, congestion and safety most effectively through a surrender of competence: it has been decided not to treat urban areas in the same way as sensitive mountain regions, yet on the other hand the full compatibility of the Eurovignette has been recognised, with urban tolls <span class="italic">à la</span> Ken Livingstone being used directly to regulate congestion and combat pollution. It is a first step; let us just be grateful for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tolls are a hot issue. We also had very heated debates and close votes in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue was central, and that was transport costs; that was the issue that most inflamed passions. In particular, it encountered the strongest resistance from Transport Ministers. It is essential to charge for these external costs if we are serious about wanting to protect health and the environment; these costs have to be charged to polluters at long last. For, currently, the European taxpayer is paying these costs and, furthermore, for this very reason, the railways find it difficult or impossible to make themselves competitive. We did make some progress during our negotiations with the Council, but too little. Nevertheless, I should like to thank the rapporteur and also my colleagues for this progress. We shall be able to support a large proportion of what has been negotiated, but not the loopholes, of which there are the following: Germany’s derogation from the obligation to charge tolls for vehicles weighing up to 12 tonnes – that will be a lengthy job, I fear – and Italy’s multiple-driver bonus, which will also be a lengthy job. All of this just because the Transport Ministers did not listen to the man on the street, but only to lobbyists from the HGV transport industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We pay for it in the shape of air pollution, noise pollution and the excessive space that it takes up. That is why a drastic shift away from roads to rail and water is necessary, as is the reduction of needless transport. One of the means of achieving this is for road transport to pay for all pollution itself and thus to become more expensive than rail transport. Switzerland is a good example in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise proposal for charging toll is better than the directive we have at the moment, but too many loopholes and exceptions have crept in. There is every likelihood that Member States will wait for the Commission’s promised calculation model, which will require the go-ahead from the Council and Parliament in two years’ time. As a result, interested governments will try to put off passing on the environmental costs <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The most polluting trucks are exempt until 2010. Smaller lorries under 12 tonnes fall outside of the directive’s scope until 2010, and Member States can simply exempt these lighter vehicles. There is also no guarantee whatsoever that the toll proceeds will be ploughed back into sustainable means of transport, such as freight railways. Member States can, if they so wish, invest the full amount in asphalt. My group would have liked to endorse amendments that are geared to more and quicker results, which this compromise does not cater for. The main thing is that at least now a start has been made on the introduction of this desperately needed toll charge on lorry traffic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems I have with the Eurovignette are both technical and relate to reasons of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In issues of taxation of this nature the European Union has no competence. These matters are rightly the purview of Member States, and, before I am corrected, let me say that the Eurovignette is a tax, not a toll, since the Commission proposes hypothecating revenue from what can only be called a stealth tax. This goes way beyond its remit.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure the President-in-Office will confirm that in the UK alone over GBP 40 billion is taken in road-related taxes, yet only GBP 8 billion is reinvested in the transport infrastructure – far from being tax-neutral. If I know national governments well, the end result of this proposal would be tantamount to double taxation. This is only the thin end of the wedge. The Eurovignette is the precursor to tolling on all vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">I fundamentally oppose such measures. We already have iniquitous levels of taxation in the road sector, and this is no different. Not to mention the ‘big brother’ approach that is being taken to how this will eventually be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">On technical matters, the internalisation of external costs offers no verifiable scientific evidence to support the claims being made. To try and build into legislation arbitrarily such issues as environmental damage, which cannot be calculated with any confidence, is plainly ludicrous. The European Union is consistent in its claims to promote competition and competitiveness, yet it is just as consistent in failing to do so.</p>

I am pleased that you, a skilled environmental politician, are present to see us make good progress with a European sustainable transport policy by adopting the infrastructure costs directive. Of course, we have not yet reached the end of the road; we are a long way from achieving our objective. The fact that we have come as far as we have, however, is due in large part to my colleague Mrs Wortmann-Kool. Therefore, I offer her my compliments and my sincere thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to discuss two important points. We are discussing freight transport, and we cannot restrict ourselves to lorries weighing 40, 12 or 7.5 tonnes or more here, but want vehicles weighing 3.5 tonnes or more to be subject to tolls. It is then up to the Member States, too, to meet their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we know that the costs of freight transport far exceed those of just constructing and repairing roads. The external costs for users must be calculated at long last, therefore, and can no longer be dressed up. It is quite possible to calculate these external environmental, noise, congestion and health costs, even if my colleague Mr Bradbourn takes a different view. According to a study, transport by road incurs external costs of EUR 88 per thousand tonne-kilometres, whereas the figures for transport by rail and inland waterway are EUR 19 and EUR 17, respectively. According to very conservative estimates, external costs make up at least 60% of infrastructure costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise envisages that we meet again in two years’ time. Therefore, the compromise entails a very great responsibility and obligation for the Commissioner. That is, we are expecting to see not only the model, but also legislative proposals in two years’ time, and I can already anticipate the quarters from which he will have to fend off the arrows. We shall hear arguments along the lines that this is not serious, is scientifically untenable and, if need be, puts jobs at risk. That is why I ask the Commissioner to make courageous proposals. The vast majority in Parliament will support you in this.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, this directive responds to the profound imbalances in the transport system, within which road transport is progressively increasing its share and is in danger of collapse. Meanwhile, there are certain other forms of transport that are losing share and volume, as in the case of goods by rail. I believe that railways are a more sustainable and less polluting means of transport than lorries, and that we must discriminate positively in their favour until they can manage by themselves. Goods transport by rail is still subordinate to passenger transport by rail and its average speed is therefore not very competitive. We must construct more sections of line exclusively for goods and, if we do that, we will enjoy clear economic and environmental benefits in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect relates to the need to promote the interoperability of European toll systems. There are stretches of our network in which, within little more than twenty-five kilometres, there are five motorway toll stations, which inevitably increases congestion. We are still awaiting the proposed legislation in this regard from the Commission. Let us hope that it does not take five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It harms the railways, which cannot withstand the unfair competition between rail and road, and whose market share, according to the McKinsey study, will fall from 14% today to 9% if the privileges of the roads are not dismantled.</p>
<p class="contents">The German right-left coalition government has pushed through huge loopholes enabling each Member State to charge the toll only on 12-tonne lorries, which make up only 10% of such vehicles. The railways will be decisively weakened as a result, because in Germany there is a railway toll for all trains on all tracks in the form of train-path prices. On the roads, this applies only to lorries weighing 12 tonnes or more, and that only on the motorways. Unfair competition is not being ended, but reinforced. Neither Germany nor Europe will achieve the Kyoto objectives like this. The German blockade renders the shift from road to rail impossible. This directive means that there is no future for the European railways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One question remains, however. Has the rapporteur led us to the goal we have set ourselves? Needless to say, this goal is to improve transport infrastructure, and by this I mean not only improvements to road infrastructure. Related goals include cutting traffic jams, reducing the number of accidents and limiting emissions of harmful substances.</p>
<p class="contents">We would only be able to answer this question in the positive if there were a guarantee – I repeat, a guarantee – that all of the revenue from the Eurovignette would be earmarked for transport-related objectives. Yet no such guarantee has been given. Those Members who have commented, both today and on other occasions, that these charges may well be used as a stealth tax by the Member States were therefore entirely right to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying, of course, that the rapporteur could not do anything to settle this issue, since it is unquestionably covered by the subsidiarity principle. At the same time, however, if we suffer a defeat on this matter, and if the Member States bail themselves out by using revenue from the Eurovignette to plug the holes in their budgets, the whole point of these new regulations will be undermined. I would therefore call on the European Commission to monitor the way in which revenue from the Eurovignette is spent as closely as possible. It would also be a good idea for Parliament to be informed of any irregularities in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to remind Commissioner Barrot that this directive is his brainchild too. He should attend to it with particular devotion, and lavish care and attention on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will be voting in favour of this text tomorrow, albeit with some reluctance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in fact talking about the financing of our ambitions, which appear in the 2001 White Paper and are meant to stabilise transport’s modal shares or even to finance alternative modes of transport. Those considerable ambitions were expressed in the 30 priority projects. We now know, however, that the TEN budget will not be as much as the Commission is asking for to finance the large-scale projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We might have expected the ‘Eurovignette’ directive to be much more ambitious. Unfortunately, it, too, is a subsidiary tool. Member States who do not want to apply it will not be required to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a tool designed mainly to use road transport to finance road transport. It would only finance other modes of transport occasionally. I am very much afraid that, in order to reach a compromise – and we should perhaps have used the conciliation procedure – the European Parliament will drop some of its ambitions tomorrow, that it will not be firm enough on external costs and in particular on the sunset clause that Mr El Khadraoui has tabled in an amendment. That means that if the Commission and the Member States fail to propose a directive within the time required, the automatic clause will apply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that it is right that we have uniform rules at long last. After all, the 21st century should not go down in history as having robber barons still practising in Europe. It is also important, however, that the money generated from the infrastructure flows back into the infrastructure and is not just used for plugging budgetary holes.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few things about the external costs. We also have to ask which costs are already internalised today and which are not. Is it possible that there is an external benefit against which they must be offset? The congestion costs have been internalised: they are paid by transport operators, because their lorries are not moving and thus cannot generate any gross national product. The social costs have been internalised via insurance premiums: may I make that very clear. In addition, as far as the environmental costs are concerned, we should not forget that every lorry and every car also pays vehicle and fuel tax.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable, therefore, for the transport sector to have to pay for everything, for funding, and on top of this for the money to flow into general budgets. I am a little surprised by what Mr Cramer says. I would recommend he take a look at the trend in the freight transport volume of Deutsche Bahn AG from September 1998 to October 2005. In the seven years in which his party shared power in the German Government, the volume of freight transport by rail fell by half. His party also imposed the environmental tax on the railways. I would advise him, therefore, not to give any speeches here about things for which, in essence, he is partly responsible. That is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A result that, if all goes well, will be the end, for the time being, of a long and laborious negotiation process. It is provisional because a great deal of homework is yet to be done in terms of external costs, one of the key bottlenecks. The Commission will need to develop a calculation method for the external costs within two years, upon which a fresh initiative will need to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Some will claim that compromise Amendment 37 does not go far enough. Needless to say, I have a great deal of sympathy for this viewpoint, having myself tabled, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, an oral amendment that goes much further with a view to keeping the pressure on in order to make quicker progress in terms of external costs, the well-known 60% rule.</p>
<p class="contents">We scrapped this in the compromise, which means that things will all take a little longer. This may be a concession, but this is offset by the fact that the Council, in its common position, had not made any reference to external costs, and had to make a U-turn without there being any turning back now. The principle of external costs in toll charges will be accepted and applied.</p>
<p class="contents">This is surely considerable progress on the road to fairer competition between the modes of transport, with the underlying principle being that the polluter pays. Combined with the fact that the revenue from toll charges will be used for investments in the whole of the transport system, and thus not only roads, means that possibilities are being created for alternative modes of transport, such as rail transport and inland shipping, which is a giant leap forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is therefore good that this compromise first of all takes account of different geographical situations, secondly makes it possible to fix the price of infrastructure in ways that accurately reflect the cost to national economies and, thirdly, makes it possible to have different tolls for different euroclasses. This is important in countries where long distances and light traffic mean that it is never possible to bring about a situation in which costs are fully covered.

The current status of discussions on the infrastructure costs directive is more or less satisfactory.

<p class="contents">In any case, the ‘Eurovignette Directive’ signifies a decision for the future, which we see as moving towards a more people-friendly and environmentally friendly transport policy, as indeed it must. In this regard, it is of course essential that the Directive be usable – apart from the peculiar German derogations for lorries weighing 3.5 tonnes or more mentioned by Mrs Lichtenberger – and that tolls be permitted not only on roads forming part of the trans-European transport network, but also on diversion and parallel routes.</p>

Secondly, we are introducing charges that are in proportion to road usage. Thirdly, the directive will mean extra costs for road hauliers. At the same time, however, the directive is crucial as a source of funding for road construction. This is vitally important for the new Member States, including my own country, Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is absolutely essential for the sustainable development of branched transport infrastructures. I should like to remind Commissioner Barrot, however, that we must carry out a systematic impact assessment for this directive.
