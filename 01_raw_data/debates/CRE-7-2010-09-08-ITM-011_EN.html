Today, I am going to talk about the substance of the question. A 200 metre-long helicopter carrier, with the capability of carrying at one and the same time, 16 heavy helicopters, 40 tanks, 900 service personnel, landing craft, and equipped with a military hospital. France wishes to sell four such aggressive warships to Russia, without consulting the other European Union Member States. I would remind you that 18 months ago, Russia attacked its neighbour Georgia and has still not complied with the terms of the truce negotiated by the President of France. Furthermore, last autumn, Russia carried out military exercises on the Estonian border, aimed at the occupation of the Baltic States. I should like to pose all of you a question. What is the European Union, and why do we need it? In the spring, when Greece was severely struck by the financial crisis, Europe had a choice – to help or to let Greece sink. In a show of solidarity, the countries of Europe decided to help Greece, for there was a common understanding among the Member States that, if the financial situation in Greece got any worse, it would also get worse in other European Union Member States. The external security sphere is no exception. We have bound ourselves by agreements to act in solidarity in this sphere too. Many European Union Member States have serious concerns about where and for what purposes Russia would station and use such aggressive warships. Jobs in France are important. However, they cannot be created at the cost of other EU Member States’ security. Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you not to allow the sale of arms of any description to third countries before the issue has been discussed in the Council and there is absolute certainty that such a transaction would serve to strengthen and not weaken the security situation throughout the European Union. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Baroness Ashton is unable to attend this session, she has asked the Presidency to stand in for her during this debate and I will therefore endeavour to answer some of the questions that we have received on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, for some years now, the European Union has played a leading role in the control of arms exports, both regionally and internationally, and our aim is clear: we want to prevent the export of military technologies that could be used for undesirable ends such as internal repression or international aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 10 years ago, the Council adopted an EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which set out a series of criteria for exporting conventional arms. This code was replaced in 2008 by a common position that introduced a number of new elements, resulting in the European Union having the strongest system of arms export control in the world. The common position’s legally binding provisions are there to ensure that Member States carry out arms exports in a responsible and transparent fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the common position is to effectively coordinate national policies on the control of arms exports using, in particular, a denial notification and consultation mechanism. This mechanism means that, when a Member State is planning to grant an export licence which has been previously denied by another Member State for an essentially identical transaction, it must consult this Member State and notify all Member States of its final decision. In other words, the Member State granting a licence for a transaction that has been denied by another Member State must provide a detailed explanation of its decision to all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in answer to questions about consultations, the situation is clear: the common position obviously only calls for systematic consultation when a licence for an identical transaction has previously been denied.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, Member State delegations within the competent structures of the Council regularly and often exchange information on the control of arms and, in particular, on so-called ‘sensitive’ destinations. Member States often solicit the opinions of other members of the Council on any destination that might give cause for concern or about which there might be any doubt. This regular exchange of information forms a central pillar of the European Union’s policy for the control of arms exports.</p>
<p class="contents">For your information, during the course of 2009, consultations between Member States looked at a total of 14 third-country destinations. Member States then communicated what led them to decide whether to grant or deny export licences to these destinations.</p>

<p class="contents">What it needs, however, are common rules and a coordinated approach in order to enhance the development and competitiveness of the European defence industry and, at the same time, to ensure that this development is in line with Europe’s principles and international commitments. To that end, together with the directive on the internal market in defence, the December 2008 common position defining procedures and criteria for military exports to third countries was an important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, these procedures do not include a general consultation mechanism. However, the common position does include a timely reference to the need to enhance cooperation and convergence in this field within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. Until the hoped-for progress on this front, and until such time as the creation of a common defence system makes it possible to adopt even more binding mechanisms, the cooperation and convergence referred to in Article 7 should not remain just on paper and the annual report on military exports should be made available to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the question tabled by the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) seems implicitly – although it has now been made explicit – not to confine itself to matters of a general nature. Given that it would have been better to refer to things by their names right from the start, it does not seem that the sale of French ships to Russia contravenes the 2008 common position. On the contrary, such exports could strengthen European-Russian ties and cooperation in the security field and make them more binding. These ties, however, should be removed from the bilateral sphere and be entirely addressed, discussed and managed at a European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This concerns the old question of European competence. In the constitutional and government conferences, we were not able to include arms trading within the general European sphere of competence. I believe it would be sensible to continue trying to achieve this, so that the Code of Conduct and the regulations introduced by the Council in 2008 can be made more binding. The European Parliament should work towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it seems to me to be clear that it should not be possible in this context for there to be so little contact between the Member States that individual Member States have the feeling that arms exports to third countries take place at their expense and threaten their security. Whether this is right or wrong, the case is almost irrelevant. For this reason, I believe that we need to find more effective European solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am of the opinion that greater European cooperation is required, among other things, for reasons of industrial policy, for example, via the European Defence Agency, with regard to exports, research, planning, production and procurement, because when a country has its own arms industry, this is related to its independence. If a country does not have its own arms industry and has to buy all its military equipment from third countries, it is dependent for its security on other states. This concerns our freedom and is not only related to economic factors, although I cannot deny that these also play a role.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to put everything into context and then we will be able to give this area a much stronger sense of community, without misunderstandings arising among the Member States like the one which understandably occurred recently among the Baltic States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU Code of Conduct, which has been a legally binding text since 2008, is a good step but is not enough, as has also been mentioned by our Liberal colleague. We should continue work on the global-level arms trade because the EU has a great responsibility. We are responsible for one third of the volume in arms trade.</p>
<p class="contents">If the proposition is that Russia is our strategic partner and we can cooperate on military affairs with Russia, for me it is a question of logic. Why does our friend need an assault weapon system? To participate in an effort to organise some sort of good governance in Afghanistan? No, Moscow has no intention of participating in that operation. To protect human and minority rights in Kyrgyzstan? No, and in both cases Mistral is no use because it cannot approach these landlocked countries. It will change the situation in the Black Sea – not for better, but for worse – and also affect eight European Union Member States around the Baltic Sea. The security situation of those states – from Poland and Germany to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – will worsen.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Gualtieri that cooperation with our strategic partner is a good thing but, believe me, there are other means of cooperating with Russia than high-tech weapon systems. Think about cars – this is something Russian industry is also struggling with. Think about cooperation between fire brigades. The Russian fire fighters were in trouble this summer when an area of forest equal to the size of Belgium was burning.</p>

Clearly this is not a matter where the EU decides, nor should it be. The common position, of course, urges exporting Member States to consider, inter alia, the preservation of regional peace, security and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case which seems to be the focus of this discussion, we should be aware of the sensitive nature of the situation in both the Baltic and Black Sea regions. As far as the Black Sea is concerned, we should recall the recent conflict in Georgia and the fact that, of the six Black Sea littoral states, three – Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania – are NATO members, and two others – Georgia and Ukraine – are NATO partners and aspiring members. We might therefore question the wisdom of the sale of amphibious assault vessels to the sixth: Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are well-established mechanisms to cover issues related to arms exports. In the EU context, this is the Council working group on conventional arms exports – COARM – which meets formally about every six weeks in Brussels. As it is intergovernmental, it is the right forum for discussion of arms exports; a Strasbourg plenary session is not. We should let COARM get on with its work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have failed to meet this target in many areas, but not as far as arms exports from the EU are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In the period from 2005 to 2009, the EU Member States overtook the United States and became the world’s leading arms exporters. I think that this development is highly questionable. Obviously, the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which was never legally binding and which included a restrictive export licensing practice, consisted of empty words. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was converted into a common position in December 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we still have no effective sanction mechanisms. For example, long before 2008, Germany recognised the Code of Conduct as being legally binding. Despite this, Germany is now the third largest arms exporter in the world and supplies arms to crisis regions such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. In addition, the arms export reports which the Member States submit to the Council are not uniform and often not transparent. We urgently need standardisation in this area, so that all the relevant arms exports are traceable and can be subjected to critical evaluation. Unfortunately, almost no efforts are being made to standardise these reports. In any case, I doubt whether it is possible to have a system of ethically sound arms exports. However, one thing is certain and that is that the European Union is currently a very long way from achieving this.</p>

The fixed costs are self-evidently and inevitably high, which makes it uneconomic for most – if not all – countries to manufacture arms for their own use only. It would be tempting for some arms manufacturing countries simply to have a policy to export arms to any country other than ones that it has reason to believe might attack itself or its interests. That would maximise the interests of the country producing the arms. However, it would at best be an amoral policy and, at worst, a thoroughly immoral one.</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria stated in the original question for deciding whether to export arms are many and varied. Different criteria might apply to different kinds of weaponry. Countries with poor human rights records such as Iran – and, for that matter, those EU countries that lock people up for political dissent or heretical opinion, such as half the countries in the EU – should be denied small arms, surveillance systems and articles of restraint, but might not be denied weaponry to protect them from external attack.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries that are prone to waging aggressive wars, but respect the rights of their own citizens, might be sold small arms and restraint mechanisms, but not weapons of mass destruction. In particular, the United States – arguably the most aggressive country on the planet, having waged countless destabilising, aggressive and illegal wars – should be denied any technology that might be used for weapons of mass destruction.</p>

He said that it was very expensive for many individual states with smaller arms industries to produce arms cost-effectively. Of course, the conclusion I draw from this is different from his, namely that within the European Union, we should produce the necessary military equipment more cheaply via the European Defence Agency and via common procurement programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would first like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his statement. I think it is very important in political terms for us to be able to state here that we have the most modern legally binding criteria for arms exports in the world. In my opinion, the European Union should be proud of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I have one question for the President-in-Office of the Council. You have explained the type of cases where consultation takes place and this obviously only happens when an identical application from a state has been rejected and another state intends to authorise an export application. Were the discussions on this subject restricted to the Council working group or, and this is my second question, has this already been discussed at a political level in the Council of Ministers? In this context, this is another question which interests me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would have been helpful to have more clarity when raising this question. On the other hand, we must recognise that some Central and Eastern European countries are particularly sensitive and feel less secure than the old European Union Member States. The Council Common Position of 8 December 2008 drew up certain guidelines in the area of arms exports. Experts recognise that the country we are talking about today – France – did not exceed the limits of these guidelines, but that does not mean that when implementing security and defence policy increasingly in practice, we should not improve and revise those guidelines and rules. I agree entirely with the opinion of my fellow Member, Elmar Brok, that we must cooperate more in the area of arms. As for arms exports, we must ensure that there is more trust and less suspicion: sometimes well-founded, sometimes spread without reason. The latter pits large and small, old and new EU Member States dangerously against each other. We need more trust and solidarity, which will not appear of its own accord. We must talk more, engage in constructive consultations and avoid heated accusations and artificial parallels with the beginning or middle of the 20th century, when the might is right dominated Europe. We must improve the consultation mechanism within the EU to achieve a concrete result. Then, this discussion will also be of some benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The largest and richest Member States do what they like, and do not pay attention to the standards and rules about which so much is being said today. Only in the last few days, we have heard once again of the sale by France of Mistral assault vessels to Russia. If this matter has not yet been finalised, it is only because Russia has initiated special tender procedures, but in any case, we know the transfer will go ahead. In the meantime, a Russian Admiral has recently said about the Russian aggression against Georgia that if Russia had possessed Mistral assault vessels, the war against Georgia would not have taken four or five days, but only two hours. Should EU Member States really be selling such weapons when it is known that the purchasing countries are not going to use the weapons for defensive purposes, but for offensive ones? Meanwhile, Georgia has not been able to buy defensive weapons from EU Member States for years, because there is a special embargo in place on the purchase of these weapons.

Israel is a state which does not respect international law, which tramples over human rights and which has invaded Gaza and I should like, at this point, to say to those who tabled the question that I have not heard one voice raised, in the wake of recent events, calling for provision to be made for the sanction of a ban on exports of military equipment and arms, together with the other sanctions which need to be imposed on Israel, which does not meet these criteria, sanctions which, for the rest, they have touched on in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The first speaker referred, within the framework of political solidarity in Europe, to the example of Greece. May I remind you that, while criterion 8 of the common position states that, when one Member State of the European Union wants to export arms to another, it must take account of the economic standing of the country to which it is exporting, in the case of Greece, France and Germany are putting pressure on it to buy their arms in order to secure their political support and are doing so at a time when Greece is in very dire financial straits and is subject to numerous controls, at a time when pensions, salaries and so on are being cut in the country.</p>

Firstly, as the issue at stake was France’s position regarding the sale of the Mistral, may I remind you that no firm agreement has been reached, that the Mistral is a vessel, a ship that would be sold unarmed – which is really one of the fundamental issues at the heart of talks with Russia – and that Russia has not only entered into negotiations with France to purchase this type of equipment. So, allow me to put things into perspective. I realise that there is a great deal of emotion in some countries, but emotion is one thing, the facts are quite another.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as you pointed out, Minister, we have within the European Union a code of conduct for arms exports that became a common position under the French Presidency in 2008; this code of conduct is one of the most demanding in the world. We are above exemplary on the matter, and we have, in addition to this code of conduct, as one of our fellow Members reminded us, a group that meets on a regular basis as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss not only the implementation of this code but also Member States’ national policies on arms exports. There are, therefore, forums in which the Mistral issue can be dealt with quite adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, allow me to say that, if we are talking about European solidarity on arms exports and if we are looking at the need to have a common strategy and a common defence policy, we need to look at the entire cycle of trade in arms and defence equipment. That also involves imports and obviously the defence industry. From that point of view, I believe that many countries also have a long way to go to ensure that Europe can maintain technologies, jobs, know-how and a real strategic capacity in our military deployments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The export of weapons and military equipment to third countries, especially those that are dubious democracies, where human rights are infringed, and which collaborate with countries where signs of terrorism can be observed, can pose a serious threat not only to the European Union but also to third countries. That is precisely why it must be considered as an important arm of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. How can we talk of a common defence policy, as Mr Barroso did yesterday, if every country can carry out its own separate arms trading? France’s decision to sell a Mistral warship constitutes a direct transfer of military technology to a third country that does not have a military alliance with Europe. We must recognise that technology transfer most certainly does not, of itself, mean that the relevant country has or will become more friendly towards the European Union, as Mr Lelouch, the French European Affairs minister and some honourable Members have maintained in today’s debate. No European Union strategy will succeed if it does not adhere to commonly adopted principles. That applies equally to solidarity between the countries of the European Union and to the recognition of common interests in the decision-making process. The Treaty on European Union and the Council Common Position defining common rules governing the control of exports of military technology and equipment both stress the importance of solidarity. Individual short-term economic interests must not stand in the way of the European Union’s common priorities and objectives. Decisions with an impact on the European Union’s foreign and security policy must be taken jointly in consultation with all the EU Member States, and an adequate and legally binding mechanism, under which all the possible consequences are analysed according to jointly developed criteria, must be drawn up for them. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us not forget that, in the United States, tanks are manufactured on just one production line, while in Europe, they are manufactured on 16 different production lines. Consequently, we would have economies of scale. However, bearing in mind the Council’s 2008 common position on controls of arms exports, we must admit, Mr Chastel, that there is no real control. I do not refer to France; I refer to every country in Europe, just as no real controls are carried out in order to ascertain if the countries to which we export are, in turn, exporting to third countries, in other words, are intermediaries, to which we would never give arms.</p>
<p class="contents">I get the impression that the group set up within the framework of the CFSP is not in a position to control the Member States in order to ascertain where exactly they are exporting arms. If we manage to apply this common position and if there are specific restrictions, then we shall have made a successful step. However, we shall only be really successful in controlling arms exports if we manage to create a truly common defence agency and arms manufacturing agency which allow us to reduce the cost and, at the same time, to support our principles and values and to demonstrate them in practice in the case of the production and export of arms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something we have heard many times. Mr Barroso also talks about common defence. In my view, however, the policy is not coherent if we do not also include the defence industry and arms exports. As has been said, the EU Treaty includes – and this must, of course, be a given – the principle of solidarity and a requirement for the Member States to consult one another within the Council and the European Council on any matter of foreign and security policy. Could this be put any clearer?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s Common Position of 8 December 2008 lays down common rules for the control of military technology and equipment. Where have these common positions gone? Have they not reached France? Have they perhaps not even reached us? The EU Member States of Lithuania, Estonia and Poland, as well as Georgia, claim that the sale of the Mistral warship to Russia has reduced the security of these countries. Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, has said that if Russia had had a Mistral class ship at the time of the conflict with Georgia, the Russian Black Sea Fleet would have performed its operation in 40 minutes instead of 26 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">The large Member States must not be allowed to take liberties. We know that large countries would very much like to have a monopoly on arms exports, which is quite obviously unacceptable. It should be the task of the country holding the Presidency, Belgium, to start discussions within the EU with the aim of achieving clear common provisions on arms exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, citizens of several Member States have become seriously worried about imminent exports of modern military technology to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a year ago, Russia conducted military manoeuvres in north-eastern Europe, the scenarios of which targeted the Baltic States as objects of military invasion. We have the famous words of the commander of the Russian navy to the effect that, if it had had Mistral carriers at its disposal in August 2008, it would have been able to complete its operation in three hours rather than three days.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy with the statement made by Secretary of State Chastel, which I consider a very positive reaction to our worries, and at the declaration made by our colleague, Mr Danjean, that no military technology will be sold. However, the Russians have insisted – and will continue to insist – on buying precisely that military technology.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still one question to be answered, which is why do we not have consultations and normal debates in the Council in cases where one Member State is prepared to sell military technology to a third country? That is our message to the Council. We would draw attention to the necessity of routinely discussing, within the European Council, exports of military equipment to third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have always been, and still can be, suspicions of stirring up conflicts and destabilisation of regions. Supervision of the export of weapons, as previous speakers have stressed, is also difficult. On the other hand, the arms industry is an important area of the economy for many of the European Union’s Member States. Arms are exported by France, Great Britain, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and many other Member States, and also by the United States, Russia and other countries outside the European Union. We are, therefore, very far from a situation in which the production and export of weapons becomes the subject of EU policy. Today, the Member States have a great degree of autonomy in this area, but they do need to harmonise their regulations in accordance with the Council Common Position of 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">A short comment about Mistral – fellow Members from France ought to understand the anxiety of the Baltic states and Poland.

Members did not receive a satisfactory answer. In relation to this, the Council must take specific steps in this matter in order to satisfy those who have asked this question, all the more so because the question has been given a context, which has been mentioned here several times, both by Mr Kelam and by Mr Czarnecki. I refer to the way in which military commanders in Russia are treating this type of weapon and, in particular, to the fact that the Mistral assault vessels are an offensive weapon. This must suggest the thought that this is not only a matter of making a sale, but should also give rise to questions about what the consequences of that sale would be. We do realise that the 2008 directive is in force, but we must also accept that sometimes, there is more to life than the provisions of a directive and existing regulations. The case of control of the conflict in Georgia, in which the European Union is interested and which has not been resolved, shows that such a decision is needed here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I would like to support those who are proposing that a discussion be held at a meeting of the full Council on Union policy in the area of export and military cooperation. For example, we have a considerable number of remarks and doubts in relation to the export of Mistral assault vessels to Moscow, but if we look at it another way and think about, for example, the construction of a European anti-missile defence system, I think it would be in our interest to involve Russia. In other words, to put it briefly, these matters are not as obvious as they may appear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bearing in mind that the European Union is producing weapons non-stop at the moment, and that there are almost 30 wars around the world, as well as countless other conflicts, whether regional or local, we should also realise that we are producing weapons that are directly intended for destruction and for killing.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we should also give some thought to whether we would prefer the money which we contribute every year to the budgets of individual states for arming or equipping individual armies to be transferred in some way to education, which would actually be far more useful than weapons in a time of economic crisis. It would also interest me very much how some of you might perhaps answer the question: how many individual Member States have reduced their defence budgets in this time of economic crisis and by how much? Perhaps we should all give some thought to that, because I do not think we are providing a good example to the younger generations by believing that shooting, for example, which is actually a form of destruction, should be elevated to the level of an Olympic sport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to reframe the concept of responsibility. Article 4(2) of the common position lays down that the decision to transfer or deny the transfer of any military technology or equipment shall remain at the national discretion of each Member State. Consequently, this responsibility rests, first of all, at national level and clearly, the common position does not take this responsibility away from Member States but it does introduce a broad range of provisions to ensure effective coordination and exchange of information between them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concept that I would like to come back to is the concept of transparency. The common position lays down that Member States must draw up an annual report on their arms exports. A European Union report drawn up on the basis of these national reports shall be published annually providing information on the financial value of the licences granted, broken down according to destination and category of military equipment, as well as on the number of licences refused and any subsequent consultations with Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the European Union’s annual report, the common position requires Member States to publish national reports concerning exports of military technology and equipment. The aim of transparency sought by the common position, therefore, applies both at European Union level and at national level, but it is true that the European Union should set an example in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that, as several of you have pointed out, the common position represents considerable progress compared with the code of conduct. The common position was adopted in December 2008, that is, less than two years ago. It is reasonable for us to allow the new provisions introduced by the common position time to take effect before embarking on any revision of a new system of this kind, even though, having listened to you and indeed understood what you have been saying, it may seem tempting to make it more restrictive or link it with a system of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to clarify a very specific issue, I would like to say, rest assured, that the common position has been discussed on many occasions at the political level, in the Council in particular, especially in the context of the arms embargo on China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
