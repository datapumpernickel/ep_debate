<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, last Saturday we commemorated the fact that the world suddenly changed three years ago. In this presentation, I would first like to look back and explain the basis for our policy, then address the current situation in the fight against terrorism before going into the work programme of the Dutch presidency. I will end with a few words on cooperation with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 11 September 2001, it has become clear that terrorist attacks are closer to us than we wanted to believe. It is a threat that we cannot neglect. We have all seen the horrific terrorist attacks on television. We are witnesses to these attacks and are also jointly responsible for ensuring that they do not happen again. What we have seen, both outside the European Union – in Jakarta, Beslan, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East – and inside the European Union – in Madrid six months ago – requires action now and in the future. Every attack poses new questions which require new answers and pose new challenges that we have to address jointly through concrete action. We need to protect our citizens better. We need to continue to look at our policy instruments in close cooperation with others. There are no quick fixes for terrorism. In the long battle against terrorism, two key words spring to mind: protection and cooperation, as well as the idea of protection through cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">On protection, the European Union has done a lot in the last three years. We have improved our legislation and widened our policy instruments. We have drawn up and implemented new measures to protect borders, aircraft, etc. We have started to put security first, also at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">On cooperation, the terrorist attacks have taught us that internal and external security cannot be separated: they are two sides of the same coin. There are two basic reasons for this: firstly, terrorism does not stop at borders and, secondly, terrorism is a global threat: it can happen – and indeed has happened – anywhere in the world. True protection can therefore be realised only through international cooperation. We also have to look carefully at whether our approach matches those of our partner countries in order to create sufficient possibilities for close cooperation. National and international action should be dovetailed for their mutual strengthening.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is an attack not only on our political and economic freedom, but also on our norms and values: liberty, democracy, tolerance and the rule of law, values that we have to defend. Terrorism is also not just an attack on western values, it is an attack on universal values which form the foundation for the United Nations. The only way to defeat terrorism is to confront it. We must therefore be strong and active to fight this many-headed monster. There might be a temptation to believe that any measure could be used in this fight. But here, we have to be cautious. In our common fight, we should uphold the norms and values that terrorism is seeking to destroy.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism to a large extent boils down to security, which is the core of our existence. A new approach to security has been developed, through various processes, with a view to taking more conclusive action against terrorists and preventing new attacks. The UN is at the core. UN Security Council Resolution 1373 has forced countries to improve their policies on terrorism, not only in word but also in deed, not only by improving old legislation or by drafting new legislation but also by implementing it. The resolution contains <span class="italic">inter alia</span> measures to combat the financing of terrorism and promotes efforts that should lead to the prevention of terrorism and the punishment of terrorists. The counter-terrorism agenda, incorporated in UN Security Council Resolution 1373, should therefore be considered to be the most important global point of reference for action – action that has to be taken by all United Nations Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European Union, the European Council and the General Affairs Council – as well as other Council formations such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council, the Transport Council and Ecofin – has actively worked, from 9/11 onwards, on setting up, implementing and refining an extensive EU action plan. Amongst other things, this involved a European arrest warrant, joint investigation teams, Eurojust and legislation on terrorist financing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also been active as regards external policy. The key issue of security is at the centre of the European Security Strategy, which should contribute to a stronger multilateral system. It should address various threats – including terrorism – through active, more coherent internal and external action, with stronger capacities and in close cooperation with our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also decided to include a terrorism clause in new contractual relations with third countries, similar to the human rights clause. This will allow us to hold serious consultations with third countries which are not fully observing their international obligations in the fight against terrorism, including with regard to the implementation of Resolution 1373. By adopting the carrot-and-stick approach – carrots taking the form of assistance – we use the political and economic power of the European Union in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the presidency programme. The work programme of the Netherlands presidency in the field of counter-terrorism is extensive and wide-ranging. In addition to a strong focus on implementation of EU measures and legislation, it entails new initiatives in many fields. An important tool in this matter is the EU Counter-Terrorism Action Plan. It was adopted by the European Council after the horrendous attacks in Madrid last March. The presidency works in close cooperation with the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr Gijs de Vries, to implement and complement this action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Key areas in which we, as presidency, want to take substantial steps forward are Justice and Home Affairs, improvement of cooperation between intelligence services, prevention of terrorist financing and strengthening of the EU's external policies and counter-terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">On Justice and Home Affairs, we will focus on the implementation of measures like the European arrest warrant. We also need to improve the way our intelligence agencies work together. Having good information on what terrorists are planning and preparing to do is our first line of defence. The EU Action Plan already outlines some of the steps that we intend to take and Mr De Vries is fully engaged in this process. We are in the process of strengthening the EU Situation Centre that will be instrumental in pooling analyses on terrorism in Europe. We also need to strengthen the role of Europol and make sure it can play its role. In the near future, the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will sit with their US counterparts to see how we can strengthen transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevention of terrorist financing is high on our agenda. Even though the EU is at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, we cannot sit back and relax. Money is the life-blood of terrorism and we need to reinforce our financial systems to make sure that they are not abused by terrorists. The third Money Laundering Directive is a fresh step in this matter. We also need to strengthen our policies to freeze assets of terrorists. We therefore seek to make the EU Clearing House more effective and to secure better implementation. Finally, we will be looking at ways to prevent cash couriers from circumventing banking regulations by taking their money in cash across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In our external policies we want to make sure that the resources of the Union are being used to their full extent in order to work with other countries in the fight against terrorism. As I have already said, terrorism is a phenomenon that does not respect international borders. It is our firm belief that we must work with third countries to promote the ratification and implementation of UN counter-terrorism conventions and to use political dialogue and technical assistance to support countries willing to cooperate. The EU is already active in Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan, where it is implementing specific programmes. The EU also operates other programmes in various countries with a view, more generally, to strengthening their judicial systems. We feel that the EU should do more and therefore we are talking to a number of key countries to explore how we can enhance our cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to terrorism in Russia. Russia is very worried about the threat of terrorism, and rightly so. But, more than a mere worry, this is a true problem for Russia, which has suffered three major attacks in little more than a week. We must show – and indeed have shown – our sympathy. It is clear that the European Union has always systematically condemned all acts of terrorism. The Russians deserve all the support we can give them. Hence we stand by Russia to assist it in its efforts to fight terrorism. In our relations with Russia, we already discuss counter-terrorism on a regular basis. We stand ready to increase cooperation on a technical level and to share the counter-terrorism experience that we have gained in the EU. We will use the regular dialogues that we have with Russia to discuss how to proceed in this matter. We are willing to discuss anti-terrorism strategies and methods with the Russians so that we can learn from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">This cooperation forms part of our overall strategy to strengthen relations between the European Union and Russia. It is part of our goal to make tangible progress on all four common spaces at the next summit on 11 November. In the field of external security, we have made progress. But the interaction should go hand-in-hand with building up cooperation in the common space of internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorist attacks have prompted Moscow to continue to regard Chechnya as a predominantly anti-terrorist issue. This gives rise to concern. We have been consistent in our position that human rights should be respected in the fight against terrorism. Indeed, the European Union has a clear position on the situation in Chechnya. We will continue to present this position to Russia in future.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the terrorist attack in Beslan, I will be brief. We have fully and unconditionally condemned this attack and have offered our condolences to the relatives of the victims, the Russian Government and the Russian people. We therefore fully supported your initiative, Mr President, for schools all over Europe to respect a one-minute silence at noon yesterday in commemoration of the victims of this terrorist attack. In that way our children were able to show the world their grief for its victims and their worries about terrorism. It is now up to us, the politicians, to translate these worries into further concrete action and to reinvigorate our fight against terrorism while respecting our core values.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, let me begin where the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands concluded and make it clear that no-one possessed of any shred of humanity could be other than appalled and deeply saddened by the tragic events at the school in Beslan in North Ossetia two weeks ago. I reiterate the Commission’s condolences to the people of Beslan. I also unhesitatingly and unreservedly condemn terrorist acts wherever they are perpetrated. Attacks on civilians are always contemptible. When they deliberately target children, they plumb new depths of atrocity.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, this event, as the presidency noted, was not isolated. In recent months, Russia has suffered several terrorist attacks, with targets ranging from the Moscow metro to domestic passenger flights. The sequence is deeply disturbing, and the Commission has of course expressed its readiness to intensify our work with Russia to combat the very real terrorist threats that it faces. We are, to take one example, already working with Russia to combat the financing of terrorism, by helping Russia to improve its efforts to tackle money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">We want ideally to pursue those efforts as part of our much-vaunted 'strategic partnership' with Russia, as part of a process of dialogue. Dialogue inevitably involves questions. Real help comes only with understanding, and understanding comes only with clarity. What happened in Beslan is still not fully clear, at least to the outside observer. Who were those involved? How did the hostage-takers plan and execute this horrific act? What provoked the storming of the school? Why was the number of casualties so high?</p>
<p class="contents">However, the link with Chechnya is clear. Events in Beslan followed an intensification of rebel attacks in both Chechnya and Ingushetia since the spring. The current conflict, now in its fifth year, has been a vicious affair, with widespread human rights abuses and the targeting of civilians by both Russian armed forces and rebels. Many civilians have simply disappeared. The conflict has caused a massive humanitarian crisis and has laid the economy waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We should all recognise, however, that this is not the time to read Russia lectures about Chechnya. This is a time of grief and shock. We have had, and will continue to have, our differences with Russia over Chechnya. We have made, and will continue to make, those differences clear in our meetings with the Russians, and to discuss them. That is what partners do.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, there are two principles that guide cooperation with Russia on terrorism. First, it is equally – if not more – important to work together to prevent terrorism, by which I mean addressing its root causes. Second – and I strongly endorse what the Foreign Minister has just said – human rights are paramount and must be respected. The fight against terrorism does not justify or excuse the violation of human rights. Rather, it is strengthened by a demonstrable respect for the human rights of all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted a remarkable statement the other day by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Israel. He was giving a judgment on the security barrier. What he said reminded me of what we share fundamentally with Israel, whatever our criticisms of the present government’s policies. Democracies, he argued, have to fight with one hand tied behind their backs. That is true. But it is also true that the moment you behave like the terrorists, you undermine your moral authority and you augment the number of citizens who either actively or passively support them.</p>
<p class="contents">So when we return to discussion of Chechnya, we should continue to make clear our support for a political solution to the conflict, which fully respects Russia's territorial integrity. But we should do so in a consistent, intelligent way that does not risk changing from presidency to presidency, and that recognises the complex nature of ethnic conflict in the whole of the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">I note in passing that we and our Russian partners need urgently to come to a shared understanding of this point. Territorial integrity and stability matter throughout Russia’s near abroad, in the southern Caucasus as much as the northern Caucasus. They matter in the near abroad as well as within Russia itself. A shared recognition of that would do much to make our common neighbourhood a safer place.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part we should recognise that no-one sensible in Russia could or should want to return to the Chechnyan status quo of the years immediately before 1999. They remember what that was like, and what it led to. So should we. It was appalling – a community that exported gangsterism.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Commission welcomes efforts to rebuild properly functioning public health, education and administrative systems, but we have no illusions. This is the start of a very long journey, which will only be lengthened by the siphoning off of reconstruction funds by corrupt officials, by the apparent manipulation of elections and by a failure to protect human rights and the absence of dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge for Russia is to put in place a leadership in Chechnya in which the population of Chechnya has confidence. Without this, there can be no lasting, genuine reconciliation, which it is clear the majority of the population wishes to see. We can help in this, in a modest way, supporting efforts to promote reconstruction and institution-building in Chechnya. I repeat the Commission’s readiness to provide funds for reconstruction and rehabilitation in the north Caucasus, as soon as the security situation permits, and once a needs assessment mission to Moscow and the north Caucasus can be undertaken. But ultimately that, and any lasting resolution of the Chechnyan tragedy, depend on the pursuit of far-sighted, humane and resolute policies in Moscow. I hope they are forthcoming and that the government of the Russian Federation will not conclude that the only answer to terrorism is to increase the power of the Kremlin. Frankly, there is not much good history on the side of that proposition.</p>

Almost everything has already been said on the subject of terrorism, following 11 September, 11 March and now the Beslan tragedy. This is no longer merely a case of terrorism, it is a new reality that I would call hyper-terrorism, in which not only civilians, but also children are used as a terrible means of achieving aims. In the circumstances, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what can be said is very simple. First and foremost, we must insist that institutions and governments act firmly. We cannot accept, under any circumstances, any neutrality from an institution or State in the face of an act of hyper-terrorism of this nature. It is not only governments that must work together; we must demand that all governments and institutions work together in the fight against terrorism and hyper-terrorism. The firmness that we demand, as has been mentioned, must never, however, be at the expense of what makes us strong and what we strive for, which is democracy, the rule of law and human rights. This is an area in which we must not make any concessions. We do not want to establish police states anywhere, not even in those States with the greatest justification for so doing, because if we were to go down that road we would lose, as has already been said, all of our moral strength. What we need, in addition to firmness, is, therefore, closer cooperation and, at the moment, we feel that there is room for improvement in this area, firstly as regards intelligence, but also as regards the flow of money that is behind terrorism. The questions of who is funding this flow, and how the money is circulating around the world must be investigated in much greater depth than has until now been the case. The European institutions are alive to the problem. I applaud the work done in the Commission, in particular by Mr Vitorino, and this work should be carried on even more thoroughly. I shall finish, Mr President, by saying that in our view terrorism has always been a struggle against democracy, freedom and the rule of law, which are the very cornerstones of our European Union. This is one of the main reasons why we should combat it together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nobody speaking in this debate can banish these images. I think we can all readily comprehend what it means when, in a particular town, not one single family is not lamenting a victim, and most of those families have lost children. We have to imagine that; there is a place on this earth, in which there is not one family that has not lost a child – grandchildren, nephews, nieces, the children of the family itself. Beslan will have to live with that trauma for a long time, and not just Beslan; we will all have to live with that trauma for a long time. The media world, in which we are at home, is fleeting and happy-go-lucky; today, already, other images are making the news.</p>
<p class="contents">So I want to take up something Mr Cohn-Bendit has said, something that I think is very astute. ‘A Rubicon of terrorism has been crossed’, he said. That is a fact; indeed, it has been. For the first time, we have seen in terrorism something characterised by two elements. It is actually an unwritten, but self-evident law of humanity that says that children are not to be targeted by such actions. Until now, as I recall, it was a fact of terrorism, albeit not of war, that children were not attacked. For the first time, something has been introduced, something that says: ‘We don’t care; we’ll take a whole school hostage, and we’re not interested in what happens to the children’. So it is that the end justifies the sacrifice of children; a Rubicon has indeed been crossed, and it is this against which we must defend ourselves. That is why I want, in this debate, to draw attention to something: as we all know how these terrorists think, we also need to make two connections here. There is, quite obviously, a connection between Chechnya and Islamic terrorism, with the idea being to use Chechnya and Ingushetia, regions with predominantly Muslim populations, as a means of taking the conflict to North Ossetia, inhabited by a different faith community, the object being to multiply the conflict two-fold. When, however, children were taken as hostages, the result was an effect that has gone unnoticed by our media. The fact is that, for the first time in a long time, in not one Arab country were there demonstrations in the street in support of this act of terrorism. Throughout the Islamic world, not one newspaper failed to condemn this act. Even the most radical of Islamic leaders anathematised and repudiated this sort of terrorism. It is in this element that there lies, certainly, an opportunity to revive a dialogue that has evaded us. If we can spot a lowest common denominator – and I believe that we can – then it is our shared repudiation of this sort of terrorism, and that smallest common denominator is also an opportunity to begin dialogue, an opportunity that we must make use of. That is why our group has discussed the need to draw the logical conclusions, to actually avoid talking only in terms of cultural confrontation, and instead seize opportunities for inter-cultural dialogue wherever they present themselves, even if it be at a moral nadir such as this one.</p>
<p class="contents">To all the perceptive things that have been said here, I want to add that there is a particular question facing the governments of our Union, in this House and particularly here. It is this. The European Parliament was broadly unanimous in supporting those states that rejected pre-emptive warfare as a means of conducting international policy and as a model for conflict resolution. We will shortly be discussing Iraq and the failure of the approach according to which international crises and conflicts can be resolved by pre-emptive strikes. To be consistent, though, we then have to say that such crises are no better dealt with by nullifying the democratic system, by abolishing the rule of law, or by reintroducing authoritarian structures.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is not for us to give Russia advice, anyone who reintroduces the death penalty absents themselves from our platform of action, which we in this House, let me add, share with our counterparts in the Council of Europe. That, too, is the honest thing to say, and if we cannot say that to a friend, then I think it is already too late, but, as we have friends in Russia, and as Russia is Europe’s most important partner, that must be said loud and clear. Pre-emptive warfare is no more use than the reintroduction of authoritarian structures.</p>

We abominate and condemn it without reservation. The brutality meted out to children, parents and teachers beggars belief; these terrorists are not freedom fighters, but cynical murderers.</p>
<p class="contents">Like all Europeans, we MEPs are entitled to ask how this tragedy came to pass, and whether it was unavoidable. Who was it who sowed the seeds of such terrorism, which kills so many of the innocent in such terrible ways, in Beslan and in a Moscow theatre a year ago? Who is actually behind the aircraft crashes in Russia? Questions such as these do nothing to diminish our solidarity with the victims and our horror at the hostage tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no simple solution in the war on terrorism, for it goes far beyond the bounds of war as we know it, and is also far more complex than what was known as the Cold War. There are no defined battlefields, the foe is not readily identified, and that is what makes simple answers such as military intervention so ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorists must be hunted down ruthlessly, no question about that, and nobody doubts it, but it is not enough to combat the symptoms; we have to get to the causes of this war. The Russian Government must learn from the catastrophe of Beslan if the vicious circle of violence in Chechnya is to be broken. In this situation, warlike behaviour bars the way to a peaceful and democratic end to the conflict. For as long as the people of Grozny have no hope of a normal life, there will continue to be a perverse incentive for more terrorism. President Putin is playing tough, but he is not taking the tough road that a political solution would be, for his government seems not to believe that a political solution for Chechnya is possible. We are left with the lie of an unwinnable war.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, President Putin announced amendments to the Russian constitution, effectively removing the elements of democracy from the country’s political system. That is no real war on terrorism, but it is Putin’s – a war on the political diversity that Russia needs so desperately, and his stronger government makes the country no safer.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals and Democrats are convinced that we have the right and the duty, as the representatives of the people of Europe, to speak out on Chechnya and to speak up for democracy and the rule of law. It is not enough to relegate Chechnya to the small print in the margin, and that is why we find it regrettable and deserving of criticism that the Socialist Group and the Group of the conservative Christian Democrats have blocked a resolution of this House on this important subject. We must not take the manipulation of elections and the ongoing violation of human rights lying down. Nowhere in the world can we allow the idea of pre-emptive war on terror to take root, for it leads down a dead end. We believe in the universality of human rights and in the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union is to have the genuine partnership with Russia that it seeks, Russia has to be prepared to rethink its policy on Chechnya and find the courage to change tack.</p>

<p class="contents">Taking that as our starting point, there are two options open to us: we can say that these monsters must be fought, which is a self-evident truism but rather simplistic, or we can ask ourselves how human beings could become monsters. The Chechens who carried out this operation were not born monsters, but became them. Who made human beings into monsters? That is a legitimate question, and, in Chechnya, a colonial power has for years been waging a colonial war that, day after day, brings forth monsters. If we want to talk about how to put a stop to the barbarities of terrorism, we have to start by looking at how to put a stop to the barbarities of this colonial war. History has taught us what colonial wars are like. The atrocities committed by the Algerians against the French were barbaric. Colonial wars bring forth barbarians. The problem is with finding a way to end the barbarism, and here it is not enough to say that we are going to pour more money into the war on terrorism; we have to ask what we Europeans are going to put into the political balance in order to put a stop to the barbarism.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the role we can play is that of political mediator between the Russians, who are incapable of coming up with a political solution, and the Chechens, who cannot extricate themselves from terrorism. That is why we call for a condemnation of Putin. What does the reform of the regional election process have to do with terrorism, or with the fight against it? Nothing. It does, however, have something to do with the power of a tsar whose democratic legitimacy is dubious. The Russia of today – it has to be said – is in the process of leaving democracy behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Chechnya, when there is talk of a political solution, we have to know with whom one is supposed to negotiate. A political solution will not be found in Russia alone; there must be partners on the Chechen side with whom it is possible to negotiate. If everyone – the terrorists and the Chechens who propose political solutions – is treated in the same way, that is to say, as terrorists, there will be no political solution, because there will be nobody to negotiate with. Negotiations will have to involve Mr Zakayev, they will have to involve discussing his proposals and recognising him, and it is only right that the European Union should recognise him and prompt him to abandon and denounce terrorism; he has to be treated as a political partner, as an enemy with whom it is necessary to negotiate. Negotiations are always conducted with enemies and never with friends. With friends, one organises surprise parties, if one feels in the mood for them; one does not conduct political negotiations with them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason, Mr President, that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is proposing Natalia Estemirova for the Sakharov Prize. The daughter of a Russian father and Chechen mother, she is in Grozny fighting the good fight for the recognition of human rights: a symbol in herself! She is a member of the ‘Memorial’ group that produced Andrei Sakharov, in whose spirit, and with whose friends, she campaigns. I hope that this House will find the strength to say that there is a solution other than terrorism to the conflict in Chechnya, and Natalia Estemirova would be the symbol of political action on its part in the face of this tragic situation.</p>

<p class="contents">Having radically and unanimously condemned terrorism, it is now for us to speak out equally clearly on the roots of these appalling outbreaks of violence, on the results of the much-vaunted war on terrorism, which was launched in order to curb them, and on the EU’s responsibilities in this crucial context.</p>
<p class="contents">These questions, however, arise in a very similar way in respect of the Caucasus, Iraq and the Middle East. Mr Bush, Mr Putin and Mr Sharon are taking the same strategy further, with the same catastrophic results.</p>
<p class="contents">The roots of terrorism, of course, lie in a state of permanent war, with bombings and acts of destruction and humiliation, when these are not acts of barbarism committed by occupying forces. Claiming to wage war on terrorism, one ends up waging war on peoples. Putting them through hell does indeed beget monsters.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of this alleged war on terrorism is therefore the same in each of the cases to which I have referred. Vladimir Putin gained power by promising to restore order. Five years on, the Caucasus is ablaze and the blood is flowing as far as Moscow. Ariel Sharon promised his people security and peace. Since then, the people of Israel have been living in a climate of fear, division and confrontation, while Gaza, locked in and exhausted, is rapidly becoming another ticking time-bomb. George Bush saw good as overcoming evil and contemplated extending democracy to the whole of the Middle East; now Iraq is sinking into chaos while the list of innocent victims gets longer from day to day.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is the EU’s responsibility, in terms both of its values and of its own best interests? It is, in the first place, to be there, not as an inaudible entity, but as a recognised interested party; it is responsible, above all, for daring to sound the alarm when the world is falling apart before our eyes. It must not tremble at every frown from his lordship in the Kremlin. The accusation of interference carries no more weight today in the case of Chechnya than it formerly did in relation to Kosovo. It must also do away with the intolerable <span class="italic">de facto</span> immunity granted to the Sharon Government, which is openly defying the UN, the International Court of Justice and international law in general. Finally, it must denounce the unjust, illegal, and increasingly dangerous war in Iraq, formally call for the withdrawal of the occupying troops and, in general terms, adopt as its own for the future the principle that war should be banned as a way of sorting out the world’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We should reflect on the words of Kofi Annan, who said: ‘History is a harsh judge; it will not forgive us if we let this moment pass’.</p>

It is a new war, because never until now have the forces of evil been mobilised on such a broad front and never has the civilised world, at all latitudes of the globe, found itself confronted with such widespread atrocity and such total indifference towards civilised values and principles. Never have children been struck down with such savagery and determination outside conventional conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for us to get over the stunned reaction that we, the civilised world, have felt, for we have all been brought up to respect human dignity and civil rights and we cannot comprehend that there can be men and women capable of the acts of savage cruelty that we have witnessed.</p>
<p class="contents">They have declared global war on us using unconventional methods, and we must not forget that we were given many warnings, from the Dar es Salaam and Nairobi attacks to the escalation of the Taliban regime. One of the last warnings was given to this Parliament and the international community by Commander Massud, who was later killed on 9 September 2001, just a few months after his visit to Strasbourg and two days before the attack on the Twin Towers, the attack that marked the terrorists’ official declaration of war on the whole civilised world.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to understand the reality in which we live. There are no more ambassadors to announce that we are at war, but there are bombs ripping our countries apart, child murderers and rapists, and new terrorists being recruited from within our own cities. Europe has a duty to listen to every voice raised in defence of the freedom of oppressed peoples, but it has to state clearly that terrorism must be fought and condemned with no ifs or buts, and that all those who justify, tolerate or support terrorism – surreptitiously or otherwise – must be isolated and that we must ensure that they can do no harm.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that with a sense of solidarity we are struggling to fight this new terrorism that has declared war on us, it is difficult to understand how neighbouring countries that we respect and love, such as France, allow a terrorist convicted in Italy for four murders committed during the tragic ‘years of lead’ to escape. Our national and European laws also need to be adapted to the emergency situation in which we are living. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who took children hostage in Beslan, he wrote, were Muslims, just as were the hostage-takers in Iraq, those who commit acts of violence in Darfur in the Sudan, Bin Laden and the suicide bombers who blow up buses, cars, schools, homes and other buildings all over the world. We cannot clear our name, he went on to say, until we acknowledge the shameful fact that terrorism has become an Islamic activity, a virtual monopoly operated by Muslim men and women, end of quote. Courageous Muslims such as Mr al-Rashid must be supported in saying such things. Above all, we must become aware that a global war is being waged on Europe and on the West in general, a war waged by Muslim fundamentalism against our European democratic values and lifestyle, and I am, alas, less than convinced that the European Union is in the forefront of the fight against terrorism, as Mr Bot has just said. Far more than is at present the case, there needs to be cooperation with the United States, with NATO and with such countries as Russia. Member States must work together more effectively in exchanging information and must adapt their legislation better with a view to combating international terrorism, or else things will go from bad to worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not just an emerging problem. We must have no doubt that it will be an increasing problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest risk facing us Europeans in relation to this phenomenon is that the European citizens may come to the conclusion that our reaction is fundamentally the failure to act, paralysis, doing nothing. That is the greatest risk, the greatest difficulty: not knowing how to confront this terrible risk on the basis of our principles, convictions and values.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of my personal experience, I believe that, in order to tackle the scourge of terrorism, the first thing, the most important thing, is to increase awareness, awareness of the seriousness of the problem. Legislative and operative measures will be important, but the most important thing is to increase awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two sides to this increasing of awareness: firstly, we must have the courage to treat the fight against terrorism as our very top priority amongst all our problems. We must therefore say it, repeat it and affirm it in all the Union’s documents, in all our public statements: terrorism is the main problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would go as far as to say today that the principal gap in the European Union's anti-terrorist policy is not the lack of measures and initiatives, but the fact that we do not acknowledge sufficiently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the second objective in terms of increasing awareness is the conviction that we can defeat this phenomenon. We cannot start to fight terrorism unless we are sure, on the basis of the moral strength of our convictions, that we will be able to beat terrorism. Terrorism is essentially about fear, it generates fear. And the fear of failure we feel when we deal with a problem of this nature is the first thing we must conquer if we are then to conquer the terrorist organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it takes time to tackle a terrorist phenomenon. There are no shortcuts and no possibility of magic solutions. But each and every one of us must have conviction from the outset. The fight against terrorism has nothing to do with the left or right; it is essentially a moral obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe we must dedicate more time, more single-issue debates in this Parliament, to tackling terrorism. I believe we must state more frequently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans and we must promote a debate amongst governments in order to ascertain in certain circumstances, when terrorist attacks take place close to elections, what instruments are available to those governments in order to defend themselves, whether or not this may include delaying elections, in order to prevent terrorists from achieving their objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have a moral duty of the highest order.</p>

What should have been for hundreds of children a day of rejoicing – their first day at school – turned into an appalling tragedy. Yesterday, together with millions of schoolchildren throughout Europe, we kept a minute’s silence to remember the victims, and we thank this House’s President for this gesture of solidarity, which was also an expression of powerlessness, the powerlessness felt by everyone in the face of this cruel attack on those who cannot defend themselves – children and their mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we want, above all, to affirm that we are alongside people in a remote corner of Europe, but the debate on the mounting threat of a terrorism that spares nothing and nobody must still go on, both today and in the months to come. Its keywords must be ‘comprehension’ and ‘action’. We must endeavour to comprehend the incomprehensible. We must be prepared to seek out the causes of terrorism, to open our eyes to people’s hopelessness and frustration and that of the conflicts that appear to be unending, without the prospect of a solution. I am quite clearly not saying that the existence of these conflicts is a justification for barbarous violence directed at innocent people, but rather that we must adopt a joint approach in order to do away with this source from which violence develops. In the same way, we also have to be prepared to act, to take international cooperation in the fight against terrorism further.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that the European Union must offer the Russian people, and President Putin, every assistance in attempting to prevent such far-reaching calamities from happening in future. The question naturally arises of how all of this was possible. It is a good thing that the State Duma is conducting an inquiry into how the calamity in Beslan ended and how that final stage was dealt with. Nor is there any getting away from the Chechen issue. The assistance to which I have just referred does, of course, include joint operations on the ground by the intelligence services, their training in specialized units and their learning from each other’s experiences. International terrorism cannot be tackled without international cooperation, and the European Union has an important part to play in that.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has little sympathy for those who think that they can go it alone in combating international terrorism and who also believe that this is the only way to do so. I want to ask the House for an intensive debate, to be held by the end of the year and jointly with the Council and the Commission, on the European contribution to the fight against terrorism. Where do we stand, and what is our analysis of the threat? This morning, Mr Bot made an important contribution to this discussion in his statement on what the European Union and its Presidency are doing. High on the list are seeking out the causes and dealing with them, but our European tradition bids us also look at how democratic structures are to be secured and fundamental human rights protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A week ago, Mr Bot, you asked the Russian authorities a very simple question as to how it had been possible for this tragedy to occur. A very simple question, and one that you were right to ask, but you are wrong today in your desire to see it buried. Why is this so? After all, it is the question being asked by all the families in Beslan; it is the question being asked by all those families as they grieve. What happened? What has come to pass? How can you not see that, in this tragedy, the Russian powers-that-be have deployed all the calculating cynicism of which they are capable – manipulation, disinformation, poisonings – and the best journalists, experts on Chechen issues, found themselves being prevented from reaching the scene. How are these facts to be denied? How can one not put these questions to the Russian authorities? How, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, can you cooperate in the fight against international terrorism with a power that first denied that there was any connection with the conflict in Chechnya, with a power that then condemned the independent and moderate President Maskhadov, putting a price on his head? Now this same power has proclaimed an international war on the global scourge of terrorism, finally asking all states to refrain from interfering in its internal affairs. Who is that power, inconsistent and manipulative, with which you seek to cooperate in saving democracy, the rule of law, and our code of values? Think about it, Mr Bot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, I should like to emphasise that this event demands from the state political action to prevent such situations in the future, to remove the causes of terrorism. That is not easy. It is much easier to make irresponsible pronouncements about preventive strikes or merely to try and consolidate authoritarian powers. The President of Russia should be trying to assuage the mutual hatreds of the different peoples within Russia. These hatreds were bred by tsarism and continued by Stalinism, and have yet to be resolved. Quite recently, militiamen in Moscow beat up an ex-astronaut, purely because he had a Chechen-sounding surname. It is important for President Putin to show proper concern for every citizen of his country – not only Russians, but other peoples too, and for his immense power to be deployed to create peace and harmony. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, our feelings of sympathy are for the victims, those left behind and the whole of Russian society. Different though our opinions may be about a conflict such as that in Chechnya, there can never be any justification for atrocities of this kind, nor should anyone attempt to find one. We as politicians owe it to the public to make every effort to prevent this from happening again. It is ever more frequently apparent that terror knows no boundaries and is a threat to every open society. In addressing this terror, we in the European Union will therefore, more than ever, need to join forces with countries such as the United States and Russia, while, within the Union too, we have an awful lot to learn in this area of cooperation. Many plans have been forged under the guidance of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr de Vries, during this and the previous presidency, but it is just as important to monitor the implementation of plans that have already been adopted. In the extra Justice and Home Affairs Council in the wake of the attacks in New York of September 2001, it was agreed that, from now on, all relevant information about terrorist threats would be exchanged within the EU. A few days before the attacks in Madrid, it transpired that this exchange is still very inadequate. We can no longer afford this. Have fine words meanwhile been translated into action? In fact, the need for identical implementation also applies to terrorist organisations that have been included on the European list. Indeed, in our Union, which lacks internal borders, these organisations are banned in some countries, but not in many others. The discussion about an effective and identical implementation of the plans should be held at a higher level, and it would be useful if the coordinator, Mr de Vries, were to send his progress reports directly to this House too. After all, we show no real understanding for, and sympathy with, the victims of New York, Madrid and Beslan, unless ambitious words are turned into concrete action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These people need our help: communities across Russia as well as Beslan and its surrounding regions. There is nothing more barbarous or mindless than the intentional killing of defenceless mothers and children. We cannot be impartial faced with terrorism of this sort. It threatens the rule of law, democracy, civil rights, the basis of our society. The whole world has realised that things have now gone too far.</p>
<p class="contents">I headed a parliamentary delegation to Chechnya last year. Parliament stressed that the conflict in Chechnya could not be resolved by military means. The Russian Government stated that it would act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism cannot be fought in ways that curtail democracy, civil rights and equality. The background to terrorism involves social policy, and the remedy for it likewise involves social policy. It will not come about through the use of weapons or the continued centralisation of power. In Europe, we can see that Russia’s policy on Chechnya has failed. It is difficult to see how a continued centralisation of power in the Kremlin would help us understand this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Up till now, we have supported the policy to promote stability and democracy under Putin’s leadership, and hopefully it will not now come about that, as a result of these tragic events, we start to rethink and alter our policy on Russia, because now Russia itself is also a victim. Hopefully we will find, together with the Russian leadership, ways in which Russia could act in accordance with its own public proclamations, and which we could therefore support wholeheartedly.

Just read the reports by Amnesty International, or the report by our <span class="italic">ad-hoc</span> committee, of which I too was a member and to which Mr Paasilinna referred, or just look at what is happening in Chechnya. A military solution is not possible. What we need to establish is dialogue, a dialogue that should involve all parties, all parties within Chechnya, not only the clan around Mr Kadirov, but all clans in Chechnya, a dialogue including the rebels. Mrs Thatcher once stated that she would never talk with terrorists, and yet it is thanks to Mr John Hume that the British and Irish Governments sat around the negotiating table, along with the IRA and the Protestant terrorist gangs. This proved to be the solution for peace in Ireland, and this is also the solution for peace in Chechnya. They should enter into talks with all parties, and Europe should play an important role in this, just as the United States did in Northern Ireland. We must try to unite the parties and try to persuade them to work together. That is what the Chechens are asking us, because the Chechens essentially want peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no such thing as terrorism in the name of God, as every kind of terrorism is the work of the devil. That said, the film on Chechnya we have been watching for years is not a black and white film, with a good sheriff pitted against the bad guys. In this film the sheriff has also shot people in the back in the past, as in Chechnya there really are two kinds of terrorism. There is the kind currently being discussed at length, both in this House and elsewhere, and there is the other kind no one talks about, namely state terrorism. The fact that the EU is putting forward its views on this issue is to be welcomed. These views should be those of the entire EU, and this fact should be noted by Russia, which in the past has preferred to talk with selected Member States such as Germany and France, as demonstrated by the recent summit in Sochi. If we act together, Mr President, as a single EU, it will be easier for us to exert influence on Russia and to fight for human rights, both in Chechnya and elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is reminiscent of the tragedy in the Moscow theatre and brings many things to mind. Today when the Russian authorities declare that they will fight terrorism anywhere, that may seem new and positive, perhaps it opens the door to combined efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan, to stop acts of terror in Quatar and elsewhere. When the Russian authorities condemn double standards, there springs the hope that Russian terrorists will also be persecuted, for example those who on the night of 31 July 1991 killed seven Lithuanian border guards in cold blood. The criminals are known; members of a unit of the terrorist 'Black Berets', they live in Russia protected and supported by its authorities, who refuse to cooperate with Vilnius in the pursuit of justice. While talking so much about the war on terrorism, Russia's leaders have shown more than one example of double standards and hypocrisy. The European Union could urge them to change this behaviour. Here is a quote, an excerpt from the shadow cabinet's statement at the beginning of the Beslan crisis. Quote: 'We categorically condemn this act of terrorism and unite with the United Nations Security Council in encouraging the release of the hostages. At the same time we deeply regret that the United Nations Security Council has never condemned and has not expressed sympathy for the deaths of 42 000 Chechen children, killed in Chechnya as a result of the Russian authorities' orders'. Unquote. At that moment the children of Beslan were suffering, but were still alive. The 42 000 other children were no longer alive, were no longer suffering. For them that anachronistic colonial war was long over. When will it end however? Those who say, 'first victory, then peace', are wrong. That is a dead end. It is time for a different way of thinking – peace is victory. Peace, which would save thousands of lives, which would mean that children no longer die because of the stupidity and brutality of adults, cannot be shameful. General de Gaulle did not disgrace France when he ended the Algerian War. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The escalation of terror, in terms of its nature and degree, frightens us all and causes us grave concern.</p>
<p class="contents">What frightens and concerns me, though, and many others among us, is the red line that connects Bush’s policy of preventive war in Iraq, via Sharon’s stubborn belief that violence can be countered only with violence, with Putin’s actions, which tend in that direction, the belief being that force can be dealt with only by force, with more force making authority necessary, which in turn makes authoritarian structures inevitable. I am grateful to all the speakers, to the Foreign Minister and to the Commissioner, for highlighting the alternative way, the one I would call European, which, far from bowing down before terrorism and yielding to it, involves combating its causes as well. To its partners, including Russia, Europe must make this way clear and unmistakeable. Terrorism must be fought, but its causes must also be done away with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From today’s speeches, we can see various conceptual approaches to evaluating what happened. Let me briefly explain my own judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to reject the proposition that ‘the end justifies the means’, then we must not exploit the situation that violent means have brought about in order to raise the question of our cherished aims. Otherwise, the terrorists will conclude that the events they stage bring results. The issue of a people’s right to self-determination, which should be respected as far as possible, must not be raised in connection with acts of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, one would want to see the European Union adopt not double standards, but single standards towards events in Iraq, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia and other countries. Sunni terrorism, Chechen terrorism and Kurdish terrorism do not have a separate existence. This is all violent conduct based on exactly the same principles, and should be condemned, regardless of its perpetrator, its origin or the territory on which it is committed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard something of that this morning. Since the Beslan tragedy we have heard blame being put on the Russian authorities, either because of their own actions in Chechnya or because of their sheer technical incompetence in terms of handling a terrorist situation. But we should not be distracted from the simple observation that the only people really responsible for terrorism, for the horrors of Beslan, are the perpetrators – the terrorists themselves. No cause, whether it is the separation or autonomy of Chechnya, no injury, even brutal acts by Russian security forces – nothing justifies the mass murder of children and their mothers. Sadly, the Beslan attack will not be the last.</p>
<p class="contents">What is to be done? We do not have just a humane interest in the security and stability of Russia and her increasingly important southern reaches, but a selfish interest as well. We all want to see security and stability in the Caucasus and an end to the spiral of terrorism where we see endemic banditry and distorted nationalisms now fed by Islamic extremism. This is a dangerous mixture that threatens us all. The Russian authorities should not be too proud to seek assistance, which is needed on several levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of counter-terrorism that expertise does not rest within the EU as such. I do not entirely dismiss all EU actions in relation to terrorism. Closer cooperation between our police and security services is important. Controls of terrorist finance need joint efforts, but too much effort is focused on empowering the EU and extending its competence into new areas. I do not share Mr Bot's enthusiasm for the European arrest warrant, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Expertise rests in countries such as the United Kingdom and Spain. Certainly, Russia should be calling on that sort of expertise. The inability of the Russian authorities to deal with the Beslan situation reveals many worrying and enduring problems that seem to be deeply embedded in the Russian state. If the EU has anything to offer, it should be a single-minded condemnation of terrorism, together with humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. Russia has to recognise who her real friends are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The attack on Beslan immerses us in absolute horror, in the denial of humanity, into the age of barbarism, and we cannot help but feel sickened at the sight of parents put to death in front of their children, or at the sight of children being used as human shields at windows. The place itself is symbolic: a school, representing learning, that knowledge that makes possible the fight against obscurantism, against stupidity and savagery. That which makes us human, the barbarians have smashed; how can you deprive a child of water, of food, of sleep, and still be part of humanity?</p>
<p class="contents">At the European level, though, we absolutely have to build up our capacities. The ambitious goals set after the Tampere Summit in order to establish a European approach to terrorism, have not been achieved. To be sure, as you have emphasised, progress has been made, particularly in the creation of the international arrest warrant, but the process has been held back by the Member States’ lack of political will to make European decisions truly effective. We have to build up our fighting capacity if we are to counter this, the curse of the new century. Having said that, what can we say about State barbarism? It is not acceptable that violence should be answered with violence.</p>

There, Mrs Flautre, I have to tell you that you are wrong. That is not the first question that must be raised, but what is, is our compassion for the victims, and so it was a mistake on the part of the Dutch Presidency of the Council to start by demanding reports from the scene on information policy and everything else, rather than making it an absolute priority to express concern at the dimensions terror was taking on. On that I really do want to contradict you in the strongest terms.</p>

All victims of terrorism are innocent: people on a commuter train, in a theatre, an office block or a nightclub. But children in a school are the most innocent victims of all. The survival of children, like seven-year-old Aida Sidakova – who we saw on our television screens returning to what we thought was her death – is a symbol of the hope that our human spirit craves in the face of such an unspeakable act of evil.</p>
<p class="contents">Beslan must not be exploited for political ends, whether in the Kremlin or here in the European Union. I agree that there should be justice, but there should be no recriminations, no reprisals, no revenge, and, as all the institutions of Europe affirm in unanimity in this debate, no dilution of respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I accompanied my own daughter to her first day of school. It was a nerve-wracking experience for both of us. I cannot imagine the ordeal suffered by those children.

<p class="contents">I would like my first comment, Mr President, to be one of solidarity with the victims of Beslan, and it is with emotion that I express my compassion and share in the grief. There is no justification for terror, no possible cause can justify it. Killing, murdering children, murdering mothers and fathers of children, killing children’s teachers is the most extreme expression of the most miserable of human behaviour. The victims were tortured for 52 hours and then murdered. Those are the undeniable facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Shamil Basayev, who planned and authorised the attack, is not a leader of the Chechen independence movement, he is a murderer of children, an inhuman terrorist who has littered Russian soil with innocent bodies. This is the truth and is undeniably the fatal consequence of indiscriminate terrorism. So I would like to express my total and determined condemnation of this event which degrades the human condition in the extreme.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeing an unprecedented increase in the spiral of terror. I would like to express my support for the Russian authorities in their quest to arrest and prosecute the people responsible for this horrific attack quickly, and I can assure you all that my emotions are not purely rhetorical. I have visited Chechnya and Ingushetia; I have visited the Chechen refugee camps; I have spoken to Kalamanov on two occasions; I understand the complexity of the political problem and I am aware of the human rights violations of the parties concerned; I also know what Politkovskaya has said.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen terrorism from close quarters in my own country, from less than five centimetres away, and I can state with democratic conviction that these savages cannot be given any advantage. They take advantage of our doubts and turn parts of our debates into their own arguments whenever it suits them. I would call for the democratic capacity to identify the problem properly and combat it with determination and without reservations. I call on you to restart the debate on Europol, to revise United Nations Security Council Resolution 1333 and to make the European Agency for the Management of External Borders operational. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having listened to what you have brought here today, I can certainly vouch for that, and I am also grateful to you for the support that many of you expressed for the programme as I unfolded it. I was also moved by the image that Commissioner Patten conjured up, that if we enter into the fight against terrorism, in a way we have one hand tied behind our backs. I should like to say, though, that that means two things, namely that we should strengthen the hand that we have left over, but, at the same time, that we also have a mouth, with which we can step up the dialogue. In my view, as I said initially, this is about two things. On the one hand, we must protect ourselves in the fight against terrorism, but on the other hand, it is crucial that we join forces. I think that we should keep these two elements very much in the forefront of our minds.</p>
<p class="contents">I have outlined the way in which we want to reinforce our cooperation. First of all, we must focus on cooperation within the European Union, because I believe that if we succeed in this, if we make it clear – as I have tried to make it clear to you – that among the twenty-five of us, we can organise cooperation more effectively in a different way, namely by stepping up our efforts to pool information, by adapting our legislation, by cutting off funding for terrorism, then I think we can also create a precedent in that way, one which we can use in our contacts with the rest of the world. As has been stated several times before, it is a worldwide fight, but a worldwide fight also requires a worldwide response. It is also in that context that the European Union is active. I have mentioned a few measures. I have told you that we are in the process of reinforcing and intensifying our contacts with developing world countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, let me mention the forthcoming ASEM Summit, where we, along with the Asian world, will be discussing this topic. How can we fight terrorism jointly? What are the means at our disposal? How can we pool our information more effectively? I noticed during my recent trips to Asia how great a concern there is about this in the Asian world too now that attacks have also taken place there, that people over there are increasingly prepared to work together in the spirit in which we would like to. It has also been stated that it is important for us to work more closely with the United States and with Russia. I have tried to explain to you in my introduction in what way we are trying to achieve this. This is a constant concern to us, both in respect of the United States and Russia, and I would like to eliminate a misconception here once again, which was re-emphasised by Mrs Flautre, when she stated that I took something back of what I had said earlier. I do not believe that to be the case. I have spoken out clearly in our dealings with Russia, and I stated, and I am reading out the English: ‘we will use the regular dialogue that we have with Russia to discuss how to proceed’. It is important for the dialogue to be in place, but at the same time for us to clarify our values.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to return to the image of the hand that is tied behind our backs, which leads me to conclude that we should be more emphatic in spelling out our values and the reasons why we fight terrorism. We do so with the aim of honouring our own democracy, our own belief in human rights, of respecting minorities, and in saying this I am also referring to Chechnya, and we must do this together, we require everyone’s support for this. I can only reiterate my thanks for the support you have expressed today. I can also state that in the coming months, the presidency will be actively committed to vigorously pursuing the programme I have unfolded and which, in my view, is somewhat extensive and covers many areas, but we will need everyone’s help in realising it. I was pleased to hear today that that help will be forthcoming. As is customary, the presidency will report on everything that has happened and what we have done at the end of this term, at the end of the presidency. In saying that, I am also responding to Mr Wiersma’s question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even so, it is to be feared that such an atrocity will be repeated, and not only in Russia. The attack committed in Spain on 11 March was a demonstration in blood that none of our countries is safe from Islamic terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more the case as this terrorism is encouraged by certain commentators, who attribute responsibility for this massacre to Russia’s policy in the Caucasus: ‘If Russia did not defend the integrity of its territory, the terrorists would leave it alone’. Such, in essence, is the reasoning of these sophists, who can always find extenuating circumstances for the assassins and reasons to find fault with their victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of the young thugs who set the areas in which they live ablaze when the police commit the impropriety of entering them to ensure that decent people can live in safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, if we want to put a stop to these horrors, it is necessary, before all else, to name the guilty party: Islam, which, like Communism, seeks to use terrorism as a means of imposing a totalitarian system.

<p class="contents">At the same time, we express our deep concern about future developments in the area in relation to USA and EU plans and the manifest copying of their strategy by the Russian Government in the areas of internal and external security, especially their adoption of the doctrine of preventive war.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly obvious that the recent tragedy in Beslan and the inauspicious predictions are yet another result of the break-up of the USSR and the fall of socialism.</p>
<p class="contents">The imperialists engaged in internecine competition, which are responsible for the acute risk of destabilisation in the area and the widespread clashes, have their eye on the Caucasus region, through which the oil routes pass.</p>
<p class="contents">The concerns expressed by the US and EU imperialists are particularly hypocritical. The 'political solution' which they propose and the so-called internationalisation of the problem aim to turn the area into a Kosovo-type protectorate.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the grass-roots fight by the people of Russia seeking to overturn the current situation will create the preconditions to a fair and peaceful solution to the problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
