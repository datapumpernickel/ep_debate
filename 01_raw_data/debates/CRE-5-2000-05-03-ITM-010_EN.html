<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Deva (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, I am indeed privileged today to present this report to Parliament. It is one of the first reports from the Development Committee under the codecision procedure. I am particularly grateful to all my colleagues who have turned up in force to hear me speak and present my first report to Parliament and the heaving public galleries. All are waiting with bated breadth to hear my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very urgent matter. It is my hope that we can pass this report without any substantial amendment other than procedural ones because the report is an extension for one year of an existing regulation which supports four million refugees in the most war-torn and ravaged part of the world. If we delay or fail to pass this report in plenary as soon as possible, all further assistance, food supply, housing, shelter, water, sanitation and education, to the most vulnerable people in the world, will be severely affected as there will be no legal base in the European Union to support them and to fund them.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are doing today is to consider a Commission proposal to extend the regulation on aid to uprooted people in Asia and Latin America, which expired on 31 December 1999. The extension we propose is for one year until 31 December 2000. The extension of the regulation will enable a further EUR 40 million to be spent until the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1997 and 1999, Parliament sanctioned EUR 240 million. This regulation came to an end on 31 December 1999. By extending this regulation today for a further period of one year, we are also giving the Commission time to prepare a new regulation which I hope will be a multiannual one to replace the existing regulation. This new regulation, to be brought in at a later date, should build on, and take into account, the existing regulation as well the annual report and the evaluation which the Commission has undertaken to present to Parliament and Council in the very near future, and no later than September.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s original report on the current regulation, the Howitt report, was exemplary in how it was constructed by Parliament. It had considerable success in improving the existing draft and thus played an important part in supporting and improving the text which was finally adopted. Notably, the Parliament contributed to a strengthening of the regulation in its reference to environmental concerns, complementary support and cooperation and assisting local host populations, a strong approach for targeting support programmes towards women refugees, particularly those who have been the victims of rape, and a clear provision for the upholding of the “non-refoulement” principle, i.e. protection against forced return.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Howitt engaged then in a very positive dialogue with the Irish presidency as well as with the Commission in order to improve on the existing draft. In addition, and more importantly, more than fifty NGOs were consulted. Therefore the Parliament played a major role in producing this regulation with its report.</p>
<p class="contents">Support to uprooted people, refugees, returnees and internally displaced people in Latin America and Asian developing countries has been a feature of the Community budget since 1984. The UNHCR estimates that there are 4.8 million in Asia and some 88 000 in Latin America. Of these, the current regulation and the one year extension that our report today is calling for, will continue to help 2.9 million Afghani refugees of whom about 40% are in Pakistan and Iran and the 60% balance in Afghanistan itself. A total of EUR 24.3 million was given to Afghani refugees with a further EUR 960 000 to Thailand, EUR 6 million to Sri Lanka, EUR 11.8 million to Burma and EUR 1.8 million to Nepal. In Afghanistan, about 2 million people were assisted by the mine-clearance programme which is crucial in returning that country back to normality.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in a sense, an immediate approval of the proposal would postpone the need for a long-term solution. In doing so it would nevertheless allow the institutions to engage in a more thorough dialogue in this area and hopefully allow us to find a more permanent solution by 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also a very timely report in the context of asylum-seekers. We are now presented with a solution by this Parliament, by our institutions in Europe, where we want to and can help people where the problem is. We can stop people needing or wanting to come across if we can help them at the place where the problem has arisen. The central thrust of my report is to help the people in war-torn areas, in ravaged parts of the world, to settle back to normality, to have proper foundations and sanitation, proper infrastructure, and to stop them needing to travel as asylum seekers and refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, may I begin by stating how bizarre it is that we are debating the extension of a regulation tonight in May 2000 that already expired last December and which, under the Commission’s proposal, would again expire in seven months’ time. As the rapporteur for this Parliament on the original resolution four years ago, I cannot but comment that this represents a failure of political commitment in Europe to aiding five million refugees, some of the poorest of the poor, in Asia and in Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless we are here now, and the Socialist Group supports the rapporteur’s recommendation for adoption of this regulation with the minimum of amendments, already agreed in principle with the Council, in order to allow a fast-track, one-reading approval of the extension, and in reality to allow refugee support projects this year to go ahead rather than be cancelled. The need for this work remains as strong as it did four years ago. It is no good us debating conflict resolution in the Parliament and then finding that the sole support to assist people when the guns are put down or when the period of immediate humanitarian assistance is at an end is then forgotten altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation has enabled us to intervene in countries where there is deep conflict with serious abuses of human rights. For example in Afghanistan, which has today broken all world records for refugees with six million people having left the country since 1992, leaving the single largest and longest staying refugee population in the world. Or like the protection of the terrorised indigenous peoples fleeing from Burma. As one conflict ends another begins, as the half a million returnees expected in Timor by December this year go to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="contents">On this regulation, we know that the Council has some divided thinking. I have to say, Mr Patten, I regret that the Commission does too. Whilst it has supported projects in Asia to a great degree it has failed to address properly and with sufficient vigour the problems of refugees and internally displaced people in Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that I have spent much time visiting and studying the problems of violent, armed conflict in Colombia. In that country alone there have been 800 000 internally displaced people since 1996; 123 000 new internally displaced people between January and June last year. It is a disgrace that with this regulation the European Commission in the past has failed to address this problem. The sort of forced displacement that we have seen in Colombia I have seen too in Chiapas in southern Mexico where the presence of international aid workers is essential for the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Deva on his report, thank him for his kind words in his speech and endorse what he says. I know he will be listening carefully to the Commissioner when he sums up to see if he will put on record that promise to ensure that a future proposal for a multiannual regulation comes forward and that the annual reports will be provided. With Mr Deva we ask those questions of you, Mr Patten, and if we do not get satisfactory answers the Socialists on this side of the House will be supporting Mr Deva in taking a very different stance on this report altogether. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It no doubt says something about the relationship between Parliament and the Commission at the moment that the text presented to us has been produced very urgently and is therefore very brief and very simple.And, as Mr Howitt also mentioned, is it, of course, not particularly satisfactory to receive it four or five months after the regulation has in fact expired, but this is actually the usual way, although I do not suspect Mr Patten of being up to no good. It is the usual way things are debated in parliaments. A report is submitted which says that we must now extend the regulation. It is four months since it expired. Parliament is thus, in actual fact, compelled to say: all right, then, we really have to accept the extension for, otherwise, there will be even more people dying of hunger and destitution. It is not a fair way of doing things, and I shall therefore, like Mr Deva and others, also listen to what Mr Patten has to say. That said, however, I would also say that we need to implement this proposal as quickly as possible, for we must try to help as best we can and just hope that we can find a more satisfactory way of doing things in future. One simple little matter, which Mr Deva also emphasises, and which I too think we ought to discuss in the future, is the situation of women and children, which is, of course, extremely difficult and always will be in these situations. We therefore need to concentrate very heavily on this area and find some methodical ways of doing so, partly by involving NGOs and others who can make a contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I would like to join in the heavy criticism which has been levelled by the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Development and Cooperation and which has been outlined in the otherwise very constructive report of Mr Deva. These committees complained about the fact that the annual reports have not been issued by the Commission, and what is worse, the independent evaluations have failed to materialise, although these are, of course, vital in order to establish that the validity period of the regulations definitely needs to be extended. But how can we do this without the necessary reports at our disposal? </p>
<p class="contents">As has already been expressed in other criticism, this is probably once again a case of outstanding payments, unnecessarily complicated procedures for financial control and a fragmentation of efforts. Also the fact that the amounts spent are disproportionate to the number of displaced persons raises questions. Commissioner, of the EUR 240 million, 40% has been allocated to Latin America which has less than 1% of refugees in the world, while 60% has been granted to Asia which has 40% of the displaced persons. Were it not for the fact that a sudden discontinuation of the programmes would cause undesired effects and result in innocent victims, we would follow the advice of the Committee on Budgetary Control, but instead we will now follow Mr Deva’s recommendation. He has called for an extension of that programme by one year, although Mr Howitt has already pointed out that, in actual fact, we are already halfway through that year. We hope that the report and in-depth evaluation will as yet be forthcoming. Mr President, we are not talking about humanitarian aid but about viable projects aimed at self-sufficiency and the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons, ex-soldiers, etc. Surely we should be able to come up with the goods and establish that there is indeed reduced dependency on aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are prepared to give the Commission some respite because we know that so many people are making huge efforts and because Parliament too is not exactly whiter than white as far as the Council is concerned, which you are under-staffing, but I think that, in any case, we will need to get the Commission to keep its promise to us, because otherwise this cooperation will be futile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All we need to do is to change the year 1999 to 2000 and the European Union can support campaigns for another year for the benefit of uprooted people in Latin America and Asia. There is, however, more to it than that, as evidenced by the opinions of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the implementation and evaluation of this programme, the Commission has not exactly come up smelling of roses. Little consideration has so far been given to the operation of this programme. Sound annual evaluation reports are lacking. Moreover, we are still waiting for a long-term vision for this programme. I would, therefore, make the approval of the extension of this programme dependent on the availability of reports. Parliament must use this as a way of forcing the Commission to account for the spending of the development funds. </p>
<p class="contents">None of this detracts from the fact that the recipient countries sometimes have dire situations to contend with. The European Union must help where it can. The role of the national Member States, however, is at least as important. Indeed, at European level, we are always running the risk of making pledges that we cannot keep due to budgetary restraints. The most important prerequisite to a long-term solution for the problems outlined is sound coordination of Member State efforts. Nothing more, nothing less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This being the purpose of this report, I congratulate its rapporteur, Mr Deva.</p>
<p class="contents">To help those in need when it is in our hands to do so, at the end of the day, results in our really helping ourselves. The Bible as always is right when it states that there is a giving which does not impoverish. The other side of the coin is also true. Hoarding does impoverish. Countries that have serious internal hostilities and all the terrible reaping of that where the innocent go to the wall and countries encouraging displaced persons to return home ought to be helped. The fact of the matter is that those displaced are mostly women and children. This makes it even more imperative that action should be taken. Food supplies, water and sanitation, housing and shelter, education are, of course, the top priorities. I welcome the recognition of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the four amendments submitted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation must be accepted by the Commission and I hope that the Commissioner, Mr Patten, who did not very often give me happy replies on other things when he was in another office, perhaps today will give me some little encouragement that Christmas is really coming. It is essential that annual reports are submitted by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council, as is specified. If such reports are not forthcoming then I could not find my vote to go with this renewal. I believe that the Commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial framework needs to be introduced in keeping with provisions already agreed to. These provisions must be strictly adhered to and this change is absolutely necessary. The new text on comitology is necessary and when the long-term future of this regulation is assessed, this Parliament must have before it independent valuation reports, so where improvements can be made they can press upon the Commission to make those improvements. Where they think this expenditure of finance can be maximised to a better reaching of the objective and target of these regulations, then we should have the information before us so as to give us a good, healthy and proper debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the regulation, the Commission is obliged to prepare an annual evaluation for Parliament and the Council, something it has not done. However, the programme must not be halted under any circumstances; that would be quite wrong. It is important that the programme should be extended, but not before we have seen the evaluations. The Commission promised that we would have the evaluations in March, then in April and then in May. So where have they got to? An independent evaluation is needed for otherwise we have no guarantees that the money has been spent properly. The purpose of the evaluation is, of course, to improve the future programmes. Everything concerning development aid, including the rehabilitation of refugees, ought to fall within the remit of the Directorate-General for Development. It is this Directorate-General which has the expertise and it should therefore also have the responsibility. The Court of Auditors has also criticised the lack of clarity in the way the different initiatives are related to one other. It is indefensible and damaging to the programme that no effort is being made to introduce coherence. I am glad that there is support, especially in the Committee on Budgetary Control, for my amendment to the effect that the programme should only be extended once the Commission has fulfilled its part of the agreement and submitted annual reports and evaluations. Without this amendment, the Commission could get away with not having submitted a single evaluation report since the regulation came into force in 1997. I have also noted that my dear friend, Mr Dell'Alba, has had his grumbles printed as an appendix to my opinion. However, he is only speaking for himself. At any rate, he had no backing in the Committee, since he was the only one to vote against the conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, let me first of all thank my honourable friend for his extremely thoughtful report and for the care and attention that he has devoted to the issue of uprooted people in Asia and Latin America. It is common to all the speakers in the Chamber and to others outside that it is an excellent report but, speaking for myself, I would not have expected any less from my honourable friend.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation 443/97 on aid to uprooted people is an important instrument clearly, an instrument to deliver aid that is not covered by humanitarian assistance and the honourable Member Ms Maes made this distinction extremely clearly. It supports projects implemented by international organisations like the UN and the UNHCR and NGOs and these measures are designed to improve living conditions, not only for returnees but also for the communities into which they will integrate. In that context particular importance is attached to clearing the land of mines, a point which my honourable friend referred to, rebuilding farming systems, supporting secure livelihoods and embracing key health and education challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of honourable Members have made clear the good and practical work done as a result of this regulation. I noted in particular what the honourable gentleman, Mr Howitt, said about geographical balance and one or two other honourable Members referred to that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I also noted what the honourable gentleman Dr Paisley said about our moral duties to those who are uprooted. Dr Paisley and I have not always seen eye to eye on every subject but I hope that this is a subject on which we can see eye to eye and even share quotations from both the Old and the New Testament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission started preparations for the renewal of this regulation in Spring 1999. However, these discussions were delayed by the former Commission’s resignation last year. It was decided as an interim step to propose an extension of the current regulation up to the end of the year 2000. A Commission activity report covering the three years of implementation of the regulation from 1997 to 1999 was presented in its preliminary version to Mr Miranda, the President of the Committee on Development and Cooperation of Parliament, and, of course, to the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, preliminary findings of an on-going external evaluation on the implementation of the regulation were also transmitted. The final evaluation report will be submitted to the Parliament by September of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the amendments: the Commission broadly agrees with the four amendments which have been tabled by the Parliament. However, concerning the first amendment I would like to stress again that the draft of the activity report has already been made available to the Committee on Development and Cooperation and that official submission will take place next June at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with amendments two and three since they reflect the existing framework of interinstitutional cooperation with regard to budgetary discipline and comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me come to the fourth amendment. I recognise that the Parliament would like to see the independent evaluation report extremely soon. A number of honourable Members have argued that you should see that by July. We believe however, that given the late contracting of the 1999 programme, which means that some activities are only now getting under way, it would be better to finalise the report, which must be a thorough and comprehensive document, a month or two later, say by September. That will give us a reasonable period to evaluate 1999’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as you know, the evaluation is already under way and I will make any interim reports available as soon as they are produced. I want to make that commitment unequivocally. I hope that Parliament would be willing to agree this approach. There have been references to the new regulation. I can confirm that the new regulation is under preparation. It will need to take into consideration the findings of the evaluation exercise and, of course, before presenting it to the legislative authority, we in the Commission will have to ensure that we are able to mobilise the necessary human resources for its effective implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often, in my experience of just seven months, we undertake to do things without having first made sure that we have got the resources to carry them through and it is important for us to be honest about what we want to do and how we can achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Before closing let me once again thank Parliament for its support in extending the validity of this important instrument. I can assure honourable Members that I have taken account of the criticisms and of the aspirations that have been expressed during the course of this debate. I am old enough and experienced enough in political life to recognise the difference between a standing ovation and a raspberry, or a bronx cheer as the Americans would call it, and I do not wish to sit through another debate about a subject as important as this and hear it dominated by well-meant criticisms. So I hope that we can do better by the time we next discuss this important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with important technical details but, above all, we are dealing, as honourable Members have pointed out, with human tragedies that lie behind the need for all these measures and that is why we have to ensure that our own response is as rapid and as effective as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
