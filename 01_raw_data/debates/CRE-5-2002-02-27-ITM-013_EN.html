<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I am very happy to be able to introduce my report at this evening's plenary session. Colleagues will recall that this is an own-initiative report and in our early discussions in committee some concerns were expressed about the potentially enormous scope of a report on such a broad subject as transport and health. We agreed that in order to be useful, we would need to prioritise the issues that we focussed on very rigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason I focussed this report on just two key issues: gaps in existing legislation and where further work can have genuine added value. First, the introduction of health impact assessments for all major EU transport projects and policies is probably the single most important initiative which could help integrate transport and health policies and help to minimise the negative impact of transport on health. The second issue I focussed on was the promotion within the bounds of subsidiarity of cycling and walking within EU transport policy. This would have an enormous impact on maximising the positive effects of transport policy on health.</p>
<p class="contents">To demonstrate why action is urgent and necessary, my report summarises some of the key negative health impacts arising from transport growth. These include air pollution, noise, lack of physical movement and others. To take just one of these, transport is now the dominant source of air pollution in urban areas and despite the past decade's improvements in air quality in Europe, close to 90% of the urban population is still exposed to excess ambient levels of particulate matter, NO2, benzene and ozone. These can affect respiratory functions and lead to other health problems and diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is true that vehicles have become relatively less polluting, the effect in absolute terms is offset by the increase in the number of vehicles on the road together with the increases in the length and frequencies of journeys. The significance of this was demonstrated by a recent study that found that air pollution now causes a higher mortality rate than road accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also a very timely debate. New evidence from scientists in California in just the past few weeks demonstrates that car fumes can actually cause asthma rather than only exacerbating asthma in existing sufferers. New research in the UK, part-funded by the UK Government, reveals that children find it increasingly hard to breathe the closer they live to main roads.</p>
<p class="contents">So having focussed on two priority areas, I should explain the process used to identify those areas. First, on health impact assessments: in all the relevant literature it is clear there is still a lack of integration of health issues into transport policy at EU level. This was most recently and clearly evident in a synthesis report produced by the WHO and the UN Economic Commission for Europe in January of last year. That report was called for by European ministers to provide an overview of relevant existing agreements and to provide further recommendations. Their overwhelming conclusion was: "The main gap seems to lie in the lack of an overarching integration strategy which would bring together and use the synergies of policies and legislations relevant to transport, environment and health." We also have an EU Treaty obligation to better integrate these fields. Having spoken to a number of experts, it seems to me that health impact assessments should be introduced for all major EU transport policies and projects so that we can understand better the potential health risks and benefits of different proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">These analyses could be very helpfully integrated with strategic environmental assessments. This proposal actually complements and builds on proposals that are currently being considered in the Commission's proposal for a new programme of Community action in the field of public health. What I am proposing is that this commitment should now be implemented urgently as regards transport and health.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people will say that this methodology is not yet ready to be implemented. I would counter that very strongly. While this methodology, like all methodology, is still evolving there is more than enough knowledge to start implementing now. We need to be very clear about that.</p>
<p class="contents">The other part of my report focuses on promoting cycling and walking within the bounds of subsidiarity. I make a number of proposals which would help to promote those modes of transport in the EU. But I want to finish by coming back to an amendment that I notice that the PSE has tabled to the report which will have the effect of delaying the start of the health impact assessment until 2004. I regret that amendment since the methodologies exist for starting this process now. There is really no need to wait three years until the Commission comes up simply with proposals. For that reason, I will be making an oral amendment, which I understand has been agreed to by the PSE, to change the year 2004 to 2003. I hope very much that the other groups will accept that too.</p>
<p class="contents">Action in this field is urgent. Until we are prepared to give health concerns a major place in transport strategy, our children will go on paying for our inaction with their health, and increasingly with their lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transport users have accidents, suffer the stress of gridlock and, as local residents, are exposed to traffic noise and exhaust fumes and many other hazards, not only in urban but also in rural areas. In some cases, they affect an entire Member State, as we are witnessing in Austria, my own country, where major problems are caused by transit traffic. It is sensible, therefore – indeed, it is essential – to analyse and evaluate the impact of transport on public health and draw appropriate conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, we owe a debt of gratitude to the rapporteur, Mrs Caroline Lucas, for this own-initiative report. We must also thank her for her willingness to work with all the groups – particularly the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – in seeking sensible compromise solutions. The text which I assume we will adopt by a fairly large majority tomorrow is both ambitious and modest, and therefore deserves to be taken seriously. We want the Commission to carry out professional impact assessments and to use the scientific data as a basis for appropriate legislative initiatives wherever – but only if – these initiatives are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">If, indeed, it proves possible to implement some points by the end of 2003, which is one of the proposals set forth in the oral amendment by Mrs Petersen, we should welcome this step. We will be delighted to give it our support. We look forward with interest to the work of the Commission and our Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those of us in my political group have really helped ensure that we shall be able to obtain a good final product.</p>
<p class="contents">Efficient transport is crucial to our economy, especially in the case of regions far from the centre of the EU. At the same time, those of us who are dependent upon both passenger and freight transport must be entitled to communicate without such communication’s damaging public health through air pollution and noise. We must therefore make efforts to integrate public health considerations into transport, and we must apply that part of the Treaty which states that we must have a high level of health protection in all the EU’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the proposal in favour of health impact assessments for transport projects and policies. There are many good examples given, which we can use in our continued work. I would also call upon the Commission to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Cyclists and pedestrians must be able to proceed safely and quickly. Cars must be designed in such a way that, in the event of their colliding with passengers, they cause minimal injury. Moreover, we must multiply the good examples of cycle paths and pedestrianised precincts to be found in municipalities and regions throughout the EU. These are concepts we must make use of when we draw up our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to support the draft oral compromise tabled by the rapporteur. I hope we shall obtain a good result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been an arduous task, to which Mrs Lucas has committed herself fully, and I should like to thank her for her work.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper on European transport policy for 2010 makes the citizen, the user, the very focus of our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the objectives we put forward is simply to halve the number of fatal accidents on our roads by the year 2010; from the current total of 40 000 to less than </p>
<p class="contents">20 000 by that time.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight some of the recent measures that we have proposed to improve safety in this area, such as, for example, the directive on working times for road transport, which was recently adopted, and which will have obvious repercussions for safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission has submitted various practical measures to Parliament – some will be presented shortly – and they are all intended to achieve the same objective: a change to the Regulation on driving times and rest periods, the introduction of speed limiters for small lorries, the mandatory use of seatbelts in all vehicles – particularly in coaches – or the introduction of digital tachographs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is traffic pollution. With regard to polluting emissions from vehicles and their noise levels, we must concede that notable progress has been made. In the space of a few years, European standards have enabled us to considerably reduce this form of pollution from road traffic. We can however, improve further.</p>
<p class="contents">With the sixth action programme for the environment, the Commission has created an ambitious strategy to combat atmospheric pollution and its harmful effects, which is the CAFE (<span class="italic">Clean</span> <span class="italic">air for Europe) </span>programme on air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the initiatives that need to be taken for the future, I should like to mention two that are perhaps the most important: the first, which I feel is of enormous significance, seeks to replace 20% of traditional fuels with alternative, cleaner fuels such as biofuels, or even hydrogen, by 2020, with an intermediate stage in which biofuels will be in use by 2010, with the ambitious objective of 5.75% of all fuels consumed in the Union being biofuels by then.</p>
<p class="contents">The second initiative is intended to provide support for European cities that have committed themselves to an ambitious strategy of lasting and sustainable mobility; this is the Civitas project, for which EUR 50 million have been earmarked, to support these cities which are pioneering the quest to rationalise the use of the car in favour of greater use of public transport, not to mention the secondary initiatives designed to boost cycling or even walking.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe a study of the repercussions for health to be extremely important. The Commission has already made progress on developing methodologies for evaluating the impact on health and on its implementation in the Community context.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the need to make progress on improving methods and on carrying out pilot projects, financial resources will be made available from the new action programme for health, to develop and test the methodologies to assess the impact of transport on health. The programme is currently being discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council – to be specific, the rapporteur for the European Parliament is Mr Trakatellis – and is expected to enter into force in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have tried, by providing a few examples, to outline the way in which we are taking health matters into account in our transport policy, although I have by no means attempted to be exhaustive; for example, I would still need to mention everything that the Commission is doing in the field of air transport and health, in which, amongst other things, in addition to the initiative aimed at airlines, we are also working with these companies, precisely to safeguard the health of their passengers. All of this must be undertaken within the limits of our competences and of our resources, and taking account of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains open to any suggestion put forward by this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
