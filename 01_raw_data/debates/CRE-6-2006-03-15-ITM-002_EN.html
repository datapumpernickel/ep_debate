<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>   Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before moving on to the items on the agenda, I must inform you of something you already know. We will not have the opportunity to listen to President Mahmoud Abbas today.</p>
<p class="contents">A few hours after arriving in Strasbourg yesterday, our guest today, President Mahmoud Abbas, had to return to Ramallah. This was of course due to the dreadful and deplorable events that took place in Jericho and which have created a violent and dangerous situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last night I informed him that Parliament understood perfectly well that the crisis created in Palestine obliged him to return to his country to take control of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Destiny and fate have led to a highly symbolic situation. His having to leave Strasbourg having just arrived without being able to come to Parliament has something of the symbolism of Greek tragedy about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Abbas represents the majority of Palestinians who still support a negotiated solution to the conflict with Israel despite all of the suffering and all of the disappointments they have been through. He represents those people who, despite everything, still believe that it is possible to find a solution by peaceful means.</p>
<p class="contents">He is a man who has been trying to achieve peace through negotiations since the seventies and his presence here amongst us today would therefore have been a golden opportunity to support his approach; another opportunity missed as a result of an unnecessary and illegal military operation and the violence that it has caused.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole world is now wondering why and how such a military operation can help to strengthen Israel's security, why and how the humiliating pictures we have seen on the television or the destruction of that prison by bulldozers can contribute to Israel's security. We Europeans will have to pay for a new prison, like so many other things destroyed during these tragic confrontations.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence that has followed this military action is extremely worrying. As you know, the news this morning confirms that there are three western hostages, including two European citizens − two French citizens. There have been rumours of more kidnappings, but they have not been confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Last night, before Mr Abbas left for the airport, I visited him in his hotel and he told me of the efforts he had been making during the day to stop this military operation and to prevent the spiral of violence before it became uncontrollable.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Palestinian National Authority asked me to explain to you his reasons for having to return to his country, in order to try to control the situation and to prevent any more kidnapping of Western citizens, which is currently causing huge concern. The European Union staff who were controlling the border between Gaza and Egypt have also had security problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I must inform you that President Abbas has promised to return to Strasbourg and to speak to the European Parliament as soon as he can: probably during the next part-session in April. If that happens, we will then have the opportunity to hear how he intends to tackle the serious crisis in his country.</p>
<p class="contents">I asked him whether he wanted the speech that he was going to make today to be distributed to the Members of Parliament in writing. Mr Abbas felt that it had become out of date and that it was better to see how the current situation develops, and that he wanted to come to see us as soon as that situation allowed him.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a good time for the leaders of the political groups who wish to do so to speak. Some of them have asked to do so. Those who wish to speak may therefore do so for the relatively brief period of three minutes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At your proposal, Mr President, the chairmen of the groups decided to invite Mr Abbas here, because we see him as a man of self-control, conciliation and peace. We therefore deeply regret that he cannot speak here today. Mr President, you have explained the circumstances surrounding this.</p>
<p class="contents">In such situations, we are really pretty much helpless. I would warn against jumping to hasty conclusions: we must be circumspect, and we must not exacerbate the spiral of violence. However, we must demand an investigation into the storming of the prison in Jericho. We must get an answer as to why this happened, and this answer must be convincing, if indeed there can be an answer at all.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am warning against hasty conclusions, at a time like this it is worth reminding ourselves of the principles. We advocate an Israeli state within secure borders, but we also want a Palestinian state within secure borders. The Israelis have the same status as the Palestinians, and the Palestinians have the same status as the Israelis. I am convinced that, despite the pictures we have seen on television, the majority of people in both Israel and Palestine want to live peacefully. We want to encourage everyone to follow this path to reach an understanding. We call on all parties to put an end to the violence and to release the hostages – both European and non-European – because human dignity is a right for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Union will be able to make a contribution to peace in the region, in an objective, fair, non-partisan statement. Our group supports anything that can help bring peace to the Middle East. We very much hope – as you said, Mr President – that the time will soon come when the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Abbas, can make his speech to the European Parliament. That is our heartfelt wish.</p>

We all deplore the events of the last few hours. We particularly regret that Mahmoud Abbas is unable to speak to us. We regret it not for our own sake but because he would have been able to come: the fact that he was already here, that he was able to come to this Parliament, that he could accept our invitation, was an encouraging sign, in particular that we are able to receive the elected Palestinian president here. In so doing, we were providing a situation in which – as Mr Poettering just said – we are working together step by step towards a Palestinian state, by giving Mr Abbas his due, namely the future leadership of a state, representing his country in the region as an equal partner on the basis of full sovereignty. That must be our aim. And every little contribution that we can peacefully make to that is a job well done.</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been good if Mr Abbas had been able to take advantage of this situation, but that has now been postponed. We quite deliberately say postponed, because we hope that we will be able to welcome Mr Abbas here as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the recent events in Jericho, however, which I discussed, last night and this morning with those Members who have been in the area as election observers for the past few weeks, my group is asking the question that always arises in international politics in such circumstances: <span class="italic">cui bono</span>? Who benefits from what happened? Of course, we can only speculate about that, and speculation is not an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do have three questions. The first question is: does it actually benefit anybody to storm this prison? The answers we are currently getting from the Israeli media are not adequate. I do not think it makes sense that a state whose services are able to carry out targeted assassinations needs to storm a prison when it comes to the potential release of detainees held there. Surely there are ways to prevent that without needing to storm the jail.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is this: Why was this action carried out at all, when international observers were monitoring this prison as part of an international agreement? Why was this international commitment not honoured? Why was it not used?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I hope that this action was not motivated by any internal political reasons in Israel. It would be fatal if the internal political events that are due to take place in March were the real reason. We would find that very regrettable, because it benefits nobody. It might bring short-term domestic success, but it would harm the entire region in the long term.</p>

<p class="contents">It certainly seems to us that where the tectonic plates of the world’s three great monotheistic religions – Christianity, Judaism and Islam – are rubbing up against each other and causing sparks to fly, we need to proceed with extreme caution. This House should not underestimate the risk of a wider conflagration in the Middle East. The tragic events of 9/11 and the equally tragic response have seriously threatened the chances for continued peace in our world. Just as European Union diplomacy with Iran is being undermined by George Bush riding roughshod over the Non-Proliferation Treaty in his dealings with India, so our diplomacy on the Middle East is being jeopardised by the actions of Israel yesterday. I hope that the European Union, through the Council and Commission, will protest in the strongest terms to the Israeli Government about these actions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are questions to be asked about whether there was a conspiracy between the British and American monitors guarding the prison who left shortly before the Israelis moved in, and I hope the Council will come back to this House with a report once we know the full facts of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing can justify the attack on the prison. Nor can anything justify the hostage-taking that followed. I hope we will be able to move quickly to restore calm and confidence and I hope that we will be able to see Mr Abbas back in this Chamber in a much more serene set of circumstances, so that we can discuss seriously with all sides how we can create a secure and lasting peace in that troubled region.</p>

<p class="contents">Unilateral policies like the ones currently being pursued in that region lead to catastrophe, and by that I mean the unilateral policies of both sides. Unilateral mutual contempt leads to a dehumanisation of action. We can see this in practice in that region. In principle, we in the European Union, the Council, the Commission and Mr Solana must insist on one thing: there must be no more unilateral politics. Israel cannot decide on its own what the Palestinian state should look like. That is not on, and the international community cannot tolerate it. The Palestinians and their Hamas-led government cannot decide on their own how and when force may or may not be used against Israel. Europe and the world cannot simply close their eyes to this.</p>
<p class="contents">If both sides believe that their legitimate position can give them a universally valid right to action, allowing them not to talk to each other and to hold each other in contempt, then the international community must put an end to it. That also means that the decision of when and how Israel takes action in the Palestinian areas cannot lie purely in Israeli hands, even in the event of security problems. Mr Schulz, it is perfectly clear: there are domestic elections. Mr Olmert and the Kadima party said they would return settlements. By so doing, they scored points with the left wing. Now they want to score points with the right wing, and so they took this action. Let us have no illusions: it was pure electioneering. The worst aspect of this affair is that the future of this region is being sacrificed for an election.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore say to everyone here: we must not deceive ourselves. The Israeli action was outrageous. The prison in Jericho was no longer a prison. That is also the truth. They could hold a press conference with 500 journalists in there. I would like to see a prison anywhere in the world – and I have been jailed a few times – where you could hold a press conference with 500 journalists. Both were unilateral, unacceptable actions, and we must simply recognise that. If you want to release someone from prison – which is quite possible – there are ways of doing so under the rule of law. That is what the Palestinians, and Hamas, should have done. However, Israel does not have the right to storm an institution just because something is not right. Therefore, let us be honest: what we have to fight against is unilateral, arbitrary actions by both sides.</p>

Indeed, he considered that his country could be placed in an extremely serious situation by this new and, as you rightly pointed out, deliberately humiliating escalation in Israeli violence and its inevitable consequences, all of which, like the kidnappings, were totally unacceptable, as well as being, however, unavoidable and foreseeable.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this matter is of concern to the European Union on several counts, firstly because a Member State, namely the United Kingdom, had concluded an agreement with the United States and the Palestinian Authority under which it would be these two Western countries that oversaw the prison concerned. It is that agreement that Israel has flagrantly violated, despite there not having been any problems at all in the prison for four years. No prisoner has escaped or tried to do so. If, moreover – and I would address Mr Cohn-Bendit now - Israel had thought that there was a problem, President Abbas had proposed to the Israeli Government that the prisoners be transferred to Moukata under proper, indeed international, surveillance. There was therefore no excuse or basis at all for Israel’s decision. Can we accept that?</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason why I think this matter is of concern to the European Union is – if I may speak frankly – the EU’s systematically indulgent attitude towards, formerly, Ariel Sharon’s government and, now, that of his successor. How otherwise is it to be understood why an aspiring prime minister should dare be so reckless as to risk inflaming the already explosive situation in Palestine and in the region solely in order – and here I agree with my fellow MEPs – to appease the most extreme fringe of his electorate. It really is hard to credit. If he can allow himself to do this, it is because he knows that, on the one hand, American leaders give Israel carte blanche to do whatever it likes and that, on the other hand, Israel has got used to enjoying de facto impunity, courtesy of European leaders. We now have to ask ourselves the following question: given the results of this policy, are we going to continue blithely to look on while this new blow to peace progressively weakens the position of those Palestinians most committed to peaceful solutions including, in the first place, President Mahmoud Abbas?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the questions that, I believe, we have to ask ourselves. For my part, I shall submit three precise proposals tomorrow morning to the Conference of Presidents, all calling for an immediate reaction by our Parliament, the idea being formally to demonstrate our commitment to the rule of law and to a just peace in the Middle East.</p>

An attack on a prison and on political prisoners is never regarded as acceptable anywhere, nor has it ever been in history. Even political prisoners have the right to be in prison without being exposed to the threat of extra-judicial judgments. Today’s assault on the prison reminds me in a way of the enforcement of just such a judgment. Naturally, this event will provoke further reactions and tensions on both sides, leading to what might be described as a ‘never-ending story’. I was truly looking forward to today’s speech of the Palestinian President in this House, at the press conference and during our joint lunch, and I expected to learn about the vision that Palestine intends to bring to the negotiating table in the hope of securing peace for the citizens of that part of the world. I was hoping, and perhaps expecting, the European Parliament to assume the role of mediator. It is my devout wish that we might offer assistance in this way, since both sides now need peace at last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Abbas, who was elected directly by his fellow Palestinians and therefore has legitimacy, seemed to be taking on a mediation role, in order to negotiate between those who advocate the renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist and Hamas, which has not so far recognised this but has won an election, so that Hamas can be brought into the fold. I am afraid that it is now obvious that this role is being abandoned and we do not know who else can fill it.</p>
<p class="contents">The action in Jericho was a significant, emotive event, which leads to problems on the Palestinian side. However, I am much more worried that the withdrawal of the international observers from the United States and the United Kingdom will lead to the Quartet losing its credibility as a stabilising influence and a guarantor of stability. I am afraid that it all goes much deeper.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Fatah's actions in Gaza showed that those who were previously in favour of the renunciation of violence under Mr Abbas are taking on a new role now that they have lost the elections and have lost their sources of profit. And on the other side Hamas is not yet there. Those who used to advocate the renunciation of violence are moving away from that position, and the others have not yet reached it. That seems to me to be the current situation. Both President Abbas and the Quartet have lost credibility in putting things right. That is how it looks to me at the moment. In our own interests, I hope that this depiction of the situation will prove to be false.</p>

<p class="contents">You said, Mr President, that these were fateful or chance events. In fact, they had nothing to do with either fate or chance. The fact that the prison in Jericho was attacked at a period when the Palestinian President was in Europe to plead his cause, taking Saeb Erakat, the strong man of Jericho, with him, owes nothing to chance. The current pantomime of half-naked, blindfolded prisoners with their hands tied together owes nothing to chance in a country that, as we know, is in torment. The least thing can spark off violence, and caricature is never far away.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore faced now with an extremely serious event which, as Mr Brok has just said, is aimed at undermining the man who is the guarantor of stability between Palestine and Israel but who is also the guarantor of resistance to Hamas, which he would see become a force for peace. It is these objectives that an attempt has today been made to undermine.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know who will benefit from this crime, but what I do know is that we in the European Parliament must neither be fooled nor share responsibility for this crime, which we must condemn.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the situation is difficult and that negotiations were under way concerning the prisoner, Mr Saadate. It is true that the latter had been implicated in the murder of an Israeli minister, a murder that itself followed on from the killing of a PFLP leader. Are we to continue this cycle of violence? No, we must not. We need to keep a cool head, but we also need firmly to condemn what happened yesterday. The situation is really extremely serious.</p>

Nevertheless, they were free and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">We find ourselves with a man – Mahmoud Abbas – whose history you have described back to the 1970s, his commitment to peace, and his presence here today in an Assembly of 25 nations, directly elected, representing the very values that we are seeking to encourage in other parts of the world and especially in the Middle East: human rights, democracy, the rule of law, the free media, and so on. These are the values which I believe President Mahmoud Abbas was prepared to accept and of which he spoke in his inauguration speech in January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as a Briton, and with a deep commitment to the process of peace and democracy in the Arab world, I find it paradoxical, ironic and tragic that the two countries which speak so much about democracy in the Arab world are the very countries – the United States and the United Kingdom – which walked away from that prison, which abandoned their international responsibilities instead of reinforcing the prison’s security. We knew there was a problem; they knew there was a problem. It was their duty to deal with it. They did not: they walked away.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr President, that, when the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, over which you preside, meets in Brussels in a few days time, we will hear a statement from the Commission and the Council on precisely what happened, why it happened, when it happened and who took the orders. There is a case to answer here and a case that may need to be answered to the international community, but starting in this Parliament.</p>

It is therefore natural that the leaders of the groups and other important Members wished to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to take the opportunity to express briefly, on behalf of the Council, our deep concern regarding the continuing and escalating violence in the Middle East. The Austrian Foreign Minister and President of the Council, Mrs Plassnik, has condemned the violent attacks by radical Palestinians on EU institutions and has also given her support to the appeals by the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">The top priority is to restore peace and order and to protect human lives. We must remind all those responsible that they have a duty to protect human lives and to free the hostages still detained.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Poettering quite rightly said, this is not the time for hasty conclusions. The Council, too, will now discuss what specific steps need to be taken. I also agree with Mr Schulz, who said that all the institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – are duty-bound to act responsibly to ensure that the Middle East peace process does not break down irrevocably, but can continue.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to exercise restraint, in order to avoid further escalation. In this context, I would also agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that we need to prevent and avoid unilateral action. That is not the way to resolve the problems in the Middle East. Over the last few weeks and months, the foreign ministers have repeatedly grappled with the problem of the Middle East, most recently in Salzburg last weekend at the informal meeting of foreign ministers, on which Mrs Plassnik will report today.</p>
<p class="contents">Attacks on institutions, hostage-taking and all other kinds of violence do not just contradict our own values. They also disrupt and run counter to the peace efforts. We hope that, together, we will be able to get the peace process back on track.</p>

We share the concern expressed by some speakers at the extremely dangerous situation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We must of course highlight the fact that some Europeans have been taken hostage and that the interests of the EU and of some Member States in the territories have been attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out that nobody has helped the Palestinian people more than the European Union.

I do not wish to delay the House long, but I have to raise this point because it is a serious matter. Under Rule 191(8), relating to the Committee on Petitions, of which I am a member, a petitioner to the Parliament can insist on anonymity. However, in a recent case being considered by the Committee on Petitions, the anonymity of Mrs X, a former member of Lloyd’s, was breached, and as a direct result of that, Mrs X is being pursued by the British Government to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">This could not have happened if her anonymity had been preserved. It is essential, therefore, that this Parliament protect her position, maintain the rights of petitioners and stand up to the British Government. The chairman of the committee has written to you as a matter of urgency, but has not yet even had the courtesy of a reply. When will you respond, Mr President, and will you protect the rights and privileges of this Parliament and its petitioners? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
