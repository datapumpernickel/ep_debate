<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Torres Marques (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tourism is one of the most important economic and social sectors of the European Union in terms of the wealth it generates, in terms of the jobs it creates and in terms of its essential contribution to preserving Europe’s cultural and historical heritage. It is also a sector that is crucial to achieving full employment in the European Union, a goal laid down at the Lisbon Summit, and is also fundamental to regional policy, through stimulating growth and employment in less developed areas, especially in Europe’s peripheral and outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is still the most popular tourist region in the world and the potential of this sector, especially following the planned enlargement of the European Union, is immense. Nevertheless, major debates on tourism are rarely held in this Parliament. I therefore congratulate Commissioner Erkki Liikanen and his staff on having given us this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to thank the draftsmen of the opinions for this report for their contributions, the majority of which were voted for by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, thereby adding value to this report. Europe has a historical and cultural heritage and a diversity and density of tourist attractions that make it the most visited region in the world. This means that we can expect the volume of European tourism to double in the next twenty to twenty-five years, bringing a net benefit in terms of expenditure and profits of the order of 3% per year. Employment will grow at a rate of around 15% in the next ten years. This incredibly rich historical and cultural heritage of Europe is a crucial factor in attracting tourists, and has the advantage, in comparison with other industries, that it cannot be relocated.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important factors in the growth of tourism in the next few years will be the trends in the demographic structure of the population: in twenty years’ time, the population aged over 65 will have increased by 17 million. Individuals in this age group, who will enjoy better health, a longer life expectancy and greater resources, will feel much more inclined to travel than in the past. At the same time, demand for tourism will evolve: cultural and heritage tourism will increase significantly. What is crucial, however, is that tourism has become a social right for workers and, where young people are concerned, the entire European Union has become their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Other factors boosting the tourist sector, such as the liberalisation of transport and the development of transport networks, the progress of the single market, particularly the reality of the single currency, and the considerable developments and outcomes of the Information Society will continue to promote mobility and the internationalisation of tourist flows. Many measures adopted by the Commission have been crucial to the development of tourism. I would mention, in particular, the free movement of persons, the removal of borders, and the creation of the single currency. A new and very important step will be taken on 1 July of this year, when the 'euro' zone becomes the domestic market and electronic cards will mean that we could just as easily be in our own countries. I think that this is a very important step in terms of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">Since tourism is so important, we call on Commissioner Erkki Liikanen to include all measures concerning tourism in his presentation of the raft of measures to be proposed for next year or which are already underway. I say this because one of the fundamental problems is that so many sectors have an impact on tourism that, unless we look at them as a whole, much of the impact, the importance and the coherence of these proposals will be lost. I think that his proposal to create a European tourism forum that will meet annually and which will include representatives of the industry and of the European Parliament is a very appropriate measure and is of the utmost importance. The idea is that we must listen to what the tourist industry has to say and find out what its needs are, to which we can then respond. Another idea that I consider to be very important is that of a Community-level programme to promote tourism in Europe. One of the factors that we have been most frequently asked to remedy and which I feel is of the utmost importance, is for the European Union’s fiscal policy to consider labour-intensive sectors such as tourism to be entitled to pay the lowest rate of VAT. Lastly, I ask Parliament, in the Convention on the future of Europe that is now under way, to approve strengthening the legal base so that Europe can develop a genuinely strong tourism policy, which is what we need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to say first of all to Mrs Torres Marques that she has produced an extremely comprehensive report with a lot of good ideas in it. I would say to Mr Liikanen, whom I am pleased to see here in a different guise from when we normally engage in debate, that I read his proposal with great interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that the line taken by my committee in our opinion is that we are looking for areas where the Commission can add value. We are not looking for new Treaty competences. We are not looking for new layers of bureaucracy in an industry which, as Mrs Torres Marques has rightly pointed out, is characterised by the very large number of small- and medium- and owner-operated businesses. The last thing we want is lots of bureaucratic information collection and even ideas like new observatories.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has a role in adding value, in promoting ideas about benchmarking and sharing information about standards, but industry players and local authorities must be engaged in that process. I emphasise that they have to add value to the process. Mr Liikanen's portfolio is a very broad one already. I do not want to see him diverting a lot of resources into something that is primarily a competence of Member States and should remain so.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, I do not want to see us use the ideas about tourism – and certainly, as Mrs Torres Marques has said, it employs a lot of people – to call for centralising measures, for new tax centralising measures or for new measures that might engage regions directly instead of Member States. We should clearly be discussing tourism issues but we should be quite clear about where the responsibility lies. We should say to the Commission: add value, look for solutions but do not add to your Treaty competences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, it is even enjoying a phase of permanent expansion at European and global level. As an economic sector, the tourism industry accounts for 5% of jobs in the European Union. The lion’s share of the activities and of employment is generated by some 2 million small and medium-sized businesses, together making up some 8 million people. Furthermore, this employment is spread across different service sectors, such as transport and the hotel trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Small and medium-sized businesses are therefore clearly the driving force behind, and platform for, European tourism. This is why the proposed actions must be coupled with actions in the framework of the multi-annual programme for small and medium-sized businesses. To the question whether Community tourism policy should be developed for the tourism industry, the answer remains negative, at least for the time being. This does not detract from the fact that tourism policy must be coordinated more effectively and better managed. Tourism policy often gives a fragmented and chaotic impression. This is why actions in the field of harmonisation of information, the establishment of harmonised labels and networking must be strongly encouraged. In addition, the Commission’s initiative to establish an annual, European tourism forum at which the sector itself can set its priorities, receives our full support. In short, closer cooperation between all parties involved in order to make tourism more competitive and sustainable, appears to be a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believes that we need to use this advantage every way we can, at both European and national level. To start with, the Member States should include specific commitments on employment in the tourist industry in their national employment action plans. These actions should basically concentrate on vocational training, improving working conditions and applying policies to protect workers in seasonal, temporary and insecure jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">If these policies are to be effective, however, they need to be based on a proper study of the market and its present and future requirements. There is already a lack of manpower in certain professions in the tourist industry, which is why our committee is calling on the European Commission to draft a study into the requirements of the market in collaboration with the Member States and within the context of a tourism policy at national and regional level. It is also calling on the European Commission, in cooperation with Cedefop, to propose control standards for personnel training and to generate the required synergy between learning and professional experience.</p>
<p class="contents">If full use is to be made of the potential of tourism, these policies all need to be accompanied by support for manpower mobility at both national and European level. Tourism is a sector which is admirably suited to this sort of mobility policy. We also believe that we should make use of the potential for job creation and should strengthen employment among women, starting with various measures to help reconcile family life and work in the tourist industry and encourage entrepreneurship among women.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee also stresses the need to emphasise social tourism and calls on the European Commission to produce a communication on the various forms of social tourism and its importance in developing a European conscience among our European citizens and reviving the regions of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs Torres Marques rightly states, Europe remains the main tourist destination for third countries, despite facing increasingly stiff competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Treaties provide no specific legal base for a Community policy on tourism, despite the fact that our Parliament has been calling for such a policy for a considerable amount of time in order to give the Community major scope for intervention whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity. Since the Treaties do not provide for such a measure, the European Union must contribute to improving and encouraging cooperation in this sector in order to harness the enormous potential of tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the efforts of the Commission, whose communication proposes an operational framework for European tourism as well as a range of measures and actions to be implemented by the various players involved. The Commission highlights the complexity of this sector due to its diversity and its wide-ranging nature, which gives it little visibility at political level, a situation that does not properly reflect its true economic and social importance. The Commission has, however, shown a lack of ambition: its proposal does not raise hopes that a real boost will be forthcoming because it fails to envisage a genuine strategic framework for monitoring an industry with enormous potential but which is experiencing little growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with all of the recommendations contained in Mrs Torres Marques’s excellent report, not least making tourism an issue to be considered by the Convention on the future of Europe and I do not think that a joint action runs counter to national actions to promote tourism. Employment in the tourism industry is often highly seasonal and precarious, which is an obstacle to achieving sustainable development in this field. I therefore call on the Commission to draw up at the earliest opportunity proposals to include the restaurant sector, and possibly other as yet ineligible tourist services, on the list of sectors of activity entitled to a permanent reduction in the VAT rate, so as to boost employment and modernisation in the industries concerned and better equip European tourism to deal with international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, know-how in the field of management and technology must be acquired and spread in order to encourage new methods of production and to promote a form of tourism that responds as well as possible to changes in the market. Tourism is also a crucial element for the economic development of certain regions of the Union whose development is lagging behind, and for the outermost regions in particular, the tourist industry is the leading source of income and contributes significantly to their efforts to ensure the convergence of their economies towards the Community’s average rate of development. Tourism whose development is handled with prudence over the long term must provide local economies with a source of sustainable income and employment and must also contribute towards safeguarding and enhancing the landscape, cultural, historical and environmental features of the regions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to stress the crucial role that the European Union must play in encouraging new forms of tourism in new places, not least by helping continental Europeans to discover the wonders of Europe’s outermost destinations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe we are faced with a contradiction – a contradiction that emerges clearly as Mr Harbour speaks on behalf of Mr Bradbourn, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in this field of tourism. I believe we need EU competence in the field of tourism, not only to enable tourism to develop in terms of staff and standards and give us a coherent and coordinated tourism policy, but also – and I thought the Conservative Group would have really taken this to their bosom – because the present scenario is holding back profit generation and the opportunities to make money in that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism contributes 5% of the EU's GDP. It employs thousands of people in the Member States and yet we have no EU competence. We are faced at this moment with numerous – I do not know how many exactly – tourism policies reflecting national, regional and even local priorities that differ from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that we have a tourism ship that is sailing the seas with nobody on the bridge to direct it or to control it. That is not the fault of the Commission or this Parliament. The fault lies squarely with the Member State governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Even within national boundaries, tourism suffers from this effect of other interests – parochial interests. We really need to take the opportunity presented by Mrs Torres Marques to get to grips with this problem and to produce for the European Union a coherent tourism policy that will work and be of benefit to the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has listened to her colleagues and drawn up an excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism is the industry of the future, and, as has been said here, Europe is still the world’s largest tourist destination. As a growth industry it can also create jobs in regions where it would be very hard to do so otherwise. It is important that Europe’s competitiveness and its appeal in the tourist sector are increased through better coordination of different areas of policy, and more cooperation and networking. It is especially important to promote sustainable tourism and improve conditions for the growth of environmental and cultural tourism. I would also like to stress how important it is that all regions and citizens of the European Union keep up with developments in the information technology field and that broadband networks should extend to all companies in the tourist industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group would nevertheless like to emphasise the importance of the principle of subsidiarity with regard to the tourist industry and therefore supports the notion of limited action within the framework of the EU. For this reason, we oppose the proposal that the tourist sector should have a clear legal basis and its own budget heading. In my opinion a reduction in VAT in the tourist industry is justified, but many members of our group take a wary view of matters of taxation, as they are largely the business of the Member States. Regarding amendments, we support most of those tabled by Mr van Dam and Mr Bradbourn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, tourism is one of the most important sectors in the European Union and the absolute number one objective in certain regions in which tourism provides the majority of their gross domestic product and it is essential to the development and cohesion of these regions that they themselves also have significant common policies in other fields.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of a legislative basis which would make this sector more operative and remove it from the field of unanimous decision-making within the Council will give impetus to this sector, which is in the hands of the large tour operators and completely outside the control of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need decisions to be taken by qualified majority voting for tourism in the European Union. The necessary action to protect the consumer must not lead us to forget the protection of the interests of the countries and regions for which tourism is a product, which is also necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of tourism on regional planning, the impact on the environment, the traditional agriculture sector, employment, transport and its essential infrastructures, as well as relations with other non-Community States which are providers and receivers of tourism, in which that tourism generates wealth and employment, make the adoption of an operative decision urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a system of quality and efficiency indicators for tourism and the integrated management of the coastal areas within the field of policies at local, regional and national level must appear in a directive and not in a mere recommendation. An in-depth analysis should be made of the impact of fiscal transport measures on tourism and the environmental impact of tourism and, finally, the Convention and the Council should work in this direction. We therefore also need a common umbrella, a common policy and also common promotion for tourism in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In keeping with what is now the Union's standard approach, the report also ties tourism to the Procrustean bed of the laws of the market and competition in order to accommodate the interests of big business in the tourist sector, thereby dealing a mortal blow to small and medium-sized – and especially small – businesses in the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, a tourism policy should be based first and foremost on protecting and safeguarding the rights of workers in the tourist industry who, because of the seasonal nature of the industry, have terrible trouble securing insurance and health and safety rights and are the first to suffer at the whim of their employers.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that tourism should aim to satisfy the needs of the workers and the working classes in general for rest and recreation, which are vital if they are to maintain their strength. Consequently, it must be made into a universal right of the people, not a means for the big businesses ravaging the sector to suck in excessive profits. In this sense, tourism should play a positive role in wider communications, in getting to know other nations, customs, mores and cultures, in helping to develop friendly relations between nations and in promoting popular culture and history and a healthy and creative synergy between tourism and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, to a considerable number of regions in the Union, tourism is a significant source of income. It appears that, within the countries of the European Union, there is enough to attract both Europeans and non-Europeans in terms of nature, culture and in other respects too. The attractiveness of some regions is so manifest that the income from the tourism sector dominates, sometimes to a large extent, the revenue on the balance sheet. Certainly in those circumstances, prudence is called for. After all, tourism remains a luxury product that is largely dependent on the prosperity and sense of security of the world’s citizens. Even stagnation in one particular link of the tourism chain can have very detrimental effects on the sector as a whole. Recent events in aviation have illustrated this. This is why I should like to call on the policy makers to prevent, where possible, the unilateral bias on tourism by regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is the tourism sector very dependent on factors outside of the sector, it is also characterised by a major influence of the seasons. This means, in addition to unilateral financial dependence, that only partial use is made of the labour potential. </p>
<p class="contents">Also, the ecological vulnerability of many tourist areas forms an important concern. Areas that are of outstanding natural beauty or that are culturally attractive experience a quantitatively large and growing influx of visitors. This puts such heritage under extreme pressure. The policy should take this point very much into consideration. </p>
<p class="contents">These findings do not minimise the problem, but highlight the seriousness of it, certainly if we realise that with the EU’s enlargement, a considerable number of regions will be added to the list of tourist attractions. This is another reason why the measures to be taken in the tourism sector should be well thought through.</p>
<p class="contents">We can endorse the overall gist of these remarks that are included in the present resolution. Our struggle concerns the level at which the specific problems would need to be solved and the role which the European Union is to play in this. The EU, especially with its economic and structural policy, undeniably has a great impact on the situation in many of the tourist areas. It is questionable whether adding more tasks to the package of the Commission will strengthen the tourism sector and the Commission itself. After all, most of the expertise about the tourism sector lies with the regions, the Member States and the sector organisations. Initiatives to provide incentives should therefore mainly originate in these bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">After this reconnaissance exercise, a number of incentive measures appear to us to be conceivable. As already stated, there is first of all a task for the regions, the Member States and sector organisations. I struggle to think who could match their knowledge and expertise. Not only measures aimed at tourism, but also at activities of other kinds must prevent unilateral dependence on tourism in the regions concerned. A European sector forum could play a useful role in this. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Commission also has a part to play, not in setting up a specific tourism policy, but in synchronising those areas of policy that impact on the tourism sector. A sector which mainly comprises medium-sized and small businesses. Good communication and harmony between the relevant Commissioners and their services is desirable in this respect. In addition, the Commission will need to support the Member States in their endeavours to establish a stable economic situation in the regions. In our view, developing the versatility of a region is one of those supporting measures. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European institutions do not appear to have any other role of significance or added value. Accordingly, the inclusion of a legal basis for tourism in the treaties does not receive our support.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, areas which for a large part derive their economic <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> from tourism deserve attention and encouragement in order to offer them structurally sound prospects. All authorities involved have their own part to play. As far as the European Union is concerned, this means, in our opinion, that in the short term, particularly the synergy within the Commission deserves a boost. Accordingly, I have tabled a few amendments which I would warmly recommend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My starting point is the fact that the Treaty does not provide for Community competences in the field of tourism, since the matter is only mentioned once, in Article 2, which cannot be used as a legal base. This position is in keeping with common sense: the tourists who visit a region are attracted by its specific local characteristics and this is why, in the Member States, responsibility for tourism is held at local or regional, sometimes national level. Although international cooperation may sometimes appear desirable, there must be flexibility between public and private partners, and cooperation should not have to be bound up in the administrative straightjacket of the Community system.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Commission clearly do not see matters in this light. They want to incorporate tourism into Community policies and create a framework programme with an appropriate budgetary line – see paragraph 12 of the draft resolution – with Community administrative resources – see paragraph 44 – and even, it could be said, a sort of planning. What are their reasons for this?</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism is important for growth. It can be a tool for development and can create jobs. It is already indirectly affected, to a greater or lesser degree, by several Community policies. The report now before us even adds that with the attacks of 11 September having indirect consequences for tourism, a European tourism policy has become necessary in order to respond to the shock that was inflicted. These arguments are interesting but none of them is central to deciding whether such a policy should be implemented at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Article 5 of the EC Treaty lays down only one criterion. Will the action that is planned be implemented more effectively if it is managed from Brussels? The argument on this point that the report puts forward is very weak, even non-existent. The opinion delivered by our Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, contains a revealing phrase. Having rightly noted that it is hard to see what a Community tourism policy would cover, it adds, and I quote: “Nevertheless, there is no doubt that common needs do exist and we must identify them”. In other words, something is needed – but no one knows what this might be.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, this report clearly shows that the Commission and the European Parliament are capable of proving that everything and anything falls within their competence. If they had their way, this approach would apply ad infinitum. This is why it is crucial that at the next intergovernmental conference, genuine supervision of subsidiarity, in other words, supervision from outside the Community institutions is put in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that, at some point, we have to move from words to deeds. I have attended more debates like this than I care to remember here in the European Parliament and at some point they start to sound like empty liturgies. So we really do need to move from discussion to deed, to measures, to implementing what we keep talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that obviously we should welcome the European Commission's communications on tourism, but we also need to say to Commissioner Liikanen that they are not enough. You start with these communications, Commissioner, but you do not see them through to the end. Various directorates, not just yours, have passed general measures on tourism, the internal market, the Structural Funds and the environment. These measures need to be coordinated, even though there is no common policy, if the European Union is to produce the best possible tourism policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I want to comment on is the famous legal basis for tourism. There is a legal basis for industry, but there is no legal basis for tourism which, in a few years' time, will be the most important sector in industry. Despite the fact that, by definition, tourism goes beyond borders and is by definition an activity which is beyond a single Member State's control. We therefore need a legal basis which will not be a substitute for national policy but, on the contrary, will help us adopt a policy with added value at European level and, in the final analysis, will help Europe stand up to international competition. That is why we need to make sure when the Treaties are revised at the next intergovernmental conference that we have the legal basis which the European Parliament advocated at the last Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The schools were only shut for two days and the number of new cases quickly petered out. And yet, this had an instant and severe impact on Greek tourism, with numerous bookings cancelled, exacerbating the crisis sparked by the events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, this reaction was unwarranted because the ministry had acted in a purely preventive manner, demonstrating gravitas and a sense of responsibility in allaying tourists' fears. However, the hype created by certain mass media and a few loose cannon resulted in cancellations and disappointment for those who make a living out of tourism in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">What else could the Minister of Health have done, however? Should he have thought first of the financial consequences or of the potential risk, albeit tiny, to the health of Greeks and visitors alike? If you were the minister, Commissioner, what would you have done? The same, I imagine. You would have put health first. But nor are the businesses and people who make a living out of tourism at fault and they are right to call for proper action, to call for the protective umbrella of the European Union. When they work and serve a sector which contributes as much as tourism does to the balanced development of the regions of the Union and, in the final analysis, to European integration itself, a sector which is as susceptible and sensitive as tourism is to every sort of crisis, then these businesses, these workers, these European citizens rightly and reasonably feel that it should not be abandoned to its own fate.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be able to take measures to moderate these unfortunate repercussions, we need to be able to finance suitable action from the Structural Funds, we need to make special provision in the budget for funding to improve tourism, with everything that means and implies. Clearly we need to incorporate the tourist parameter into all Community decision-making procedures and Mrs Torres Marques' excellent report paves the way for just that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to emphasise the importance of tourism in boosting the economic activity of the outermost regions, and as a means of combating underdevelopment. This sector is the main activity in these regions in terms of the wealth it creates and makes a major contribution to the task of bringing these areas closer to the more developed regions of the European Union. It is, therefore, crucial to recognise the value of the role played by tourism and the potential for economic development that it represents. We must not, however, forget that these regions cannot remain dependent on tourism alone, an activity of whose vulnerability we are all aware. We must, therefore, support work on economic diversification by making use of the opportunities provided in Article 299(2).</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to highlight the need to develop efficient and sustainable transport infrastructures, with the aim of making access to the remote and island regions easier. The increase in tourist flows and the consequent development of the sector depend on measures that improve accessibility, which, combined with a proper policy of promoting and making the best use of environmental, historical and cultural resources, could be an instrument of crucial importance to the development of these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would highlight the special fragility and environmental wealth of territories such as the outermost regions, which are on the one hand a determining factor and tourist attraction, but which on the other require sustainable tourism. Unless this happens, the very development of the economy and the tourism of these regions will, in the medium term, be irremediably compromised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Torres Marques’ excellent report – in which, moreover, she was willing to include contributions from her fellow Members – which she supports with figures, gives such a good account that there is no need for us to go over the ground again, describing how the tourism sector is not just a sector which is vital, extremely important for the European Union today but also one of the crucial sectors for its future, both in purely economic terms and indirectly, because of its potential to contribute to environmental policies, social policies and policies for promoting peace and awareness between the people of different areas. That said, we are now stuck in the absurd situation where, although we acknowledge the value and strategic importance of the sector, we are unable to come up with any policy with a European dimension to help it face its new challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges are those that have been mentioned by the Members: there was September 11 and, on a more general note, we are faced with the question of the competitiveness of the tourism sector, whose dimensions have changed; there is a problem of training; there is a problem of environmental sustainability. We need tourism to help us but it needs our assistance too to bring about environmental conversion with a view to achieving sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, Commissioner, that you cannot do much at the moment because of the constraints of the Treaties, but maybe you could speed up policy coordination and even join us in calling – as we are doing – for the forthcoming Convention to develop such instruments, legal instruments which will make it possible to create a sectoral policy that will help us face the challenges of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 19 February the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, under the chairmanship of Mr Caveri, organised a public hearing on the future of European tourism, which was attended by the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Caveri and the rapporteur, Mrs Torres Marques, for their active contribution, as well as the members of the committee for all their work and for the report tabled today. Various other committees gave their opinion. I should like to thank Mr Harbour, Mr De Clercq and Mr Graça Moura for their contributions. The Commission in general can go along with the draft report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a limited number of issues that need particular attention and on which I would like to make some comments: first, the question of a stronger legal basis in the EC Treaty. In our view, the Treaty of the European Community, in particular Article 3.1(u) and Article 157, establishes a sufficient basis for the actions proposed in the Commission’s Communication.</p>
<p class="contents">After the ratification of the Nice Treaty, a qualified majority will be sufficient for supporting measures in the context of Article 157 of the Treaty to increase the competitiveness of European industry and, therefore, of tourism enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the need for a better promotion of Europe as a tourism destination. The Commission agrees with the Parliament report that more should be done to promote Europe as a safe and attractive set of tourist destinations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is regularly requested to examine this issue as well, and it agrees with the wording of the report and of the draft Council resolution that will be formally adopted on 21 May, in which it is emphasised that: "with a view to contributing to the improvement of the global image of the European Union in the world, consideration could be given to analysing the present image as well as to discussing the possibilities of improving it, for instance through the new information and communication technologies, through benchmarking of best practices or through the coordination of certain combined promotional activities by tourism authorities and/or industry, while ensuring that competition among Member States is not distorted".</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as far as the opening of the Tourism Consultative Committee to the public is concerned, on the one hand, the Commission has already opened – and will keep open – several of the committee meetings to include the participation of industry and other stakeholders representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Consultative Committee on Tourism is a body established by a Council Decision in 1986. Members of this committee are designated by Member States, and the Commission chairs the meetings. It is true that in this Council Decision there is no basis for this and it will be difficult – unanimity is needed – to amend it, in order to open it to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the annual forum meetings, which will start in December, will be open to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention that the informal ministerial meeting organised by the Spanish presidency in Santander on 4 May was followed the day after by a seminar attended by major public and private stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">The event showed that the proposed actions in our Communication are in line with the priorities of Member States and of the other stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very encouraging to note the attention the European Parliament continues to give to tourism and that it agrees largely with us. This will facilitate our work in attaining the objectives described in the Communication, and in implementing these and other actions which could promote sustainable and competitive tourism in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, although many of you favour a more ambitious approach, I consider that this process has been particularly successful. The merit of the Communication is that, for the first time for nearly ten years, it has attracted strong support from all Community Institutions for tourism-related activities. The recent meeting of tourism ministers at Santander has shown that we are truly engaged in working together for the future of European tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The next important step in this cooperative approach in EU tourism issues will be the first European Tourism Forum that the Commission is organising with the industry and other stakeholders on 10 December this year, to which all the European private and public stakeholders, including representatives of the European Parliament, will be invited.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for this very constructive debate. I am sure that much work remains to be done to convince the European public and decision-makers of the vital role of tourism for employment and growth perspectives in our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those who said that the number of people employed in tourism makes it a core employment sector. Secondly, even though today the average figures are still around 7-8% of GDP, we have countries where tourism accounts for up to 12% of GDP, which shows its importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism deserves our attention, and we must coordinate different policies as well as possible to promote the future prospects of European tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
