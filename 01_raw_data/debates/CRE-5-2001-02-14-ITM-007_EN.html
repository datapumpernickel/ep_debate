<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rocard (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, when the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs decided to present this question to the Council, it wished to focus on two specific and interrelated points: firstly the free movement of third-country nationals following the decision of the Tampere European Council and secondly, the expected legal base for this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, our question was also, of course, related to the preparations for the Nice Summit, since we hoped that decisions in favour of social policy and freedom of movement would be taken. Since then, particularly in the lead-up to that European Council, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has had occasion to look into the issue of freedom of movement in more general terms. This more general consideration has proved useful in indicating to us that, before extending freedom of movement to third-country nationals, we must, of course, ensure that it operates smoothly for European Union citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We were concerned to note, however, that Regulation 1408/71 was becoming less and less appropriate, and that every month saw further postponement of moves to modernise and simplify it. This is a serious situation, for freedom of movement is one of the truly fundamental principles of the European Union. This is what enables EU citizens to move, reside and work without obstruction. That is why Regulation 1408/71 – which was originally designed to coordinate national social security systems – is one of the keystones in Citizens’ Europe, and any obstacle or delay to its being modernised is a serious matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me, Mr President, to take these three aspects in turn. Firstly, let me hark back to the wording of our question. Firstly, what do we have to say regarding the extension of Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals? We are forced to note that the action taken by the Council does not always, or rather does not yet – which is not quite the same thing, reflect the expressed political will of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 to create within the Union, I quote, an “area of freedom, security and justice” in which “the legal status of third-country nationals should be approximated to that of Member States’ nationals.”</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I would remind you that Parliament had already decided the same thing in October 1998, when the Commission proposal under review at that time was adopted, without amendments, by Parliament. In other words, the Commission had taken the initiative, Parliament had supported the proposal in a clear vote and the European Council at the highest level, in Tampere one year later, gave legitimacy to this policy direction. Yet, in 2001, the Council has still not adopted a common position to enable us to continue the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the reason for this intolerable delay and this denial of political will by the Heads of State and Government even though, for once, there is perfect agreement between the three institutions, when this is not always the case? Apparently this is due to the question of the legal base of this text, which sets the Council against the position adopted by the European Council and the Commission. But if you will permit me to express this legal dispute in readily accessible terms, what is the Council after in opposing this legal base? It is seeking to take the European Parliament out of the codecision procedure (you will tell us that it could do this). That is what is at issue. So, do not shake your head! You are rejecting our right to take part in codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">This business does not affect just the role of the European Parliament; it is of direct political interest to the citizens of Europe. The extension of Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals is such a sensitive issue that the citizens of the European Union ought to be fully involved in the form of the European Parliament, which represents them. That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs cannot accept the reference to other legal bases other than those given in the Commission proposal, and would like to point out that Regulation 1408/71 cannot be amended except through the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what we are challenging in the Council proceedings is one and the same issue, whether it concerns European Community citizens or third-country nationals. In both cases, the slow progress of work in the Council is obstructing the development of free movement. The Council cannot shirk its responsibilities; it must apply the decisions of the European Council and apply them transparently with regard to public opinion and in proper compliance with democratic rules while respecting the role of the European Parliament. Failing to go down this route, Mr President, would doubtless impel the Members of the European Parliament to respond firmly – and with public support, we have no doubt – and to take action to oppose these obstacles to free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that my protest is not, of course, directed at the Swedish Presidency as such but at the Council. Indeed I believe that the Swedish Presidency, on the basis of its traditions, may make a great contribution towards solving this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to conclude on another matter relating to the imminent future of the European Union, enlargement. The Committee on Employment deems it essential for the countries involved in the next wave of enlargement to be informed of the various outstanding proposals regarding reform of the relevant article in Regulation 1408/71. The issue of freedom of movement is, as we are well aware, one of the sensitive aspects of the accession negotiations. What are the Council’s plans in this area? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The presidency therefore welcomes this opportunity to debate it and will of course be listening very carefully to the analyses of this issue by all participating Members.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Rocard points out in the question, the conclusions from the European Council in Tampere addressed equal treatment of third-country nationals who are legally resident in the EU or in the EEA, for example by according them rights and responsibilities similar to those of EU citizens. It is therefore necessary to adapt the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 with regard to harmonisation of social security systems. The rules for harmonisation contained in this regulation are a prerequisite for the free movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">If third-country nationals are covered, they will also receive the opportunity of guarantees for ‘acquired rights’. This is in contrast to the current situation in which harmonisation is only regulated through bilateral agreements, to the extent that such exist.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, before the European Council in Tampere, the Council received a proposal from the Commission aimed at expanding Regulation No 1408/71 to cover third-country nationals. This proposal was addressed by the Council in November 1999. However, the Council has not yet been able to reach a decision on the proposal, as there is unfortunately no agreement on the appropriateness of the proposal and its legal foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with this, the Council is currently considering the Commission’s proposal on simplifying Regulation 1408/71. This proposal also advocates the regulation being expanded to cover third-country nationals. The Council is currently giving the proposal its first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware of the criticism of the Council for the fact that this matter has taken so long. However, one should remember that we are addressing a technically very complicated subject. The technical review currently underway will help us to establish difficulties which may arise from an expansion of the scope of Regulation No 1408/71. The political negotiations necessary to complete the reforms will, without doubt, benefit from this detailed technical review.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Rocard’s third question on consultation with candidate countries, there is no formal consultation either with the candidate countries or with the EEA countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I must say that I am slightly disturbed by the lack of response on one or two of the issues there, but I will come to those in one moment. My report deals with this regulation and, as has been said, it concerns a key mechanism in the implementation of the European Union's goal of free movement of people in that it coordinates social security systems. It certainly does not seek to harmonise them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three aspects to today's debate. We have heard already about third-country nationals and the legal base which should be applied to include them in the scope of the regulation; the comparative lack of progress in including accession countries in the coordination process; and the update of the regulation in my report to bring it into line with the changes made in the social security systems of certain Member States. I will say more on that, but touch on the other two issues as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been stressed, a crucial factor underlining all these elements is the need to make rapid and positive progress on the Commission's proposal for a simplification and modernisation of the whole of Regulation 1408/71. It is essential for the Council to understand that in Parliament we have consensus and are determined on that point, whatever the differences that might appear elsewhere about the right strategy. We have been looking to the Council for a positive response about the speed of that overall reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 4 of the resolution tabled by four political groups makes it clear that Parliament is no longer prepared to continue with the piecemeal amendments and technical updates – of which my report is the latest and, we believe the last example. We must now have overall integrated changes necessary to resolve the bulk of the problems currently arising from this regulation as soon as possible. That is why the amendments proposed and supported by the committee are technical ones. We prefer generally not to accept amendments concerning the scope of the regulation, the benefits covered, the changes in the competent authority and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is to deal with this report most speedily so as not to give the Council any excuse for not moving rapidly to the conclusion of its initial debate on overall simplification – again a point raised in the joint resolution. That is also the primary reason for my not accepting the amendments tabled in the name of the PPE, although I also have difficulties with the content of one or two of them. Amendment No 8, for example, deals with occupational pensions which are not state-provided benefits and therefore currently outside the scope of the regulation. I also consider that Amendment No 10 might be regressive in some Member States, as it proposes a general condition governing entitlement to unemployment benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that certain of the proposed amendments touch on some important issues and Parliament recognised them in its vote on the report on frontier workers last month – again, as recalled in the joint resolution. Such workers are of course an issue for accession countries. We are aware that free movement both to and from those countries depends to some extent on successful coordination of the social security systems. Much of the debate about free movement tends to neglect the fact that people from current Member States wish to work and establish themselves within the accession countries, and hence our interest in the state of those negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I strongly support the Commission's proposals to include third-country nationals in the regulation and to do so on the legal base it has proposed. Parliament should be involved in codecision on this issue, as it now is on matters relating to coordination of social security in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of third-country nationals seems to me to be recognition of the principle of equal treatment of those who contribute to the economic and social life of the Union. The joint resolution recalls the Tampere Summit when Member State governments stated that the legal status of third-country nationals should be approximated to that of Member State nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">I was at a European Union migrants' forum conference representing the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs soon after that statement was made. It was welcomed as a strong indication of the Union's desire to be anti-discriminatory in its actions. I regret that the Council cannot yet uphold the proposed legal base and live up to the hopes it has raised in the EU's so-called "16th Member State" of third-country nationals and among those of us who wish to see them treated fairly and equally.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would urge Parliament to move to a rapid conclusion on my report so that we can turn our full attention to the much-needed simplification and modernisation of the whole of Regulation 1408/71 to make it more inclusive and effective for all of those covered by a social security scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has had the same effect on my fellow MEPs of the socialist group, with whom I usually manage to come to an agreement very quickly whenever I mention frontier work. I therefore wonder whether there is a fear of getting in the way of our own Social Affairs Ministers, or does it, Mrs Lambert, amount to a well-intentioned difference in political strategy? Every year, we receive from the competent committee a report on Regulation 1408, which attempts to coordinate the social security of frontier workers. This contains amendment proposals, in order to bring this regulation up-to-date. For years, the EP has used this as an argument to extend our wish-list without causing any division in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Mr President, despite all the resolutions, the Council of Ministers has never taken the trouble to so much as glance at Parliament’s proposals. I should also therefore address the European Commission in my lament today. For as early as in 1998, the Commission, which is, after all, the originator of legislation and guardian of the European Treaty, made an excellent proposal to modernise, adapt and extend the regulation. But the Council is playing the same game with the Commission, unfortunately. The Commission proposal has been, and is being, discussed and is the subject of debate, but we have been awaiting a concrete result for the European Commission for the past three years. I would ask Commissioner Solbes Mira whether this might not be a reason for joining our camp now, rather than waiting patiently for the moment when the Council, in its great wisdom, will take a decision?</p>
<p class="contents">I have also listened very carefully to the chairman, Mr Rocard, who I value greatly. I have heard his passionate plea before the Council for the recognition of the rights of the European Parliament and for Parliament to be able to play that role. I do not need a plea for this. The EP has a role to play in this procedure. We are co-legislators, Mr Rocard, so that role has already been carved out for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I therefore also express my deep disappointment at the words which Minister Danielsson spoke a moment ago. He has given any response to what Mr Rocard has said. None whatsoever. They may be in favour of debates and of adapting and extending regulations, but how they intend to bring this about, or what the timeframe is, is a mystery. I wonder whether this House cannot even expect an answer to this, and I therefore wonder, on behalf of all those who face those commuting problems on a daily basis, whether we, the Commission and Parliament that is, should not make use of our powers and invite this Council around the table to establish what we can do with the proposals which we have tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lambert, there is absolutely nothing in them which is even slightly peculiar. We mention pensions, and the Commission comes back with the proposal. The same is true for unemployment and medical expenses. This is all enshrined in proposals which the European Commission has also made at the request of Parliament. There is, therefore, nothing out of the ordinary in them, Mrs Lambert. I suggest you have a look at your own dossier and you will find that it is better to join our camp and to ensure that we can get this Council to join us at the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have been quite happy to tell my group tomorrow that we have received nice pledges, but nothing came of them, and that is for me a reason to call on everyone once again: let us ensure that we now get to talk to them and I hope that the Commission’s reply will also be another acknowledgement of Parliament’s plea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of these concerns Mrs Lambert’s report, which is sensible and pragmatic and contains the necessary changes in the light of the annual updates. This is a technical report and the Group of the Party of European Socialists thinks it right and proper that it has been separated from our political reports. For this very reason, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I do not understand your outburst. I think you are getting worked up about a report which really does not warrant it and that you are putting the rapid harmonisation of legislation in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">The position we have adopted, which is one we have held for the last six years and more in our committee, is, quite understandably, to secure the right to freedom of movement, the rights of frontier workers and also the rights of third-country nationals whose families are in Europe, as quickly and as comprehensively as possible. That is why the position of the Council seems to me somewhat lacking. But our motion for a resolution, which we tabled together with the other left-wing groups of this House, contains a clear and, I think, urgent request for the Council to lay the directives, the regulation and the revision of the regulation on the table by the end of the year. From what I have heard, I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ria, I regret, therefore, your zigzag course. When we look at your proposals, we find they do not tally with what you have said. For instance, in Amendment No 1 on paragraph a, why did you remove social security? We all want social security to remain a component; we do not want only economic interests to be to the fore. In the case of Amendment No 4 to paragraph 1, you have removed third-country nationals. That is a big problem. It has always been close to our hearts that we are dealing not only with the citizens of the European Union but also with workers and people from other countries, who are legally resident in our countries. That is why we expect you to include these groups of people. You can be sure that this problem will return to haunt us at the time of enlargement – but probably sooner – namely when the glaring deficit in qualified workers, which will make itself felt in all 15 Member States, is all too apparent. We cannot restrict legal status to workers; we must also include workers’ families.</p>

We know. We all do. However, because it has taken the Council, or Commission, such a long time to pluck up the courage to assess this regulation and to include it on the agenda, this was simply a cry from the heart from people who believe that it should at long last be included on the agenda so as to make it possible to hold a broad, political debate using sound arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lambert said that discrimination must be prevented. I could not agree more, and everyone should support this view. However, as Mrs Oomen<span class="bold">-</span>Ruijten has already indicated, frontier workers are still being discriminated against, and the Left has no intention of doing anything about this. Do not ask me why. I would urge them too to roll up their sleeves in this area, as these people are still being discriminated against. That is my first point: we are drafting a directive which evidently has a discriminatory effect, especially in terms of frontier workers. Something must be done about this.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another point, which is possibly of even greater importance, namely the future of the Union. We are now addressing the subject of interest at European level, and we are currently controlling the economy centrally, from Brussels. This is to be welcomed. What has not been tackled yet is the mobility of workers, since each Member State has its own wishes and legislation. This will be a threat to the European economy in due course. It is vital that mobility is established.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as frontier workers, as well as people on secondment, are concerned, I am of the opinion that they should be given a choice. When I see how journalists who are stationed in Brussels for five years have to return home because they would otherwise have to surrender their pensions, I consider that the European Union is behaving quite outrageously with its legislation. Certainly if this period is reduced to twelve months. I therefore believe that the employed should have far more freedom of choice, leading to a widening and improvement of worker mobility. I believe that a) not discriminating any longer, at any level, represents a positive step forward for us and b) that this will benefit the European economy.</p>

The likelihood of implementing fundamental changes at the moment is therefore rather slim, although these changes are desperately needed, as everyone is all too aware.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would therefore argue in favour of a resolution which has been tabled jointly with the PSE, the ELDR and GUE, as was indicated a moment ago. First of all, the Council should adopt the Commission proposal for extending the directive’s scope, in order to cover third-country nationals who reside in the EU lawfully, for they are clearly being discriminated against at present. This is in contravention of the Charter of Fundamental rights and Article 12 of the Treaty, and clashes with the concept of the Citizens’ Europe. ‘Citizens’ Europe does not only refer to the European citizen, but also to all citizens in Europe. I hope that the Council will commit itself to a so-called inclusive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important point, which has already been made, concerns frontier workers. Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and, in actual fact, Mrs Van Lancker before her, as well as others, have already made huge efforts in this respect. Time and again, Parliament has asked the Council and the Commission to lift the barriers in terms of taxation and social security for this group, but so far to little or no avail. It is therefore high time that legislation was drafted in this field. But there is a time and place for everything. The place is this Parliament, but the time, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, is not now. It would be short-sighted to try to improve the position of frontier workers or third-country nationals in the present technical amendment without any chance of success. Not only will this slow down the completion of this resolution, it will also slow down the much-wished-for, wholesale reviews. Let us not pursue a defeatist strategy, but rather focus our efforts on actual improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union must indeed guarantee equal treatment for third-country nationals legally resident within a Member State territory, according to the Tampere Conclusions. It must also, however, grant the same rights to the people who, driven by the increasingly restrictive policy on identity papers, visas and asylum rights, are forced to work in unacceptable conditions, without social protection. At this time when 700 “immigrants in an irregular situation” in Spain are on hunger strike, we need a policy to regularise their situation throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes reference to freedom of movement, but establishing genuine freedom of movement would entail putting an end to the requirement to declare entry into European territory and doing away with the Schengen Information System and the Eurodac system. Finally, truly fair treatment would entail equal access to public sector jobs, and equal wages and social rights, as well as to European citizenship based on residence and not on nationality, with, consequently, the right to vote and the eligibility of immigrants that are third-country nationals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Crowley (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, I come to this debate today with a lot of reservations because of some of the comments made by other speakers in a previous debate. In particular when we speak about the free movement of workers, as was pointed out in the two previous debates on Lisbon and on the Lipietz report, the free movement of workers is not just about internal barriers. It is not just about lack of social security protection. It is also about lack of recognition and about hindrances at national level whereby the internal market is not completed. It is about lack of recognition of qualifications. It is about lack of opportunity for training and also a lack of opportunity for knowledge of what opportunities and what rights are available to people.</p>
<p class="contents">So when we speak about the free movement of workers and when we speak about updating regulations we should be clearer in our focus on two points, namely that, firstly, in Nice the governments decided that this should be done by unanimous voting, not by qualified majority voting, and secondly that there should be no discrimination – either positive or negative – against any worker who is legally resident within the Member States of the European Union. My Group will therefore be supporting the resolution from the PPE-DE Group.</p>

As for the rapporteur, I would like to say that perhaps it would have been better for her to occupy a seat in the Council section rather than our section as far as the defence of Parliament’s interests is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the free movement of persons is still very badly regulated in Europe. The brochure seems to be painting a rosy picture, but the reality is very different indeed. People who make use of the free movement of persons are brought down to earth with a shock. Just ask journalists in Brussels, for example. They are now being covered by Belgian social security, but lose all their rights elsewhere. They are left with the choice of paying twice or else leaving, unless the Belgian government shows mercy. Journalists are, of course, a group of people who can fend for themselves to some extent; others fare much worse.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to cite the example of a Swedish lady who lives in the Netherlands, is insured in the Netherlands, returns to Sweden but cannot benefit from the health care system there because the Netherlands refuses to include the so-called private patients in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Examples of this are legion. People who experience this kind of treatment end up in a Kafkaesque situation. Who are the architects of this system? They are in the Council and are keen to keep things as they are. This is also evident from the replies. The question now arises as to whether we want to change this or not?</p>
<p class="contents">We have had precious little opportunity to do anything so far, for the only right Parliament has had has been advisory. The only thing we could do if extremely bad changes were announced was to settle for a recommendation which prevented discussion in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have another right: that of codecision. That is why our group is of the opinion that we should use this right at long last to force a dialogue with the Council. That is exactly what the rapporteur has tried to prevent with all his might, with all possible means, and backed by the UK representatives. I believe that that is not right. This is today’s topic of discussion. That is why we are in conflict, and not so much in terms of the objectives. There are naturally always differences between the way in which the one amendment would have been worded compared to the other, but they boil down to the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely odd that if we discuss a legislative matter, we at the same time want to express our true interests in the form of a resolution. If we were to adopt this approach in other codecision matters, we would not make much progress. This morning, we managed to conclude quite a few codecision matters successfully, and I do not believe that there is a resolution in these, the exact meaning of which would need to be reiterated.</p>
<p class="contents">That proves just how odd this procedure is here today. That also proves that we are on the wrong track. Someone might say that perhaps this is the last time. I do hope so. I hope that this will prove to be the case in a year’s time. If that is so, Council, you will really need to watch your step, because you will be unable to continue in the same vein. You will really need to look after those ordinary people who are continuously at the receiving end of your stipulations. Then, there will be no need to give less consideration to the interests of the bureaucracies which so far, the parties to the Left have valued more than the interests of the electorate and the people they represent.</p>

<p class="contents">We have cooperated for years in order to break the deadlock in the issue of the free movement of persons and hence of frontier workers. It is utterly disgraceful that the European Commission’s proposal on coordination and extension is, after so many years, still on the Council’s table, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. To tell you the truth, Mr Danielsson, I had hoped from the bottom of my heart that you, on behalf of the Swedish Presidency, would have shown the greatest commitment to ultimately making decisions, and to at least producing a timeframe indicating when a decision would be taken on this important regulation. I happen to know that the Belgian Presidency is very much prepared to reach political agreement on the content of this dossier and on the timing. Mr Danielsson, I believe we need this, but we cannot do this, of course, without Sweden’s strong commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is also of the opinion that pressure should be stepped up. But our group does not believe that the annual technical amendment, Mr Pronk, is the right way to achieve this. It does not move the issue on frontier workers along one inch, not even if we call on Parliament’s codecision. You are all too aware of this. Quite the reverse in fact. A number of vital adjustments which are equally important, such as the situation of the Belgian frontier workers who should be able to enjoy supplementary French pensions, Mr Pronk, are under threat in this dossier. The best approach is to continue to form a united front in these issues and not to use this directive to pull cheap party-political stunts at the expense of frontier workers. This is not why we pursue this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the case, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the Belgian Presidency and the Swedish Presidency should facilitate a speedy breakthrough in this issue. In fact, it should be possible for the final discussions in the Council to coincide with the prospect of a conference on frontier work, which the European Commission has promised us. I hope that this will at least win over the hesitant Member States and that we will have clarity in this matter by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the best line of attack is not a divided one, for this is not the impression we want to convey to the Council. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, something which worries me a great deal is the fact that the Council apparently does not intend to extend the scope of the regulation on social security to include third-country nationals. At least, that is what I could gather from the whole dispute regarding the legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell you in all honesty – and I echo Mr Rocard’s view on this – that this is diametrically opposed to the conclusions reached in Tampere, where it was decided that third-country nationals should be given equal treatment, and it is obvious that this Parliament will not accept this unacceptable discrimination. But if I can ask you something: I would very much like to know how Sweden, not only as the country holding the presidency, but also as a Member State of this European Union, intends to break the deadlock in this issue and how you stand on the extension to include third-country nationals.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jensen (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I also wish to emphasise that people’s opportunity to move freely to another EU country and work across frontiers is one of the major advances in European cooperation, and I believe we can all appreciate that it is only right and proper for people who obtain work in another EU country to be able to retain their social security rights. Our framework – Regulation No 1408/71 – whereby countries’ reciprocal agreements ensure that people also have these rights in practice has become more and more complex throughout the years and, what with this and general bureaucracy, it is often no simple matter at all to move from country to country. That is something we must change, and I therefore think it is right to call for more progress in the work on simplifying the regulation, as proposed by the Commission at the end of 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises as to whether, in addition to simplifying and improving the regulation for EU citizens, we can also ensure that it will be possible for third-country nationals engaged in active employment and resident in EU countries to be covered by the regulation. Several countries, including Denmark, have opposed the Commission’s proposal by referring to the legal basis, Article 42, which of course only covers EU citizens. At the Nice Summit, Denmark fought hard against changing Article 42 and against majority voting in connection with Article 42. I understand that work has been done on possibly seeking another legal basis, for example in terms of legal cooperation. I would urge that it not all be allowed to collapse in legal wranglings and problems concerning the legal basis, for Danish business too will have an interest in a solution’s being found to this problem so that, for example, foreign experts legally resident in Denmark can be posted to another EU country for a period and retain their social security rights and so that we can have experts over to Denmark from other EU countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Big business and the European Union, in their full frontal attack on everything the working classes have struggled and fought for, have now set their sights on social security. They are using groundless arguments, such as longer life expectancy and the allegedly excessive cost of labour, in order to introduce measures such as increasing the retirement age, reducing employers' contributions and replacing insurance funds by private, profit-making companies. This, together with the continuing privatisation of the health system, means yet another burden on the workers, a lower standard of living and huge profits for the monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">The working classes in Greece have already mobilised in the face of this attack. They are ousting the trade union leaders who have been bought off and who are being dragged into so-called social dialogue with so-called social partners, and they are organising their resistance and counter-attack. Similar action is being taken in other countries. The Communist Party of Greece hereby declares from this tribune that it will do everything it can to support this movement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council fully understands the frustration apparent in many of the speeches in this debate. I can understand why you think that the work on Regulation 1408 which has taken place since the Finnish Presidency in 1999 has seemed extremely long drawn out. I would nonetheless repeat what I said in my introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">This is technically a complicated issue and it has been necessary to take the time to test the Council’s reactions and to provide the Council and the Commission with the opportunity to consider, reflect and create a foundation for future negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we Swedes have high hopes that, in the next six months, the Swedish Presidency will be able to complete this technical work. If we succeed, and we are hopeful that we will, this will allow the forthcoming Belgian Presidency to move on to a strategic discussion on the proposal to simplify and modernise Regulation No 1408. Both the Swedish Presidency and the forthcoming Belgian Presidency want to break the vicious circle in which the Council has found itself on this issue. We believe this is extremely important. We hope to be able to agree on a continued timetable for the work. The Council and the Commission may need a mandate in which the working method and approach are clearly stated – whether the proposal is to be divided up, whether certain sections are to be omitted entirely, whether we are to try to simplify the regulation further and if so, how, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I am hopeful that we will not need to repeat this debate many more times and that the Council will be able to return with better news than I can provide in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally say the following in answer to Mrs van Lancker’s question on what the Swedish Presidency intends or would like to do to tackle the problems of discrimination. In this I will remove my Council hat and put on my national hat. In brief, as we see it, the only way to tackle these problems in the long term is to agree on qualified majority voting on Article 42. We did not succeed in Nice, but we do not intend to give up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Rocard for his support for the Commission proposal to extend Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to third-country nationals. The Commission also thanks him for his support for Articles 42 and 308 of the Treaty as suitable legal bases for this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">An extension of this nature, in my opinion, is fully consistent with Community policy, particularly if you take into account the conclusions of the Tampere European Council on the situation of third-country nationals who reside legally in the Member States. The Commission therefore regrets the fact that the Council has not yet been able to support this and other Commission proposals to amend the Regulation and, in particular, the global proposal to simplify and modernise it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted at what we have just heard Minister Danielsson say in this respect, and we hope his wishes come true over the next few months. The Commission insists that the Council should intensify the debates on the proposals mentioned and is grateful for Parliament’s support on this matter. This leads me to Mrs Lambert’s report; I offer her my most sincere thanks for her highly constructive contribution to the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is a technical proposal, aiming as you well know at filling gaps in legislation due to changes in national social security laws. Community coordination of national social security systems is a means to foster the free movement of workers, and in order to guarantee that this coordination works properly the amendments to national legislation also require the amendment of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71; this is basically what it is about.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals made by Mrs Lambert, whom we thank for her support, are very useful since they clarify the Commission’s original proposal and make it more specific. I can agree fully with the proposals contained in Amendments Nos 1 to 7 in the report. I also agree with the general idea that underlies the two additional amendments that have been tabled in the House, Nos 9 and 10. Their aim is to extend the right to sickness benefit to frontier workers, and if I have understood correctly, to expand the Regulation to cover early retirement benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact the Commission included the same provisions in its 1998 proposal for the simplification and modernisation of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71. The amendments that concern us now, however, propose a substantial change to the Regulation and clearly go beyond the technical nature of the update proposed by the Commission, and in my opinion the debate on the technical update should not be confused with a debate on the substantial amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the Commission cannot accept the other additional amendments on supplementary pensions. With regard to Amendment No 8, I should like simply to underline the fact that the Commission has agreed to submit a proposal this year on its transferability.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, therefore, we can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 7, but we cannot accept Amendments Nos 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13.</p>
<p class="contents">May I thank you all, and especially Mrs Lambert, for your general support for the Commission’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
