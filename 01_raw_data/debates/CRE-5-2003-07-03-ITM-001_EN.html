Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Duisenberg, I have been reading your biography in recent weeks and have found it very enjoyable and interesting. The book begins with a beautifully written preface describing the tough negotiations that preceded your appointment as the first President of the Central Bank. They were difficult negotiations that were to lay the foundations of a stringent policy aimed at stabilising the euro. If one thing became clear, however, it was that you set your very own course for the European Central Bank, in which political views did not play a role. It is an ironic twist of fate, then, that the very country that found it hard to accept your nomination for longer than four years, asked a few months ago whether you would like to stay on a little longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duisenberg, your last annual report has come out in a period in which the growth of the European economy has stagnated. The last quarter saw zero growth. Some Member States are thus officially in recession, and that means that the economy has contracted for the second consecutive quarter. This puts the European Union in a worrying situation. The measures taken by the Union and the Member States have thus proved unable to turn the economic tide in the short term, and it is in this very period that we are discussing the fifth annual report of the European Central Bank. It is an annual report about a very eventful year; a year in which citizens had their first chance to show their confidence in the euro; and a year which was preceded by higher expectations as regards economic recovery following the September 11 attacks. Many of those expectations were not realised. New threats slowed down the pace of recovery, and the euro is yet to inspire great confidence in citizens. The fact that 300 million inhabitants of the euro zone are making full use of the new currency does not prove anything except that they have no real alternative: they have to use it, and no further political conclusions can be drawn from this.</p>
<p class="contents">In a climate of uncertainty such as this, it is not surprising that the ECB has its work cut out if it is to fulfil the objective of stability. It is not only the responsibility of the ECB, however, but also of the Member States; after all, it is their budgetary policy that lays the foundations for a stable euro. I should like to devote attention to a few further points in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is important that we make our position known succinctly in the form of a resolution. Now is not the time to reveal all of our political desires for change. The most important thing, in this economically less prosperous time, is that Parliament make clear that it supports a policy that has stability as its aim. Stability of the currency, and hopefully a return to economic growth in the short term, are necessary in order to restore the confidence of manufacturers and consumers and revive the economy. The number of new political desires contained in the resolution is therefore limited.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it would be ill-advised to start tampering with the ECB's objectives already. The resolution emphasises – incidentally following on from earlier resolutions – that price stability is, and must remain, the chief objective of the ECB. New objectives, such as the promotion of economic growth and other tasks, are subordinate to this. An important argument for this relates to the short history of the Bank. To date, the Bank has not been confronted with a Europe-wide recession; it has, however, met with repeated criticism of its policy. For example, in times of economic prosperity, there was a great deal of criticism when the exchange rate of the euro depreciated, and also now, when it is rising – even though the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar is not an aim in itself. What is important is monetary stability within the euro zone itself, and this is the ECB's responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, a real acid test is yet to come. The Bank has yet to prove its ability to fulfil the objective of price stability in times of recession, too, using the existing instruments. In addition to this, inflation has been relatively high up to now, and real wages are increasing sharply despite the increase in unemployment, which indicates continuing structural rigidities in the labour markets. I should like to emphasise that it is important for precisely that price stability – to which consumer confidence is inextricably linked – that the ECB be allowed to continue to do its work independently of politics. Parliament therefore bears some of the responsibility for creating the political preconditions for this by means of a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Duisenberg, on the back cover of your biography there is a photograph of you evidently enjoying your hobby, fishing. I wish you a good catch, and I also wish you good health and enjoyment of the finer things in life in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is pleased to see Parliament undertaking this activity, which contributes to our joint efforts to improve the framework of macroeconomic policy in the Union and, especially, in the Eurozone. The report clearly pursues the approach adopted in previous years and contains numerous aspects with which the Commission fully agrees. There is no doubt that the euro has been an enormous success and we must all thank the European Central Bank for the hard work it has carried out to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also considers that the Central Bank has done an excellent job in recent years with regard to its basic task, which is to ensure price stability, and we also share the concerns at the inadequate structural reforms and at the fiscal consolidation that is taking place in Europe. Nevertheless, my position is rather more circumspect on some points. Firstly, with regard to the Central Bank’s mandate, the Treaty makes this mandate quite clear: to maintain price stability. It is true that the Bank is also asked to support the general policies of the Community, but this must be done without undermining the aim of stability. Mr Blokland’s report appears to suggest a rather different interpretation of the mandate, and this aspect was highlighted by the Commission last month, when the report was debated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report calls for the Central Bank to take action in other areas for which we do not believe it has a mandate. It calls on the Bank, for example, to back the denomination of energy supplies and commodities in euros. On this point, the Commission’s position is the same as the Bank’s in that it should be neutral with regard to the international use of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Blokland’s report assesses the European Central Bank’s management of its budget. From the formal point of view and without having access to the latest audit report covering 2001, this assessment might, in our opinion, be somewhat premature. In any event, I wish to thank him for his comments and say that I am particularly pleased to be here in Parliament, particularly on such a special day, with Mr Duisenberg present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mr Blokland for the kind words with which he introduced the resolution which is before you today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed a pleasure today <span class="bold"></span> despite the fact that it is in all likelihood the last time that I shall be here <span class="bold"></span> to introduce the ECB's Annual Report for 2002, a year that was marked <span class="bold"></span> despite all the incidents you may have found overwhelming in your minds <span class="bold"></span> by significant progress on our path towards a more integrated Europe. In particular, 2002 saw the successful introduction of the euro in its tangible form, as euro banknotes and coins have been swiftly accepted and embraced by the citizens of the euro area. Moreover, the Heads of State or Government, at their summit meeting in December last year, took the historic decision to invite ten countries to join the European Union as of 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the environment in which monetary policy was conducted in 2002 was one of considerable uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the slowdown in economic activity in 2001, a moderate recovery of real GDP growth in the euro area was recorded at the beginning of 2002. However, as the year progressed, the recovery lost momentum, affected by renewed turbulence in financial markets and geopolitical tensions, which had consequences for oil prices and confidence. Overall, annual real GDP growth in the euro area is estimated to have been only 0.8% in 2002, compared with 1.4% in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the subdued pace of real economic growth, inflation remained at 2.3% on average in 2002, unchanged from 2001, and slightly above the European Central Bank's definition of price stability. This was partly due to a number of temporary or one-off factors, including higher oil prices, indirect tax increases and adverse weather conditions. On top of this, there is no denying that there were some effects from the cash changeover. While the overall impact of the cash changeover on inflation was small, its perceived impact was much greater than its actual impact, probably due to comparatively strong price increases in some specific sectors. Of greater concern for the medium-term outlook for price stability was the fact that nominal wage growth remained relatively strong despite the weakening of economic activity and a rise in unemployment, while productivity growth remained low. This development points to persistent structural rigidities in the labour markets of the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">Monetary growth was strong in 2002. While this development was partly the result of high volatility in financial markets, which heightened investors' preference for short-term liquid and less risky financial assets, it also reflected the relatively low interest rates in the euro area in 2002. Overall, however, the excess liquidity was not seen to indicate risks to price stability in an environment of subdued economic activity and moderate credit growth.</p>
<p class="contents">While some factors pointed to possible upward inflationary pressures at the beginning of the year, later in the year the worsening outlook for economic activity and the sizeable and protracted appreciation of the euro increasingly pointed towards lower inflationary pressures over the medium term. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points in December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">This move was followed in March 2003 by a reduction of 25 basis points and by a further 50 basis point reduction last month, in June 2003. These rate cuts provided some counterweight to the various factors having an adverse effect on economic activity and thereby improved the prospects for price stability over the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">With these decisions, the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations reached 2% in June 2003. Interest rates in the euro area are now at record low levels by historical standards, both in nominal and real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the current outlook for price stability, Eurostat's flash estimate of annual inflation in the euro area was 2% for June 2003. The appreciation of the euro, which has brought exchange rates to levels close to long-term averages and more in line with economic fundamentals, should contribute to keeping inflationary pressures low. In addition, in a context of moderate economic recovery, wage growth is expected to remain compatible with the maintenance of price stability. The strong monetary growth also should not, for the time being, adversely affect the outlook for price stability. While the outlook for price stability has remained broadly unchanged since our last decision on 5 June 2003, the Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors which are relevant to its assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the outlook for price stability is favourable, having allowed interest rates to fall to historically low levels, monetary policy cannot by itself generate lasting and sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. Other policy-makers also have to take up their responsibilities. Part of the weakness in economic growth in the euro area can be linked to a lack of ambition in the areas of both fiscal and structural reforms to further improve the conditions for investment and employment. I probably cannot emphasise sufficiently the need to speed up the pace of structural reforms in the labour and product markets, given their positive impact on the euro area's ability to better withstand external shocks, as well as to increase its growth potential. Fiscal policies should also strive to establish a well-designed consolidation strategy in those countries struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances. A medium-term, stability-oriented approach for economic policies would eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently overshadowing long-term planning and perspectives, which would also have positive effects over the shorter term. In fact, at present, the situation of subdued economic growth and the stronger external value of the euro make the structural reforms even more necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to some other issues raised in the draft resolution on the ECB's Annual Report. I have noted <span class="bold"></span> and I welcome <span class="bold"></span> that in several important aspects the views expressed in the draft resolution are very similar to those held by the ECB, for instance as regards the need for Member States to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and the importance of honouring their commitments under the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, in particular, again, with respect to structural reforms. I also appreciate the fact that your draft resolution welcomes the clarifications of the ECB's monetary policy strategy which we made public in May of this year. These clarifications, while reflecting the overall successful experience with the ECB's monetary policy strategy since its inception, will further foster understanding of the monetary policy of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">While the European Parliament and the ECB hold similar views on many important issues, some differences in views remain, such as regarding the draft resolution's suggestion that the ECB should publish the summary minutes and the balance of votes of Governing Council meetings. For a number of reasons, which I have pointed out on previous occasions before Parliament, we believe that the tools chosen by the ECB to communicate and explain its decisions ensure transparency, are more readily available and better reflect the institutional environment in which the ECB operates. You will also not be surprised that I cannot share the view that the ECB's decision-making process might have been delayed by the fact that most Governing Council decisions have so far been taken by consensus. Indeed, the Governing Council has taken its decisions in a timely manner, responding appropriately to changing economic conditions whenever required.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution also refers to the Beige Book of the Federal Reserve System as being a benchmark for country-by-country reviews to be conducted by the Eurosystem. Let me point out that the national central banks within the Eurosystem regularly monitor and analyse macroeconomic, fiscal as well as structural developments in their respective countries, publishing their findings in their monthly, quarterly or annual reports. These analyses clearly enhance our understanding of euro area developments. However, given its euro area focus, it is natural for the European Central Bank to pay greater attention to the euro area perspective in its explanations of the single monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, we are currently experiencing truly historic developments. The dream of a united Europe stretching beyond former post-war rifts is about to become reality. Although major challenges lie ahead, as many of the acceding countries are still developing into fully-fledged market economies, I believe that the signing of the Accession Treaty at the Athens summit in April testified to our joint belief in an integrated Europe. The clear endorsement of the Treaty in the national referenda that have already taken place in a number of acceding countries provides evidence of this commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that an enlarged European Union will require a number of adaptations in the working procedures and the internal functioning of European institutions and bodies, including a reform of the voting modalities of the Governing Council of the ECB. I am well aware of the views that the European Parliament has expressed in this regard, but let me again point out that the Nice Treaty set clear conditions and limits within which our reform proposal had to be formulated. While the adopted changes in the voting modalities are, admittedly, complex, the tried-and-tested principles of the Eurosystem constitution, in particular the <span class="italic">ad personam</span> participation of governors and the 'one member, one vote' principle for the members exercising a voting right, have been kept fully intact. This will ensure that, also in a significantly enlarged euro area in the future, the Governing Council will maintain its capacity for timely and efficient decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Upon accession, the new Member States will join Economic and Monetary Union with the status of 'countries with a derogation', and their central banks will immediately become part of the European System of Central Banks. At a later stage, these central banks will become part of the Eurosystem, once their respective countries have fulfilled the convergence criteria for adopting the euro. A key priority of the European Central Bank is to have in place the necessary technical and institutional infrastructure to ensure an orderly enlargement of the European System of Central Banks and, later on, of the Eurosystem. An interesting foretaste of the new, larger ESCB was provided by the General Council meeting last week where, for the first time, the governors of the acceding countries' central banks participated as observers in a meeting of the General Council of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">With this look towards the future, I should like to conclude my statement. This, indeed, will be the last time that I have the opportunity to present to you the Annual Report of the European Central Bank, which I have had the honour and the privilege to preside over for the last five years. Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and its chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath, for the cooperation and cordial relations that we have maintained.</p>

I will not wish you good luck in your fishing, Mr Duisenberg, because, as an Italian from the south of Italy, I am afraid that it might bring you bad luck.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland, whose report focuses on the responsibilities of the European Central Bank in Europe and the responsibilities that it will have to take on with a view to the imminent entry of the ten new countries into the Union. According to the terms of the Treaties, the primary goal of the European Central Bank is to define monetary policy in Europe and to ensure price stability through monetary policy. Personally, I am convinced that, irrespective of this principal responsibility, the European Central Bank must play a more effective role in the economy, using moral suasion methods, not least, which have yielded surprisingly successful results in the field of bank supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled an amendment, which was not accepted in committee, which sought to provide a more detailed, comprehensive definition of the Pact. It would have read as follows: a uniform interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact must be achieved in order to avoid undermining the credibility of the euro area and thus the effectiveness of its monetary policy; considers that the European Central Bank must confirm to the Commission that the Pact is being implemented with sufficient flexibility as to promote growth. Indeed, the Pact was created not just with a view to achieving stability but also in order to boost growth to acceptable levels. Growth as a key objective of the Pact can also be achieved through investment in large-scale work and financial undertakings in the field of research, outside public spending. Of course, this option must not become an excuse for abandoning the rigour of public finances and must be supported by a totally sustainable fiscal policy, as implemented so successfully in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The recently approved draft Constitution includes provisions governing the European monetary institutions, or rather, the role of the ECB and the national central banks and their sensitive relationship. Over this period, some national central banks have feared radical resizing with subsequent centralisation of power in Frankfurt. They did not want the European Central Bank to become a fully-fledged institution on the grounds that this would jeopardise the independence of the monetary institution, but I am sure this was just an excuse. This deadlock between the European Central Bank and the national central banks has caused confusion, and it is only in Article 29(3) that we have a comprehensive definition: the European Central Bank shall have legal personality. Looking at the other decisions made in this field, it has to be said that, in Europe and Parliament, as elsewhere, the compromise approach has taken root which often, far from bringing about convergence of differing positions, generates, in many cases, uncertainty and confusion regarding the matter in question. As a result of these compromises, a complicated method of voting has been decided on for the members of the Bank’s Governing Council, the printing of banknotes has been split willy-nilly between the different monetary institutions, and, above all, a decentralised system has been preserved which will become overcomplicated and ineffective with eastward enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, over and above the Convention’s decisions, we need to ask ourselves whether, in order to take into due account the guiding role of the European Central Bank and the interests of the individual national central banks, we should not be taking the path of dividing up the responsibilities between centre and periphery, with consequent specialisation of the national central banks, which would have to supervise minor financial institutions too. I hope that many of these points will be clarified at the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Against this background it is therefore especially pleasing to note that no one disputes the successes achieved in establishing the issuing bank, introducing the notes and coins, and also in combating inflation. I would also like to thank you very sincerely for your cooperation and for the contribution you have made. The fact that 75% of Europe's citizens are now in favour of the euro must certainly be due in part to your work and your actions. We will of course do everything we can to win over the remaining 25%, and we hope that the three Member States still outside the euro area will soon be part of European monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Although interest rate levels are at an historically low level in Europe, I find myself wondering, when I consider the European Central Bank's monetary policy, about the appropriateness of those rates, given our failure to achieve our growth potential and the price stability guaranteed for the foreseeable future. That is why I ask myself if our monetary policy strategy is the optimum one. The bank itself has of course investigated to what extent it can be satisfied with its own monetary policy strategy, and I do indeed see that as being very helpful. However, we as politicians also need to consider at all times whether this monetary policy strategy is optimal not only in terms of monetary policy, but also as regards those aspects of macroeconomic policy that relate to the Lisbon objectives – growth, employment and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that does not make your job particularly easy, because there is also room for improvement in the coordination of economic, employment and finance policies. Nevertheless, I wonder what scope there is for making a further contribution. The definition of price stability now agreed upon, with a medium-term inflation rate target of under 2%, if only just, will help here. But I still believe that our bank of issue has a more rigid definition of price stability than other internationally important central banks. That is why we need constantly to reflect upon whether a certain change of course would not be appropriate. I also believe that it is important for us consistently to consider inflation, deflation and how they are defined, especially in view of the risk of deflation. Even during times of strong economic growth a symmetrical target of 2% with a range of plus or minus 1% should certainly be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB must not underestimate the importance of a strategy for low growth and increased employment in the euro area. Although this is, of course the secondary rather than the primary objective, we still do not as yet have a clear definition. It is apparent in the current economic situation that incentives for growth are urgently needed and I wish to specifically welcome new investment initiatives and also the support of the European Investment Bank. I view this initiative very much in the context of structural and fiscal reforms, but such reforms alone will not enable us to achieve the Lisbon objectives. That is why I believe this to be so important.</p>
<p class="contents">You will not be surprised if I refer once again to transparency of monetary policy, because this House has made its views on this very clear over the years. I still cannot see how it would jeopardise the effectiveness of the bank if summary minutes were to be published. Nor do I see how it would put the ECB or its independence at risk if the result of weighted votes were to be published without naming names. To my way of thinking, it would result in greater clarity, more information and it would avoid false reporting. I have in mind your last press conference and the way it was reported in the British press, which led to much speculation and aggravation on the markets. We could do something to change that. Greater transparency prevents inaccurate assessments, which in turn lead to bad investments – something we all wish to avoid. That is why I think it is important to do still more in this area. There is also scope for gaining greater public acceptance for the euro, for example by abolishing the 500-euro note or by printing a 1-euro note. After all, there is a 1-dollar note!</p>

I also wish to make a point of thanking its president, Mr Duisenberg, personally.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of euro notes and coins must be viewed as very successful. There were major logistical problems and plenty of opportunities to make mistakes, but the euro has become the second world currency in a very short period. On a recent visit of mine to Japan, a significant anxiety could be sensed faced with the strength of the euro and the economic advantages with which the euro provides the eurozone countries and the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, Mr Duisenberg, we shall be having a referendum in my country this autumn. It is no exaggeration to say that the name of the ECB is on everyone’s lips. In many respects, the Bank and the work you have carried out are commended but, in one area, the ECB is criticised in a way that I must admit is justified. It is a question of transparency and public scrutiny. Now, during the remainder of your time at the ECB, you should be able to make further efforts in this area. You have accommodated Parliament before and you can do so again. You are aware of our wishes and mentioned them before: open publication of the minutes of ECB Council meetings and annual publication of economic prognoses from individual countries, regions and border regions in the manner of what is termed the Beige Book in the United States. We must also obtain renewed discussion of the new voting rules. The principle must be clear: one country, one vote.</p>
<p class="contents">For myself, engaged, as I am, in an active struggle to persuade the Swedes to vote in favour of the euro, it is precisely the issue of the ECB’s lack of transparency that is a problem. If today, Mr Duisenberg, you could provide us with some encouraging news, it could cause more and more Swedes to accept the euro. Transparency and public scrutiny are always good for democracy. If the Swedish National Bank in Stockholm successfully manages to publish its minutes and votes, I am convinced that the ECB in Frankfurt should also proceed similarly.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by thanking you and wishing you good fishing. Mr Duisenberg, in the future you can put up a sign saying ‘Gone fishing’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe the Bank has been distinguished not so much by the successful operation of introducing the euro as by the line he established on monetary policy. Over the past few years, he has played a courageous, effective part in safeguarding the independence of monetary policy as a whole as well as that of the Central Bank against repeated attempts on the part of governments and many sections of public opinion to bend monetary policy to the short-term needs of a policy which has been unable to create the necessary conditions for success and economic growth in Europe. This morning, President Duisenberg said: ‘I probably cannot emphasise sufficiently the need to speed up the pace of structural reforms’. I hope that, despite the fact that they will be taking over in a climate and a situation in which we would prefer the procedures to be clearer and more transparent, his successor too will be able to focus consistently on the need for structural reform, on the need to safeguard the Stability Pact: this is the way to protect the future generations of Europeans, citizens and taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, President Duisenberg, best wishes for your birthday in a few days’ time. For the sake of all of us in Parliament, all of us European citizens, I hope that President Duisenberg’s successor will be able to do as good a job as he has. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add that budget deficits in Europe are another great weakness. Worse still, it is precisely the biggest countries that have allowed these large deficits to build up. However, in view of this it is also important to emphasise that this does not apply to all the EU Member States. There are in all seven countries in the European Union that either have a balanced budget, or, as in the case of Sweden, Denmark and Finland, have a budget surplus. So it is not acceptable for people constantly to talk about the 15 Member States of the EU as if the same problems applied to all of them. No, they are very different, and I believe that is something we need to spell out very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another factor here: there are countries that are not complying with the 3% criterion in the Stability Pact, especially of course France, Portugal and Germany. When I look at the Stability Pact I can only say that there is perhaps still a little glimmer of hope that it will survive. When you consider the debate going on in Germany, for example, and the fact that fiscal reform is not supposed to be counter-financed by cutting subsidies, then it is evident that Germany will be in breach of the pact for years to come. We do not therefore consider it acceptable for Europe's major economies to fail to implement the necessary structural reforms and thus fail to sort out their budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the European Central Bank and the Commissioner responsible have repeatedly observed that it is precisely these countries that need to carry out structural reform in health services, for example, or in other areas across the whole range of social provision, because there are latent budgetary risks in these areas. This needs to be tackled once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fair to say that Mr Duisenberg put his stamp on the European Central Bank in the early years, when it was on the way to independence. This became apparent during the great many dialogues that we had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and for that, Mr Duisenberg, I would like to thank you personally. It is vital that we should continue to prevent the bank from being politicised, so that the dialogue with Parliament should be about providing information and not justifications. That needs to be emphasised too. I believe that Mr Duisenberg himself has done a great deal to safeguard that independence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point. Europe needs to be extremely flexible – we need flexible arrangements. But we do not want flexibility when it comes to Europe's Stability Pact. That is something I feel very strongly about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the good name that the European Central Bank (ECB)’s mandate under Mr Duisenberg’s Presidency has earned itself is widely acknowledged, and the conviction with which this institution defends its monetary policy is admirable: it considers that policy to be best suited to revitalising the European economy in the short term. The recent changes to the Bank’s monetary strategy are, furthermore, uniformly described as very positive. They are believed to constitute real progress. Indisputably, however, there is no sign of a European economic recovery in the immediate future. Moreover, all the political changes undertaken have been anticipated by the markets and diverted towards uses and balances which can contribute little towards that recovery in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it is predicted that Europe’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth will reach around 0.7% in 2003, and that Europe’s GDP will increase by only 1.6% in 2004. At a stroke, in other words, the ECB is cutting a slice out of its growth predictions equivalent to about 0.9% of GDP in 2003, and 0.8% in 2004. Faced with the false dilemma of ‘growth or stability’, the ECB cannot be content with its primary institutional strategy, price stability, and disregard the weaknesses and contradictions of those of its policies directed at other targets, such as economic growth and employment. Furthermore, national governments, the Commission and the Council cannot, for their part, be satisfied with the low initial level of coordination between their economic policies, or with the merely advisory nature of their general economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the Bank, there are also good reasons for believing that mistakes were made in setting the point of departure for monetary policy levels (an inflation rate of 2%) and that these are not in line with the potential growth of the European economy. The European Central Bank must, therefore, help to find answers and solutions for the following fundamental questions: have the structural reforms carried out in most European economies been sufficient? If not, what additional contribution can monetary and fiscal policies make to the fight against the current situation of economic stagnation? Are the current monetary policy restrictions and the financial constraints imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, which the ECB has supported, compatible with the much-needed reform of the European social model, without calling into question its essence and the distinctive role it plays in the context of European development policy? Is the current appreciation of the euro entirely in step with the foundations of the European economy? Is it, moreover, a proactive aid to economic recovery, or could it, on the contrary, set off a severe deflationary trend? What contribution can the ECB make to overcome the lack of structural reforms necessary in order to attain the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy? Can those objectives be attained within the time limits initially set, given the monetary and fiscal policies which have been developed and the apparent preference of Member States for a minimal level of economic coordination?</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this economic crisis, the level of responsibility taken by the ECB and the active cooperation needed to weather the storm depend on finding a balance between the various options, and on the effectiveness of the solutions found for the problems that I have just described. Whilst acknowledging the positive balance-sheet of the Bank’s activities, which the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, does, the European Parliament should, in line with its duties and competences, draw attention to those problems that do exist and urge all the institutions to overcome them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of my group I would like to say that you were the right man at the right time.</p>
<p class="contents">You have not only shaped the image of the European Central Bank through your appearance; you have also shaped it by the sheer force of your personality. I myself have a three-year-old son and I therefore know how important, how eventful and how demanding the almost daily surprises of the early years of a child's life are. The early years of the European Central Bank's life have been successful ones and you have shouldered your specific responsibilities to our full satisfaction during those first few years. The introduction of the euro and the introduction of the euro notes and coins went smoothly. The ECB has made its mark as an independent European international bank. With a steady hand, you calmly steered our monetary policy on a successful course on the basis of the ECB Statute, building up confidence without being swayed by short-term populism, opportunism and carping. You demonstrated that for you the long haul was more important than short-term image building.</p>
<p class="contents">You also once again sounded a note of warning today when assessing the report. Those who deliver such warnings need credibility and integrity, and you possess both those qualities. You have reminded us again today that despite the successes of the European Central Bank, a great many tasks have been agreed as regards the economic policies of the Member States, and as regards our own work, which have not yet been completed. You also reminded us that structural reforms need to be given high priority in Europe's economic policy, because they underpin stability and growth; that fiscal policy needs to provide a stimulus and must be pursued; and that the Stability and Growth Pact should not be constantly called into question but must flank the ECB Statute by providing the necessary basis for a successful policy of stability and growth. You have once again reminded us that monetary policy can be no substitute for economic and cyclical policy and a corresponding structure, and our priorities must be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Through your work and that of your colleagues in the ECB, you have averted a number of monetary crises – we only have to think of 11 September and of the Asian and Russian crises. You have made an excellent job of preparing Europe and the ECB for enlargement, and we have also moved closer together, although there were often times when a little more communication and transparency would have been welcome. Nevertheless, our relationship has become a more open one. I would like to conclude by saying that as far as I am concerned, I would have been pleased to see you stay for the entire period of office! Many thanks for your work. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my own thanks to those already expressed to Mr Duisenberg, because, with the support of your colleagues and your committees, he has, over the last few years, managed the introduction of the euro in a way that has won growing support from the public. My sincere thanks to you for that, Mr Duisenberg. I have always admired the open and fair way in which you have discussed matters with us here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments we have heard in several speeches today are the same ones that have cropped up again and again in recent years. I have in mind in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, who asserted once again today that monetary policy can solve Europe's problems. She is mistaken. Structural and fiscal reforms alone cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives. In fact, the reverse is true. Even with a good monetary policy, the Lisbon objectives will not be achievable without structural reforms in the EU Member States. Mrs Randzio-Plath, we have two responsible experts in monetary policy with us today; Mr Duisenberg, for whom I have the highest esteem, and Mr Solbes Mira, whom I also regard very highly. Both of them have their roots in social democracy and are not prepared to accept your proposals. I would also like to express my sincere thanks for the consistent and reliable monetary policy that has prevailed over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, however, not the only subject we should mention in relation to the annual report, which is presumably the last one for which Mr Duisenberg will be responsible. The latest annual report – of which you can be proud, Mr Duisenberg – refers to the euro's position on the world stage, which it has earned. The euro has now returned to its previous strength; we have overcome the crises involving the euro. We have not put a foot wrong over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also once again heard that old story about the need for us to have immediate information about the internal decision-making processes of the ECB's committees. I think that is a mistake too. It is precisely this cautious assessment process that has guaranteed the internal stability of the euro in recent years while at the same time enhancing its external stability.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is also my belief that Mr Duisenberg's well-earned retirement and the appointment of his successor should not involve an arbitrary change in the European Central Bank's strategy. You have already changed the inflation range. It was the right decision not just to aim for the lowest possible inflation target, but to bunch it around 2%. We have heard bellyaching from the left of this House that there is a risk of inflation. That is pure nonsense! The totally normal adjustment of prices and of competitiveness in the euro area has led to varying inflation rates. The same applies to growth rates as well, of course. That is the responsibility of the Member States and that is how things should remain in future. That is why I am pleased that you have adopted this strategy in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the European Central Bank that is responsible for growth in Europe – in any case there are not many further options available in terms of monetary policy. It is the leaders of the governments, of the majority parties, in the three major Member States: Germany, France and Italy. Chancellor Schröder, Prime Minister Raffarin and Prime Minister Berlusconi need to carry out structural reforms. That needs to be our starting point, regardless of the basic political direction. In the long run, it is only by consistently adhering to the Stability and Growth Pact that we will be able to keep the euro internally and externally stable.</p>
<p class="contents">On that note, Mr Duisenberg, I would like to thank you for your excellent cooperation, which has been based on trust, and for your successful period of office, and to wish you all the very best for the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duisenberg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">ECB</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, first of all let me thank all the Members that have spoken for their good wishes and in particular for their encouragement to the ECB to strictly adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">One has to realise that the Stability and Growth Pact is a very welcome additional element in forging our monetary policy. However, the ECB is not the guardian of the Stablility and Growth Pact; that is the European Commission. I can assure you, however, that the ECB has been and always will be squarely behind the European Commission in its endeavours to live up to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Andria has referred to the position of the ECB and the ESCB as mentioned in Article 29 of the draft Constitution of the Convention, which will be under discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference as from the middle of October. May I add one remark? In general the ECB welcomes the draft Constitution in so far as its position is concerned. However, we have one overriding wish for change, concerning the fact that in the current Treaty and in the draft Constitution, the term European System of Central Banks is interpreted with some ambiguity. Sometimes it is to be understood that it refers to the total of all the central banks participating in the European System of Central Banks. Sometimes it is understood as comprising only the ECB itself and the participating national central banks. We have pleaded for the inclusion of a reference somewhere to the core concept of Europe's system of central banks, that is, the Eurosystem. It is the ECB that is the hub, the participating national central banks are the spokes; together they form the central banking system of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, when we are asked for an opinion, and we have to be asked for our opinion, urge the Intergovernmental Conference to make a reference somewhere in the text to this concept of the Eurosystem, which is the central bank of the European people, something which up until now has not been mentioned, either in the current Treaty or in the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Various speakers <span class="bold"></span> Mrs Randzio-Plath and also others <span class="bold"></span> have expressed some doubts as to whether the current monetary policy stance is optimal. The last speaker, Mr Langen, even referred to statements made in recent days by some heads of government <span class="bold"></span> Mr Schroeder, Mr Raffarin, and Mr Berlusconi <span class="bold"></span> calling on the ECB to do more to promote growth in the current circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be crystal clear on that. The current monetary policy stance, in the eyes of the Governing Council, with interest rates at 2%, is regarded as being appropriate in the light of the developments we foresee for the medium-term future.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect inflation for the remaining months of this year to hover around this level of 2%, then early next year, mainly due to base effects, to fall significantly below the 2% limit and then, later on next year and in 2005, to climb back somewhat in a direction that will bring it close to 2%. That is our aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this monetary policy stance, which is regarded as appropriate in the light of analysis of the future, in so far as we can make it, one can conclude that monetary policy has played its part in creating the conditions for a resumption of economic growth and growth of employment in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">We have played our part and it is now the case that governments <span class="bold"></span> maybe I sound a little sharp <span class="bold"></span> can no longer hide behind the ECB to try to cover up their failure to enact the structural reforms which are so urgently required for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the definition of price stability too rigid? I do not believe so. We recently clarified our definition and our strategy. We are striving for a rate of inflation of below 2% but also close to 2%. That should be a guarantee to the European people that we are on our guard, not only to fight inflation, but also to fight deflation if it were to emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me answer another question clearly. Mr Santos wondered whether there was a danger that the appreciation of the euro might lead us into a deflationary environment. The answer is that we do not see that. We do not expect deflation, not in Europe and not in individual component parts of the euro area. Deflation is not around the corner. That is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the definition too rigid? Let me speak anecdotally. We define our price stability as a rate of inflation of no more than 2%. Let me remind you and give an example. The Bank of England has inflation targeting, and the Chancellor imposes a target on the Bank of England of 2.5% inflation, 2.5% inflation as measured by the retail price index. Now the Chancellor has announced that probably in September, when he presents his mid-year budget, he will change the definition of the price index into the European one <span class="bold"></span> the harmonised index of consumer price inflation. When he does so, the implication is that the 2.5% in England will translate into less than 2% <span class="bold"></span> probably between 1.75% and 2% <span class="bold"></span> in terms of the harmonised index of consumer prices.</p>
<p class="contents">On publishing the minutes and being more transparent, I truly believe that there is no central bank in the world which is as transparent about its monetary policy decisions and the backgrounds and analyses leading up to decisions as the European Central Bank. About an hour after a decision has been taken, we hold a press conference and give all the necessary background and explanations which led us to take that decision and subsequently, in a question-and-answer session, we answer all the questions relating to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Some say that if the minutes of those meetings were published there would be less confusion. May I refer to the decision taken last week by the Federal Reserve System, which immediately produced a press communiqué giving the decisions and stating how the members of the Federal Open Market Committee had voted. You all know now that has created more confusion than transparency in the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have answered the most pressing questions. I would like to thank the Members once again for their good wishes, both for the past and for my future. I should like to say to Mr Karas, who has a three-year-old son, that I have eight grandchildren of about the same age. They saw me recently on a television programme for children explaining the functioning of the euro and its intricacies. They called me after the television interview and I asked them if they had understood what I said. Their answer was: 'Why? What's so special about the euro? We don't know anything else! What was there to explain?' I regard that as one of the greatest successes of the introduction of the euro, that at least for my grandchildren it is nothing special any more. It is simply their money.</p>
