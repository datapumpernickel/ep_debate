That is because of the way we wish to conduct this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to begin by saying that one thing that is very obvious to me is that we are seeing a much more proactive Turkey in terms of its foreign policy. If we were looking at some of the issues regarding the position of Turkey in the Arab world, there is much we could spend time discussing. I am particularly, of course, talking about the issues in regard to the flotilla dispute with Israel – a situation that is a real source of friction and which spills over into other aspects of foreign policy and relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is both a candidate country and a NATO member. It is, of course, in our interests to try and seek to calm tension and, from my perspective, to bind Turkey into the delivery of our foreign policy objectives. I spent time talking with Foreign Minister Davutoğlu on a whole range of issues, but it will surprise no one in this House that the issue that he and I spoke about when we met bilaterally at the United Nations was the issue that is before us this evening. I, of course, worked closely with the Foreign Minister of Cyprus, who is new to our deliberations on the Foreign Affairs Council, but follows in the footsteps of her predecessor. We are well aware that the current tensions over the drilling issue concern us because they also involve a candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">My services have been working very closely with Štefan Füle, and continue to do so. Because of the nature of this debate, I am now going to hand over to Štefan to continue from this side of the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Vice-President/High Representative and I made it very clear right from the start that threats are not an option when it comes to solving problems between neighbours. Disputes need to be settled by peaceful means. This is a guiding principle in international relations and in the European Union, and Baroness Ashton has made that point a couple of times during this afternoon’s debates.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret and reject any statement or action that runs counter to this approach. Moreover, as the Council has stressed on several occasions, our Member States have the sovereign right to conclude bilateral agreements with third countries in accordance with the European Union <span class="italic">acquis</span> and international law, including the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea. Let me recall that, under international law, the European Union and its Member States only recognise the Republic of Cyprus on that island.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also repeatedly underlined the importance of progress in the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all European Union Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus. I firmly believe that Turkey and the European Union have much more to gain through integration and dialogue than through tensions, especially at a time where the stakes in the region following the Arab Spring are so high. Turkey and the European Union need to support jointly the aspirations of the people on the southern flank of the Mediterranean for democracy, human rights, stability and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is based on a number of core principles and values including good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes, resorting, if necessary, to international arbitration. We are, and remain, committed to this approach, which is the best guarantee for peace and stability. We assure you that both the Vice-President/High Representative Catherine Ashton and I made all these points very clearly in our recent contacts with all our interlocutors.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of July, the United Nations Secretary-General met the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders in Geneva. They decided to enter into an intensive period of negotiations towards a comprehensive settlement. Since then, we have all been looking forward to a crucial phase of settlement talks in the autumn and the resolution of an issue that would be to the benefit of all Cypriot citizens, the European Union, Turkey and the entire region. This phase is ongoing and I understand the leaders are intensively discussing the substance of several core pending issues. This is a chance not to be missed under any circumstances. I therefore urge all parties now to focus all energy, efforts and minds on the comprehensive settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">During this crucial ongoing phase, it is essential that all parties concerned exercise restraint and do their utmost to ensure a positive climate that will facilitate successful completion of the process. Let us give the settlement talks the best chance to succeed. I trust that all European Union institutions, including the European Parliament, will send the same messages and encouragement towards this end to all the parties concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turkey resorts easily to threats when things do not develop in line with its geostrategic ambitions, regardless of whether or not such developments are legal under international law or international practices. This is also confirmed by the escalation in the reaction and threats by Ankara to the exercise of the legal, sovereign right of the Republic of Cyprus to explore its exclusive economic zone in accordance with the Law of the Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the utilisation of serious wealth-producing resources by the Republic of Cyprus will improve energy security in the European Union and support the policy to diversify energy sources. In addition, the prospect of benefits to both Greek and Turkish Cypriots is a strong incentive, rather than a deterrent, to progress with and finding a solution to the Cyprus question and, of course, the Republic of Cyprus should not pay for the illegal occupation of part of its land by suspending the exercise of its rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, Turkey is, I fear, trying to foster controlled tension in the area in order, among other things, to acquire the status of regional force and <span class="italic">locum tenens</span> which it has constantly sought in the Eastern Mediterranean. However, the dividing line between controlled and uncontrolled tension is extraordinarily fine. Turkey is literally playing with fire.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker continued in English)</span> </p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is more a security consumer than a security provider in the Eastern Mediterranean. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EL) </span>Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, the European Union needs to send a clear message of condemnation and rebuttal of the Turkish threats and of solidarity with our partner, the Republic of Cyprus.

We wish to have Turkey as a partner. However, a partner must behave like a partner. Unfortunately, what we are witnessing at present is far from partnership. We were very pleased to hear foreign minister, Mr Davutoğlu, say that Turkey was interested in politics that did not involve conflict with its neighbours. However, when I think of Israel and Cyprus, conflicts between Turkey and its neighbours seem to be growing in number. This is unacceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey must accept that Cyprus is a Member of the European Union and enjoys our full solidarity. When, as is the case at present, Turkey tries to put Cyprus under pressure with its warships, when Turkey makes a foreign policy statement saying ‘We will not talk to Cyprus when it holds the Presidency of the European Union’, then this is unacceptable to us. We are faced with policies that do not just target the Greek population of Cyprus, but also the Turkish population, because they make it increasingly difficult to reach an agreement within Cyprus itself. What we want is for the island, the country and the population to be united. We want both parts of Cyprus to cooperate and insist that negotiations must take place. However, this also requires a willingness on Turkey’s part to act in partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I would like to state that we stand in complete solidarity with our colleagues in Cyprus and with the Cypriot population. Cyprus is doing the right thing. I would urge Turkey to respect the fact that Cyprus is an independent Member of the European Union and has our full solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The mounting tensions with Cyprus are of special concern to this House. The Commission has rightfully urged both sides – the Greek Cypriots as well – to show restraint. Turkey’s role in the region is important and could be a great vehicle for more intensive cooperation between Turkey and the EU. I hope the Commission and High Representative will find active support from Turkey in their efforts to find a negotiated solution to the Middle East conflict, and I hope that they will seek closer cooperation with Turkey to end the ongoing hell that we see in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">However, EU-Turkey relations are, formally, predominantly about domestic affairs and reforms: the Copenhagen criteria. A focus on foreign affairs and Turkey’s important role in the region neither compensates for nor replaces the relevance of making reforms to meet these criteria. Similarly, it seems that Turkey’s economy is doing better than all its neighbours, with truly remarkable figures. Yet economic success cannot replace good governance, respect for civil rights and a functioning rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">A press release I recently received from the Turkish Government aimed to explain that the rule of law is not violated in Turkey, but accepted that there are approximately 70 journalists in prison. Official charges are not always filed and pre-trial detention periods can last years. To make matters worse, indictments that are presented are often supported by something called ‘secret evidence’, which makes a transparent judicial process impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish Government asserted that these journalists are in prison on terrorism charges and that those of us who believe press freedom is under pressure are wrong. This House, the Commission and the External Action Service have assessed the press freedom issue in Turkey with great concern. Would the High Representative and the Commissioner agree that it is time to broaden the scope and assess whether counter-terrorism laws are being abused and whether the rule of law is still functioning in line with the Copenhagen criteria, so that we can move towards the much-needed accession of Turkey to the EU? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So this is the first time since then that we have had an open discussion about a European Union Member State in which there has been a United Nations international peace-keeping mission since 1964 in relation to a conflict with a country engaged in the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">Stating the facts naturally highlights the fairly ludicrous nature of the situation. As far as I am concerned, this debate is not about whether Cyprus is exercising its sovereign right by deciding to drill in its exclusive economic zone. That is beyond doubt. International law clearly says that Cyprus is in the right, but equally we could envisage a situation whereby, under a future agreement, the benefits from that drilling would be shared fairly between the two communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I feel that the timing of the operation is reprehensible because, at the end of the day, this decision is prejudicial to the negotiations due to begin in the coming days under the aegis of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the role of our Parliament – as has already been demonstrated – is not to engage in one-upmanship but rather to make a constructive contribution to achieving overall peace within the framework of an agreement for a federal country made up of two zones and two communities. What is more, the substance of a future agreement is known and almost – I nearly said for the most part – on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that we need to ask ourselves as Europeans is what Member States and the European Union are doing to bring a political agreement into the world and to encourage all the stakeholders to take constructive confidence building measures. However, sometimes I feel that the question of Cyprus is intentionally left to one side, to be used when the need arises in the context of relations between the European Union and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like practical measures to be taken today by the Union and the Member States to support and encourage a rapid resolution to what is essentially a European problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turkey has never accepted this legitimate fact. In 2008, Turkish warships repeatedly harassed the vessels conducting oceanographic research in Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone. In the light of the drilling process, Turkey, at the highest governmental level, has repeatedly threatened Cyprus, demanding that it abandon its lawful rights. The threats are becoming facts. Warships have been dispatched, and a so-called agreement with the occupied part of Cyprus for exploring the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea was ratified by the European Union and is thus part of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> which Turkey, as all European Union candidate countries, is expected to respect and be bound by. Instead, it chooses to ignore it. Turkey is undermining the sovereign rights of an EU Member State and Community law. It is escalating its unilateral action, jeopardising the peace process for the solution of the Cyprus problem and endangering stability in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">My group strongly believes that any further instability in the region would be to the detriment of the people of the region and of the EU itself. The EU must send Turkey a very clear and strong message that its action is violating international and European law and that it has to stop. This behaviour is unacceptable. There is now an even greater need for EU solidarity with Cyprus, and we call upon the UN Council to demonstrate similar solidarity in a very clear manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here we sit, being told that we need to advise restraint on both sides. Why on both sides? The Republic of Cyprus is carrying out explorations of its economic zone in due form and in accordance with international law and Mr Karim, if I have understood correctly, says that they should stop. How can that be? It is their economic zone, why should they not carry out explorations? Why are we putting the offender and the victim on an equal footing? This is unfair treatment of the Republic of Cyprus. As things stand, to say that both sides should demonstrate self-restraint means that all of us here are ignoring international law and are ignoring sovereign and national rights and the contractual obligations which the European Union has towards Cyprus. I consider this unacceptable and we need to take a bold and fair stand in keeping with international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to make is this: Bismarck said that the only stable factor in foreign policy is geography. Baroness Ashton, do you have geographical borders on the scope of EU foreign policy? As we have you to represent the single foreign policy of the EU, should we not know where these geographical borders lie? Geographically, do we know where Europe starts and ends?

I disagree. The conflict is between an EU Member State and a country that has been accepted as a candidate for the EU club. Therefore, the Commission must not be silent.</p>
<p class="contents">The planned exploration is in Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone. This extends to the south of the island and in no way limits exploitation in the northern part or the rights of Turkey. For me, it is crystal clear that these rights follow from the UNCLOS Treaty, where economic zones are described, followed by bilateral agreements. The fact that Turkey did not sign UNCLOS does not mean that it rejects it. In the 1980s, Turkey declared an exclusive economic zone in the Black Sea and reached an agreement with Romania, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union. It used the same median line method then.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge Turkey to refrain from all threats. I also have a question for the government of Cyprus. I would ask it to give an assurance that the move towards the exploration and possible exploitation of natural gas and oil reserves in the exclusive economic zone will not in any way impinge on the possibility of an agreement between the two Cypriot communities on reunification, and that this will be to the benefit of both communities. I think that this should be done – or could be done – for instance, by pledging to earmark reserves, or part of the future revenue, for the benefit of the whole Cypriot community once reunification is achieved, and also by pledging to provide electricity, generated by natural gas, to northern Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Commissioner Füle said, negotiations on reunification have been ongoing – without success, so far – between top-level representatives of the Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots for more than two years now. The negotiations carrying on with the active assistance of UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, and his special adviser, Alexander Downer, are entering the final phase at the moment. There is much at stake. Either it will be possible to find a solution that is satisfactory to both of the parties to this long-running dispute, or, influenced by the changes in the Middle East, there will be a definitive and permanent division of Cyprus, with fatal consequences both for Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots. I would therefore like to make an appeal again from this place to the representatives of both communities, President Christofias and Doctor Eroğlu, to focus on a successful conclusion to the negotiations and not to take any steps that would lead to a further escalation of tension. It is in the interests of both communities to reach a permanent and sensible compromise, so that Cypriots can decide jointly on the fate of Cyprus, including its mineral wealth in offshore waters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Injustice cannot create rights. The fact that Turkey has occupying forces in the northern part of Cyprus does not imply that it has acquired rights to the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Cyprus in what is, moreover, a completely different geographical area, especially when we all know that the Republic of Cyprus has abided by all the provisions of international law to the letter and when we also know that it will take a great deal of time, perhaps several decades, for the benefits from current exploration to trickle down to the citizens of the whole of Cyprus, time which more than suffices to find a solution to the Cyprus problem – which would be useful sooner rather than later – and to share the benefits of this exploration fairly between all the citizens of Cyprus, regardless of their ethnic origin.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in the 21st century. Turkey is making a mistake if it thinks that gunboat diplomacy can be exercised against a Member State of the European Union. To conclude on the subject of negotiations: negotiations on the Cyprus question have lasted for thirty years. If we take the line that the Republic of Cyprus has reduced sovereign rights during the period of negotiation, then it would be as if we were withdrawing sovereign rights from the Republic of Cyprus. It is wrong for us to say so and wrong for us to argue so; the solution must be found elsewhere and the solution is to apply international law logically and judiciously and for us to seek a solution to the Cyprus problem within that framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not about tensions between two countries, but rather threats by Turkey against Cyprus, which have taken shape in the movement of Turkish naval ships. Threats that Turkey makes against a Member State are threats against the whole of the European Union. They unnecessarily increase tension in the region, and Turkey’s behaviour is intolerable when compared with that of the government of the Republic of Cyprus, which is making every possible effort to find a viable, peaceful and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the statement made by the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Demetris Christofias, to the United Nations, in which he stated that any potential oil and gas exploration in the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Cyprus would benefit both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. In addition, one of the conditions set by the European Council in order for Turkey to become a member of the European Union was that it must abide by and sign the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, something that Turkey has not yet done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall make certain points which have not been made by previous speakers. First of all, the crisis does not concern Turkey and Cyprus; it concerns Turkey and the European Union, and the eastern borders of the European Union. We all know that, in a bid to exploit and expand its own exclusive economic zone, Turkey has also contested the right of Greek islands, specifically Kastellorizo and the other islands in that vicinity, to an exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, in its effort to foment trouble, Turkey has given notice of its own exclusive economic zone, because it has not signed the Law of the Sea, which has been signed by the whole of the European Union, and it is claiming no more and no less than about half the Eastern Mediterranean. As regards the area in which exploration is being carried out, it is off Egypt, at the southern point of the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Cyprus. Apart from that, Turkey has linked this specific episode to the talks, to the Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus and to the fact that it does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus. More importantly, the presence of the Turkish navy in the area is, unfortunately, currently being verified by other states; there are reports of US aircraft flying out of Sicily to monitor for the presence of Turkish submarines. Israel is doing the same while, for our part, unfortunately, the facility for the European Union itself to act is very limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, I will close with this: we still have a long way to go before the European Union has a real common foreign policy and common defence policy. We must all help to resolve this incident. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite apart from the dubious wisdom of drilling for hydrocarbons on a planet whose temperature is increasing far too fast and in countries which have huge resources of renewable energies, this is a challenge the European Union cannot ignore.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in this situation partly because we failed to insist on a peace deal prior to Cyprus’s entry to the Union and partly because, since entry, little progress has been made on a solution for the island and the Union has gone cold on Turkey’s adhesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the speech of Cyprus’s new Energy Minister, Praxoula Antoniadou Kyriakou at the Energy Council last week, and I welcome her commitment to the opening of the energy chapter for Turkey, which Cyprus blocked in 2007. But I note, too, that exploratory drilling has begun. Knowing Turkey’s objections and knowing its offer of 24 September for a UN mediator on hydrocarbon resources, aware that drilling will be seen as more than an economic activity, and at a time when UN negotiations are entering a very delicate phase, what Cyprus is doing may be defensible legally but it is bound to be inflammatory politically, and we should not be surprised at Turkey’s reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, of course, we must urge Turkey to show restraint, but we must also give some hope to the Turkish Cypriots that they might have a share in the wealth of an estimated 20 billion barrels of oil.</p>

Ankara is in breach of international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which forms part of the European <span class="italic">acquis</span>. It has not signed, it does not respect, and it is not applying this convention. It is creating tension by sending gunboats into the Eastern Mediterranean and it is using the unrecognised state to illegally endeavour to create an exclusive economic zone. Although it is a candidate country, it does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which is a Member State of the United Nations and of the European Union and which has the sovereign right to explore and exploit its natural resources. Turkey is acting as a terrorist state in the Eastern Mediterranean. I call on the European Parliament, the European Union and, especially, Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle, to stop this policy of sitting on the fence and, more importantly:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, not to open any chapters, especially the energy chapter;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, to warn Turkey that, if it continues its threats, its accession prospects will immediately be suspended;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, I call on Ms Oomen-Ruijten to include in this year’s evaluation report on Turkey that, if these threats continue, its accession prospects will stop.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rouček, do you not think that, when you talk about self-restraint on both sides, you are basically sitting on the fence and putting the offender and the victim on an equal footing? Do you not think that you are blackmailing Cyprus when you say that any breakdown in talks will result in division and permanent partition? Mr Watson, why have you not condemned Turkey for blatantly infringing the Law of the Sea, while Cyprus is respecting and applying it? I want clear answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has every reason to safeguard stability and to prevent any escalation of tension in this rapidly changing region. Unfortunately, Turkey, a candidate country for accession to the European Union, has opted for a slippery slope, by contesting the sovereign rights of Member States enshrined in international law and defiantly threatening to use military violence, deploying its gunboats in international waters and taking openly hostile action.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional balance in the region appears to have been overturned and the path which Mr Erdoğan has chosen, in basically ignoring Europe, is causing a great deal of concern right across the continent of Europe and in the United States. Clearly, anyone who invests in tension for internal consumption and in order to become a regional leader is playing a very dangerous game. Turkey’s words and deeds are putting peace and stability in the area in danger.

It is circumspect and responsible in the standpoints it adopts and the measures it takes. On the other hand, Turkey has now been occupying for a considerable time a large part of the island of Cyprus and thereby part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is really ridiculous that the European Union should permit a discussion tabled by Turkey on restricting the right of the Republic of Cyprus to exploration drilling in its territorial waters. I understand that the Turks would also wish to benefit from the wealth located in the coastal waters of Cyprus and thus also of the European Union. However, international law is clearly on the side of the Republic of Cyprus, so, we need to begin to restrain this expansionist appetite in a calm but determined way.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, to start with, I can assure you of my understanding for your emotion and your concern, although some of the statements have rather crossed the line. Let me assure you that the last time I checked the news, no one had been attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we can clearly say that we all agree that increased tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean are in nobody’s interest. We can also agree that we stand by one of our Member States when its rights are called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a remark here, because there was a question of the extent to which the Commission considered this to be a volatile issue. What is volatile is the disagreement on the delimitation of borders: exclusive economic zone. What is not volatile, and never will be, is an approach based on threats, which violates the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">But we all also acknowledge that the most important issues right now are the Cyprus settlement talks. The United Nations and the Secretary-General, but, in particular, the leaders of the two communities, have invested enormous effort in making them succeed, and it is our responsibility and duty to support these efforts in any way we can.</p>
<p class="contents">A united Cyprus would bring peace, stability and security within the European Union, in our close neighbourhood, and in one of the most troubled regions in the world. It would also have a positive effect on relations between the European Union and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that the European Union and Turkey are in a delicate phase in their relations; the pace of the accession process is disappointing, with no chapter opened since June 2010. The European Union is expecting more and faster reforms in Turkey to address urgent issues under fundamental rights and freedoms. Turkey, too, is frustrated by what it perceives as a lack of commitment from the European Union to negotiations. I believe the fresh tensions around the whole drilling issue partly result from this frustration.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a couple of remarks here in reaction to a very important debate and adding to a number of the statements I made at the beginning and also during the Question Time we had earlier today in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no problem with assertive foreign policy – if that policy is responsible. I have a huge problem with irresponsible policy. Threatening a Member State, talking about the role of the navy, is irresponsible and needs to be condemned. It is being condemned, and it will be condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point: the issue has never been doubts over the rights of one of us. No one has indicated that there could be a problem. The only point was timing. Most leaders made a personal commitment to the Secretary-General of the United Nations that they will not be distracted by anything and that all their efforts will be focused on finding a comprehensive settlement, in such a way that the settlement is found before Cyprus assumes the Presidency of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who made the point that what is really of the utmost importance is to send, at this point in time, the clear message that, as far as the benefits of this hydrocarbon project are concerned, they belong to all citizens of Cyprus, in both communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish I had an answer to the question of what our contingency plan is if the United Nations decides to withdraw. I do not have one, and I am not aware of anyone having a Plan B. This is one more reason why we all need to support the United Nations and the Secretary-General and special representatives. President Barroso recently sent a special envoy who at this point in time, with the talks being intensified, is fully committed to the talks and is available to the special representative Alexander Downer, on a 24/7 basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also address the issue of the statement that Turkey is going to boycott the Cyprus Presidency of the European Council. I was confronted with this statement when I visited Turkey soon after the elections, a couple of hours after the new government had been formed. My immediate reaction was that, instead of sending this strange ultimatum, all our efforts needed to be focused on finding a comprehensive settlement before that time. This is exactly the angle which, I understand, has been used by the Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, speculating on what is going to happen if no settlement is reached on the Cyprus issue. I shall not continue his speculation on what is going to happen. I think we all need to use the time between now and the beginning of next year – not the end of June – to move the settlement talks forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I disagree, with respect, with those who try to say that we have been talking for thirty years. There have been a number of phases and a number of efforts. We do not have anything better than the current plan, with which we are moving forward and making progress. The Secretary-General of the United Nations made this clear during the last meeting with both leaders. There is commitment on the part of these two leaders; there is a kind of road map that they have both committed to. So expectations are high.</p>
<p class="contents">I was talking about frustration; that frustration is unfortunate and largely unnecessary. What we need now is constructive engagement; we do not see any other option. Turkey and the European Union need each other more than ever in addressing jointly the challenges of the day. They are already closely linked by trade, investments, 50 years of association and now, accession negotiations. There are real benefits to working closely together with Turkey in our common neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, however, the European Union accession process with Turkey has proved a powerful instrument to force reforms in this country. Turkey today is a more democratic country than it was ten years ago thanks to the European Union accession perspective. Even though reforms should be accelerated and broadened, they nevertheless continue, as demonstrated over the summer by significant steps such as the return of confiscated property to the non-Muslim religious communities or strengthening of civilian control of the military. And yes, I am aware of the increasingly troubling issue of press freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about the current legislation: particularly the anti-terrorist law, which has an ambiguity which is unfortunately being used to put a huge number of journalists in unnecessary detention.</p>
<p class="contents">But my approach is that we need to open chapters and engage with Turkey, rather than closing chapters. Let me remind this House that, as far as the accession process is concerned, we have only three chapters to open. Three chapters are available to us to open. Their nature and substance makes them rather difficult, and if you looked at the accession process of some other countries, you would see that those chapters which are available for the EU-Turkey relationship are being addressed only at a late stage of the accession process. The truth is that part of these chapters are being frozen on the basis of the Commission recommendation – some of you mentioned the Ankara additional protocol, the Ankara agreement. But there are others which are being blocked unilaterally by Member States, thus limiting the area of engagement. I do not want to speculate whether, if we open the chapter on energy, we will be facing a similar situation to today’s.</p>
<p class="contents">I will address a different issue. If we open Chapter 23, on fundamental rights and the judiciary, it will give us an opportunity to keep abreast of the Turkish reforms in the most important area – the rule of law. It is a pity that this chapter is not available for the accession negotiations. Turkey and the European Union need to develop a renewed positive agenda, building on the achievements of the accession process and our joint interest, and give a new momentum to our relations. This supposes renewed efforts in a number of key areas, including support for political reforms in Turkey, alignment with our <span class="italic">acquis</span>, addressing important trade issues, closer cooperation on visas and migration and a closer dialogue on foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I believe this is the only way forward, and I look forward to discussing these matters further with you in the coming months starting in October, once the Commission has adopted its enlargement package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, Turkey shares some of the responsibility for escalating tensions in the region. In the wake of the deterioration in its relations with Israel, the Turkish Government, committed to a policy of aggression in recent years, decided to oppose the Cypriot Government’s intention to explore for gas reserves off the island by launching its own exploration activities in the eastern Mediterranean. This policy of force threatens the negotiations between the Turkish and Greek communities aimed at reuniting Cyprus. There is also the risk of tearing apart a region already affected by political changes and economic problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European Union has a duty to reject categorically these acts of provocation and show total solidarity with a Member State which is a victim of threats from a third country. We vociferously call on Turkey to refrain from any hostile actions if it wishes to remain a reputable partner. The threat of freezing relations with the EU if Cyprus takes over the EU Presidency next year casts doubt on both the prospect of Turkey joining the EU and the future of bilateral relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As it was not resolved, Turkey takes everything as a pretext for reiterating that it does not acknowledge the Republic of Cyprus’s sovereignty and for supporting the north of the island, which is under Turkish military occupation. At present, tensions have been rekindled in relation to oil and gas drilling in the eastern Mediterranean within the island’s exclusive economic zone. The European Union has limited itself to refusing to come out in favour of either side, calling for moderation and respect for international rules. It has not even had the decency to express solidarity with one of its members, nor even to confirm that, in this matter, Cyprus is clearly well within its rights. It refuses to recognise that for months, Turkey has been declaring that it is willing to resist European constraints on internal reform and to return to a foreign policy that is more in line with its own geostrategic interests. They are entitled to do so. However, the action must be noted and Brussels and Ankara must accept the consequences: quite simply, that it is no longer credible to pursue the accession negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
