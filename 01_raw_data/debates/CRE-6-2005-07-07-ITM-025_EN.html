<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hélène Flautre (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, allow me first of all, because we are resuming this debate in very distressing conditions, to offer my sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the attacks that have taken place in London, the terrible consequences of which we are learning minute by minute.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to our debate, the major importance of which was stated this morning, my group, through Caroline Lucas’s speech, has stressed the extent to which it supports the series of temporary measures that are being proposed. That said, I should like today to highlight certain points that appear to me to be essential. The first concerns two paragraphs in the report that seek to minimise the scope of the REACH Directive, and which we consider to be totally unacceptable. Those two paragraphs actually make a very clear recommendation to limit the scope of application of the directive in order to prevent its having – supposedly – harmful consequences for the textile industry and its competitiveness. I would remind you that the draft REACH Directive, currently being debated in Parliament, proposes to record, assess and monitor the use of chemical substances that could be harmful to our health and our environment.</p>
<p class="contents">These references are therefore completely unacceptable, because we do not believe that the competitiveness of our industry can be increased at the expense of health, the environment and employees’ working conditions. It is all the more unacceptable given that in my region, for instance, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, which is hard hit by the restructuring, we are unfortunately well versed in this type of debate, which advocates curbing environmental demands in order, so they say, to protect jobs. That systematically results in a social and environmental disaster. I am referring, of course, to the very high number of asbestos victims. I am also thinking of the Metaleurop affair, which was the subject of a major debate in this House, and which caused the inhabitants of the region to lose their jobs, their health and their soil, unusable for years.</p>
<p class="contents">This attack against the REACH Directive is therefore entirely misplaced, all the more so since it is expected that its effect on the textile and chemical industry in general will be to foster and drive the capacity for innovation. Our discussion ought to be much more focused on the competitive advantage resulting from the low cost of producing textiles products in China. In fact we should be aware that these low production costs are due to the exploitation of Chinese workers and to the violent suppression of their demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer to an extract from an Amnesty International report, a relatively recent one since it dates from 2002, which states very clearly that in private companies in China overtime is not only compulsory, but is also unpaid, and that certain factories impose fines on those refusing to work overtime or arriving late for work. Chinese workers work between 10 and 12 hours per day and their accommodation and food costs are often deducted directly from their wages. It is not unusual for businesses to withhold wages for sometimes two months, or to keep the identity cards of certain workers for several months. In short, trade unions are hugely repressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we have a structured dialogue with China on human rights – talks moreover took place last week – it seems to me that we ought to highlight the freedom of trade unions. The numerous trade unionists today incarcerated in Chinese prisons ought to be the subject of protection measures, protection measures provided for in the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. This is an entirely crucial factor in the debate, which, I believe, has been unjustly concealed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is hard to say, but it is not the trousers and T-shirts imported from China that should be counted, but the jobs destroyed and the lives shattered.</p>
<p class="contents">When we hear the Commission and the Council of Ministers say, ‘we are not aware, we were not aware, we could not be aware, it is China’s fault’, I can only cry out: but who are they trying to kid? The decision to abolish the quotas was taken 10 years’ ago with the agreement of all of the governments. China has been part of the WTO for nearly four years. Over the past two years, nine out of ten textile machines have been bought by China. Ultra-modern factories have been built there thanks to direct or indirect capital investments, including from Europe. The European governments and institutions knew all of that and have done little or nothing at all. They are therefore entirely and jointly responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">The pitiful agreement that Commissioner Mandelson reached with the Beijing authorities will not change anything. The ineffable Commissioner Mandelson is like Molière’s doctor: he waits for his patient to die in order to ascertain his illness. However, can the general interests of Europe be reconciled with the specific interests of the City: invest in China, Turkey or elsewhere?</p>
<p class="contents">Today it is the textile industry, but tomorrow it will be the car industry or perhaps the aeronautics industry, as China already manufactures Airbus doors and builds regional aircraft that compete with European, Canadian or Brazilian products. You were surprised by the instinctive rejection of your ultraliberal constitution by the majority of those rare people in Europe who had a vote! This overwhelming rejection is, however, the people’s punishment for your policy, including that relating to the textile industry. The public do not want that policy to become the basic law of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to save and develop our textile industry, it is time for a change of policy. After introducing a moratorium on the lifting of quotas, the Commission is duty bound to boost and assist research and development and training efforts in this sector. The European Central Bank ought to encourage the introduction of low-interest loans for SMEs/SMIs in the sector, promoting employment, research and training. The Union should take measures to prevent imports of goods produced by children or slave labour or by workers denied their freedom to participate in trade union activity, and to impose a tax on social dumping. Finally, emerging countries should be given assistance to develop their internal markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am in favour of the immediate implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean trade zone on the basis of the principle of reciprocity. I am in favour of adequate Community financing to strengthen research and innovation, especially in the less advantaged areas of the European Union.</p>

Although it deserves a great deal of praise for the speed with which it initiated negotiations and took steps to deal with the situation, these steps could have been more far-reaching and could have been taken sooner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the important role this House has played in this respect. It was what we did that compelled the Commission, even more than it would have been, to have recourse to these measures. Left to themselves, they might well have done rather less. It is, though, to challenges such as these that European policy must respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Europe, we enjoy the great advantage – and it is one of which I am glad – that our consumers are surely among the most mature in the world, and so they should be given the chance to decide what and how to buy, on the basis of far more information and with greater ease. We should give thought to the possibility of introducing a ‘made in Europe’ label, which would be able to be carried only subject to certain very stringent criteria being complied with, first among them, of course, compliance with international labour standards, along with social and environmental standards and a ban on the use of child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">If we succeed in this, we will also be able to find another way to respond to this development and make the world rather more socially responsible and cleaner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a sector that has been going through a serious crisis for some years now; the crisis has now been accelerated by the introduction of new trade agreements and the fall of many customs barriers, but the sector had already been experiencing great difficulties for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an important sector in terms of volume of business, the number of workers, its distribution in various European countries and its particular concentration in certain regions. As a consequence, a crisis within that sector leads, in a number of local situations, to nothing short of a crisis for the economic and production system.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have already stated on other occasions, we too felt that the Commission’s intervention came slightly late in the day. People had already been calling for it for some time, with the data in hand, in view of what was taking place with regard to imports and their volume.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this criticism, however, we welcome the action taken by Commissioner Mandelson, whom we invite to oversee not only the agreement reached and its implementation, but also what is happening with regard to other categories of products. In actual fact, the issue has not been resolved once and for all, and what has been done for a few categories of products, somehow containing the situation, could be required in the coming months for other categories of products.</p>
<p class="contents">For now we must not waste the time we have gained and we must make use of the recommendations originating from the high level group, from cooperation with entrepreneurs and social partners and from the ongoing talks. Action must be undertaken to promote the restructuring and reorganisation of that sector, so as to overcome a profoundly structural crisis. I refer in particular to employment, to professional training, to credit assistance, and to all of those innovations that can help such an important sector for Europe to remain that way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a consequence, they have given up protecting industry, production and national labour.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the prospect of exporting many European goods and services has almost been wiped out, because it is impossible to withstand the competition from the so-called ‘Asian Tigers’ with regard to markets in developing countries. Added to that is the fact that we are subjected to unparalleled competition within our internal markets, both as a result of goods imported from the countries mentioned, and because of the diabolical mechanism allowing European producers, who have perhaps also benefited from government funding for their activities, to relocate production and to import and market their products in the countries in which the brands originate.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the terrible predictions made by industry associations, and taking into account that in the absence of national sovereignty, imposed by this bureaucratic Europe, initiative measures cannot be taken by individual Member States, the Commission must expedite policies and directives supporting European businesses and employees in the sector, and prevent the marketing in EU countries of goods produced by the Asian Tigers, which are invading our markets. <span class="italic">Inter alia</span>, they are goods produced without any guarantees for the consumer in terms of the production processes and the materials used, which often have a very high environmental impact, and which, furthermore, do not respect social guarantees and workers’ dignity, in complete contrast to what is stipulated by the World Trade Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are only seeing the first stage. That is why our present responses to this issue will serve other areas of our industry in the future. We cannot accept the deregulation of international trade without concerning ourselves with the related human, economic and environmental consequences. A case in point is the textile sector where the end of quotas was dreaded and where there have been countless company restructurings, indeed outright shutdowns, in the regions in which this industry is still very prominent. Faced with these human dramas, we are, in a sense, powerless.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of safeguard clauses, the fight against counterfeiting and the supplying of aid for research and information provision are all helpful roads to go down, but we cannot stop there. In paragraphs 18 and 24 of her report, Mrs Saïfi rightly emphasises the need to combat all forms of modern slavery and forced labour, as well as the exploitation of children. Indeed, it will never be possible for our modern economy, based on, among other things, respect for human dignity, to compete faced with such abuses. Mrs Saïfi’s responses, designed to combat these scourges, are insufficient, however. One has to be able to hit where it hurts.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, together with 50 of our fellow Members representing four political groups, we have lodged an amendment asking the Commission to consider putting in place an ethical tax on products proven to have been manufactured in violation of all the rules of human dignity and, above all, involving the exploitation of children. It is crucial that an institution like ours serve more than one generation and that it serve to generate hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will provide companies affected by the huge rise in imports with some respite in this extremely serious crisis for the textile and clothing sector. It is now necessary to monitor the implementation of the safeguard clauses and to evaluate the effects of these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to put three questions to the Commissioner. How do you intend to respond to this resolution by the European Parliament on the future of the textile and clothing industries? How do you intend implementing the High Level Group’s recommendations, which have been received very favourably by Parliament? And what actions do you intend to take to enable companies to have access to the market? For example, might the European Union support trade strategies common to those small- and medium-sized European enterprises that might wish to form consortia with a view to conquering new markets such as China’s?</p>
<p class="contents">Fellow Members have already said this, but the current crisis in the textile sector was foreseeable, and crises in other sectors of industry are foreseeable in the context of a globalised economy. We must all work with ingenuity and tenacity to safeguard the textile, clothing and leather industries, for the lessons we shall learn from this crisis will, in the long run, help us to maintain and develop other sectors of the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Textiles and clothing are a key sector for the European Union and I therefore support Mrs Saïfi’s protest at the absence of the competent Commissioners in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector, which is mainly composed of small- and medium-sized enterprises, today finds itself in great difficulty as a result of Chinese goods, produced and sold extremely cheaply, invading our market. Imports from China have increased on a worrying scale, particularly following the definitive abolition of import quotas in January 2005. As a consequence, the EU textile and clothing sector finds itself under unprecedented pressure. Our factories are closing down with increasing frequency and thousands of workers are left without jobs. In Italy, 24 000 jobs were lost in 2004 and over 66 000 in the last three years.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be stressed that this problem also afflicts all of the developing countries that used to export their goods to Europe and that are now no longer able to withstand the Chinese competition. As a consequence, factories are not only closing in Europe, but also in Sri Lanka, in Pakistan, in Morocco and in the entire Mediterranean area.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do? The appearance on the world trade scene of new, aggressive global players, in particular China and India, makes it necessary to review the traditional objectives of Community trade policy, characterised by the maximum opening up of the markets to assist in promoting European industry worldwide. The current scene and the way it is likely to develop, however, dictate a more prudent approach, aimed at protecting European industry in the face of unbalanced and destructive competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The following actions need to be implemented urgently: approving without delay – as Commissioner Michel stated in this House this morning – the proposal for a regulation for the compulsory marking of origin of goods imported into the European Union; laying down industrial policies aimed at providing support to the sectors most exposed to international competition, including through the use of the Structural Funds; strengthening the trade protection instruments available to European businesses, including anti-dumping measures – as has been done for leather shoes – and anti-subsidy measures as well as the safeguard clauses; making the fight against counterfeiting a European priority, by supporting Commissioner Frattini’s initiatives; and steering the Commission’s choices towards bilateral agreements. If Hong Kong were to collapse like Cancún, there would be no time to relaunch the multilateral negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I call for a review of the position on the new policy on chemical substances – the REACH Directive – particularly in order to guarantee the competitiveness of small- and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I very much want to emphasise how important this subject is. A common European market requires common rules. The same rules of competition must be applied to all the participants in the European textile market. That is part of what respect for competition means. China represents the ideology of state enterprises. No one will be able to accept advantages being accorded to Chinese enterprises. Our national governments are not entitled to accord advantages to national enterprises. The Commission would immediately pronounce a ban. It would, however, be a mistake for our national industries not to react, faced with China. That is why I am in favour of applying the principle of reciprocity of trade, as everyone could benefit from it. It is therefore extremely important to ensure that the High Level Group’s recommendations are properly applied and to be vigilant when it comes to properly implementing the Shanghai agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This agreement gives the European textile industry some breathing space but, more importantly, it allows for crucial strategic decisions to be taken even now as regards the regrouping and modernisation of the textile sector in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, international developments in competition are forcing companies into making progress in leaps and bounds, into technological modernisation, innovation, research, technology and lifelong learning. That is why the European Union must develop the structural policies and Structural Funds for the textile industry, develop the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development, create a specific Community programme for the development of the textile and clothing sectors, dynamically develop the institutional possibilities offered by the WTO to overturn China's social and environmental dumping and combat the problem of child labour by taking, where necessary, specific defensive trade measures, by safeguarding and defending free and equal access to third country markets and pure competition for European products, by defending consumer rights, by combating piracy and imitations and protecting intellectual property rights and by taking initiatives for a new integrated cooperation agreement with China to replace the 1985 cooperation agreement, which has basically been overtaken by international developments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take advantage of Commissioner Michel's presence here to finish by saying that the Commission will also need to step up its investigation into uncontrolled imports of Chinese shoes, which have created serious problems in European countries such as Greece. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to express, on my own behalf and that of the Commission, our sincere condolences to the victims, and to the families of the victims, of the atrocious and barbarous acts that have taken place in London. I should also like to express my complete solidarity with the British authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I note that, behind a few inevitable and no doubt necessary criticisms, the general tone of the speeches is fairly favourable to the Commission’s approach. That is already the case with the draft resolution, even if a number of people consider that still further steps could be taken, for example when it comes to social norms, protection against China or industrial restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, I should like to revisit a few of the concerns expressed. The agreement with China is of concern to, among others, Mr Silva Peneda, Mr Guerrero, Mr Caspary, Mr Allister and Mrs Martens. I would say that Mrs Martens found the right words to express this concern. Like the majority of those who follow these issues, she thinks that the agreement with the Chinese will allow European industry some breathing space between now and 2008 and that this agreement is therefore good in itself. I wish to point out that this agreement is to be applied strictly and that the quantities imported are strictly accounted for within the framework of genuine self-limitation quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the safeguard clauses provided for by China’s act of accession to the WTO, it will be specified that the European Union has not formally relinquished these, but the agreement with the Chinese is obviously global and designed specifically to avert such conflict in administering the sector as might arise from the harsh measures constituted by these clauses. These clauses would therefore only be applied if this were really justified, something that does not seem to me to be the case, precisely because the agreement with China covers the most sensitive products, that is to say almost half of the Chinese textile sector liberalised in January 2005. Mr Allister who, I see, is generally well disposed towards this agreement, will appreciate that the management of Chinese trade thus put in place obviates the necessity for the anti-dumping measures that he was recommending.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to reassure Mr Caspary that the agreement with China will enable volumes to be stabilised, with a reasonable annual rate of increase of 8% to 12%. It therefore protects European manufacturers but, until 2008, also stabilises importers’ stocks. Flexibility clauses are envisaged within the framework of the negotiations under way with the Chinese in order to mitigate the limitation measures, to the advantage of importers.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words about respect for social standards on the part of developing countries. I would say in reply to Mr Silva Peneda that, although the European Union and the Commission actively promote such standards, developing countries criticise us on this subject, interpreting our demands as a form of protectionism in disguise. Matters are therefore not always as simple as they appear. Developing countries constitute the vast majority of ILO members and reject the link between trade and social standards. However, the Commission is not giving up and is proposing systematically to introduce into any preferential free trade agreement negotiations a withdrawal of preferences clause in the event of non-compliance with these standards. It is also acting positively. For example, the Council followed its lead on 27 June 2005 after we had proposed making new trade concessions to Sri Lanka, because the latter had just ratified the ILO’s eight basic conventions. The policy is fairly clear: ban child labour in exchange for abolishing customs duties on exports to the European Union. It is a question of making a link between multilateral trade negotiations and social standards. We cannot say what will be decided in Hong Kong in December, but the Commission’s very strong attachment to this link can be pointed out right now. If he had been able to be present in the House this morning, my colleague in charge of trade, Peter Mandelson, would have certainly explained how, in Turin on 26 May 2005, he intervened along these lines within the framework of a meeting organised jointly with the ILO. In this area, as in others, many practical measures are possible. For example, serious thought is being given to a partnership and social dialogue structure with China where textiles are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would return now to the European Union’s trade policy priorities by way of replying to Mr Belder, among others. Implicit in the draft resolution is the need to give priority to the Euro-Mediterranean zone, particularly in relation to Asia. The Commission largely shares this point of view. Developing trade between the two banks of the Mediterranean should help the development of this region and partly resolve the serious problems, such as immigration, that are common to the north and south of the area and that extend beyond the problems relating to textiles.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other priorities: Africa, in connection with which I would refer you to the G8, meeting today in Scotland; the Least Developed Countries; and the poor countries of Asia. The Commission therefore agrees with Mrs Saïfi on this point: a number of comparative advantages need to be maintained in favour of those to whom the European Union intends to give preference. That is why, for example, it very strongly supports putting in place the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin, which should be adopted by the Council this autumn. I would, moreover, take this opportunity to invite Parliament to help the Commission put pressure on the Council in order to speed up the adoption of the protocols in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it should be noted, on the question of trade preferences, that, since this year, the European Union has withdrawn most of its trade preferences from China. This negative priority is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Zingaretti, in particular, referred to the trade protection measures. If third countries subsidise their exports, there are responses available. In fact, the European Union has a whole arsenal of responses available to it. These include antidumping duties or anti-subsidy measures. For example, a week ago, the Commission opened an antidumping investigation in connection with certain types of Chinese and Indian shoes. The matter was discussed. We are not in the business of pious hopes in this House. I can assure you that these measures are taken very seriously by these two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to counterfeiting, which is Mrs Muscardini’s concern and one that is shared by the Commission, the European Union has made progress. Since July 2004, a new arrangement is in force enabling companies to ask for the customs authorities to confiscate goods likely to be counterfeit. What we have here is a unified, free and simple Community procedure, intended as it is, in part, for small textile companies representing, as one MEP rightly said, 90% of the sector. However, does not greater efficiency demand, above all, that more be done to integrate the European customs authorities? A Community Customs Code has existed since 1992, but it is applied by 25 national customs authorities, which are sometimes difficult to coordinate. Fraudsters are often clever at exploiting such situations. A lot therefore remains to be done in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of intellectual property, which is a very sensitive subject in the textile sector, recent years have been characterised by a veritable explosion in statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that China’s accession to the WTO now imposes obligations upon it and also gives the European Union the option of taking more vigorous action if China does not comply with the obligations arising from its accession. I would therefore say to the representatives of the European left, who do not want the European Union to fund relocations, that we are in complete agreement. It must simply be pointed out that there is not a single clause along these lines in any preferential trade agreement. I do not think it right to suggest things that are untrue or to allow them to be said.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rull and Mr Karim too spoke about the industrial restructuring of the textile sector. I think that Mr Karim is right: European industry has been urgently awaiting a miracle from the Commission since the beginning of 2005 and the liberalisation of the Chinese textile sector. It has already been said, but I should like to state emphatically that liberalisation was decided upon ten years ago, in 1994. A number of Member States have also been able to prepare for it. The crisis in the textile sector is not, therefore, European in nature. It affects only those Member States that are unprepared.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be pointed out that industrial restructuring measures are largely the responsibility of the Member States. In its sphere of competence, the Commission proposed to reserve a portion of the Structural Funds for those sectors undergoing industrial restructuring following crises just like that in the textile sector, a matter now being discussed by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2004, the Commission – and, more specifically, Commissioner Potocnik – together with Euratex (that is to say, the European Apparel and Textile Organisation) announced an initiative known as the ‘European Textile Technology Platform’, one of whose purposes is to encourage technological innovation and so promote more upmarket products in the face of Chinese competition. It is true, as Mrs Lucas very rightly said, that the real victims of the liberalisation of the textile sector are the poorest countries, otherwise known as the Least Developed Countries, and that is precisely because they manufacture products with little technological content, such as cotton tee-shirts. Europe has the resources to go upmarket and to specialise in textile sectors. I am thinking of fabrics with very high technological content, in respect of which Chinese competition is more limited. Protection is, admittedly, necessary as a temporary measure, but innovation is surely the real solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that this resolution has not been adopted from today for, on behalf of the Commission, I broadly share the approach proposed by it. I should like to make a few more comments. Mr Leichtfried and Mrs Toia say that these are good measures but that the Commission could have reacted more quickly. The Commission responded in five months, after having verified that harm was indeed being caused. Where the Chinese are concerned, there can be no question of imposing quotas lightly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Romagnoli, I should like to repeat what I have just said. I challenge you to say by what precise mechanism the Commission might encourage relocations. It is not true that it would do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Laperrouze welcomes the agreement, rightly I believe. Regarding the High Level Group, a plan for identifying trade restrictions was presented by the Commission to the High Level Group on 14 June. It was presented by more than one Commissioner, namely Mr Mandelson and Mr Verheugen, and Mrs Saïfi was also present.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Tajani’s speech, in which he talked of marks of origin, the Commission is preparing a draft regulation to make such marks compulsory upon import. You must know, however, that the Member States are divided on this issue, a factor that is obviously slowing down progress on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the reciprocity mentioned in Mrs Lienemann’s speech, I agree, but this needs to be discussed within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude by drawing attention to two small considerations that are by no means irrelevant. An Airbus represents 20 million Chinese shirts. It is worth reflecting upon this and bearing in mind that trade is not a one-way affair. Trade operates in all directions and, by focusing upon one product in particular, one can sometimes significantly lose out on another product. That is something worth repeating.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment upon the highly ideological charge I heard made against liberal Europe, about which so many bad things are said. I just want to point out that it is liberal Europe that has made peace possible and that has led to the wealth that has been created no doubt being better distributed and shared out here in Europe than anywhere else. Collectivist or Marxist Europe, about which some people are clearly nostalgic, certainly cannot, in my view, offer the same track record as what is known as liberal Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As for trade union freedom, which was talked about in the same breath, it is guaranteed everywhere in the liberal states. I have not yet seen it genuinely guaranteed in totalitarian states, even left-wing ones. I say this simply because of my own liberal affiliations and because, from time to time, it is worth repeating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The future of 170 000 companies and 2.5 million workers in Europe is at stake, as well as a market worth EUR 185 billion. One need look no further than the US for a good example of how not to take decisions on this matter. Within two years of quotas being lifted in 2002, China had gained a 65% market share in the country. The Chinese problem consists not only in cheap clothing imports, but also in unfair practices such as state subsidies, tax breaks, land distribution and subsidised energy and transport. If we wish to stop China in its tracks and to keep jobs in Europe, we should convene an extraordinary WTO session to discuss how we can prevent global trade being dominated by a single supplier. At the same time, we should launch the emergency procedure provided for in the guidelines for invoking the safeguard clauses, and set up a new programme to secure funding for regions where the sector provides jobs for workers who would otherwise be unemployed, and ensures that women are not forced into inferior jobs. We should make funding available for restructuring under the new Financial Perspective, and for new solutions and the implementation of research results in the SME sector under the Seventh Framework Programme. EU policies should be targeted at modernising industry, as otherwise the Electronic Proposal Tool will never be anything but a dead duck. The governments of heavily industrialised Member States should be granted derogations from the ban on subsidies, and an impact assessment must be carried out for REACH in order to ensure that it does not act as a brake on the competitiveness of European industry. A consolidated market should be set up under the EU-Mediterranean agreements, and a similar platform should be established in the Baltic region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
