<p class="contents">Following the introduction of the toll for heavy goods vehicles in Germany, plans to introduce a toll for cars in the near future are also under consideration. As this would lead to higher costs for German car drivers, the introduction of a car toll would have to be accompanied by a compensatory reduction in vehicle tax.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that the introduction of the car toll in Germany, conditional to a decision being made to reduce vehicle tax at the same time, is compatible with the ban on discrimination laid down in Article 12 of the EC Treaty? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to inform the honourable Member of Parliament that currently, with the sole exception of heavy goods vehicles, there is no harmonisation in the field of vehicle taxes at Community level. While Directive 1999/62/EC established minimum annual vehicle tax rates for heavy goods vehicles, Member States are free to lay down national provisions for car taxation as they see fit. A similar situation exists in the field of tolls and charges for road vehicles, the imposition of which is often related to, and justified by, the costs incurred by national authorities for the construction and upkeep of the road infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 1999/62/EC provides the framework for levying tolls and charges for heavy goods vehicles in a non-discriminatory and proportionate manner. There is no such Community legislation for private vehicles. However, national provisions introducing car taxes, tolls or charges have to be in line with the general principle of the EC Treaty and, in particular, should not give rise to border-crossing formalities in trade between Member States and should respect the non-discrimination principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion that, if the imposition of toll charges for road vehicles is not conditional on a decision to reduce car taxes simultaneously, and if these measures do not include any direct or indirect discrimination based on the nationality of the road vehicle, they are not contrary to Article 12 of the EC treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall that the Commission gave a similar reply to an oral question during Question Time at Parliament’s December 2005 part-session. According to the information available to the Commission, Germany is currently not pursuing the idea of introducing a toll for passenger cars. If Germany were to introduce a toll, as referred to in the oral question, the Commission would of course examine those provisions in depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament confirmed the need for infrastructure charging when it adopted the report of the conclusions of the White Paper on 12 January 2003. Distance-based road tolls and charges based on the duration of the use of the road have historically been levied on motorways or other main roads to help finance the construction, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure. Increasingly, as technology advances, such instruments could also be used to manage traffic: congestion charges, emissions-related charges and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Most Member States levy tolls or charges on at least part of their motorway network. The Commission policy on road charges and tolls is that they are an important instrument for financing investment in infrastructure, managing traffic and encouraging private-sector investment in infrastructure management. So Commission legislation is currently limited to heavy goods vehicles, as I have already mentioned, but it is a part of our policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly the case with the advertising of food products, given the potential relationship with children’s diets and health. On the general basis, the European Union is equipped with a number of horizontal norms that touch upon this field and regulate those advertising activities that can influence children’s behaviour, and which also cover food products.</p>
<p class="contents">First, in respect of television advertising, since 1989 the Television Without Frontiers directive has provided that such advertising shall not cause moral or physical detriment to minors. In particular, television advertising shall not directly exhort minors to buy a product or service by exploiting their inexperience or credulity, directly encourage them to persuade their parents or others to purchase the goods or the services being advertised, or exploit the special trust that minors usually have in parents, teachers and in others close to them.</p>
<p class="contents">A proposal for an amendment to this directive, adopted by the Commission on 13 December 2005, would extend these provisions to other types of audio-visual content. In addition, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which was adopted in 2005, includes similar provisions. This will enhance the protection of vulnerable groups of consumers, banning directly exhortations to children to buy advertised products or persuade their parents or other adults to buy advertised products for them.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, the Commission does not intend to take any other legislative initiative. The Commission now expects self-regulation by the industry to step in and complement in an effective and precise way the provisions of law which are in place. It has initiated a far-reaching process to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">The European platform on diet, physical activity and health, for example, is meant to bring about non-regulatory measures and firm commitments by the industry. The Commission expects that these commitments will include a number that relate to advertising to children. In parallel, the Commission has also reinforced its dialogue with industry and others to assess how to further improve advertising self-regulatory measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2005 the Commission adopted a Green Paper on the promotion of healthy diets and physical activity. One of the questions, for which the Green Paper specifically invites responses, is: ‘Are voluntary codes (“self-regulation”) an adequate tool for limiting the advertising and marketing of energy-dense and micronutrient-poor foods? What would be the alternatives to be considered if this self-regulation fails?’ The Commission hopes that this approach will produce meaningful commitments to the benefit of all actors concerned and to society at large. Should this not be the case – and this is important – the Commission will not hesitate to propose appropriate legislative measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can I push you a bit further on that last point you made, because up until then I was a little disappointed with what you were saying in implying that the legislation was already there. I could give you any number of examples about which I am concerned, but I shall give you just one. Nestlé ‘Cheerios’ is a breakfast cereal which has 21% sugar and a great deal of salt. They produce their own colouring book and encourage children to eat more and more of this product according to how much they are colouring in.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU already legislates, as you outlined in your remarks, but you also implied that this legislation was the basis that could be used. If no new legislation is necessary, can I urge you to look again at the existing measures and self-regulation – which I am not at all certain is accurate – and see whether they are working or whether they need strengthening? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The total allocation amounts to EUR 20.35 billion for these TENs transport projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement on the 2007-2013 perspective reached at the December 2005 European Council implies a significant reduction of around 40% of the overall amount of appropriations allocated to Heading 1a which, in addition to the transport sector, covers areas such as research, education, competitiveness and new technologies. The breakdown of appropriations between the various components of Heading 1a has not yet been decided.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore unable to give a precise reply to the honourable Member regarding the consequences of the reduction of the amounts contained in its original proposal for a financial perspective until the figures have been finally decided upon by interinstitutional agreements.

<p class="contents">The funding of the seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research for the period 2007-2013 is due to be adopted this year. The programme will have a budget of over EUR 72 000 million and includes plans to double the number of researchers taking part in projects, to create research jobs and to improve the conditions for collaboration between research and business.</p>
<p class="contents">Statistics on participation in the sixth Framework Programme of the European Community for research for the period 2007-2013 show that in the majority of EU Member States, including Lithuania, small and medium-sized businesses often received less funding than universities and other centres of research or institutes. In EU countries, and in the new Member States in particular, there is little collaboration between private businesses and researchers. This state of affairs reduces the EU’s competitiveness globally.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it not be appropriate to allocate part of the moneys available under the seventh Community Framework Programme (15–20%) towards funding the requirements of small and medium-sized businesses?

First, regarding the total budget for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, the Commission proposal will need to be revised in the light of the developments in the financial perspective for 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding cooperation between research organisations and enterprises, in particular SMEs, the Commission agrees that this is of crucial importance. Participation by SMEs is, and will remain, one of the key objectives of the framework programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In Framework Programme 6, a variety of measures has been taken in order to promote SME participation in the thematic areas where they collaborate with other firms and research organisations. These measures include: support to networks of intermediaries in specific sectors of technological fields to help SMEs with proposals, preparations, partner searches etc.; targeted calls in areas of particular interest for SMEs, as well as funding schemes dedicated to SME support, the outsourcing of research by SMEs and SME associations. Given their success, we propose that they should continue in Framework Programme 7. The framework programmes are thus already promoting participation by SMEs and their cooperation with research organisations very actively.</p>
<p class="contents">With specific reference to the honourable Member’s suggestion to set a quantified target for SME participation, the Commission takes note of the fact that the Council has introduced a target of 15% SME participation as part of the partial general agreement on FP7. Such a target already exists in FP6, but the Commission has doubts about maintaining such an overall minimum budgetary target for SME participation for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, potential participation by SMEs varies very much from one thematic area to another, from approximately 5% to 20%. It is therefore practically impossible to define a realistic overall target <span class="italic">a priori</span> and it could even be misleading.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, targets for SMEs may be perceived as compromising the objective of supporting only research of the highest quality and would go against the principles of equal access and excellence that are fundamental to the Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, support to SMEs should focus on real measures that make FP7 genuinely attractive and beneficial for SMEs, through the identification of research topics, simplification of administrative aspects and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Commission believes that SME involvement is best achieved by removing barriers to SME participation and that is what we want to do. It is also achieved by simplification and improvement of administrative and financial procedures, shorter time to contract, reduced reporting requirements and increased flexibility for SMEs to promote projects of a scope and size that best fit their needs. More account must also be taken of SME needs and potential in developing the content of the theme in the specific programme and especially in the work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is very important to underline that for SMEs the Community financial contribution may reach 75% of the eligible costs instead of the usual rate of 50%. This is the proposal which was included in the Rules for Participation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the honourable Member that it is a large sum of money, because there are important challenges which are ahead of us if we are to deal with questions such as how to sustain our quality of life and remain globally competitive. That is the major question which is included in the Lisbon Agenda and the Partnership for Growth and Jobs which is a follow-up to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is crucial that, on the one hand, we try to stimulate the potential of Member States which are less developed, smaller and maybe do not have the potential to compete on an equal basis today. There are a number of action centres; specific action is proposed in Framework Programme 7 to boost that ability to compete. On the other hand, we have to be aware that the European Union should be aiming for the top. We should stimulate excellence and the possibility that we can truly compete with the changing and challenging world of today.</p>
<p class="contents">So we care very much about what you have said, but we also believe that the various types of sources should be combined to address both questions which I underlined, one being the question of aiming for the top, of having the best for Europe; and the second, the question of how to deal with the others which may not be in the best position today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are right to say that it was mentioned in the debate. However, even before it was mentioned in the debate, the Commission, in its original proposal and together with the European Investment Bank, tried to develop an instrument called a ‘risk-sharing facility’. One of the major problems we have to deal with at European Union level is that we do not all have the same ways of addressing risk. It varies from culture to culture. That is why it is crucial that we create instruments to address that problem. It is not allowing us to be totally in line with the major competitors, especially when we talk about the percentage of GDP invested in research and development. It is crucial that that we stimulate that.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the idea behind introducing the risk-sharing facility with the EIB. It would increase potential, because with each unit of the grant which we would somehow give to the EIB, we would get something like four to five units of credit back. It would also give us the opportunity to address some of the more risky businesses which the EIB – in line with banking logic – is not addressing. I am sure that this is not a magical answer which will solve our problems, but I sincerely hope that it will be followed by some other financial institutions across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you rightly stated, probably the best way of stimulating SME participation is to cut down on red tape. Bigger companies do not have to expend the same proportion of their energy on this as smaller companies, and the same is true of the proportion of finances. We are trying to approach this question in a consistent manner: from the financial regulation, to the rules of participation, to the next steps of how we will deal with that in-house, we are trying to cut red tape. It is one of the most difficult exercises we are conducting. However, I am firmly convinced that, with goodwill, we can take a major step towards at least reversing the negative trend.</p>
<p class="contents">On the same day as we adopted the framework programme, we also adopted the special paper dealing with questions of simplification. In addition, we established a kind of simplification board, consisting of a number of small actors who have been advising us on the preparation of the rules of participation and who will continue to advise us on further in-house simplification processes.</p>
<p class="contents">I see simplification as a process that we need to address in all phases and which has to be consistently applied throughout the entire period. I hope that, in this major endeavour, I will also obtain the support of the European Parliament and the Council, because it is to a certain extent a problem we all share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, a new scheme on regions of knowledge provides support to research-and-development-intensive regional clusters. This follows on from two rounds of experimental activities that have created a lot of interest among our regional stakeholders. Members will recall that the first was actually stimulated by the European Parliament. The proposal for the seventh Framework Programme recognises the role of regional actors in developing the research capacity of their region and supports projects focused on regional research-driven clusters.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important new initiative under the capacities-specific programme is the one on unlocking research potential, which aims to develop the research potential in the EU’s convergence regions by supporting secondments of research staff, the acquisition of equipment or the organisation of conferences for technology transfer.</p>
<p class="contents">Activities will also be undertaken on the coherent development of policies, part of the capacity-specific programme that will enable the exchange of experience between policy-makers at regional level. Activities are provided for under the strand of research infrastructure that would have important implications for some regions in Europe, and, last but not least, the Eranet and the Eranet+ activities that will also involve research players at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">Regions have always been partners to the framework programme. The fact that this is now taking one step further, including schemes targeted specifically at regions, must not allow us to forget that the framework programme has contributed to research and development in the regions in many more ways and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Framework programme projects help fight regional insularity and technological preventionism. Through European research projects, innovative companies in convergence regions will continue to link the major technology networks and to regenerate their profile and capacity, and remote universities will continue to have access to innovative ways of adopting their research models and become, in some cases, real development drivers for the region.</p>
<p class="contents">SME networks participating in the framework programme will continue to improve their technological competence. Marie Curie fellowships will maintain support for research and development human resources, with a direct impact on regional research capacities. New features in the framework programme enhance its commitment to improving synergies with European regional policy so as to reinforce the support of the structural funds for research in the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Through our actions in the framework programme, the Commission will try to provide useful models that will enable European regions to become more efficient in designing and implementing research policy and thus be more able to support their research players. In addition, they will become more efficient in using structural funds resources for research investment.</p>
<p class="contents">This presents a real opportunity to make progress towards the Barcelona objective of 3% of GDP investment in research and development in the context of the Lisbon strategy. It is obvious that we must address the issue of catching up at European, national and regional levels, and that is clearly acknowledged in the proposal for the framework programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is crucial that one reads carefully the cohesion guidelines prepared by the Commission, which try to give a clear message that the Member States, in addressing their problems in the regions, need to take into account the structural and cohesion funds which are important in this respect for catching up with the Lisbon goals.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, we also try to do that through our programmes.

<p class="contents">The principles in the approach to the revision were outlined at a meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on 26 January 2006. Smaller activity actions cannot be reduced as much as bigger ones, otherwise they lose their <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>. Some lines have a budget that depends, for instance, on international commitments entered into by the European Union or some other bodies. Prioritisation within the themes and a high level of flexibility are also necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation part should remain the core of the programme. Alongside the cooperation part, many other activities, such as infrastructure, SMEs and the mobility of researchers will be given due consideration in the revised proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the reduced budget, not only the breakdown but also the timing for the introduction of new initiatives may have to be considered. The framework programme aims to make European research more attractive and to create more mobility for researchers. That is to be boosted by the People Programme, dedicated to structuring the mobility, training and career development of researchers throughout Europe. This is essential to help create a single labour market of researchers, but it is not the only programme to create an attractive European research area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pulling the strands together practically is crucial. It is obvious that cooperation at EU level could show the best ways of using and investing the money. That is happening with or without our investment. This is the trend that is going on, because this is the only way in which we can truly deal with the challenges ahead of us. By stimulating that at European Union level, however, we help this process go faster. That is why I agree with you totally that our common endeavours are very important for Europe to benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, approximately 5% of public money is spent through the Framework Programme at European Union level. The rest is invested from the budgets of the Member States. Private funding is even more important than public funding. In the European Union, approximately 55% of private money is invested, compared to 45% of public money. It is crucial that we try to stimulate not only the public but also the private sector. It is crucial that companies work and invest in Europe. That is why it is crucially important that these companies are stimulated via the creation of proper conditions, i.e. that tax incentives are there, state aid is supporting that, intellectual property rights are in place, public procurement goes in this direction, risk venture capital is provided, and we stimulate brain circulation and so on. All these things matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Three per cent is a kind of indicator of whether we are doing things correctly. Our horizontal policies which we are using across all our sectors are consistent and are those which are truly up to the challenges which we have to face today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the competitiveness and innovation framework programme, one phase addresses the issue at hand, and the other phases are addressed through the framework programme. From the very beginning, we have coordinated our activities, which are having a similar effect on innovation as the structural funds have on the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, when we talk about involving business in the work we are doing, it is crucial to underline that we have a new tool that did not exist in the past: I refer to the technology platforms, which were established at the beginning of this century and which are developing very fast. The whole idea of technology platforms – I believe we currently have 28 of them – is that they are bottom-up initiatives, starting with the business’s point of view. In these platforms, the points of view of practically all stakeholders are taken on board. So, while these platforms stem from a business initiative, they also include researchers, politicians, NGOs, financial institutions, regulatory authorities and the others on board. They create what are known as ‘strategic research agendas’ for the next 20 years – or more, depending on various factors.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first time that this kind of tool and this kind of logic have been developed at European Union level. I meet daily with industrialists and with others, who are clearly very enthusiastic about what is going on. Even if we were now to remove the incentives, which were, at the outset – if we are frank – financed through the framework programme, this is now a process with its own story. It will definitely make a change at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are part of a process that will produce hugely important benefits. On the basis of their views for the long-term future, where you have an idea of what research should be undertaken, to the final product and the business sector’s ideas on how to evaluate it in their work, we take this input on board when we create our cooperation activities. In practice, that is in the major part of our programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in some areas, where we believe that this long-term, strong partnership exists, and where there is strong commitment from the companies and other actors, such as Member States, for instance, we are ready to develop what are known as ‘joint technological initiatives’, which are a new long-term tool with clear cofinancing, as a new tool, from the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have never had such a clear overview of the intentions, strategies and points of view of the business sector as we have today when we create the framework programme, and, of course, in the final phase, the specific work programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the reason.</p>
<p class="contents">As a complement to the Commission’s reply to Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2005-4200_EN.html">E-4200/05</a>, asked previously by the honourable Member, on the issue of the goodwill ambassadors, the Commission can reassure the honourable Member that its intention during the period of reflection is to listen to citizens’ views on a range of EU issues and to draw conclusions from the debates held at all levels. The issues discussed will be very varied and they may or may not include recommendations on the desirable level of integration at EU level, but the role of the Union will certainly be tackled and in any case the content of the database of debates will be reflected in the feedback process.</p>
<p class="contents">This process will start with an initial synthesis report that will be presented by the Commission to the European Council under the Austrian Presidency in order to prepare the stocktaking exercise at the June 2006 European Council. The Commission would like to take this opportunity to remind the honourable Member that the declaration calling for a period of reflection was adopted by the Heads of State and Government themselves, therefore it is for the Council to take stock of the exercise as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in the organisation of national debates the European institutions have an important role to play, but the primary responsibility rests with the Member States. What the Commission has recommended in Plan D is that the national debates need to be structured to ensure that the feedback can have a direct impact on the policy agenda of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the second part of the honourable Member’s question, the Commission would like to stress that the different initiatives suggested by Plan D at European level are part of a long-term plan and are being implemented at a different pace in the 25 Member States. The European goodwill ambassador plan is one of the measures that need to be further developed in most of the countries of the EU and in cooperation with the Member States, depending on the creativity and the proposals identified by those involved in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no single model for every country, just as there is no standard model for the organisation of the debates in the Member States. In any case, the Commission thinks that it is important to reiterate that the ambassadors would always act on a volunteer basis and the views that they would convey would be their own views. The Commission has no intention of imposing a particular line on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This budget will be managed as follows: a call for a proposal of EUR 2 million will be launched in the following weeks to give support to pan-European projects aimed at creating the conditions for citizens’ debates on EU issues. It will be aimed at supporting EU citizens’ networking and participation in the debate on Europe. It will be aimed at collecting citizens’ opinions, especially through qualitative means and extensive scale and it will be aimed at providing analyses of citizens’ contributions as feedback for decision-makers. In addition, EUR 850 000 will be allocated for setting up specific information products.</p>
<p class="contents">On a complementary basis, in order to stimulate the implementation of Plan D at a local level, EUR 4.5 million will be decentralised to the Commission’s representations in order to develop debates at regional and local levels and to improve synergy and coordination between national, regional and EU levels for the implementation of Plan D. This EUR 4.5 million will be executed either by calls for proposals or by procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, EUR 250 000 will be requested to develop a website especially devoted to the debate about Europe. On a broader scale, the Commission has already expressed its disappointment about the recent agreement of the European Council to cut the global appropriations of the next Financial Perspective, Heading 3, in a situation where the debate on Europe is becoming truly crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Implanted locally all over the enlarged European Union, 393 new relays have taken over from former Info-Points Europe and Rural Information and Promotion Carrefours which targeted the public in urban and rural areas respectively. The objectives of the new network have been streamlined in order to better meet the information needs of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the financial mechanisms put in place to support the network, they need to comply with the EC financial regulation. The new relays were therefore selected on the basis of a call for proposals, following the decision from the Commission, C/2004/2869. Each Europe Direct information relay benefits from an operating grant of a maximum of EUR 24 000 while the maximum grant for former IPEs and Carrefours was EUR 20 000. Furthermore, Digicom is planning to launch a complementary call for proposals at the beginning of 2007 in order to open new relays in geographical areas insufficiently covered by the current network and taking into account future enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the assessment of the impact of the networks, an internal assessment of the former information relays in 2003 revealed the real value of the relays as partners in the communication policy, especially at the local and regional level. As for the new relays, starting from the second semester of 2006, an online monitoring system will be implemented in order to assess the activities of the information relays.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the framework of the action plan on communicating Europe published in July 2005, the Commission intends to carry a feasibility study – action 6 of the action plan – to assess the desirability of progressively streamlining the Commission’s various information sources. As stated in action 42 of the same action plan, an impact study on the communication of the relays’ activities is also scheduled to start at the end of 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The contract covers the production and distribution costs of the EU programmes. It was signed on the basis of the existing seven languages – German, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian – and state of distribution. It does not contain any obligation for the channel to increase its geographical coverage or the number of languages. Nevertheless, the contract provides that however much the coverage or the languages increased during the life of the contract, the EU programmes would be included.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the selection criteria was the capacity and the will of EuroNews to develop its geographical and language coverage. Since the contract was signed, a window has been opened in Romania and in the Romanian language; agreements have been signed in India, China and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">EuroNews is also diversifying the various distribution technologies through which it can be received: cable, DTT, mobile phones, etc. However, distribution is a commercial matter over which only EuroNews has full command. Obviously, the Commission is encouraging EuroNews to increase by all the means under its control its geographical distribution technologies and language coverage.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Lithuania is concerned, at present only 49 000 households out of 1.33 million are able to receive EuroNews via cable or satellite. EuroNews is a candidate to be distributed via digital terrestrial television, Lietuvos Telekomas, and hoping for a positive answer. Moreover, negotiations are on course with the public channel, LRT, which would permit LRT to broadcast EuroNews programmes on their Hertzian base frequencies as often as they like. A Lithuanian window, similar to the Romanian one, is also currently under discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it an instrument that the Commission may be expected to use in connection with future proposals or is it being used in connection with the sugar reform by way of exception?

If need be, these dimensions might, moreover, be taken into account with the help of State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">It is currently permitted to grant State aid for the production and processing of various agricultural products listed in Annex I to the EC Treaty, if three different criteria are fulfilled. Firstly, the conditions of competition must not be repudiated. Secondly, the aid must be in keeping with the common agricultural policy in general and, thirdly, such aid must of course be compatible with the international commitments we have entered into. In this connection, I could mention our WTO agreement on agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">At the November European Council, the agricultural ministers laid down the political strategy for reforming the common EU policy on sugar. According to this agreement, it will be possible to grant limited and specific State aid of no more than EUR 350 per hectare to sugar beet producers in Finland, with a maximum of EUR 90 million per year being specifically targeted at the EU’s ‘outermost regions’. It was also decided that those Member States that reduce their sugar quotas by more than 50% be given the opportunity to receive temporary aid for a transitional period of five years, calculated from that production year in which they make a start on reducing their quotas or in which they reduce their quotas to below 50%. In the case of Italy, it has already been possible to grant such transitional aid, corresponding to approximately EUR 11 per tonne of sugar beet per production year. It has primarily been earmarked for the transport of beet.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP reform), adopted in 2003 in accordance with the decisions in the agricultural sphere previously taken in Berlin, Gothenburg and Brussels, is now in the process of being implemented. In the new Member States, the reform clearly lies within the budget framework for the enlarged EU, laid down in Brussels in 2002. In connection with the adoption of the CAP reform, there has been no desire whatsoever to renationalise European agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am no doubt looking, rather, for a political answer and political declaration. I believe that we need more reforms within the agricultural area during the next few years.

<p class="contents">In my view, such a proposal would mean our taking the first step towards renationalising Europe's common agricultural policy. It would mean that, instead of competing on the same basis, we should get into a situation in which agricultural policy would be about competition between the various national exchequers and between the different finance ministers of the EU’s 25 Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the current sugar market organisation, the quotas are allocated by the Member States to the sugar manufacturing undertakings and are actually not allocated directly to the beet growers. This principle will remain unchanged after the reform and Poland is no exception to this rule.</p>
<p class="contents">The restructuring fund will be set up in order to facilitate the necessary restructuring measures that should lead to lower sugar production in the less competitive regions within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Undertakings which renounce their sugar quota will be eligible for restructuring aid over a transitional period of four years. However, this payment will be linked to a series of conditions, including obligatory consultation with the beet growers and the submission of a restructuring plan to be agreed between the government and the industry. Member States will have significant flexibility to lay down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid, as long as they comply with the general rules of future Community legislation. Therefore – and this is very important and I underline it at every opportunity – the restructuring money <span class="italic">cannot be pocketed</span> by the industry. This is very important and it is the whole idea behind this restructuring fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the undertakings, beet growers and machinery contractors will also be able to benefit from this restructuring fund. An amount of at least 10% of the restructuring fund, amounting to EUR 730 per tonne, should be reserved for the farmers, to compensate in particular for investment in the specialised machinery needed to produce sugar beet. It is quite clear, with this wording of ‘at least 10%’, that Member States can decide that a higher percentage should be allocated to the sugar beet producers, the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be emphasised that, independently of the restructuring fund that we have just talked about, sugar beet growers will receive direct aid as compensation for their loss of revenue due to the reduction in prices. They will receive this direct aid even if they stop producing sugar beet. This is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">For the new Member States specifically, there will clearly be no phasing-in of the direct payment for the sugar beet compensation. The sugar beet producers in the new Member States will receive exactly the same amount per hectare in compensation as the EU-15, which means that there is no phasing-in as there is for cereals. The compensation will be 100% right from when the new sugar reform is first implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Refining aid</span></p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission knows, ACP countries which are party to the Sugar Protocol receive a guaranteed price for their raw sugar which is equivalent to the EU's minimum intervention price. At the current moment, this price includes basic adjustment aid to traditional refineries, which amounts to 5.1% of the guaranteed price. This aid amounts to approximately EUR 35 million. However, under the proposed reform of the EU sugar regime, this refining aid will no longer be paid from the EU budget, but instead will be passed on to the ACP in the form of a 5.1% price cut representing a loss in earnings of EUR 35 million for the ACP.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission confirm that it will consider the possibility of a small adjustment to the compromise package on the CMO, due to be considered in the Council on 20 February and allow adjustment aid for the refining industry to continue to be paid from the EU budget? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, these Sugar Protocol countries will benefit from a lower cut in the prices until the 2008-2009 production year. This will give these countries a period of three years to adapt to the new price support arrangements within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, the reference price for raw sugar will decrease by only 5%, while the producers of sugar beet in the European Union will see a decrease of 20% the first year, and 27.5% the following year. The reason for this decrease of only 5% is due to the fact that refiners and therefore the ACP suppliers will be exempted from the restructuring levy. They do not have to pay the levy at all. However, refiners will lose the benefit of the refining aid which will be abolished in the context of the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that the different conditions for the ACP countries after the introduction of a reform within the European Union has been discussed at length before finalising the political agreement in the Council. It is quite clear and it has been from the very beginning that it was important to secure the period of the last six months of 2006, which is outside the next financial period. Therefore the decision was taken to allocate EUR 40 million specifically for the period from 1 July until the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">For the period within the next financial perspective it has been quite clear that the Commission’s wish to allocate a significantly higher budget than the aforementioned EUR 40 million will be dependent on the ongoing discussions on the financial perspective for the next period. But it is a significantly higher amount than that mentioned. I can only say that within the Commission proposal, a budget of EUR 190 million a year was in the budget and I therefore hope that there will be an understanding also in this Parliament of the need to help these ACP countries, specifically in a transitional period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking about the fact that the collateral damage from the effects of the reform of the sugar regime has been felt by the 18 protocol countries.

I am now following that very closely. We can see no place in the budget for that money; we can see no likelihood of anything like the amount you promised to them being included in the budget.

It has been very important for us to try to help them, perhaps not to continue to produce sugar if they could not be competitive, but then to try to do something else. Therefore, I was very happy that at the Commission meeting last week it was possible to get through a communication on bioethanol. Afterwards, Mr Michel, who is responsible for the development money, took part in a press conference with me on this because bioethanol might be an alternative for those countries that want to stop producing sugar.</p>
<p class="contents">On the figures, this is an ongoing discussion. But it has been important for the Commission to send a clear signal that we care about the possibilities for these sugar-producing ACP countries. I am quite sure that when you are in contact with them, they will also recognise that we have had numerous meetings with these countries. For example, we have been able to have direct contact during Council meetings on two occasions. It has been acknowledged that this is really an issue that is on our minds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
