<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. – </span></span>  Good morning dear colleagues, this morning we have the pleasure of welcoming Taoiseach Micheál Martin, the Irish Prime Minister. Taoiseach, thank you for coming to address the European Parliament as part of our ‘This is Europe’ debates.</p>
<p class="contents">This year is an important one for Ireland in Europe and an important one for Europe with Ireland. It marks 50 years since the Irish people voted overwhelmingly in favour of joining what was then called the European Economic Community. And 50 years on, we are pleased that Irish citizens’ support for the European project remains extremely high.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Prime Minister being here with us in plenary is also an expression of Ireland’s commitment as Europe faces difficult times with an illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years, the European single market has helped Ireland’s economy become highly competitive. But Ireland continues to give a lot back to Europe too: economically, politically and socially. Economically, Ireland’s success story has allowed it to move from net recipient to net contributor to the EU budget. And politically, Ireland plays a central role in shaping common policies, particularly on finance, on the environment and on providing vital aid to Ukraine. And here I must commend Ireland for being the first country in the European Union to waive visa requirements for Ukrainians and for welcoming nearly 30 000 displaced Ukrainians who have sought shelter.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all painfully aware that Ireland is particularly affected by Brexit. And good relations with the United Kingdom remain in all our interests, especially in this new geopolitical context. On Northern Ireland, all the European Union institutions are aligned. Renegotiating the Protocol on Northern Ireland is not an option. The European Parliament has reiterated its unwavering support for the Protocol on several occasions and we remain fully committed to preserving the peace on the island of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Last night this Parliament officially took receipt of a gift from the Irish Government of a bust of former Member of the European Parliament and Nobel peace prize laureate, John Hume. His legacy is an inspiration with regard to conflict resolution and with regard to respecting differences. His work in brokering peace on the island of Ireland and in hammering out the Good Friday Agreement is highly respected and honoured in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament is attached to multilingualism. And, with the Irish language now a fully fledge officially EU language, let me say in Irish <span class="italic">go raibh maith agat</span>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to salute your leadership of the European Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Before I reflect on Ireland’s European past, it would be remiss of me not to pause to pay tribute to that great European, David Sassoli, who graced the office of President of this Parliament with such intelligence and dignity. Through his life and in his work, he demonstrated integrity, compassion and a strong focus on the most vulnerable in society. He will be long remembered, especially here in this Parliament, and he is sorely missed. <span class="italic">Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</span></p>
<p class="contents">By any measure, this is a critical moment in the history of Europe and the Union which we all share. We face a series of fundamental challenges. Will the values of free democracies prevail in the face of military and other aggression? Will we act together to protect hard-won progress in our societies? Do we have the ambition and urgency required to achieve energy security and tackle an existential climate crisis? Do we have the strength to overcome the many forces which seek to return us to the days of destructive rivalry and competition between the nations of Europe? </p>
<p class="contents">My message to you today is that we stand resolutely with all those who share the core values of peace, democracy and progress in Europe, and we believe that protecting these values demands a strong European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">Ireland’s nearly 50 years of membership of this Union has been transformative. We have seen an overwhelmingly positive impact across all dimensions of our society. Last month, we marked the 50th anniversary of the decision of the Irish people to join what we now call the European Union. For us, there is simply no doubt: this membership has been a historic enabler of sustained progress for Ireland. The decision of the people of Ireland to support membership was overwhelming, but it was not achieved easily. In the then six existing Member States, questions were asked if Ireland, then the poorest country in Europe, was simply too peripheral, too poor to be able to survive in the European Community. </p>
<p class="contents">At home, a coalition of forces used the classic anti-Europe tactics of claiming that we would be swamped by a neo-imperialist organisation and would lose our separate identity. However, an overwhelming majority rejected these arguments. The Irish people instead chose the path of hope and solidarity, of cooperation and a shared future. Time and time again, this decision has been vindicated. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the inspiring things about that decision 50 years ago is the role which was played by leaders from our revolutionary generation, those who as young people had done so much to win our independence against tremendous odds. They did not see Europe as a threat to our sovereignty, but as an enabler of our sovereignty. They rejected the idea of nationalism as a narrow and defensive concept; instead, they believed nationalism should be outward and forward-looking. And just as they did, we continue to be inspired by the ideas contained in our Proclamation of Independence from 1916, when the greatest of our leaders committed their country to the ideals of equality, diversity and cooperation with other nations. That is why the democratic majority of the Irish people remain euro-positive and why we see the success of the European Union as directly linked to the success of nation states.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last 50 years, sharing our sovereignty with our European partners helped to make us all safer, stronger and more prosperous, and Ireland has in turn been proud to contribute strongly to the shaping of today’s European Union. In the intense debates and negotiations of the past two years, I and my Government have been very clear: the Union must be strengthened. In order to serve us all better and to respond to urgent challenges, it needs more ambition and resources. We have been and we remain supportive of a growing and diverse Union based on shared values and shared prosperity. This has been a consistent theme during our presidencies of the Council. During our 1990 Presidency, we strongly supported European Union recognition of German reunification. During our 2004 Presidency, we worked to ease the arrival of 10 new Member States to our Union and hosted a ‘day of welcomes’ to underpin this. Through enlargement, we have welcomed new communities and they have since made a wonderful contribution to the Irish economy and society. And enlargement has been essential to strengthening our Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are seeing every day during the response to Russia’s war against Ukraine, Member States that secured their freedom from Soviet imperialism and totalitarianism are a powerful voice, reminding us that free democracy must be defended. I am strongly of the view that the prospect of membership can be a powerful driver of reform, and that membership itself is the most powerful tool we possess to enlarge the sphere of democracy, peace and security in our region. Our Treaties are clear that any European state which respects the values of the Union and is committed to promoting them may apply to become a member of the Union. It should be a source of pride and inspiration that the Union continues to be a beacon of hope to people at our borders – to the people of the Western Balkans; to the people of Ukraine; currently sacrificing and enduring so much in defence of our shared European values; to the people of Moldova and of Georgia. We should support those looking to join in undertaking the reforms and preparations necessary. And when they meet the criteria, we should not place further barriers in their way. </p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support Ukraine’s application for membership, and I look forward to the Commission’s opinion. I hope that, when the European Council meets in June, it will be possible to send the people of Ukraine a clear and positive message. </p>
<p class="contents">Ireland’s lived experience – and we are not alone in this – is that European Union membership is transformative. It is not only about access to markets and to economic opportunity, though that is, of course, important; it is about what it means to people. People who send their representatives to this Parliament. People – young people especially – who benefit from the freedom to move throughout the Union, to learn, to work, to experience life in another place and with another culture. People who gain confidence and strength from knowing that they live in a Union of values, of laws, of democracy, in which human rights and human dignity are fundamental guarantees. That is our strength, and Ireland is proud to be part of such a Union. </p>
<p class="contents">And no matter what its opponents say, let us never forget that the European Union is the most successful initiative for peace in our continent’s history. In Ireland, we feel this so deeply because of the Union’s role in supporting our successful efforts to bring an end to campaigns of violence which lasted for three decades. When I arrived in Strasbourg yesterday, I was privileged to join President Metsola in a ceremony to honour the only person to serve as an MEP who was also awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. John Hume was a political giant. A proud Irish nationalist and democrat, he dedicated his life to the cause of serving his people and persuading the minority to abandon violence and join in democratic politics. John was passionate about his country’s future, and that is why he was also a passionate supporter of the European Union. John had the vision to see the narrative of Ireland’s path to peace in the wider narrative of peace in Europe – a peace built on respect for political and cultural diversity cemented with economic interdependence. He overcame opposition from both extremes to chart a peaceful way forward for Ireland. His integrity and bravery shone through. With another courageous politician, David Trimble, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for an unwavering commitment to peace. He won every election he stood in and served in this Parliament for 25 years. </p>
<p class="contents">It is one of the many harsh realities of the Brexit vote of 2016 that no serious consideration was given to the implications for Northern Ireland and the agreement which underpins peace and reconciliation. The Good Friday Agreement provides a clear framework for protecting different identities and interests in Northern Ireland. It is a triumph for democratic politics and it has been a model for conflict resolution in many parts of the world. I can think of a no more solemn agreement than one which has ended a deadly conflict, has been democratically ratified and has been in operation for a quarter of a century. Because of this, a very detailed deal was negotiated and adopted to limit the damage on Northern Ireland caused by Brexit. Central to achieving this generous deal was the unwavering support and solidarity of our partners in the European Union, including the Members of this Parliament. I want to pay tribute to the European Parliament, which was absolutely clear in its support for the Good Friday Agreement and on the need to find a unique solution that would work for Northern Ireland. That solidarity mattered. That solidarity continues to matter. </p>
<p class="contents">The unique solution was, of course, the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland that is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom. It is perfectly reasonable to look for ways to improve the operation of the Protocol, but unfortunately what we have seen are bad—faith efforts to undermine a treaty freely entered into. Instead of trying to create a constructive atmosphere for all to engage, we have actually seen efforts to block agreements or introduce new problems. </p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, the European Union has worked hard to find ways to ensure that where there is a negative impact on businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland, it is minimised as much as possible. Vice-President of the Commission Maroš Šefčovič and his team have done remarkable work in listening to businesses and communities throughout Northern Ireland. They have a deep and practical understanding of the operation of the Protocol. </p>
<p class="contents">Last October, the Commission proposed a package of measures that would result in a significant reduction in border-linked checks. This Parliament has also been incredibly constructive. For example, in April, you overwhelmingly approved legislation to help safeguard the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland. I have said many times that there are solutions to practical problems under the Protocol, if there is a political will to find them. But that requires partnership. It requires the United Kingdom Government to engage with good faith, seriousness and commitment. Unilateral action to set aside a solemn agreement would be deeply damaging. It would mark a historic low point, signalling a disregard for essential principles of laws which are the foundation of international relations. And it would quite literally be to the benefit of absolutely no one. </p>
<p class="contents">Without a spirit of partnership, there would have been no peace process in Northern Ireland. Without trust, without engagement, without a willingness to see things from the point of view of others, there would have been no Good Friday Agreement, no quarter-century of peace in Northern Ireland in which young people have been able to grow and to flourish as themselves. All of us in positions of leadership owe it to them not to treat lightly what was so hard won.</p>
<p class="contents">As we look across our continent, as we see what is at stake when the rule of international law is threatened, it falls to all of us to work together and to stand by what we have agreed. </p>
<p class="contents">I am humbled and inspired by the extraordinary courage and resolve of the people of Ukraine as they defend their country and their right to determine their own future. The conflict is, at its most fundamental, about two utterly incompatible views of the world: autocratic and democratic. The new imperialism of Putin’s regime must not stand. Ukraine’s cause must be the cause of every person who believes in free democracy. As the European Council said once again last week, Russia must end its slaughter and withdraw from the entire territory of Ukraine. </p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, Mr Ruslan Stefanchuk, is here in Strasbourg today, and to him I say, Ireland unequivocally supports your country, your people and your right to a peaceful, democratic and prosperous future. We strongly support the toughest possible sanctions, and we do so understanding that this involves costs for us all. We are honoured that more than 34 000 Ukrainians have sought shelter in our country. </p>
<p class="contents">How many times have we heard ideologues from the extremes condemn and attack the European Union? Yet today, for many millions of people on our borders, it is the flag of blue with a circle of golden stars which symbolises their wish to be free. In 2014, the people of Ukraine took to the streets to demand a democratic and European future, and for this they suffered invasion and partition. We did too little to stand with the people of Ukraine then. We did too little to reject Putin’s new imperialism and his demand to control other countries in his sphere of influence. And this happened while he was constantly investing in extremist parties and disinformation in our countries, putting us all on notice that the destruction of the European Union was a core policy objective for him. We must stand with Ukraine not just during this war but in the months and years ahead. Our agenda must be Ukraine’s reconstruction, its securing of democracy, and its inclusion within our Union. </p>
<p class="contents">We must also support the democratic right of the Belarusian people to new, free and fair elections. We must content condemn the detention of political prisoners such as Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of the inspiring leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.</p>
<p class="contents">As a country with our own experience of famine, we condemn the illegal appropriation of agricultural production in Ukraine, which is having a direct impact on global food security and affordability, and is affecting the most vulnerable communities in parts of Africa and in the Middle East. It is hard to comprehend that hunger itself has been weaponised. Ireland will support the European Union in playing its part in an effective and swift international coordination to ensure a comprehensive global food security response. </p>
<p class="contents">And just as we are now showing urgency concerning Russian aggression, we also need to show more urgency on the other major challenges facing our Union and our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We must redouble efforts to accelerate the decarbonisation of our society, break our dependence on fossil fuels, and provide a more resilient, secure and sustainable energy system for future generations. There are many who continue to ignore or casually dismiss the scientific consensus about climate change. However, nobody can surely ignore the direct political and economic threat which dependence on fossil fuels poses. As far as Ireland is concerned, we unequivocally accept that climate change is a critical threat and it must be a defining issue for us. An immediate and large-scale reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is crucial. Unless we act now, terrible outcomes will be inevitable. We believe that Europe must push forward with its initiatives, including the European Green Deal and the sustainable finance agenda. </p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is ready to play our part. We have enacted legislation to put a legally binding target of reducing emissions by 2030 to 51% below 2018 levels. In taking the necessary steps, we must bring our citizens with us and ensure a just transition for all. Let us make sure that the regions which are most affected get a genuine opportunity to transition to a longer-term, more secure and more prosperous role in energy production. I remain confident that we can rise to this challenge. </p>
<p class="contents">In this, I am inspired by how we came together in the face of the largest pandemic the world has experienced in a century. Despite the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, and after some initially hesitant steps, the European Union quickly came together in an unprecedented way in support of its citizens, businesses and member countries, making it a role model for the world. We played a pivotal role in supporting vaccine development and procurement, becoming the leader internationally in the production and distribution of vaccines. Through Next Generation EU, the Member States and institutions came together in solidarity to address the economic impacts of the pandemic across our Union, supporting not just our collective recovery, but the green and digital transitions we need to bring resilience to our economies and our societies. There are hundreds of thousands of people alive today because of how we worked together to understand, control and target this terrible virus. However, there is no question that we were not fully prepared for the pandemic, and we had to innovate new policies rapidly. Our shared public health tracking and advice structures were not strong enough because we had not viewed this as a priority area. This is one of the many areas we should address as we look to reforming and strengthening the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is by no means perfect – it is a project that must continue to develop and evolve – and differences will arise between Member States and between the institutions. However, it is our capacity to work together through these issues that makes the European Union something to be immensely proud of. </p>
<p class="contents">Over the past two years, I have signalled at the Council that Ireland supports more ambition and urgency in developing the Union. We have rejected the idea that every debate must be a zero-sum fight between countries. And that is why, even though we are a net contributor, we supported a larger budget for the Union. The highly limited level of the budget means that the Union is often over-focused on a limited range of current or desired powers, at the expense of a more active agenda of enabling activity. </p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we need more investment in skills and research – the foundations for sustained prosperity for all our people. We have supported greater ambition on key reforms to fully address the policy gaps which caused so much damage during the financial crisis. </p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the Conference on the Future of Europe has begun an important dialogue on our shared future. The recommendations of the Conference include some very worthwhile suggestions that can be implemented quite quickly, as well as some that are more ambitious and wide ranging. </p>
<p class="contents">Let’s focus on building a Union which can directly enable action in critical areas, and by respecting important principles such as subsidiarity, we can have a more constructive debate. Our guiding principle should be, ‘how can we best prepare our Union to continue to meet the needs of its citizens into the future?’ Ireland is ready for this debate. We will work to constructively shape our new future and are open to treaty change if this proves necessary. We should first, however, do what we can within the existing framework. </p>
<p class="contents">We have in recent months and years started to face up to the reality of challenges to the core founding principles of our Union – and this is not just an economic bloc. The Treaties which we have all signed open up great opportunities for us all, but they also carry fundamental responsibilities. The Union cannot work if its members refuse to follow the laws which apply to us all. And the Union cannot have a purpose if we do not absolutely insist on protecting democratic and human rights in all of our countries. As John Hume said, ‘the basis of peace and stability in any society has to be the fullest respect for the human rights of all its people’. </p>
<p class="contents">For some time we have been going through what has been called a democratic recession in the world. There has been an attempt to push back against the idea that democracy and human rights are fundamental to sustained human progress. Every day we are seeing the terrible human price paid when a country’s leadership stops debate, closes down political competition, controls the economy and ends the rule of law. So as we learn the lessons of this moment, let’s understand that if we want the values of a free, democratic and prosperous Europe to survive and succeed, we have to speak up for these values – and we have to do so even when it’s uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="contents">Jean Monnet famously said that ‘Europe will be forged in crises and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises’. He has repeatedly been proven right. However, he missed an important extra element. Yes, we have constantly required a crisis in order to make major changes, but ultimately we are more and more seeing that if we want progress for Europe, it must be forged by its commitment to values. We must protect and strengthen these values. If we do this, we will remain a beacon of hope to others, especially to our fellow Europeans in Ukraine. </p>
<p class="contents">In our Union, we are better together, we are stronger together, we achieve most and best when we work together. Thank you very much indeed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we both know, membership of the European Union has been nothing short of life—changing for the people of Ireland over the last 50 years. That historic vote in May 1972 to join the European Communities changed the economic and social trajectory of the Irish State for the better. And as an Irish woman, I can unequivocally vouch for this positive change. The five decades have witnessed Ireland’s emergence as a modern, open economy and society, shaped by close, reciprocal cooperation with our European partners. We strongly endorse the European values of human rights, democracy, freedom of the press, and rule of law. The European Union is a beacon, a model, and an instrument for obtaining peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Fittingly, last night, as the Taoiseach said, we paid tribute to a committed European, a peacemaker, and a former member of this parliament, John Hume. We remember his outstanding work for peace and his resolute, determined stance against the use of violence in Ireland. He believed in and personified this institution, describing the EU as the most successful peace project in history. He believed in extensive dialogue to bring about peace. That approach is a hallmark of the EU’s efforts to resolve outstanding concerns within the protocol in Northern Ireland. The European way is to negotiate in good faith and we expect the same in return from the UK, not bad faith.</p>
<p class="contents">Taoiseach, you were right when you said it would be a historic low to break an international treaty. I also pay tribute to the commissioners Maroš Šefčovič, and before him Michel Barnier, for their efforts to resolve these issues. They have shown endless patience and resolve, and I want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow parliamentarians here in this House for their deep understanding of the consequences of Brexit and for their unwavering support for Ireland as a small Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The brutal Russian aggression and invasion of Ukraine illustrates the scale of the threat to multilateralism, to human decency and to the international rule of law. All Member States have a role to play in the future of defence and security policy. We must support one another. I believe that the future of Ukraine and other Eastern partners is within the EU. But I ask, is it good enough to say that your future lies in Europe, but that could be a generation away?</p>
<p class="contents">The issues facing Ireland today are mirrored across Europe. Ireland’s challenges are Europe’s challenges, and Europe’s opportunities are Ireland’s opportunities. Ireland and the EU must continue to defend democracy and the people of Ukraine. We must respond comprehensively to the current challenges of the cost of living crisis, the energy crisis, and work together as we have done during COVID. We are creating the future by the decisions made here today and through our engagement with our citizens. Ireland’s future is without doubt at the heart of Europe. <span class="italic">Éire go brách </span>and long live Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Parliament is very much concerned about the position of the UK Government on the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol and its impact on the Republic of Ireland, on Northern Ireland and on the UK and globally on the Good Friday Agreement. So I would like to ask you, can you elaborate further on your views on this matter?</p>
<p class="contents">And let me take the opportunity of having you here to address also a very different but also complex topic: tax competition. It endangers the so critical collection of resources that you referred to, Taoiseach. Let me say clearly, we welcome resoundingly the fact that the Republic of Ireland joined the OECD tax agreement on minimum corporate taxation. Nevertheless, as we all know, many other practices may still be used to decrease real taxation. Taoiseach, do you agree that the EU and the Member States should cooperate more to level the playing field on these matters?</p>

Laissez-moi vous assurer, de la part d’une famille politique très pro-européenne de ce Parlement, que nous sommes fiers de l’agenda résolument européen du gouvernement irlandais.</p>
<p class="contents">Comme nous pouvons compter sur l’Irlande pour défendre l’unité européenne, je voulais redire, cher Taoiseach, que les Irlandais peuvent compter sur Renew Europe et leurs députés, Barry Andrews et Billy Kelleher, pour défendre leurs intérêts, car, depuis quelque temps, les intérêts des Irlandais sont les intérêts de l’Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">En effet, nous voilà à nouveau confrontés bien malgré nous aux conséquences du Brexit. Nous savons, à Renew Europe, les inquiétudes des citoyens irlandais et nord-irlandais. Inquiet, je le serais aussi si mon marché, ma sécurité alimentaire ou pharmaceutique dépendaient de la constance de Boris Johnson. Mais, je vais vous le dire très clairement, nous défendons le protocole nord-irlandais. </p>
<p class="contents">Les Irlandais ne s’y trompent pas, y compris les Nord-Irlandais, qui ont à 56 % voté pour des partis favorables à cet accord. Peut-être que des accommodements sont possibles, mais ce n’est pas unilatéralement à Westminster – en violation, d’ailleurs, avec le droit international – de définir ce qui arrange ou ce qui n’arrange pas les Irlandais et l’Europe. L’Europe, elle, n’a qu’une parole. Elle n’a qu’une parole auprès des Irlandais et auprès des Britanniques.</p>
<p class="contents">Cher Taoiseach, je profite de notre échange pour vous interroger sur un sujet important pour notre groupe politique: les propositions des citoyens à l’issue de la conférence sur l’avenir de l’Europe. Nous appelons à une convention pour, si c’est nécessaire, faire évoluer nos traités. Cela nous semble essentiel pour enfin instaurer une initiative législative au Parlement et surtout pour mettre fin à un certain nombre d’éléments de décision, notamment l’unanimité sur certains points au Conseil. Un État ne peut plus bloquer les décisions qui affectent 450 millions d’Européens. </p>
<p class="contents">Alors une question: quelle est la position du gouvernement irlandais sur ces points-là et sur le lancement de cette conférence? Vous y avez un peu répondu, mais l’on souhaiterait – mon groupe politique, en tout cas – vous entendre un peu plus sur cette question.

Actually, when one looks at the history of your country, a history marred by war, occupation, famine, poverty, mass emigration, a global financial crisis which hit you like few other countries, one might expect a country of anger, bitterness, revenge.</p>
<p class="contents">And we have none of that, none of that, I’m really struck every time. And you embody that, every time I meet the Irish colleagues that we find at the same time, gravitas but also a sense of optimism towards the future and humility. There’s no grandstanding, it seems, in your country, you don’t need to grandstand to be great. And this is what I love so much about the contribution that your people are making to the European Union. And being future-oriented, an optimist to me comes out of your speech as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, not with big words, but let’s take one: ‘sovereignty’. Instead of looking at this concept, which means the ability to decide on your own, basically, instead of looking back towards the nation-state, you – and these are your words – said: ‘the European Union is an enabler of sovereignty’. It makes us more sovereign, contrary to what some in this House are saying.</p>
<p class="contents">What I like also – and this is a change from your predecessor and successor, who was also humble enough to recognise four years ago that Ireland was a laggard when it comes to the climate transition. And it’s true, Ireland was a laggard, but you embraced the new government, and indeed thanks to the participation of the Greens. But your support, your personal support as Taoiseach has embraced the green transition.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I do see the great plans and the commitments. Last year Ireland’s emissions grew by 6%, so we are still not there. There are still massive efforts to be made. But you and I see that the future of Europe’s prosperity lies in leading the transition rather than following, being laggards. We need to be leaders here if we want Europe to be prosperous.</p>
<p class="contents">A last point that I will make is to tell you that we will stand united and in solidarity with Ireland when it comes to preserving the Good Friday Agreement. We know that we are facing a British Government that we can’t trust, and I think that even his own party – well, many in his own party – recognise that he is not a trustworthy person. But we have to endure. We have to endure and find ways to keep peace in Ireland. And believe us, we are with you on this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Prima di tutto, è importante un coordinamento e un dialogo per rafforzare un punto in cui, a mio avviso, le Istituzioni europee sono un po' mancate in questo periodo difficile, che è la credibilità. Quando si affronta una sfida geopolitica, una sfida importante come quella che stiamo affrontando di fronte all'aggressione russa, la credibilità e l'unità sono due fattori di fondamentale importanza.</p>
<p class="contents">Purtroppo, a causa anche di errori strategici e di informazione che abbiamo commesso nel passato nel costruire la nostra Unione e il nostro modello, questa credibilità e questa unità le abbiamo viste pian piano mancare. Quindi è fondamentale che lavoriamo insieme, affinché non si creino blocchi distinti, come qualche volta stiamo vedendo nelle discussioni sulle emergenze. Riflettere sul perché e su come possiamo evitare questi errori nel futuro diventa fondamentale.</p>
<p class="contents">Decenni di dipendenza energetica dalla Russia, che sono stati una scelta politica fatta dall'Unione europea in passato, ci hanno reso deboli. Proprio oggi, quando questo Parlamento dovrà votare uno dei provvedimenti più importanti della prossima legislatura, dobbiamo fare tesoro dei nostri errori passati, per non ripeterli nel futuro.</p>
<p class="contents">La transizione energetica, su cui questa Commissione ha puntato molto in questa legislatura e su cui questo Parlamento sta lavorando da tempo, avrà successo se non sarà guidata dall'ideologia e se impareremo dai nostri errori del passato. In un momento in cui stiamo tentando di svincolarci dalla Russia, legarci mani e piedi a un'altra minaccia geopolitica, che è quella cinese, non è esattamente la strada giusta per rimodellare il futuro socioeconomico dell'Unione europea. Quindi invitiamo tutti a riflettere e a prendere una decisione strategica giusta sulla nostra autonomia, anche su questo pacchetto.</p>
<p class="contents">Chiudo sull'ultimo punto, molto importante. Oggi noi stiamo cercando di sostenere l'Ucraina e la sua popolazione di fronte a questa aggressione, e i cittadini europei hanno fatto un grande sforzo e stanno sopportando un grande sforzo a tal fine, però noi da tempo chiediamo che le Istituzioni europee si muovano concretamente perché il peso di questa ennesima crisi non ricada sui cittadini europei e sulle nostre imprese.</p>
<p class="contents">Di fronte alle sfide che stiamo affrontando – l'inflazione, l'aumento dei costi, la disoccupazionee la perdita di potere d'acquisto – è fondamentale che ci siano tre priorità per le Istituzioni europee: lavoro, lavoro, lavoro. Abbiamo una grande opportunità per plasmare il nostro nuovo modello futuro, che deve essere basato su un'autonomia che ci svincola dai regimi e che ci rende indipendenti nelle nostre scelte geopolitiche. Se non saremo in grado di plasmare questo sistema guardando agli errori del passato, purtroppo l'Unione europea rimarrà un attore geopolitico debole e che dipenderà sempre dagli altri. Grazie, contiamo su di voi.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The opposite happened: pull factors increased. The following decade meant a migration wave we’ve never seen before.

<p class="contents">Now, I understand that your government is pushing through a mass amnesty. For how many? No one seems to know. Taoiseach, have you looked at migration prognosis for the future? Ipsos tells us that 1.5 billion people would like to migrate if given the opportunity. The French Government estimates that 35—40% of those would choose Europe. That’s 500 million that would like to go to our continent if given the opportunity. The same as the whole EU population, Taoiseach.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa’s population is set to grow from 1.4 billion today to 4 billion at the end of this century, and there aren’t enough jobs.

<p class="contents">We are no closer to that vision, but it is worth holding on to. And I echo these sentiments in the hope that a similar approach underpins Ireland’s Council of Europe Presidency assumed recently. For, as we know, human rights are the core of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes in this institution we let economic considerations blind us to human rights violations. I refer specifically to the British Government, which daily shows its contempt for the rule of law and, in particular, international human rights law. They are renouncing the European Convention on Human Rights and actively undermining the Good Friday Agreement. Not only are they unilaterally rewriting the protocol, but also imposing one-sided legislation on the legacy of the conflict, providing an amnesty for crimes committed by state forces. The international community has and needs to continue to defend the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Taoiseach, could I remind you that human rights are often intertwined with social and economic rights? The rights of ordinary people to a home must trump the supposed rights of those who are pricing people out of the housing market or charging extortionate rents.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fundamental rights of any European must be the concern of every European, and in 1976, Ireland led by example. You took the UK to court for torturing detainees in Northern Ireland. It was an uphill fight, but time has shown that you were right. Yet decades later, we still see judges using evidence extracted by mistreating detainees. A recent ruling of the European Court of Human Rights ruled that a conviction of 17 years based on a confession extracted in isolation and without counsel was not a fair trial. The man was set free, but last week the Spanish Supreme Court disobeyed and sent him back to jail. </p>
<p class="contents">Spain’s disregard for the Strasbourg Court is astonishing. Eleven times they have been condemned for not investigating torture. But guess what? The judge that was blind to abuse and torture in six of these cases, the delinquent judge, Mr Grande-Marlaska, is now Security Minister in Spain. </p>
<p class="contents">Taoiseach, the tolerance of the EU authorities to Spanish human rights violation is alarming. We urge you to make your voice and speak clearly about that. We need to hear Ireland’s voice again. Please defend human rights for all Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Micheál Martin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Taoiseach</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Madam President, first of all could I thank all the Members for responding and for the points they have made. </p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member Frances Fitzgerald made a number of key points, not least on the transformative impact of European Union membership in Ireland, and particularly on women in Ireland, over the last 50 years. Also, you made a key point in relation to enlargement. I think you posed the question that if we say to countries ‘we want you to join’ and are opening the door, why does it take so long? My own view is that the enlargement process has taken far too long, and I think we need to have a fundamental reflection on this. </p>
<p class="contents">We were with the Western Balkans before Christmas last, and there is no reason why North Macedonia and Albania should not be members of the European Union now. In my view, we have to accelerate the process. We have to make a fundamental call as a Union, in terms of enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My own personal view, coming from where we are coming from – Ireland in 1973 – is that it has been transformative. There is no point in saying anything else. Because of that, I always feel it very difficult to put a barrier up against another country that wishes to join and that fulfils the criteria. That would be our view. We don’t think politics should get in the way, that localised or regionalised issues should get in the way of a country being allowed to join. I think it’s a key question. It’s a fundamental point that we should all reflect on. </p>
<p class="contents">The next issue was two points, from Pedro Marques I think, in relation to, first of all, the Protocol. You asked me to elaborate. I don’t think I have the time to elaborate fully, but what I would say is that if there was a Nobel Peace Prize for patience, Maroš Šefčovič would win hands down. I want to thank him for the role that he has played. But to say fundamentally where it’s at, is that Unionist politicians have raised legitimate questions, you know, issues around the operation of the Protocol, and we believe, the European Union, believes that it can resolve these issues. </p>
<p class="contents">But the fundamental question remains as to what the British Government’s ultimate position is. That’s why I referred in my opening address to the absence of political will. I just simply do not detect a sustained political will on behalf of the UK Government to settle this and resolve this, because it without question can be resolved. The more fundamental concern I have is on the overall stability of the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement and the spirit that informs that. I said earlier, you know, that it took a lot of work from a lot of people to get the Good Friday Agreement over the line, and therefore we should all be very, very careful in doing anything that could undermine that. I feel the UK Government is not giving due consideration to the totality of what’s involved in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On tax competition, again Ireland was very constructive and cooperative in terms of the OECD process, and we signed up to that. As a country, we continue to engage at international level in all fora in relation to tax issues. But the more fundamental issue that we find now in terms of foreign direct investment coming into Ireland is the talent question. Most companies are in search of talent or ability and so on. </p>
<p class="contents">That speaks to the question of migration that a colleague also spoke about and questioned, asserted that there was an amnesty in Ireland. There’s no amnesty in Ireland, but we do believe that if the undocumented are undocumented for a long period of time, they need to have their lives regularised, to have their lives resolved and become full citizens of Ireland. That’s what we’re doing. </p>
<p class="contents">I just would make the point in terms of the question around migration that the reason President Biden is President of the United States is because of an enormous migratory trail from Ireland to the United States after the famine and throughout the 19th century. We are the last country to start condemning migration or to take a very narrow perspective on migration, and that is our position on that. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the transformative things in Ireland today is the multiculturalism of modern Ireland, that so many citizens have come from within Europe and beyond Europe to live in Ireland. I was taken by what Philippe said earlier that there is still that generosity of spirit in Ireland, and that engagement, and long may that continue. We have to work at that. There are always challenges around that, and I take on board the nice comments you made in terms of humility and gravitas and so on – although the city I come from in Ireland, people don’t normally associate us with humility or modesty, but that’s an internal Irish matter!</p>
<p class="contents">I do take your point on climate change. It’s about delivery now. We have passed the legislation. I think what we have done though is put the template in place and the foundations for fundamental change into the future. The real challenge is delivery and really getting political consensus on delivery. I am passionately committed to this, and to the restoration of biodiversity as well. We’ve a journey to travel, but we’re committed to doing it and the legal framework is in place. </p>
<p class="contents">If I say so, offshore wind will be a very big development in Ireland over the next decade or so and we will be a net exporter of energy in the mid—2030s because of the fact that we have a lot of wind around our coast, with seas seven times the land mass of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of Stéphane’s point on the Conference on the Future of Europe, we are very open – and I’m very open to the idea of treaty change on the basis of the enlargement question. If we enlarge, we have to work out how we manage and operate the Union more efficiently and more effectively. We can’t operate with all the rules as the Union enlarges itself. So we’re very much in favour of really pursuing that particular issue and being open to change in terms of how we do things within the Council, the Parliament’s right to initiative and so forth. </p>
<p class="contents">I would have a strong belief in public health, for example. I was a former Minister for Health. I witnessed how in every domain every nationalist said we can’t allow our health systems or whatever to be the competency of, or to move to Europe, and so on. But, as we saw during the pandemic, public health, as a discipline within the broader health arena, really is a European competency. </p>
<p class="contents">The HERA initiative and all of that is essential to the future of public health across Europe. When I was a Minister for Health, there was no chance of procuring vaccines. Not a chance. It was so discordant and so forth. So to me it was a marvel to see Europe procure vaccines, enable the production of vaccines, and become the largest donor of vaccines in the world, for which the European Union doesn’t get credit. It is the largest donor, and the most consistent donor of vaccines. </p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the energy transition, and I think Marco Zanni made the point in relation to the geopolitical situation and ties to China, the war on Ukraine is causing us all to reflect very deeply on how we develop relationships into the future, how we maintain them in terms of the rule of law, values and democracy. I think there’s going to be a period of forward reflection in terms of how we engage with others who also transgress the fundamental values in our system. </p>
<p class="contents">I think I’ve dealt with the migration issue. Suffice to say that we need to work much harder on climate change, on a whole range of issues, to reduce the necessity for migration and to enable sustainability within many countries in the neighbourhood of Europe and in Africa in terms of economic sustainability, social sustainability, climate sustainability. That’s ultimately the way that we have a proper balanced approach to these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Chris MacManus’s point, again I was at the Council of Europe yesterday, met with the Secretary—General, also visited the European Court of Human Rights, which has a strong resonance for Ireland because of our history and because of the work it did in terms of Northern Ireland, and also in the Airey case, for example, which was fundamental in terms of access to legal aid, not just for Ireland but for the entirety of Europe in terms of that decision, and also the Norris case and LGBTQ rights, and the Louise O’Keeffe case. So we have a strong affinity with that. </p>
<p class="contents">Again, what was interesting is that the United Kingdom Government has nothing to fear from the European Court of Human Rights. In fact, it has one of the lowest number of cases against it. It seems to be very determined to create problems where problems don’t really exist. So we’re very committed to that, and again, on a more general level, in terms of tolerance of any violation of human rights, we are very strong on human rights as a country. We want to be and we will continue to play our part at European Union level in advancing and human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank you all very much for your contributions. It has been a privilege and an honour for me to address you as Taoiseach, and I look forward to engaging with you in the time ahead. </p>
