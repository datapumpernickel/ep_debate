<p class="contents">As you know, the members of the WTO have not been able to find a solution within the time set, which was the end of 2002, to the problems encountered by developing countries which do not have the capacity to produce medicines, since the debate concerned that exact problem following the agreements signed in Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has put a great deal of effort into searching for a solution. We are adopting, and that has always been the basis for our position, an approach which, on the one hand, allows reduced-price medicines, including generic medicines, to reach those who need them, and on the other, allows the pharmaceutical industry to continue to invest in research.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to reach a balanced result, first of all because we need to solve what is a substantial, in some cases tragic, social problem in many developing countries, and secondly because this situation clearly weighs heavily on the climate of trust that needs to reign around the table of the WTO in order for progress to be made in the Doha negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore worked very hard to try to find a solution that is both legally sound and sustainable, by refusing a moratorium on the regulation of differences of opinion as a solution to this question and rejecting any ideas of derogation from the outset. We do not feel that either of these two methods fulfils these two conditions of soundness and sustainability. We therefore cannot accept the current situation which is either failure or half-measures such as the moratorium, even though this half-measure provides a temporary solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s position remains the same. We need to find a multilateral solution as quickly as possible, a sustainable, fair, solution which provides a sufficient degree of legal security for all the players to be able to join forces.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have fully accepted the draft agreement of 16 December that was on the table. We found that it was reasonable and balanced and that it fulfilled the Doha mandate, and that is why, like the overwhelming majority of the members of the WTO, we were won over by it.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of scope as regards the various types of health problem still remains. We know that only the Americans have been unable to join the consensus on this point. This situation, I have said this publicly and I repeat it to you now, is deeply regrettable, and this obstacle must be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to the Union that the Doha mandate is intentionally broad and that we must respect this. In case of a serious public health problem, and I reiterate the terms of the Doha Declaration, the WTO mechanism allowing generic medicines to be imported can and must be activated.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore seeking an agreement that can go further, given the scope provided by Doha, including the assumption henceforth recognised by all that diseases such as AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and a whole list of others would be covered as a general principle, and that is why we have suggested involving the WHO, which has undisputed experience in the field of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">We did so on the basis of a list which I would like to specify is neither exclusive nor restrictive. We feel that the use of the system should not be limited to the diseases on this list. There must be no misunderstanding on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">For any other serious public health problem, in the event of doubt over the basis for the measure, a member of the WTO could request a medical opinion from the World Health Organisation. This possibility of requesting an opinion should allow the United States to overcome their reticence with regard to the use of the system by developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This would simply be a non-restrictive opinion. There again, I would specify that this would in no way constitute an attack on the sovereignty of the Member States in the field of public health. We all know that the role of the WHO is, at least currently, purely advisory.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective, in placing this proposal on the table at the beginning of January, has been achieved. Discussions have begun again. Our proposal acts as a basis for these discussions and we are going to do all we can, as we have over the past few months, to convince the members of the WTO of the need for a compromise that is as close as possible to that of 16 December. We must make progress. Too many countries need to import low-cost medicines. We know that the temporary measure that enables them to do so today is not permanent, and from that point of view we do not want to and cannot disappoint them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is only just over a week since Parliament, at first reading, voted by a large majority in favour of a new regulation on combating HIV, malaria and tuberculosis in the poor countries of the world. We had been working on this issue for almost a year. The debate focused sharply upon the uneven struggle waged in the vast majority of poor countries between, on the one hand, the spread of serious infectious diseases and, on the other hand, access to the resources available both for preventing that spread and for helping people who have been affected and have fallen ill.</p>
<p class="contents">A large problem in this connection is the fact that such a small portion of the world’s health research is directed precisely at those diseases that strike such a large proportion of the world’s population. The reason for this is, of course, that a great many pharmaceutical companies see no real profitability in this type of research. That is why we must seek innovative solutions. The market alone will not manage successfully to solve this problem. What, instead, is required is cooperation between the public aid organisations and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem touched upon in the debate was the current imbalance within TRIPS and the WTO when it comes to the possibility, in special situations, of having recourse to what are known as compulsory licences. I am naturally aware of the negotiations in which the Commissioner has been involved. I can only regret that nothing has been achieved in the way of results. This is an incredibly important issue. The countries most dependent upon these exemption rules in the TRIPS Agreement are now in a position in which they are being discriminated against.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself believe that, ideally, those countries in the South that lack production capacity should be treated in precisely the same way as countries in Europe or North America. The compromise that Commissioner Lamy is now trying to bring about contains a list. I think this list appears to be fine, but ideally, of course, there would be no need for any list at all. If we are now nonetheless to be heading towards a compromise, I think that what you have accomplished so far is commendable. I also think that the link with the WHO is an interesting idea. I believe I can guarantee that you have Parliament’s unqualified support in your endeavours to achieve a positive outcome, so that action can be taken on this issue too and, above all, so that the whole Doha process can continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Because what hopefully will be some form of solution will be in the nature of a compromise, I also think it would be entirely reasonable to establish a deadline, for example a couple of years from now, by which this compromise should have been evaluated so that we can really see if it is operating well and, if it is not, can develop and improve it.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to say that it is incredibly unfortunate that we have ended up in this position. I find it incomprehensible that there is actually opposition on this issue. I can understand the concern about the existence of cheating and parallel imports, but these are general problems that it should be possible to solve and that should preferably not take precedence over the health care situation in the world’s poor countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Developing countries' perception of our good faith, good will and sincerity towards them will be tested by our attitude to these two issues. As we know, binding agreement was reached in the form of the Doha Declaration, paragraph 6 of which highlighted the difficult issue of WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector, who could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS agreement. The Council for TRIPS was asked to find an expeditious solution to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we welcome the efforts you have made and the backing you have had to get this implemented. In an innovative and welcome suggestion you enlist the aid of the World Health Organisation. If the intention is not honoured, the new constraints would violate the spirit of the Doha Declaration and would show bad faith. I am sure you are right – and we have had discussions about this – to reject a moratorium on disputes or, indeed, a derogation. Neither is an adequate solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The behaviour of the United States, not just on this issue but also - and far more seriously in some ways - on the issue of Iraq, is becoming increasingly difficult to understand. Indeed, the only possible explanation is its politicians paying undue attention to the financial interests of pharmaceutical companies who paid for their election. They have come up with only a unilateral solution and a narrow list. This is inadequate!</p>
<p class="contents">Two deadlines have been missed already, and there is a real risk of deadlock if the efforts which we have channelled through you come to nothing. Concerns which have been raised, for example on the diversion trade in generic medicines, are being tackled. Hence the regulation by the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us welcome your proposal of 7 January. It is a multilateral solution which enlists a reputable and widely trusted agency, the World Health Organisation. As you said, the solution must be lasting, fair and legally viable. The conflict should be examined on the basis of the guideline that public health has primacy over patents. We cannot overestimate the importance of finding a solution to this issue. I wish you very good luck, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, in this debate it is perhaps worth citing once again what the Doha Declaration actually says. I quote: 'The TRIPS agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health', and it: 'can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' rights, to protect human health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all'. It is worth bearing in mind those words and repeating them for the record, particularly for the consumption of US observers. I doubt they are listening right now, but perhaps we can send them a copy of the Minutes of this stimulating discussion later on.</p>
<p class="contents">The US position is not just contrary to the spirit of the Doha Declaration: it directly contravenes the letter of the Doha Declaration. As such, it is a slap in the face for all developing countries which invested so much hope in the Doha Declaration and in the objectives of the Doha development round. It represents a spectacular assertion of narrow and misguided commercial interests over the greater prize of a development round itself. It is worth making that clear because if you then consider the commercial interests at stake, it becomes even more incomprehensible why the US is single-handedly blocking agreement in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to quote a press release from the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. It states that: 'over 95% of all medicines on the WHO drugs essential list are off-patent, and studies show that there are relatively few patents on AIDS drugs in Africa'. In other words, that statistic alone suggests there is very little commercial risk for either the European pharmaceuticals industry, or the US industry itself. It is all the more frustrating to watch these deadlines being missed – even applying the logic of their own commercial self-interest – as a particular sector in the US blocks progress in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">My group strongly supports the initiatives taken by Commissioner Lamy and the European Commission. We sympathise with his position and ask why it is that the US pharmaceuticals industry seems to have been able to marshal US government support in backing its irrational reaction to the EU proposal. Unilateralism with a reason is just about comprehensible. Unilateralism without any logic whatsoever is unforgivable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out several inconsistencies: as a doctor and a teacher, I am aware of the range of reports presented each year by the World Health Organisation, which always cite the famous Horowitz vicious circle, according to which illness creates poverty and poverty creates illness. We therefore have to break this vicious circle by helping to eradicate diseases – amongst other things – because the eradication of disease increases economic capacity and that helps to put countries in a position to produce, to have their own industry, and helps to provide access to these medicines for the people who need them. We are therefore talking about a duty in which we have a high degree of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also regrettable – as other speakers have said – that the unilateral position of the United States in this regard is having a bearing on one of the most negative aspects of the process of neoliberal globalisation we are suffering, which consists of increasing inequalities and hindering and weakening the situation of the countries with fewest resources. We therefore have to understand that it is the European Union, which is based on a desire for peace, development and solidarity, which can introduce elements to ensure a rebalance within the context of this neoliberal process of globalisation which is under way in order to provide it with the elements which – as has been said during the previous debate – arose from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that the European Union’s efforts to make the World Health Organisation an organisation with the authority to be able to indicate the necessary health situations at any particular time to be appropriate, and we therefore support Mr Lamy’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In November 2001, the developing countries were rejoicing in the Doha Declaration, which authorised them to have recourse to compulsory licences for public health reasons. There is just one cloud on the horizon: countries with no production capacity must have the medicines they need manufactured in another country and a company may only manufacture a medicine if 51% of its production is intended for the national market.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem in paragraph 6 should have been solved before the end of 2002. It has still not been solved. In the meantime, the American pharmaceutical laboratories, who are the main financial backers for the Bush campaign, have returned to the attack. The proposals made by the United States or the European Union, which are each more restrictive than the last, have resulted in failure. Today, the Trips Council is proposing to return to the previous wording allowing recourse to compulsory licences in urgent cases, a solution that proved inapplicable and led to the Doha Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of paragraph 6 must be to ensure that countries with no production capacity can genuinely use compulsory licences. On the contrary, however, some proposals create discrimination between first-class countries with a production capacity and second-class countries with no production capacity, which are, in fact, the poorest countries. The former will be able to use compulsory licences to manufacture any medicine that responds to a public health problem that they themselves have identified, whereas the latter will have to prove that they are experiencing a national situation of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, in theory, all countries may have recourse to compulsory licences, in practice, the poorest countries will have to fight to have urgent situations recognised, obtain their licence and have their medicines manufactured. This proposal is unacceptable and I would ask you, Mr Lamy, to propose a solution that is genuinely beneficial to developing countries so that health takes precedence over profit, as you yourself said so well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is that there are 42 million people in the world today suffering from the AIDS virus, yet we have the technology and the treatments available to combat diseases such this. However, people in the developing countries cannot afford to pay the exorbitant prices for the medicines needed to treat sufferers of AIDS and other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. If we are to provide these medicines to those who need them, we have to override the intellectual property rights of companies who have patented the technology to combat these diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">We can achieve this by reaching an agreement between all contracting parties at the level of the World Trade Organisation. The crux of the discussions is the relationship between intellectual property rights and public health issues. If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms, then the cost of these medicines will be substantially reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">We all recall the much publicised court case brought by 40 pharmaceutical companies against the South African Government on this issue. We have a moral obligation to support the effort of finding the way to provide urgently needed medicines to people in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a matter for the World Trade Organisation, but progress, I regret, is far too slow. Last November, the European Union presented a compromise proposal to the WTO ministerial meeting in Australia to find a solution to this important matter. However, it now appears that the US Government is just not satisfied with the terms of this compromise. The US Government believes that too many diseases are included in the European Union's proposal. Too many diseases are included they say, when in the meantime people are dying from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Over three million people will die from AIDS this year alone. The technology is there to provide suitable treatment to sufferers of this disease. Intellectual property rights will have to be put to one side so that we can alleviate the suffering of millions of people who will die needlessly, if we do not find an urgent solution to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On a separate but related matter, I have called on the members of the international community many times to increase their budgets to combat the AIDS epidemic. In fact, debt relief programmes must be put in place for developing countries with high levels of AIDS sufferers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle of solidarity applies not just within the Union but also to the people of less developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union upheld this concept when, in the face of United States obstruction, it took the initiative and authorised the importation and use of generic and low-cost medicines for underprivileged communities. As a rapporteur to Parliament on directives relating to medicines, I have worked on directives concerning the authorisation of the marketing of medicines within the European Union. I am therefore well aware of the issues involved. I understand that it is important to strike a satisfactory balance between research and generic medicines, between data protection and the price of the medicine and between innovation and authorised copying.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not however wish to revisit these issues today, nor do I wish to delve into the issue raised by a number of countries, namely whether the right to health should take precedence over the right to patent. In certain circumstances, this issue can be resolved quite easily. Do we have the right to let people waste away? Do we have the right to allow people to die when they could be treated? This would amount to failing to help a person in danger. In accordance with the principle of equal access to medicines and therefore to health, I would urge the European Union to use all its influence to support these authorisations. At the same time, the Union should however ensure that a specific framework is created and that the process is completely transparent. I believe it would be helpful for the World Health Organisation to act as arbiter in this, and would like to adduce three reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, effective measures should be implemented to prevent the parallel importation into the European Union of generic medicines destined for developing countries. If such controls are not introduced, the people we wish to help will not receive the medicines destined for them. Furthermore, such parallel imports would undermine the quality health system we wish to develop within the European Union. The relevant authority should draw up a permanent register of generic medicines destined for developing countries to ensure the effectiveness of such controls. I hope this list will evolve over time as new diseases appear, in order to increase the efficiency of product distribution and quality control frameworks. As for the quality of these medicines, we know that they are not third-rate products. On the contrary, we know that they are just as effective as other medicines. Making such products available, however, could only be one aspect of curing disease and fighting the epidemics we are trying to curb.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, the provision of local infrastructures, control laboratories and training for professionals is in fact just as important as making these products available. For all these reasons, I think the WHO should take on the essential role of guarantor for the process of making medicines available to all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ultimately the deciding factor turned out to be developing countries’ access to cheap medicines without paying for patents, either by their own production or by importing them. Ultimately the political breakthrough came. All developing countries can now establish when they are having a serious health crisis or problem and nothing is preventing them, not even the TRIPs agreement, from buying or producing cheap medicines. That applies to all developing countries and all medicines. There are no restrictions, and no external prior approval is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The assignment was to round this off in a legally conclusive text. This should have been done in December 2002, but it failed because the USA, in my opinion, was no longer adopting a multilateral position. I believe President Bush trampled all over the Doha agreement in favour of his own pharmaceutical industry. Commissioner Lamy, you have always told us that you are negotiating on behalf of the whole of Europe and that you accept the European Parliament as possessing powers of democratic control and codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, this is an important point for the Group of the Party of European Socialists – and, when I listen to my fellow-Members, for many other groups too. We should like to say that you enjoy our full support, but we do not wish to bow under pressure from the USA any further. So: this far and no further. We want no restrictions on countries, no restrictions on the types of medicines, nor any prior approval by an external authority. That is naturally a little different from the advice from the WHO. We do support stringent measures to protect our own European market against dumping, however.</p>
<p class="contents">With more than 90% of AIDS patients in developing countries, we want Europe to unambiguously decide which side it is on and to strictly limit itself to a solution in line with the political Doha agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge other groups in this Parliament to vote accordingly. The interests of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria patients worldwide must be at centre stage. Not commerce. Necessity knows no law. The TRIPS agreements must not be a limiting factor. As the PSE Group we are convinced that if this point fails, Doha will be keelhauled and Cancun will have failed before it even starts. Then there will be no development round! And that is the last thing that the world will permit in the current, very serious crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are taking this clear stance. Having heard my fellow-Members Mr Wijkman, Mr Clegg and Mrs McNally and many others, I think that Parliament is on the point of making a clear judgment and giving Commissioner Lamy, who, as he has understood, enjoys our full support, a powerful mandate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group is of the opinion that Commissioner Lamy has taken some excellent initiatives with a view to making healthcare more easily accessible, including in the poorest countries and specifically in those countries that do not have their own production capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to put forward one criticism, although I agree with all the things that have been said here. Access to medicines is not only a question of money. There are two other issues that I would like to raise.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly the infrastructure in the countries concerned, and in this case I am talking about distribution and about which people in those countries get access to these medicines. Distribution means that there must be an infrastructure, something that is completely absent in many poor countries. What is even worse: this is not a priority for the regimes in the countries concerned. For example, a person taking AIDS medicines has to take them up to three times a day every day. This means that they have to stick rigidly to their treatment regime and that distribution channels are therefore needed to ensure that the patients concerned can always obtain their medicines. If this does not happen, the remedy will be worse than the disease, because people will become resistant to these diseases and that will ultimately work its way through to Western countries as well. Then new medicines will have to be developed. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that regimes are often, in fact, corrupt. In such cases it turns out that the only medicines that are made available are the ones we have exported to these countries at low tariffs or the ones that can be produced there without patents, and even then they are only available to the better-off and not to the poorest population groups for whom we had intended them. What is more, they are sometimes re-exported or simply exported to Western countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, things are progressing at this moment, although diseases are progressing even faster. It is precisely this race, against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, that we must try to win. Attempts are actually being made to set up basic healthcare systems in many countries, in which, in fact no such things once existed, and the European Union must not be found wanting in this. It is the case that there was a time when treating people who became sick despite prevention – which, let us be honest, is not perfect even today – was an unachievable ideal. For the first time, however, there is hope that people – even those who are HIV positive – can in fact improve their lives and the quality of their lives if they have access to medicines. It is therefore of the utmost importance that you succeed in your assignment, Commissioner. All of us here in the European Parliament support you in your endeavour to ensure that disease can be overcome, even in countries which do not have the resources to do so themselves. The failure of Doha does, however, make us pessimistic. I hope that you will be able to tell us that we can revert to our own proposals, but I am also prepared to give your compromise a chance because I think that it is reasonable, although I find it too paternalistic.

Unfortunately, once drug companies – even with the best intention to alleviate suffering – allowed their products and intellectual property rights to be semi-confiscated under the guise of becoming available on affordable terms in developing countries, it was inevitable that all sorts of complications would arise.</p>
<p class="contents">These include definitions of what constitutes a measure to protect public health and is, therefore, subject to the compulsory licensing requirements allowed under TRIPS. Initially, the communicable diseases of HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB were included, but now there are plans to extend this list if the WHO thinks it appropriate. As these countries become more developed, more western diseases will become endemic, and a case will be made to extend the categories even further.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, as more migrants come to Europe, diseases such as the three above will become more common. This will create markets for these drugs and lead to enormous market-driven pressures for parallel re-importation by unscrupulous middlemen from LDCs, which produce them cheaply as generics. This will undercut the profits of legitimate pharmaceutical industries.</p>
<p class="contents">It also appears that the exemptions discriminate against smaller countries which lack the manufacturing base to produce the required life-saving drugs under compulsory licences. How much simpler it would have been if we had been more robust in defending the rights of drug companies to maintain their patent rights all over the world and then negotiated some differences in pricing, according to what the markets could actually bear and, at the same time, insisted that the burden of the drugs bill be picked up by and large by aid packages rather than by raiding the shareholder capital of the major pharmaceuticals. If there are to be reduced profits for the pharmaceuticals, my country, the UK, will suffer disproportionately, as it is a major employer and export-earner, and many of our pension funds are heavily invested in this sector. After all, many developing countries - even if the drugs were free - do not have the infrastructures to administer the treatments. Besides, profits are essential to fund further innovative research and development in the future, even into orphan drugs for rare tropical illnesses, which are of little interest in the West at present. At the very least, I call for a three-yearly review in future to see how this TRIPS agreement works out in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reality is that developing countries will not accept the United States' insistence on restricting exports to those who treat only a handful of infectious diseases. I fear also that, even if the United States concedes, the reforms will be wrapped up in red tape and have some TRIPS-plus features.</p>
<p class="contents">We should now consider a fresh start that is likely to produce a workable solution, although I accept, regrettably, that this is unlikely. The danger is that this whole issue could drag on until Cancun. If this were to happen, then the TRIPS issues could then again be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations on agriculture, services and the new issues.

They therefore took it upon themselves to oblige the pharmaceutical laboratory concerned to provide the medicines more cheaply. Had the laboratory refused to do this, the United States authorities would have resorted to a compulsory licence. I would remind you that, at that time, no one required the United States to consult the World Health Organisation first to check if anthrax was on the list of diseases deemed to be admissible in this case. The United States was not required to negotiate the conditions for the potential production of such a generic medicine. Why then are certain developing countries now being required to do so?</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to my second point. I believe Mr Clegg was right to cite the Doha declaration. I think my fellow Members were right to remind us that an undertaking was implemented and that this undertaking should be respected. According to the undertaking nothing in the interpretation of the agreements on intellectual property should prevent developing countries and WTO member countries from tackling their public health needs, whether or not they have the capacity to produce medicines. These countries should therefore be allowed to make their own decisions on this. Those with the capacity to produce medicines should be able to decide the circumstances in which they might need to resort to compulsory licences. Those without the capacity to produce medicines should be able to decide the circumstances in which they might need to resort to parallel imports. These imports would be legal, as they would be sanctioned by the state. Mr Rod and Mr Wijkman are therefore right, as are others like Mr Van den Berg, when they say that we would be imposing on the poorest countries conditions which do not apply to industrialised countries or to developing countries with the capacity to produce medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are now faced with the difficult task of finding a simple and effective solution to the problem. Any solution must not entail long and costly negotiations and procedures. The latter would eventually cost the lives of millions of sick people who would die without access to treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard that our fellow Member, Mr Tannock, is more concerned about the possible fall in the profits of certain industries than the fate of the sick. Mr Lamy, you are clearly under pressure from certain quarters, including the European industries. I urge you not to give way to these pressures! Please speak for the people of Europe. The people want us to help the sick in developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just last month, Commissioner Lamy proposed a pragmatic solution which, in his view, is workable, sustainable and legally secure, because it complies with both the Doha mandate and the compromise text of 16 December 2002 that was discussed within the WTO. The EU initiative covers the most comprehensive possible list of major infectious diseases but is not restrictive, which was the main problem with the negotiations in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy's list includes: yellow fever, plague, cholera, meningitis, dengue, influenza, hepatitis, polio, typhoid fever, typhus and measles. These are all horrendous diseases that have been virtually eradicated in the West, yet millions die unnecessarily in the Third World every year. The Lamy strategy would save lives, and pharmaceutical companies will not be losing revenue because the people in these countries are too poor to buy the medication as it stands. The debilitating effect of these diseases affects families, communities and economies throughout the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">This EU initiative should help to improve the standard of living and public health in some, if not all, of the developing world. However, it is essential that a mechanism is constructed to deal with the other public health issues and potential outbreaks, and not just the diseases listed in the compromise deal.</p>
<p class="contents">The list proposed by Commissioner Lamy is not restrictive – WTO members could ask for World Health Organisation guidance for any other serious public health problems which may arise in the future or are not covered by the list as it stands. This gives the EU proposal some flexibility to respond to unforeseen outbreaks. The response will be based on World Health Organisation expertise in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise proposal, which is more humane that the US approach, should allay US concerns that patent laws could be breached and weakened. At the same time, it provides sufficient flexibility to deal with specific disease-related crises, should they occur.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate will hopefully send a strong message of support for the Lamy proposal, as the WTO General Council simultaneously discusses the subject. It is important to help the developing world to eradicate these diseases without depriving the pharmaceutical industry of the funding it needs for further research in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This comes on the eve of another ministerial meeting at which specific political positions on the matter might be sealed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am however concerned about the declaration of the Council for TRIPS. It means going back on the undertakings we gave at Doha. Access to generic medicines for developing countries is not just a commercial issue. It is at the heart of development the world over. If we do not make progress on this question, all our other efforts to promote development will be in vain. We would be wasting our time.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieved in difficult circumstances, the Doha declaration on public health of November 2001 was an important first step towards helping the populations of developing countries and promoting their interests. We looked forward to at last sending a message of hope to those people. In December 2002 however, opposition to the agreement, for which the United States was entirely responsible, clearly demonstrated that the interests of the pharmaceutical industry took precedence over the health of millions of people.</p>
<p class="contents">This stance is not merely unfortunate. It is unacceptable and inadmissible, given that as my fellow Member Mr Désir outlined, the United States was prepared to suspend the Bayer patent in October 2001, because they were experiencing an anthrax attack, which was obviously a matter of greater urgency for them.</p>
<p class="contents">We should welcome the efforts of the Commission to reach an agreement on access to medicines. Nonetheless, the Commission is still failing to take enough account of the legitimate demands of poor countries. This comes as we are about to retain the division of countries into a first and a second class, as if the deaths in some regions were less important than deaths in others.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement must recommence at the earliest opportunity. The lives of millions of people in developing countries are at stake. I am convinced agreement could be obtained on the basis of the Doha declaration and Article 30 of the ADPIC agreement, and on that basis alone. An agreement achieved on any other basis, that did not take account of Article 30, would extinguish the hopes of the people of developing countries. They want to lift themselves out of poverty and improve their worsening living conditions, conditions that are increasingly unacceptable. Such an agreement would also send a clear message to the people of Europe. It could be a fine example of the basis on which the European Union works and of the extent of our concern for others.</p>

The copyright must be valid in the country in which it is sold; that is to say, it must have been registered and granted there. Of course, things can always be manufactured in a country where there is no copyright on them, and there must be doubt as to whether, although they clearly bring benefits, the medicinal products have actually been patented in every country around the world; I really cannot imagine that they have been, but should that indeed be the case, it follows that compulsory licensing is the ideal approach when it comes to giving help quickly and in a consistent way. We must ask ourselves, though, what happens if a compulsory licence is actually granted. Will it solve all our problems? What about prevention and complete recovery?</p>
<p class="contents">I think it self-evident that medicinal products need to be developed further, and that we have to focus primarily on creating incentives for research, rather than simply allowing ourselves to reduce the issue to patent rights and licences. When, moreover, the copyright has expired and compulsory licences have been granted, we politicians, too, will bear responsibility for universities and industry having incentives to carry out research.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important step in the right direction would be to put out public invitations to tender several times in a given year, to safeguard the fundamental principle that sufferers from disease really should get the most modern and the most effective medication available. For if, in future, research in this area of medicinal products, and the marketing of them, ceases to be a viable business proposition, we will be faced with the problem of being able to offer medicinal products that may well be cheap, but are not as effective as they might be. What do we do then? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first like to thank the representatives of all the groups who have expressed their support for the position I have adopted on behalf of the Commission. I have noted the statements made by Mr Wijkman, Mrs McNally, Mr Clegg, Mr Marset Campos and Mrs Maes in particular. The European Parliament is firmly united on this issue. This is very important for us at the Commission, it is important to me and it is important in the field of external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the issue of the use of compulsory licences by countries with a pharmaceutical industry to obtain benefit from differentiated prices and lower prices was settled at Doha. On that occasion we did not however settle the issue of countries which have to resort to imports. This implies that the system of compulsory licensing could be applied across international boundaries, giving rise to complicated legal problems.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is currently dealt with on a provisional basis. All developing countries can at present use a compulsory licensing system to obtain benefit from differentiated prices. This applies to medicines to treat diseases like AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and certain other diseases. This is possible because of the provisional arrangement that the United States and the European Union implemented in December. This provisional arrangement is simply not enough however. We think it is unlikely to galvanise all the parties involved. These parties are the governments concerned, their health systems and the pharmaceutical industry. A long-term solution must therefore be found. None has so far emerged from the discussions taking place in Geneva, because of the American position. Further evidence of this was provided at the Council on TRIPS this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reassure Mrs Kinnock on one point. The issue of access to medicines is not on the Doha negotiating programme due to be concluded at the end of 2004. It does not feature amongst the fifteen subjects we decided to discuss. The issue falls beyond the scope of these negotiations and will therefore not be the subject of any kind of trade-off. It stands alone as a subject in its own right and on the table of the World Trade Organisation. This issue is not linked to the rest of the negotiations by virtue of the agenda but because it testifies to the capacity of the World Trade Organisation to instil confidence in its members. Consequently, when it comes to discussing the question of whether the compulsory licensing system should be used for Viagra or for medicines to treat toothache for example, members have the confidence to prevent the discussions degenerating into a legal battle. I am simply referring to this particular example because I have read about it in the press. This all amounts to a major problem for the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder why the pharmaceutical industry has adopted the position it has. The latter resulted in the United States rejecting the compromise on the table in December. I have to say that I am completely baffled. I did not understand the position that the American pharmaceutical industry took in South Africa either, and I also failed to understand the position it adopted when it very nearly caused a stand-off between the United States and Brazil, until the United States Government saw the light. I just cannot understand its attitude. Its stance will only strengthen opposition to the principle of intellectual property across a large number of sectors. In truth, it is easy to present this conflict between health and profits in such a way that, little by little, if the American pharmaceutical industry continues as it has been doing, there will be sound political reasons for starting work on agreements on intellectual property. This time the determination will be there.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge those of you who have some influence in this field to use this argument to try to convince these people that their attitude will not get them where they want to be, but will lead them in the opposite direction. The United States would do well to consider an example of how to reach a consensus when circumstances make this imperative. They could study the attitude adopted by the European Union recently towards the Kimberly process on the subject of blood diamonds. This may be a less high profile case, but it is nonetheless important, especially for certain developing countries. We Europeans were isolated in the World Trade Organisation. We were the only party reluctant to ask the WTO for a dispensation to implement the Kimberly agreements. We stood alone and eventually decided to go along with the consensus because we did not want to stand in the way of this solution. We shall do so by coming up with our own interpretation of the articles of the WTO. The United States could perfectly well adopt the same approach on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of parallel imports raised by several Members, I am sure you will be aware that the Commission has put forward a proposal for the European Union. The Council is currently studying the proposal. Those of you with an interest in the matter could join me in urging the Council to take less time than usual to rule on the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to my last point. I agree with those Members who explained that while the problem of price and the problem of taking account of patent law in connection with prices are important, these are not the only problems to be solved. There are many other issues to address if we are to ensure better access to medicines for people in developing countries. The quality of the health systems must be improved. There needs to be a system of public research into diseases that no longer exist in developed countries and are therefore no longer of interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Problems of distribution and medical culture must be resolved. There will still be much to be done, even after the difficulties relating to patent law have been overcome, which I trust will be soon. This is not however a reason for giving up on our determined efforts to ensure that this first, important and highly symbolic step is taken with the help of the European Union. The Commission will certainly persevere, spurred on by the statements made during this debate.</p>
