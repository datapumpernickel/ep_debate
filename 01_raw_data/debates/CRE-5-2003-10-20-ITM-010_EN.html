The time has come to congratulate those responsible for this achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">The mother of the programme is, without a doubt, the European Commission, which launched the first <span class="italic">e</span>Learning pilot action with its May 2000 communication, although, at that time, the action was not financed by its own budget line. Tomorrow, two years on, thanks to meticulous work characterised by cooperation between the institutions, the first multiannual <span class="italic">e</span>Learning programme will be put to the vote. It is not, therefore, difficult to understand that the measure had a father too, as well as a mother. It is always more difficult to identify the father, and a question mark remains in this case too, but I would say that the role belongs equally to Parliament and the Council. The endeavours of the Council, both under the Greek Presidency and, more conclusively, under the Italian Presidency, enabled Parliament to find a substantial opening for its requests and, therefore, to allocate to the <span class="italic">e</span>Learning programme sufficient funds for it to be launched.</p>
<p class="contents">This multiannual programme, which stands alongside other historic programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo, meets the demands of the Lisbon, Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils. The main objectives are fighting the digital divide through implementing computer literacy methods, promoting virtual campuses, <span class="italic">e</span>-twinning of schools, promoting and disseminating good practice and cooperation between Community programmes and action instruments promoted at national level. The programme’s budget was, as I said, increased to EUR 44 million thanks to what I would like to call close cooperation between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the <span class="italic">e</span>-twinning of European schools, in line with the objectives adopted in the previous European Parliament resolution, I wanted to stress once again how teacher training remains a priority. I would like us to reflect once again on the fact that, in 2003, on average, 90% of primary schools, 98% of secondary schools and 99% of vocational and technical schools in the Member States were connected to the Internet, but only 39% of primary school teachers, 50% of secondary school teachers and 58% of teachers in vocational and technical schools actually used the Internet as a teaching tool. There is, therefore, a great need for this programme. In actual fact, these averages conceal huge discrepancies between the Member States: while the average figure for Denmark is approximately 70%, the average figure for Greece is below 9%.</p>
<p class="contents">From these figures, which are already, in themselves, quite clear, two things can be inferred. The first concerns the use of the Internet as a tool to facilitate teaching. It is not just a question of availability of infrastructure and school equipment but of teacher training, mentality and school organisation. The second concerns the use of technological resources. The setting up of virtual training rooms, for example, is one way of achieving the goal of exchanges of good practice between teachers in the different Member States, at both methodological and teaching level. For these reasons, I have attempted to stress in the report that the<span class="italic"> e</span>Learning programme should attach greater importance to finding more effective methods that will help teachers incorporate the use of the Internet into their teaching and encourage the dissemination of good practice in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank the Commission and all the Commission staff who have contributed to the success of our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament's active support will therefore enable us to adopt this programme in record time, less than a year after the Commission tabled its proposal in December 2002. It is also your rapporteur, whom I should like to thank, who has made it possible to respect this very tight deadline. Mr Mauro has spared no effort and has done an excellent job. For example, thanks to him, teacher training has become one of the main objectives of the programme. In fact, we are aware that this training is one of the keys to the programme's success and that all of the Member States are already working on it. I am grateful to him for enriching the programme in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, then, we need to reach a decision with a view to the second reading, and I am sure that Parliament will be able to agree. The Council agrees with the content, including with the addition of teacher training. But, as you know, its position on the programme's budget, as set out in its common position, which was adopted by qualified majority, was initially very different from Parliament's. An agreement has now been reached. There is no doubt that we would have preferred a higher amount than that proposed by Parliament, but this has proved to be impossible. The EUR 44 million on which your institution must vote is therefore a compromise, but a compromise that will make it possible to complete the procedure, saving time and resources, and to launch the programme as planned on 1 January. I believe that, on this simple basis, we should tell ourselves that it is better to have a little less money and be able to start implementing a good programme straight away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All European education and training systems must accelerate access to and use of new information and communication technologies to improve quality and reduce discrepancies. Once again I would like to mention the Bologna and Barcelona objectives, which, as you have already heard, could, if implemented, give the European economic area and learning area a chance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that the situation in many countries – Austria included – is currently such that cost cutting has prevented increased investment in education that had been agreed, resulting instead in an increase in cutbacks in the education sector. Regrettably, we are moving further and further from the objective of becoming the most knowledge-based society in the world by 2013, as the Council has already indicated and predicted that it will still take a long time. When new programmes are initiated, they should also be implemented with the necessary determination, which means that they should – as the <span class="italic">e</span>-Learning programme actually does – show visible signs of success after three years. I think that it is for the European Union to give a visible impulse in this area, thus starting a chain reaction and again making education a top priority in the Member States, so that it does not fall victim to the cost-cutting that has been the case to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A dynamic knowledge economy requires a sound <span class="italic">e</span>Learning programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make three observations. First of all, I think it positive that primary education is also involved in the programme, but the target group should also include people other than young people, for we must not neglect the elderly, or, for that matter, those who live in remote areas. It is precisely those people that we need to take out of their <span class="italic">e</span>Learning isolation. Via lifelong learning, they benefit from this programme and they can pass on their knowledge and experience to the next generations. Grandmothers can chat online with their grandchildren – I am an expert at it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is virtual twinning of schools. There are large discrepancies between the different areas in Europe in terms of the use of information technology in education, and we must ensure that disadvantaged schools are given the incentive to dare take the plunge to <span class="italic">e</span>Learning. Exchanging information and best practices via the Internet platform is of key importance. This is how schools will be able to benefit and learn from each other’s expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the candidate countries must also explicitly be involved in the programme. From experience, I know that there are schools that are already far advanced in the application of ICT in their education. The Join Multimedia programme run by Siemens is a case in point. I sit on its jury, and it is also appropriate, Commissioner, that this is linked to a European prize. I have attended the prize-giving ceremony and I was deeply impressed with what was on offer, to which this prize gives a boost. Finally, not only is the quantity important, but the quality should also be superior. I hope that the private sector that has been established, with the <span class="italic">e</span>Learning Industry Group, can make an important contribution to this. Cooperation between the private and public sector is a necessary step towards a European dynamic knowledge economy, which is, after all, our aim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the two more important points, as mentioned by the Commissioner herself in her address, are, firstly, the question of finance: it is vital for any programme that it be properly budgeted for and given the resources to ensure that all can benefit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think the whole question of school-twinning is important, utilising best practices to bring up areas that have fallen behind and guaranteeing that the digital divide does not get any wider, because we now have the new illiterate, who are people of a certain age group – and I do not want to be ageist when I say this – who have a fear of technology and a phobia with regard to the use of it, and who risk being left behind because of a lack of access. In so many ways we see our education systems as older people passing information and knowledge onto younger people. Yet this is the one area where young people could actually be the teachers for older generations, giving them the skills and resources they require to utilise fully the opportunities afforded by this brave new world created by information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the new job opportunities that are going to be created in the future will be based very much on technology. It is quite interesting when you look at the figures, which show that 70% of the workforce that will be employed in the year 2010 is already at work, but only 20% of the technology which will be used in that year is available at the present time. It is also quite interesting when looked at in another way: of all the scientists and inventors that have ever existed, 92% are living today. So the rate of change and the types of change which will take place in the future will be even greater and more vast and our capacity as human beings to cope with that change will be determined by the skills, knowledge and training that we are given in the interim period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The e-Learning programme now under discussion will hopefully extend that series of success stories. The general aim of the programme is to improve the quality and accessibility of education and training systems by means of information and communication technologies. I hope that teachers and learners will have a major role to play in achieving this aim. If we succeed in this we will also be more likely to realise the programme’s aims.</p>
<p class="contents">The e-Learning programme is a good example of how pilot projects can claim a place in European Union policy. Back in 2001 the European Parliament began to support the initiative to promote e-learning and now we hold in our hands a proposal for a five-year action programme. Although we have not managed to increase the programme’s budget to the level we wanted exactly, the rapporteur, Mario Mauro, can be very pleased with the work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">The main focus of the e-Learning programme will be the e-twinning of schools. If networking between twinned schools truly gets under way, schoolchildren in different parts of the EU can get to know other pupils of the same age and learn about their everyday lives. If it is successful in this way, the programme could reinforce the idea of EU citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">E-learning offers new pedagogical models for teaching and learning. According to a study by the European Schoolnet, the development of interschool learning environments is flourishing in Europe. Commercial learning environments are used by just one in three users of virtual education. It is very important that these individual endeavours are made visible and available for others to make use of. The e-Learning programme does not give direct support to this, but hopefully in future we can also invest in the development of content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem, however, is the digital divide, which probably affects about one third of our population. Education and training do not reach them, and they do not have computers. For that reason, I propose, Commissioner, that funds be made available, as directly as is possible, for organisations devoted to caring for the disabled, unemployed, poor and elderly, which can maintain levels of education and training within their own circles, as education and training do not extend to these sorts of people either. In this way they will also be able to purchase and build up a stock of equipment, because the digital gap is, of course, in practice an even wider form of social gap. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
