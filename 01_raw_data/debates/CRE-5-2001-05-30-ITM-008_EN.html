<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Myller (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Wallström, representatives of the presidency, to begin with I would like to thank my colleagues on the Environment Committee. It is thanks to your flexibility that we are now approving Parliament’s opinion on the sixth Community environment action programme. Criticism has quite justifiably been directed at the fact that the reading of the programme in Parliament has been given far too short a deadline considering the importance and extent of the issue. As you know, this is due to the programme being delayed in the Commission. However, as we wanted to make our own contribution to the Gothenburg Summit, the first summit to be devoted to environmental issues, it has not been possible to avoid this rush, nor the Committee having to vote so late in the day. I would like to thank the chair of the Committee, the Committee and group secretariats and the assistants to the Members for organising the voting. I would also like to thank the Swedish Presidency and the Commission for excellent teamwork. During the preparatory work we achieved successful cooperation with the Commission, although opinions on the nature of the programme have not always been unanimous.</p>
<p class="contents">During the period spent preparing the environment action programme we have been able to reach reasonable unanimity on the areas of emphasis suggested by the Commission being the right ones. As far as the environment is concerned, the greatest worries are climate change, the loss of biodiversity, threats to health caused by environmental problems, the sustainablity of natural resources and sustainable waste management. Differences of opinion have been caused by the way problems requiring a decision have been addressed in the programme. The Commission wanted a more descriptive programme and as the rapporteur for the Environment Committee I have chosen a policy whereby we have sought, wherever possible, concrete targets in terms of quantity and quality as well as clear timetables for the priority areas chosen. Although the environment action programme is drawn up for a ten-year period, I have also proposed targets for a period exceeding this. For example, preventing climate change will require a time perspective of decades. Sufficiently ambitious intermediate targets must be laid down to ensure that the long-term targets are met.</p>
<p class="contents">When instructing the Commission on drawing up the programme in March a year ago, the Environment Committee also demanded that concrete targets and timetables be set. How far the environment ministers get in reaching a united opinion in one week’s time, remains to be seen. I wish them every success. It would send a really strong message to the citizens of Europe regarding the EU’s environmental commitment were Parliament and the Council to take to the Gothenburg Summit a common opinion on what we wish to achieve. In my view it is vital that the EU’s environment programme contain clear targets and timetables for achieving them because this is the only way of ensuring that the programme and its realisation can be evaluated sufficiently unambiguously. The evaluation halfway through the programme must be based on verifiable progress on the basis of which we must be able to make the necessary corrections in order to achieve the targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving environmental targets requires cooperation. Environmental issues must be included in all Community policies and decisions. We will not prevent climate change or enable healthy air for our citizens to breathe unless we reduce emissions from energy production, transport and industry. Decisions on what is to be done in various policy areas and how we can enable environmental issues to be linked to principles, will, however, be made within these different sectors. Therefore, these also require greater environmental expertise. Environmental assessments must also be included in economic decisions. The Commission and the Council must change the way they work so that environmental issues can be integrated with all Community decision-making. The Commission has proposed an interesting idea of creating new thematic strategies, thematic programmes for the problems causing the greatest concern. I see this as particularly welcome. Parliament and the Council must, however, be included in decision-making via the normal co-decision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is both a challenge and an opportunity for the European environment. The programme should present ways in which enlargement will become a major opportunity to improve our environment. We must also boldly take the lead in international environment policy, as well as trade policy and development cooperation policy. We must also ensure the major participation of citizens. This requires the provision of clear and visible information on environmental issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would highlight as particularly important the fact that she has welcomed the proposals that we advocated on the need to reform the common agricultural policy, on the premise that we must foster and support the development and implementation of strategies for incorporating environmental issues into the relevant sectoral policies and that we also need to protect agricultural production, taking account of food safety, the precautionary principle and the sovereignty of food, promoting the specific characteristics of the regions and more natural production methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as you all know, the importance of renewable raw materials will increase with the efforts made to achieve a more sustainable economic system, in which forests and cultivated land are of particular importance. In order, however, to enable sustainable development and economic and social cohesion to take place, the procedures for internal support must give special consideration to the situation of farmers and family-based farming and to the legitimacy of specific aid for public interest goods and services in the framework of a multifunctional system of agriculture. The procedures must, of course, also take account of the differing degrees of agricultural development in the various Member States of the European Union and in the applicant countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These priority objectives are in the spotlight every day and the press refers to them on a daily basis: climate change, the promotion and preservation of biodiversity, the sustainable management of resources and the protection of health and the natural environment. Those are the priority objectives and it is therefore essential to take measures more energetically than has been the case up till now. Firstly, it is necessary to apply the legislation. As the rapporteur said, it is necessary to integrate environmental policies and other policies: agriculture, transport, energy. This has still not been done properly. We need more sustainable models of production and consumption. I believe that we need to change the model of production and consumption; otherwise, we will not be able to achieve the objectives marked out by both the Commission and the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The interest in this programme is clear. It is demonstrated by the fact that we have spent hours voting on more than 350 amendments and that today, despite many amendments presented by the different draftspeople having been taken up, almost 300 amendments are still to be submitted to the House for its approval. I believe that, in the view of the Committee on Petitions – and I am referring to the specific experience of this committee – there are two fundamental issues, which the rapporteur has taken up. The first is the application of Community law. The Member States do not apply it and this is demonstrated by the fact that the European Commission has had to take several Member States to the courts for various reasons (nitrate pollution, for example). Spain is currently being prosecuted over the existence of more than seven illegal dumping sites. The first fundamental issue is therefore compliance with environmental legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the promotion of citizen participation. We have noted in the Committee on Petitions that of the 1100 or 1200 petitions registered each year in this committee, 40% relate to the natural environment. This demonstrates that not only ecologist groups but also platforms of everyday citizens have an enormous interest in preserving the environment in which they live and that it is they who are complaining. They take care to study Community law and they make complaints to us and then have the patience to await the result of procedures which sometimes take too long. That is another problem: when a complaint or a petition is presented, there are so many delays in the responses of the governments and the procedures are so long that, sometimes, the damage is done irreversibly and, on other occasions, the citizens who complain about these irregularities lose patience.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of the Committee on Petitions, these are the fundamental issues: the participation of the citizens, speeding up the procedures and, above all, compliance with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago we held a debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the fact that, although the environmental legislation in the European Union is extraordinary, it is not complied with. We must find a method for complying with it. We are proposing certain amendments aimed at penalising those countries which do not use the Structural Funds or the Cohesion Fund in projects for preserving the environment. This is unfortunately the only thing the governments understand.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to find other mechanisms to speed up the procedures so that the citizens do not lose patience.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that this is an extraordinary programme. I hope that tomorrow most of the amendments presented by the rapporteur and some of the groups will be approved and I believe that what we have to achieve is for the programme to be implemented properly over the next ten years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gutiérrez-Cortines (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, we regret the little time available to us because this project has not been able to lead to a democratic and open debate, as we would have liked, and this would have contributed to making the population and civil society more aware of what we are dealing with in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We as a group have always supported the Commission because we have believed that this was a great project. It has been criticised for being too light, but I believe that not everybody has understood that the Commission’s proposal consisted of transferring specific policies into thematic strategies; and this is because the thematic strategies are a new way of working, a more scientific way, where the details are going to be studied in greater depth: the technical levels and the technical solutions, the viability of projects, the situations of the countries and the type of legislation which would be suitable.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore largely supported the project in the form in which it was drawn up by the Commission. We believed that our margin for presenting amendments had to be limited and narrow, in order not to completely change the system of the project. We wanted this balanced academic nature of the Commission’s project to be respected. Furthermore, we firmly believe that one of the best policies in the history of Europe is the environmental policy: it has fantastic teams of officials and, at the same time, teams of experts to advise them, and it seemed to us that it was not a question of creating another parallel project.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the situation has taken a new turn towards numerous amendments, we have introduced some priorities to supplement the project, not to correct it, because there are already many approved directives and it seemed to us that it was not a question of looking backwards. We have therefore introduced initiatives, for example, on the urban environment, on the countryside, on a sustainable culture, on the issue of animal feed and the control of the food chain, an issue which we would have put much more stress on if the document had been produced before now. Therefore, we have wanted to strengthen and extend it, thereby showing that our group has a great interest in this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must say that certain amendments have been introduced which, if approved, will oblige us to reject the general project. Because we cannot allow a project of this type to talk about, for example, the indiscriminate civil liability of all persons who have companies or initiatives. For example, Amendment No 68, if applied directly, would oblige any mountain farmer with cattle which causes problems for the environment, to take out civil liability insurance. This is absurd. Some of the amendments are excessively tough and are going to have repercussions for the citizens. The same must be said of an indiscriminate rate on hydrocarbons and on energy which may penalise the weaker sections of the population who take two hours to get to work because they live in the outskirts of the cities.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we have believed in the project and we are supporting it. We support the Commission. We support the idea as a whole and most of the ideas within it. We do not, however, believe this is a Christmas tree, as one Member says, which any old thing can be hung on. Neither is it a project for Gothenburg. It is a project for Johannesburg, which we want to present proudly in 2002, supporting the Commission and European policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Hulthén report is a contribution to a more definite strategy for sustainable development, the Blokland report explores the relationships between economic policy and environmental issues in greater depth and, finally, the Myller report seeks to provide a series of consistent objectives and effective instruments for pursuing those objectives in terms of environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow’s vote on the sixth programme only represents a stage in this important project we have undertaken, but it is no less important for that. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has sought to strengthen the text and make it more binding as a crystal clear demonstration of our determination to take concrete steps to safeguard and improve the environment around us, especially in view of the limited achievements of the fifth action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, I would like to thank our rapporteur and briefly comment on two points which seem to me particularly important. The first relates to the need to consolidate the involvement of local authorities in the action programme. While it is indeed important to set objectives at continent level, we must not forget that only committed, continuous action on the ground can actually secure a profound change in habits and customs, instilling a new culture of eco-compatible planning into every level of our local institutions. In that connection, I venture to draw your attention to Amendments Nos 52 and 53, already endorsed by the Committee on the Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must succeed in ensuring that all the instruments provided by the programme – legislative, fiscal, financial, scientific, cultural and informative – can actually be used. For this – and here I come to my second point – it is fundamentally important to strengthen training in environmental policy for all the players operating on the ground. I am not just talking about administrators, but also about economic and social players and individual citizens, whom we must succeed in involving in this collective effort so that we can indeed make a qualitative leap in the protection of our environment, hence putting on greater pressure for the achievement of ambitious objectives at global level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I remember that at a very early stage, even before the Action Programme was before us, we had a talk with the Commissioner, during which we made it clear that the sixth environment action programme should be a brief document, taking the form of a pamphlet, with clear priorities and objectives. I remember that the Commissioner shared our view. Unfortunately, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I have to say that we are disappointed with the ultimate outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a document which may provide an excellent analysis, but which is far too long and which does not contain any clear priorities and, in actual fact, which does not set out a clear policy, except for wanting to make the environment cleaner. Other than that, however, the document offers little in the way of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, by the way, not a personal criticism of the Commissioner: we are very satisfied with her work in other areas. Despite this, the Commission saw an opportunity to produce something which we did not actually want. Allow me to move on to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We have a great deal of appreciation for the work which the rapporteur has done. In many ways, she re-wrote the document. Ultimately, however, the result of the work of the Environmental Committee is not really what we had hoped for either. It is increasingly resembling a hotchpotch: everyone has a say and makes proposals, which leaves us ultimately with a kind of wish list. I cannot shake off the impression that if someone had at some stage proposed to clean up the moon while we were at it, the Commission would have adopted that too. That is not the right way to go about things, of course. We may produce whole reams of fine words and give the impression that we are doing something worthwhile, but that is not strictly speaking the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also perhaps questionable whether a ten-year programme is really what we need in this day and age. Too much chat, which, in fact, fits into the Dutch political culture perfectly: we too talk endlessly about all kinds of things – the infamous Dutch culture of consultation and deliberation, referred to as the ‘poldermodel’ being a case in point – but it subsequently takes an incredibly long time before something actually gets done. Perhaps we need an entirely different approach, for example by establishing very clear issue programmes in the short term, alongside regular legislative programmes, in respect of which the Commission is doing a sterling job.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to make a constructive comment and indicate which, in our view, should be the minimum priorities: climate change, energy, waste and bio-diversity. We should have placed the emphasis on these aspects, instead of producing a document which indicates how beautiful the world should become on all scores.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not welcome many amendments because we then cannot see the wood for the trees. Strictly speaking, we are not against the proposed details in the legislation, but we are of the opinion that it is unnecessary to include those in the Action Programme now and to regulate those matters from Brussels and Strasbourg. It would be far preferable to implement this at national and perhaps even at regional or local level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, transparency and details are two different things in our view. We will therefore vote against a good number of amendments, not necessarily because we are opposed to them, but because we believe that those points should not be laid down by the European Parliament at this stage. We therefore offer our hesitant support to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to propose the following: next time a document of this kind is drafted, we must ask the Commission officials to go back to using typewriters instead of word-processors. In that way, it might be easier to keep to the point, because then there would not be the constant temptation to copy sections from existing documents into the new document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also forms a vital cornerstone of the strategy for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay homage to Mrs Myller, who has worked excellently together with the shadow rapporteurs. She also involved us all at a very early stage by allowing us to put forward proposals which she then took into account. I believe we have raised the ambitions of the Commission document to a higher level, particularly with regard to the scope, aims and timetable of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and Commissioner Wallström received a great deal of criticism that the proposal was far too tame and was aiming too low. The criticism came from all sides, including from the two institutions, the Council and Parliament. However I would like to thank Margot Wallström for the fact that we have a Sixth Environment Action Programme. We have perhaps forgotten that the Commission initially did not want the Sixth Environment Action Programme at all. Only during questioning by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in conjunction with Mrs Wallström being put forward as a candidate for Commissioner, was the promise of a Sixth Action Programme given. I am convinced that it not only required political courage but also a great deal of stubbornness and energy to carry out this promise, which is important to remember.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many important points which I will not have time to address now, but I would like to point out that the Committee has done a good job in deciding that the relevant strategies as well as the targets, funds and timetable should be drawn up as a framework directive, so that the matter can be handled in a democratic manner in Parliament and by the Council and so that we can enter the decision-making process and influence it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is good that the wording on public procurement, biodiversity, the precautionary principle and the substitution principle with regard to the chemicals strategy has been included. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of the five strategic avenues, the two most basic are, first, finding new ways of working more closely with the market via businesses and consumers and, secondly, empowering people as private citizens. This is the simple, crude and cynical way in which acute environmental problems are dealt with by the European Union which, with its bombing of Yugoslavia and its depleted uranium bombs, has inflicted incalculable damage on valuable natural resources, not to mention all the other disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">One last but illustrative point. In Greece, there is no water on the plain of Thessaly, with the result that about a million people have nothing to drink and the plain is drying up and turning into a Sahara desert. The diversion of the upper reaches of the River Acheloos, which is a major environmental project with hydroelectric energy and some irrigation functions, is on hold because the Community Support Frameworks, the famous packages, do not fund this sort of project. Does the House not think that the European Union, which claims to be fighting for the environment, should review its position on and fund these projects? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all fresh environmental legislation, an increase in the activity in terms of transport, energy and agriculture has put more pressure on the environment. This is partly caused by the fact that many Member States fail to implement environmental legislation. The conclusion of the assessment was that the objectives of the fifth environment action programme were not met.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, implementation and compliance, including the necessary inspections, of current EU legislation must be granted absolute top priority. In addition, the remaining part of the present Environment Action Programme is yet to be carried out. In the light of the enlargement, every effort must be made to achieve this also in the candidate countries in the shortest possible time. The solving of environmental issues in those countries is very high on the list of priorities. In addition, the environmental gain is potentially at its highest in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President – and that is not a criticism of Commissioner Wallström or the rapporteur, Mrs Myller – there is a risk that this proposal will not have more impact than a paper tiger. I can support many objectives, but these can only be obtained once the objectives of the fifth Environment Action Programme have been met. It is therefore not a bad thing if the sixth Environment Action programme can only be laid down at a later stage. In the meantime, all efforts can be focused on the implementation of the present legislation of the fifth Environment Action Programme, and the Council will also have the time to assess the profusion of amendments tabled by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What the rapporteur has made of it makes the matter even more difficult. I think that what the Commission laid before us was a very good starting point. I really feel sorry for the Commission officials who presented a very good report because their good work was changed so much. I am unable to congratulate the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">In the discussion on the evaluation of the Fifth Environment Action Programme with a view to the sixth, three essential concerns were repeatedly formulated in the fundamentals, and thankfully I find them here again: streamlined EU legislation, a voluntary approach to implementation – so far as possible – and greater involvement of the consumer, whose behaviour we want to influence, after all. Because it is no longer the ‘What’ that is at the forefront of environmental policy today. We are agreed on that – industry is, too – but how we get there, that is where the controversy lies!</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the EU way is often twin-track, contradictory, difficult to implement, bureaucratic and costly out of all proportion to the ecological purpose. Such legal errors are then multiplied fifteen fold in the implementation. If, as I very much hope, we are to have enlargement very soon, there will be twice as many, because in the end with all these mistakes the dogs always bite the last one in the chain. That is not industry, it is the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of existing EU environmental legislation addressed in the Environment Action Programme and rightly called for repeatedly by Commissioner Wallström makes good sense and is also consistent with our repeated call for streamlined legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I find there is a lot missing from this environment programme. I am sure we could have included it. Only what the rapporteur has made of it does not improve matters. I feel sorry for the Commission officials! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then I looked at the articles and found that something had happened between communication and articles. There is always something missing. If you look at it closely, you can see precisely what it is. In the communication, the strategic objectives – and the related measures – are set out quite clearly. In the articles there are only vague allusions. Sometimes something has been lost altogether, in the case of noise, for example, which in my opinion is a key environmental factor for human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication describes the types of pollution and lists the measures. Then you come to the articles; in Article 2 you still find the objective of reducing pollution, especially long-term pollution, from noise. Then when you come to the measures concerning health in Article 6, however hard you look, Commissioner, I can find not one specific measure about noise.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it is right that we should now bring the things that you listed quite rightly and very well at the beginning of the communication back into the articles, thereby making them binding for the Commission, Parliament and the Council. Either list of examples can be used. If we are to set about using an instrument of this kind, we need a degree of strategic orientation. In connection with water, for example, we read: “phasing out the discharge of hazardous substances”. I don’t think there is even one person in the European Union who says he wants more hazardous substances to be discharged into water. The questions of when such a thing happens, however, and what hazardous substances are, need to be rather more closely defined! There is nothing about that at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The next bullet point is “Revising the bathing water directive”. What does “revising” mean? Does it mean raising the standards? Does it mean the same standards as in the drinking water directive, or does it mean protecting human health? So we need greater clarity here. Now a word to the PPE-DE: I admit we have a few motions here about whose content we can discuss. We must do that, but we must do it in the second reading because that is when things get polished up. I really must ask you at the first reading to give us a mandate to negotiate and back the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1972, we have had Environment Action Programmes one, two, three, four and five. A few years ago, key officials in the Directorate-General for the Environment said that they had done enough, and that there was no need for a sixth environment action programme. If the Member States implement what has already been decided, then all will be well in the environment. We as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance protested loudly against this, and we asked candidate-Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, to issue a sixth environment action programme anyway, which she did; she has kept her promise.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to say that we, along with Mr Lange, believe that the legislative component is rather flimsy. The extensive explanatory note was much better. That is why we as majority in Parliament wanted to include this extensive explanatory note in the legislation. Hence the many amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now also received the Prodi paper for the Gothenburg Summit. It has to be said that this paper contains a number of interesting ideas which go even further, such as the abolition of subsidies for fossil fuels until 2010, and 7% bio-fuels for cars and lorries, also in 2010. We as the Group of the Greens have tabled amendments of that ilk. We hope that the Socialists and Liberals will support them, so that they can be incorporated in the legislation. If that is the case, Parliament will be supporting an ambitious programme for the next ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Liberals, climate, waste and bio-diversity had to be included. Without the sixth environment action programme, the whole issue of bio-diversity would have been overlooked. It would not have been given priority in the current policy. That is why I welcome this fresh initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It suggests that Kyoto needs to be ratified if we are to combat the greenhouse effect efficiently and calls for greater protection for our cultural and natural heritage, as the honourable Member Mrs De Veyrac stresses in her report – and on this we agree.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also issues which give us cause for concern, however. For example, we are moving on to the sixth programme without any real evaluation of the results of the fifth programme, which is completely irregular. We also feel that programming over a ten-year period is much too long, to the point at which theory has prevailed over practice in the Commission communication, a document of 90 pages no less. As for transparency of decisions and access to documents, I trust that these will not go unheeded, as recommended in the Korhola report. Finally, the objectives of enhanced protection for biodiversity through the Natura 2000 network are proving troublesome. </p>
<p class="contents">Almost every Member State is having implementation problems due to the lack of clarity in the texts and their restrictive interpretation by the European Court of Justice. Article 225a of the Treaty of Nice provides for the facility to create judicial panels to hear at first instance certain classes of action brought in specific areas. There is good reason to bet that the environment sector will be one of the first to set them up, given the context. Is this the best way of protecting the environment? I very much doubt it and I call for a sixth programme which is rational, realistic and humanist in its application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given its enhanced legal status, this document will be of greater significance than any of the other environmental action plans I have seen going through Parliament in the last 10 or so years. I am, therefore, concerned at the speed with which it has been considered by Parliament, driven at least in part by an ambitious presidency that will be here today and gone tomorrow. Mrs Myller is in no way to be criticised as she has striven very hard to begin the discussion on the substance of this debate very early on, but that has not stopped some of her colleagues from coming forward with a long last-minute shopping list of demands stretching far into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not despair. The proposals are still there at the centre of the document in the amendments. The Commission can still rescue it at second reading. The rapporteur will have the chance of getting a core of sensible amendments together at second reading that will have the support of the clear majority of Members of this House. I, like many others tomorrow, will vote for this report and the bulk of the amendments, knowing that by going forward to the second reading we are taking steps in the long process of developing an environment policy for the European Union which will outlast all the presidencies and all the ministers that this Parliament will see, and which will probably also outlast most of the Members of this House. In that sense, we all have to recognise how small a part we play in the bigger overall process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has stirred up contradictory reactions, reactions of disappointment and satisfaction. I am one of those who are actually quite pleased: a great deal of thought has gone into selecting the topics, and I welcome the emphasis on climate, health, bio-diversity and waste. In my view, however, we could have been more specific, more to the point, and more precise.</p>
<p class="contents">Rapporteur, Mrs Rita Myller, has compiled an excellent report, which I back entirely. Her report contributes towards a better and more specific Environment Action Programme. The sixth environment action programme must become the mainstay of European strategy for sustainable development. That too receives my unqualified support.</p>
<p class="contents">Two matters are of key importance to me. First of all, compliance. I am pleased that the Commissioner has placed so much emphasis on proper compliance. She has also confirmed this in the previous debate. I am of the view that Parliament could play a more significant role in that compliance. One of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy states that Parliament should be issued with half-yearly reports on the state of affairs, which affords an overview of compliance by the Member States and instances of encouragement by the Commission, and, if possible, the effectiveness of the legislation. Such a report can be hugely beneficial to national parliaments: they can be the first ones to point out the governments’ non-compliance with European obligations. In that way, various parties can join forces and can turn the sixth environment action programme into a success. Commissioner, I should like to have your opinion on the possibility of these half-yearly reports.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns international cooperation. Sustainable development should not remain within European borders. That is why the Environmental Committee is calling for protection of the hot spots in tropical regions. International agreements are important. Unfortunately, Parliament has insufficient authority in this respect, and international negotiations are not public. One of the amendments is asking the Commission to consult Parliament before and after the event. That does happen, but does it also happen in the case of conferences of the international airline organisations, for example? I would welcome this greatly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to echo the hope which has been expressed in favour of broad support for this report during tomorrow’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am perhaps slightly disappointed by the view of the PPE-DE. The objectives of the programme which have been raised in this report originate predominantly from the Commission's notification section, but also include many of the same objectives which President of the Commission Romano Prodi raised in his own presentation of sustainable development at the last sitting in Strasbourg. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs; in my opinion the work was carried out well. I would also like to thank you for your observations; I personally aim to start discussions at as early a stage as possible and maintain contact with the various bodies during the work. I hope that I have succeeded in this. I also hope that the PPE-DE is able to support this report because I have taken their proposals very broadly into account in proceedings in the committee. Possibly for this reason, this final proposal now coming for its first reading has become something of a mixture of combined hopes, but Bernd Lange and David Bowe gave a very clear idea of how we can work further on this programme document.

<p class="contents">There were actually two choices after I decided to say ‘yes’ to the question in the hearing about whether I wanted to present a sixth Environment Action Programme: either the choice of being criticised for being too ambitious and thus unrealistic, or being too detailed and thus not visionary enough. I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about whether it was a good answer to say ‘yes, we should make a sixth Environment Action Programme’ since it has been heavily criticised.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I expected that, because there was a global assessment of the fifth programme, and what did it teach us? We learned from that programme that implementation was not good enough. We have a solid base of more than 200 legal acts in the environment. We already have ambitious targets and deadlines in programmes, but they have not all been met. There is a lack of understanding from different institutions and from Member States in actually wanting to carry out the necessary work for the environment. This is what we learned.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to make a short programme: it should have been shorter, but guess what would have happened then? We would have added, and Parliament and Council would have added a number of details and included even more issues in the environmental programme. That is always the risk if you want to make a short. My collaborator said that it was not possible to bring in all the important issues and make the programme shorter. There is the risk of making it a shopping list, and I wanted to avoid that. I wanted to make it an action programme. I wanted to point out what is necessary to mobilise, on a very broad scale, all different stake-holders in society, and to mention the actions necessary to meet the objectives set in this programme to show that, during a period of ten years, these kinds of actions are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I am not against targets, timetables or deadlines. We need them, but they must be based on sound science, on the latest facts from these different sectors and policy areas. I appreciate that we have broad support for the priorities and the structure of this programme. We have the problem that this is a codecision procedure, so we have a difference between the first and second part and I do not know how to deal with that. It is a pity that it exists, because you need to see the full text to understand the way we think about these issues: so that is partly an explanation of the problems we experience.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to come in the right order, however: the targets and deadlines should, of course, come in the automatic strategies, in the follow-up. However, I wanted the programme to describe the priorities and stick to the priorities, not to make it a shopping list, not to add everything about bathing water quality or the noise problem, etc., instead to stick to these priorities. We have so many good amendments that actually enhance this programme and we welcome those amendments that clarify the text and add some precision to the actions being proposed: I include Amendment No 77 on allowing environmental criteria to be taken into account in public purchasing. This is what we are working on at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the reference to giving priority to young people in the provision of information, emphasised in Amendment No 88. We have not been able to say ‘yes’ to all the excellent amendments about information and education to young people. We do not have the competence, or the resources – it has to be up to the Member States to carry this out – but it is a very important issue and I want to underline that. The setting of targets should be seen as part of the process, getting results by involving stake-holders, because we do not have many specific proposals for these targets and timetables. It was the same in the Council when we asked what kind of targets do you mean? Give us some examples – I got two, of which one was very general and the other already known to us. Of course, we could have used concepts such as 'ecological footprint' or 'factor 4' or 'factor 10', but then the programme would have been slightly different. It must be based on sound science and facts and it must be achievable and viable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about thematic strategies. We have proposed the use of thematic strategies for defining the set of measures that will be needed to tackle six complex and multi-dimensional problems. The Commission fully understands and we strongly support the wish of Parliament to be fully involved and consulted on the content of the thematic strategies. That has been our objective all the time. I welcome the inclusion of an Article that defines thematic strategies and I can support the spirit, if not the letter, of Amendment No 66, because a thematic strategy may be a framework directive, but it could also be a combination of a directive and other actions. We should not specify that in every case there should be a framework directive. We have to keep it open, to have a strategy which includes the possibility of proposing a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also this question about timetables and again we must remember that this is a strategic programme that lays down the priorities for the next 10 years, not a comprehensive work programme. There is no link made between new actions proposed and the resources available to do the job. The Commission will produce the necessary proposals, but they need to be of good quality and it is also important to underline that.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept those amendments that seek to bind the Commission to producing proposals by set dates, for example, Amendments Nos 49, 76, 85, 123, 189, 198. It is always the Commission's intention to use the mid-term review of the programme as the point at which the implementing measures for the programme should be prepared. There are annual reports about implementation, but so far we have not made a big case out of these, although we have started to have these name, fame and shame seminars, to do more to make it public, and we warmly welcome Parliament's intention to take part and to know more: we are willing to do everything possible to help in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not comment on all the amendments, because we have already left a note with our comments, but urban areas need to be stressed more and we welcome the spirit of Amendment No 207. Of the 297 amendments being proposed, the Commission actually supports more than half in full, or in part, or in principle, but we cannot accept 145.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we welcome this opinion. We feel that it will be an invaluable contribution to creating an operational, dynamic and ultimately successful sixth Environment Action Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
