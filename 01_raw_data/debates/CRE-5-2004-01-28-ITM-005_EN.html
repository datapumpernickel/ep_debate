<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution presented today is based on the debate of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs held during the annual report on competition policy for 2002. I want to give my sincere thanks to Mr Della Vedova for the important work he has done. Also, Mr President, I want to say how much I appreciate and how vital for me was the excellent cooperation with the parliamentary committees, primarily the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The proposed resolution does, in my opinion, accurately reflect that committee’s support for the Commission’s competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to briefly explain the stage that competition policy is now at and give you an idea of the direction we want to take in the immediate future. As you know, during the current Commission’s term of office the reform of all competition rules has been started and, to a large extent, completed. The common aim underlying the various aspects of that reform has been to make our control procedures more effective and eliminate superfluous red tape, without undermining the substance of the competition rules. I believe that this can help to increase competitiveness, growth and employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words on each of the three main areas with which competition policy is concerned: antitrust, concentrations, State aids. In the antitrust sector, at the end of 2002, the Council adopted Regulation 1/2003 establishing a new framework for the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. This regulation opens up a new chapter in the application of Community competition rules; in fact it is the biggest antitrust reform since 1962 and will enter into force on 1 May 2004. The following are the two main aspects of the new system: abolishing the notification system in respect of agreements between undertakings and establishing uniform conditions under which undertakings are to operate in the context of the common market. The application of Community competition rules shall become the norm enabling undertakings to carry out projects in a much simpler manner than happens under the present system where agreements between undertakings are governed not just by Community provisions, but also by 25 national legal systems. Simultaneously, under the new system undertakings are freed from the onerous burdens of notification and the Commission can concentrate all its resources on pursuing the most serious infringements of the competition rules. The reform mobilises the full potential of national competition authorities and national courts to contribute to the application of European antitrust regulations. A network of the 25 national authorities is currently being set up for the purpose of ensuring that tasks are more effectively and more efficiently allocated between the Commission and the national authorities; the Commission shall have the task – which is certainly demanding – of guaranteeing that the regulations are applied in a coherent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I could give much more detail, but I do not intend to do so now. I should, however, like to stress an aspect of this competition policy which will be proactive, based less on waiting for notifications and more on initiatives taken by the Commission and the national competition authorities; we wanted to give a special role to consumers, who are the ultimate beneficiaries towards whom our competition policy is actually directed, by means of, for example, a number of provisions designed to make consumer associations more involved in investigations into matters concerning competition, whilst also encouraging them to register complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the second part of our reform, which concerns the control of concentrations. I should like to point out at the outset that this control is not so interventionist as it might appear to be at first sight. The Commission certainly has no intention of hindering the restructuring of markets; concentrations are necessary to respond to the challenges of a developing economy. In fact, if we look at the statistics, we see that since 1990, of more than 2200 concentrations that have been notified, the Commission has blocked only 18: it is therefore an extremely small proportion, but blocking a concentration is of course more newsworthy than authorising it. The recently adopted reform of the regulation governing concentrations introduces a certain degree of flexibility into the time-limits for examining the operation, strengthens the one-stop-shop principle which is extremely beneficial for undertakings and stipulates that the essential criterion on which operations are to be assessed is that concerned with all types of harmful situations, whether involving the dominant position of a single undertaking or the effects of a situation where there is an oligopoly that could damage consumer interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the internal organisation of the Commission, in the area concerned with competition we have introduced a number of fairly radical innovations – which various Members have followed extremely closely and encouraged – including giving greater weight to economic analysis in the assessment of competition cases. As from September 2003, there has been a new figure, the Chief Competition Economist, operating within the Directorate General for Competition, who is providing a new input into our decision-making procedure in terms of economic analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come briefly, Mr President, to the third area on which competition policy is based, that is to say the control of State aids. Parliament and the Council have repeatedly and rightly insisted that the overall amount of State aids must be reduced and that, at the same time, State aids must be geared more to supporting horizontal objectives than to supporting, often artificially, specific sectors or single undertakings. As you know, Parliament has supported this move: in July 2001 we established an assessment framework – a score board for State aids – and the latest figures, from last spring, confirmed that there was a trend towards a reduction in the level of aids; when the new figures are issued this April we shall see whether this trend has continued.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards State aids, just as I said a few moments ago in relation to antitrust and concentrations, we have attempted to redirect the Commission’s work towards those activities which are capable of causing most damage to competition in Europe. We still have an intensive work programme, from now until the end of the present Commission’s term of office, in relation to the State aids sector, a programme which is focussed on three main aspects: more effective amendments to working methods and procedures; developing simpler methods for dealing with less important cases of aid; reviewing the current substantive regulations governing State aids. Work on procedural reform is already quite advanced: we are in the process of preparing a regulation which lays down the implementing provisions of the Council’s procedural rules and we want to develop new instruments for simplifying the treatment of those aids which do not raise any significant competition problems. As a follow-up to the Commission’s Green Paper on services of general economic interest, in which this Parliament has shown such great interest, major priority will be given to clarifying the control mechanism governing the payment of compensation for costs associated with the supply of services of general economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall stop now in order not to overrun the time allocated to me, but not before saying a few very brief words, Mr President, on what we have done during this time, once again with Parliament’s support, as regards the international dimension of competition policy, both by further developing certain bilateral cooperation relations between antitrust authorities – primarily with those in the US – and by setting up with other partners the first multilateral body on competition, the International Competition Network. We are hopeful that in this sector the governance of globalisation is flourishing, and not withering away, as is unfortunately happening in other sectors. I am, of course, available to listen to and, where necessary, comment on the speeches that follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of your speech, Commissioner, you devoted to the technical work of reviewing competitiveness and to improving it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, though, that where we have to exert more influence is on the issue of what must be done to make Europe more competitive. Reading the Commission’s report on competitiveness in 2003, it is quite clear to me that the businesses that achieved high levels of production growth were those in which organisational improvements go hand in hand with investment in new technologies, and especially in information and communications technology. What this means is that we have to be quicker off the mark, more flexible, more mobile, more industrious, more willing to embrace reform, starting by becoming more European in our thinking and then becoming more open to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, then, give all the participants in the internal market a level playing field, and do away with whatever obstructs the internal market and impairs its competitiveness. We have to make the internal market an internal market; our problems with competences in the areas of fiscal policy, labour law and working times mean that it is not one. Because social systems are a matter for the Member States alone, the EU, in all these policy areas, can do no more than beg and implore them to do the necessary homework.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that it is important that we should now recognise the connections between the quality of the internal market, the EU’s ability to compete, the fulfilment of the Lisbon targets and the achievement of growth and job creation. Underlying all of them are our social market economy and stability. I urge you to waste no time in presenting the Member States with your list of requirements, with clear figures and timescales showing how we can make Europe more competitive and what homework the Member States have to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is clear is that competition policy is an important and indispensable instrument, enabling the European internal market to function and facilitating ever-deeper integration, so that the gains in terms of prosperity and efficiency resulting from a large and integrated market can be put to good use. I called competition policy an instrument, and that is what it is, rather than an end in itself; if it were an end in itself, it would very rapidly degenerate into something purely ideological. Competition policy is an instrument that has to be subject to social and civil policy objectives and must help achieve them. The fact is, then, that we do not live and move in a free market economy, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs’ draft resolution puts it, but in an environmentally-responsible and social market economy. Mr Karas, you have just used the term ‘social market economy’, but you voted against it in the committee. It is astonishing how the Conservatives and Christian Democrats in this House have refused to talk in terms of the social market economy, and I can tell the Members on the other side of the House that they can correct their group’s embarrassing mistake in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in tomorrow’s plenary vote, by voting in favour of our amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are in favour of tight controls on mergers, their strength must lie in their taking into account their effects on society and on employment and in their giving workers and those who represent their interests a say in decision-making processes. That is a suggestion for the Commissioner. We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists are also in favour of tight controls on subsidies, but subsidies can be eminently justifiable if they lead to modernisation, improved competitiveness, innovation, sustainable growth and the creation of long-term employment. What I would like to see is even greater attention being given, when assessing subsidies, to the effects – including the positive ones – on the whole chain of exploitation within which the subsidy is made. We have already had a whole series of debates on this.</p>
<p class="contents">My time is running out, so I will end with a question to the Commissioner. Commissioner Monti, you have now become acquainted with our resolution – from the last part-session in Strasbourg – on services of general interest, in which we spoke out plainly in favour of codecision by this House on a legal framework, which means that it cannot be regarded as assent only to a block exemption regulation – which is the impression I got from the Commission’s reaction. We have also asked whether there is to be a follow-up within the life of this Parliament, which has not much longer left to run. We cannot have any more long-drawn-out discussions, and so I would like to know how work on this within the Commission is progressing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a number of current issues that, in actual fact, have a very great deal of bearing upon consumers: those of competition within the car sector, the decision concerning Microsoft and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that, in October 2002, the new regulation, with exemptions for sales and service, came into force within the motor vehicle sector. Our intention was that it should increase competition and give consumers more. Unfortunately, it has had quite the opposite effect in the country I know best, namely Finland. Qualitative selection criteria have become quantitative, and the number of repair workshops for all the large makes of car has declined by several dozen. In Lapland, in northernmost Europe, repairs of particular makes of car can only be obtained in the county government seat of Rovaniemi. At the service station in medium-sized Muonio, five makes could be serviced on 1 October 2002. Now, no such services can be provided. What does the Commission intend to do about this matter?</p>
<p class="contents">Where Microsoft is concerned, we heard yesterday that the Commission is close to reaching a decision on Microsoft, Media Player and the abuse of a dominant position. We again call upon the Commission to finish its investigation as quickly as possible and to take decisions that guarantee a genuine market and freedom of choice for consumers. As emerged from the parliamentary question to Commissioner Monti in December 2002, we expect you to look seriously at this issue so that all new businesses are given a genuine opportunity to operate and so that certain standards do not become <span class="italic">de facto</span> standards that reduce competition and the free flow of information.</p>
<p class="contents">Intellectual property rights, together with the monopoly and the standards that sometimes come about mean that much of the right to competition is rendered ineffective. That too is something I hope you will look at, so that there is no repeat of the situation we experienced in my own country when the Market Court had to find Gramex (the Copyright Society of Performing Artists and Phonogram Producers) guilty of abusing its dominant position. When shall we see a decision concerning Microsoft? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am addressing you in particular, Commissioner. Through the Resolution of 14 January, Parliament has just confirmed its desire to legislate in this field. In our view, the Commission therefore urgently needs to say, ‘yes, we are going to prepare a legal act under the codecision procedure’. The aim is to increase the scope of public authorities to choose and to act, in particular local and regional authorities, and to ensure that the rules of the internal market and of competition are compatible with the inalienable rights in terms of services of general interest. With this in mind, we wish to establish common principles, criteria for specifying exemptions and derogations on competition rules and funding. We now have codecision power, with Article 95, interpreted in the light of Article 16 of the Charter. The draft constitutional treaty also aims to strengthen that power. I would like to point out that the Commission should implement the rules ex post, but certainly not decide on them itself ex ante. That is the job of the Treaty, the Court of Justice and the legislator. We are concerned about abuse of power by the Commission, in the name of its competence over competition, and we think that it has a degree of legal confusion, particularly as regards funding.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is not up to you to say whether or not funding is legitimate and in particular what is aid and what is not. It is only after the rule has been made that you should ensure compatibility with competition. There is therefore necessarily an area of possible conflict between the legislator and you. That is why, after the Altmark judgment, we ourselves wish to clarify under what conditions financial compensation under public service obligations is not covered by the rules on State aid. You wish to interpret Altmark yourselves through a communication, and we wish to do it through a legislative act.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission, having been authorised by the Council, may decide to implement a rule of exemption from notification with regard to State aid. In fact, services of general interest have an increasingly economic dimension. However, our resolution rejects your use of Article 86(3) to decide everything yourselves, claiming an urgency that has been denied for many years. We are therefore asking you to establish a provisional derogation so that the codecision procedure can ultimately clarify the general conditions for validation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, taking into account the disputes that there already are against your services and the bodies responsible for services of general interest, we have grounds to ask you to respect our resolution that services such as health, social housing and even social services should be excluded from the scope of application of competition rules and only come under the control of the Commission in the event of abuse of discretionary powers. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that we wish the future codecision act to establish a right to own production, so that the threat of intrusion from the Commission will not always be brandished under cover of the argument of distortion of competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On paper on 3 July 2004 we will create 25-country electricity markets. In reality, the market is becoming an oligopoly. Germany and France and their companies EdF, Eon and RWE presently control 40% of the electricity production in Europe and 50% of all the grid and the balancing capacities. So, Commissioner, you are asking for national competition authorities to able to act and to create competition in the national market. The Eon-Ruhrgas merger and the decision by the German Government show us that the German Government has the option of having national championship-building and is not playing the game of establishing a competitive market in Germany. Their idea, and this is also the idea of the French Government, is that their three companies will dominate the European market. These two countries have also been successful in blocking ownership unbundling, and thus the complete separation of interest between production and grid, which is necessary if you do not want these companies to control new entrants and you want more competition in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">These two countries have also been able to block access to decommissioning funds, and thus these three companies buy up the other companies. My analysis, as Parliament's rapporteur on the electricity market, is that today in the European Union we do not have the relevant instruments to cope. The only country to be really successful in establishing a competitive market is the UK, because when the British opened the market they had a tough divestment policy. France and Germany will not touch divestment policy. We thus need an instrument to impose on them, at European level, the divestment of their two big companies. Otherwise there is no hope at all for competition in the market, for lower prices, or for innovation</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I address myself to you, President Cox: this is the first time in 25 years that the European Parliament has not been able to discuss the annual report on competition policy which, concerning an area that is increasingly more central to European politics – one only need flick through the daily newspapers – is one of the most important documents published by the Commission. In recent years, the debate in the European Parliament on the annual report has always been the most important – if not the sole – occasion for the democratic scrutiny of competition policy which, although having an increasing impact on the life of European companies and citizens, is one of the areas where Parliament’s role is merely consultative.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have repeatedly called – as we did during the work of the Convention, on behalf of the European Parliament – for codecision in relation to competition policy. We have not been able, for the first time in 25 years, to secure a debate on the European Commission’s annual report. This conjuring trick – because that is what it is – which meant that we did not hold an open and timely debate in the European Parliament on the general outlines of the Commission’s competition policy, has led us to today hold – thanks to the availability of Commissioner Monti – a debate in a vain attempt to replace the one that we should have had. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Conference of Presidents has a grave responsibility; there has been a misunderstanding about the fact that this report – who knows how – as of this year should no longer be considered an obligatory report, but rather an own-initiative report. The Conference of Presidents did not want to remedy the situation which had been created and today we therefore find ourselves with half a debate, with a Parliament split down the middle on competition policy. This is, in my opinion, a very serious situation that must be noted and criticised as a disgrace in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming now to the subject, Mr President, Commissioner, of this report which in reality brings to the plenary, in a manner of speaking, the report for which I was appointed rapporteur, adopted in committee, I want to make three points: first of all this report welcomes the commitment with which Commissioner Monti and the Commission have implemented a major programme of legislative and organisational reforms in the Directorate General for Competition. Last week the Council gave the final go ahead to the new regulation on the control of mergers: as Parliament’s draftsman on that subject, I must express my regret at the fact that the amendments – which I consider important – suggested by Parliament were not adopted, in particular as regards the automatic transfer to Brussels of some of the most important concentration and merger operations and powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Two further points, the first of which concerns national champions. I agree with what was said a few moments ago by a Member in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: in Europe the process of liberalisation of crucial sectors such as energy is influenced by the policies of national champions. We have national champions in certain sectors – not just energy, but also telecommunications – which are often also national champions under public ownership, in which the State finds itself playing the dual role of controller and direct acting manager of companies. In such situations, in my opinion, irrespective of the difficulties involved – we are confronted with the major countries of the European Union, extremely large and powerful companies in Germany, France and also in Italy – the Commission must keep up its guard and, if possible, attempt to obtain more positive results than those achieved so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is that of the liberal professions: a key component for the future of the European economy which is increasingly a service economy. In so many countries the growth of that sector is stifled by the survival of corporate limitations which operate to the disadvantage of consumers and to the advantage of the professions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a more general point about competition policy, also in relation to the amendments tabled to the resolution that we are due to vote on tomorrow. I believe Commissioner Monti’s policy has a sole, crucial, extremely important objective: to guarantee fair competition, to guarantee competition in open markets for all European companies. It would be an extremely serious mistake and an illusion to think that the choices made by Commissioner Monti must have a direct impact on specific social or employment aims. The best way to guarantee employment, growth and resources earmarked for social measures is to guarantee economic growth and competitiveness in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share his objections to the highly unusual procedure that has been followed here for holding in this House a debate on competition policy. In my opinion, a debate on such an important part of Community law should be carried out through the front rather than the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has undertaken a substantial revision of competition policy, but unfortunately not all its changes are for the better. As rapporteur on merger control, I have already stated my opinion that it is wrong to force the Commission’s powers of investigation under the Regulation on merger control into line with those pursuant to the Regulations on cartels. Mergers are not punishable in themselves, but the formation of cartels is. I hope that the Commission will yet consider reversing this decision. The Commission’s persistence in shifting from the market dominance test to the ‘substantial lessening of competition’ (SLC) test, too, against Parliament’s advice, is most regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">The market also needs clear competition legislation and a reduction in administrative burdens. Prior impact assessment of new legislation is a very important means to this end. Looking at the impact that the Regulation on distribution is currently having on the motor vehicle sector in the Netherlands, I can see developments towards the dominance of certain parties, particularly the importers. Of course, that was surely not the intention, and this is why prior impact assessments are potentially very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I am currently working on a report on institutionalised impact assessments for European legislation, and I am assuming that the Commission will also subject competition legislation to an impact assessment in the future. In view of the imminent enlargement, it is most important for the Commission to examine state aid in the acceding countries and to make it transparent. I have heard reports that, in certain sectors in the acceding countries – the Czech banking sector, for example – the levels of state aid entered in the State Aid Scoreboard are incorrect and should be adjusted upwards. I hope that the Commission can shed some light on the course of action it intends to take if it emerges that candidate countries have given it incorrect information on the state aid they have granted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I can tell you that I do not endorse the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. The modifications that they propose relate to policy areas that are not covered by the Commission’s competition policy. These proposals would result in confusion and legal uncertainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fitoussi’s intention here is to stress the current fragility of the structure of economic governance in the EU, while acknowledging the vital role played by competition policy in economic governance. Executive, legislative and legal powers also fall within the competences of the minister for competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition in European culture is a means of progress and development and never an ideological end in itself. It must consequently strengthen and consolidate a market economy that does not abandon its social dimension and always responds to the needs of the consumer. This policy must therefore involve all EU institutions, especially Parliament, as this is the body that represents all European citizens. At a historical moment, when the EU faces challenges in terms of social and economic progress, and when it also feels the need to re-shape the institutional framework that governs its workings, Parliament can hopefully take on new competences within the scope of this policy that are not merely consultative.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition policy will only be successful, however, if the Commission is able to create equitable conditions, whereby rules can be applied across all Member States. Progress has been made in this respect during the past year, but this is an area of competence that requires constant work, especially given the difficult economic situation, which makes it opportune for Member States to use state mechanisms and aid in order to safeguard companies and their own citizens’ jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The report tabled by Commissioner Monti is to be welcomed and represents hope for an improvement in competition policy within the EU. Parliament’s motion for a resolution, subject to the approval of some amendments that have been tabled, will also constitute an extremely important guiding policy document and provide a sound basis of support for the Commission itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Competition policy, as has been pointed out, is one of the fundamental policies which the Commission is responsible for. Its implementation and application is very difficult and subject to many pressures, I would therefore like once again to congratulate Commissioner Monti on his success in implementing this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are certain aspects which worry us and which other Members have pointed out. The first, naturally, is that we must not lower our guard. The pressure from economic and political interests to sidestep market rules is logical, and we must always balance, for the benefit of citizens and consumers, the free exercise of market mechanisms in order to ensure an efficient market with a correct allocation of resources. It is therefore obvious that we must counteract these pressures, since it is logical, and we economists know it, that the tendency of any company is to control the market, if it can be done in an oligopolistic way, all very well, but if it can be monopolistic, even better, and in certain sectors there are still very significant distortions, as has been mentioned here.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would obviously like to point out is the Liberal Group’s traditional position that there should be a section in the Court of Justice to deal with these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final point would be to ensure, both in the Commission and in the other institutions of the European Union, that the operation of the courts responsible for competition, at all levels within the Union, is correct. If it is rigorous in certain areas but not in others, we are obviously giving comparative assistance which distorts the situation of the markets, and even more so, as has been pointed out, in view of the enlargement which will take place in a few months’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made these observations, which I would like to leave as suggestions for application in the future, I would like to repeat that we in the Liberal Group are in agreement with the positions expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Della Vedova, and we congratulate Commissioner Monti on his wonderful work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I condemn a despicable system in which, in secret board meetings, a few individuals can decide the fate of thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of human beings. The European Parliament never condemns this type of dictatorship, for that is what it is, and this is one of the worst types of dictatorship. Moreover, in the pharmaceutical sector, we are talking about people’s health, and these corporations, which are some of the most profitable, make their profits by plundering social security.</p>
<p class="contents">So why should the workers in those companies, the people, not have the right to monitor the decisions, why should they not have the right to force the billions in profits made thanks to the work done by them all to be used for something other than enabling the giants of industry to buy each other out, why should they not have the opportunity to force them to make the choices dictated by collective interests rather than just by those of the shareholders?

Mr President, I wish to thank all Members for their support of the Commission’s competition policy, and even, in some cases, for their generous comments regarding this Commissioner. I must say not purely as a matter of course but out of full conviction that the dialogue with this Parliament and the support from this Parliament apart from minor disagreements on specific occasions has been, and I am sure will continue to be, a strong driving force for the European Commission in the area of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Several subjects have been touched upon. I will not be able to address each of them in depth. However, it seems to me that there is a large consensus on the fact that competition policy is indeed one key component of the social market economy. By its very nature, it addresses the market component of the social market economy. However, it is also connected with the social aspect, even though on some occasions this might not appear to be the case. It cultivates the market dimension of the social market economy and is specifically of benefit to consumers. The comments from right across the political spectrum, from Mr Karas, Mr Rapkay, Mr Della Vedova, Mr Doorn and others, although with different tones, fit into this general framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, imperfections remain in the single market. I totally agree with Mr Karas. Competition policy has to try to make the single market single and open and is therefore one of the driving forces of Europe’s competitiveness and economic development. As Mr Rapkay said, competition policy is an instrument, not an end in itself – I totally agree. It is a rather delicate and sometimes powerful instrument, but it is not an objective in itself. If it were, it would not be such an interesting instrument to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rapkay also mentioned the need for the strict monitoring of state aid, but also pointed out that state aid should not act against the need for sustainable development. Again I agree and, in particular, I would like to point out that some specific guidelines and frameworks in the area of state aid are almost explicitly aimed at sustainable development, for example those aimed at supporting renewable energies, employment creation and research and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>There have been many speeches about services of general economic interest, particularly from Mr Herzog, who as we all know is the rapporteur on this fundamental issue, and from Mr Rapkay and Mr Doorn, who particularly highlighted State aid in the new Member States, and from a few others.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to services of general economic interest, we have obviously very closely followed the Herzog report and the European Parliament resolution of 14 January on the Commission Green Paper on services of general interest. With regard to follow up on the Green Paper, there still needs to be a debate within the Commission on the nature of the proposal to be put forward. With regard to the funding of services of general economic interest, I would like to respond quickly to Parliament’s demand that legal security for enterprises be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Soon, following on from the Altmark judgment, I will propose a package to the Commission based mainly on three texts: firstly, a communication from the Commission specifying under what conditions public service compensation could constitute State aid; secondly, a Commission decision applying to small public services and hospitals, to obviate an obligation of notification under certain circumstances; and thirdly, a Community framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation, more for large public services. I will not go into further detail, because I still have to present these three texts to my fellow-Commissioners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Thors mentioned the car block exemption regulation, a subject which was also touched on by Mr Doorn. We are, of course, permanently monitoring the effects of the new block exemption regulation. Many questions were asked about the impact of the new rules; it is far too early, however, to draw a final conclusion, especially because, as Parliament will recall, the centrepiece of this structural change will only enter into force on 1 October 2005, when the location clause for dealers is abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we are closely monitoring compliance with the new block exemption regulation by all agents in this complex market. Initial trends indicate greater price convergence and we believe the process is fully under control. Mrs Thors referred to the situation in Lapland; we are always interested in learning of any situation that may present particular problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Thors also touched upon an entirely different but not uninteresting specific case: that of Microsoft. She urged us to reach a prompt conclusion on that matter. What I can say in this context is that we are indeed nearing an end to this case. It is fair to say that we have investigated this case thoroughly and carefully. As you may recall, we sent three statements of objections to Microsoft. In November 2003 the Commission listened to Microsoft and interested third parties at a hearing in Brussels. This was the final step in our procedure and it should therefore come as no surprise that the Commission has reached a draft decision. I cannot, of course, go into any more details on this at present, as the Commission has a duty to keep its investigations confidential. However, I hope for the moment that this answers the point on Microsoft made by Mrs Thors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mrs Bordes, sometimes, human catastrophes may happen. That is your expression. Speaking in general terms, yes, there are sometimes sacrifices, at least temporary ones, associated with mergers – not always, but often. We also, however, need to consider how the European economy could gain the impetus to enable it, in an increasingly open global economy, to achieve – and if possible to increase – a degree of competitiveness in order to safeguard and increase employment, if it did not have the possibility of being regenerated and restructured, including through mergers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that many studies show that mergers have not subsequently fulfilled the promises that those responsible attached to them. Our monitoring of mergers is – as you know – more limited; the aim of it is to check for the possibility of consequences that could be damaging to the competitive structure of the market and to consumers. Our role is not to replace the shareholders and others involved in the economic governance of the enterprise in taking the basic decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
