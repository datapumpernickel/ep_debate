<p class="contents">Work is in progress to tackle cybercrime (Council of Europe, the G7’s Lyon Group). In addition, the Commission has recently made proposals and is now considering taking new measures at Community level to combat crime. Apparently the Commission is discussing a paper with the Member States without even informing Parliament that it is doing so. One of the measures under consideration is a requirement for service-providers to gather and store traffic data and, upon request, supply it to the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission realise that such a measure could present enormous risks to personal data protection and the protection of sensitive commercial data and would facilitate industrial and economic espionage?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission realise that such a measure might destroy users’ confidence in the Internet?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission realise that such a measure would be inconsistent with the Commission’s recent eEurope initiative, the aim of which was to encourage the use of the Internet both by private individuals and by businesses?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission considers that any solution to the complex issue of preservation of traffic data should achieve a fair balance between the different needs and interests of those involved, while fully ensuring fundamental human rights with regard to privacy and personal data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">There are quite different, important concerns to be taken into account. On the one hand, privacy protection authorities have considered that the most effective means of reducing unacceptable risks to privacy, while recognising the need for effective law enforcement, is that traffic data should in principle not be kept only for law enforcement purposes. On the other hand, law enforcement authorities have stated that they consider the preservation of a minimum amount of traffic data for a minimum period of time necessary to facilitate criminal investigations. Adequate security of any preserved traffic data will have to be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Industry should be helped in the fight against crimes like hacking and computer fraud, but not be confronted with measures that are unreasonably costly. Furthermore, industry will have a key role to play in contributing on a voluntary basis to the process of creating a safer information society. Users should have confidence in the safety of the information society and feel protected from crime and from infringements of their privacy. The e-Europe draft Action Plan, prepared by the Commission and very recently adopted by the Santa Maria da Feira Summit of the European Council, includes the establishment of a coordinated and coherent approach to cyber-crime by the end of 2002 in order to ensure greater cooperation on these key issues. In the same context of the e-Europe initiative, as well as in the multiannual action plan on safer use of the Internet, the Commission plans to support a number of actions aimed at stimulating the use of the Internet and promoting security and confidence among the users.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We perhaps, therefore, need to discuss this in the future in order to get a complete answer.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want to combat cyber crime. It is important that it is crime that is curbed and not the new economy. To this end, all parties concerned must be involved in this consultation and present their views in good time. This not only applies to the EU institutions and Member States, but also to the consumer and industry, so that we do not find ourselves in a situation of inconsistency in which one hand is doing something relating to the eEurope initiative, while at the same time we are doing something else in connection with crime. It is a question of creating confidence in development if <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce<span class="italic"> </span>is to work. Therefore, the work cannot be carried out in secret. Rather, it is important that we obtain analyses in this area of the consequences of the proposals. In Feira it is precisely consumer confidence that is being identified as a key factor for the development of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with a follow-up question: when will we get an assessment of the consequences for consumers, industry and economic espionage, which may otherwise be in danger of developing? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not the intention of the Commission to do anything in secret generally and more specifically, in this area. On the contrary, we are trying to promote broad consultation on this issue, which is a very difficult one. Nobody has yet found the right answer. We have to follow the discussions that are going on in several international fora, for example the special convention the Council of Europe is preparing on cybercrime and the discussion on OECD. We also need to follow very closely the evolution of the legislative amendments that are being introduced in several Member States, dealing with the very sensitive question of retaining traffic data for the purpose of law enforcement.</p>

But as you can imagine, in this new field we have to address the need to reinforce security on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, in the sense that we have to recognise that each Member State is entitled to adopt its own national legislation to guarantee law enforcement at national level. What we in the Commission do is to coordinate efforts at European level to guarantee law enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">Our approach is to guarantee minimum common levels of law enforcement at European level, which does not prevent Member States introducing more stringent or national legislation. Nevertheless a comparison of national legislations would be an important factor when we adopt common rules at European level. I cannot give you a broad picture at the moment because in several Member States, such as the UK, legislation is still under preparation and has not yet been fully adopted by the national parliaments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From Cologne via Helsinki to Feira we have gone from an ambitious vision to concrete targets, first military and now also civilian headline goals and the establishment of new specific structures.</p>
<p class="contents">This very welcome development has given substance to the objectives of the ‘Petersberg principles’ as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty. Like their incorporation into the Treaty a few years ago this has only been possible with the full and active support of all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is too early to say whether any further Treaty change in this area is required at this stage. There has been no formal discussion of the European Union's defence dimension in the IGC framework so far. The presidency report to Feira indicated that the conclusions of Cologne and Helsinki could be implemented without it being legally necessary to amend the Treaty unless the Council's decision-making powers were to be altered or the Treaty's provisions regarding the WEU needed to be amended. The presidency has suggested that the issue of a revision of the ESDP provisions in the Treaty should remain open to examination as required before the Nice European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the specific question of the position in any future defence cooperation of EU Member States that do not belong to Nato, this is first and foremost an issue to be addressed by the Member States concerned. What is clear is that the military headline goal agreed at the Helsinki European Council will require a concerted and coordinated effort by all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the shape of individual national military contributions, these will be discussed at the pledging conference to be held in the autumn under the French presidency. Again, how non-Nato EU states view their role and what their contribution to the defence dimension of the European Union should be is rightfully for these Member States to say. But it may be helpful to distinguish between two component parts of the overall European security and defence equation, the Petersberg tasks of peace-keeping and peace enforcement on the one hand and territorial defence on the other. The European Union's stated aim is to be ready to support action within the framework of Petersberg tasks. All EU Member States have agreed this and are ready to contribute to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The excellent record of the European neutrals in the field of peacekeeping and crisis management operations has come very much to the fore in the new European security context. All four Member States which are not also members of Nato are contributing actively and constructively to the development of CFSB in general and to the European security and defence policy in particular. Their contribution to the last IGC was indeed crucial to the inclusion of the Petersberg tasks in the new Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have no doubt that their contribution in this area – materially as well as in the ongoing discussions shaping the new structures of cooperation will continue to be both active and ambitious, be it in the military or non-military dimensions of conflict prevention, conflict resolution and crisis management.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The adoption of the Rome Statute – on which the ICC is founded – was an important step in breaking the tendency towards the systematic use of rape as a strategy of war.

It is in fact two years since we adopted the agreement. At the same time it only needs a fifth of the 60 countries to ratify it in order for the treaty to come into effect. It is, of course, very doubtful whether it will be done in time for December this year. It is, however, extremely important, because the treaty from the Rome Conference is the first international agreement that establishes that rape and forced pregnancy can be treated as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Experience from those courts we have set up, namely the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, clearly show that the present system is inadequate for dealing with the type of crimes I have just mentioned. However, in order for the ICC to be able to work, broad international support is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Commission is therefore: Have you any plans at all to try to persuade important countries such as the United States, Russia and Japan to also sign the agreement from the Rome Conference? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have seen in that context and in other criminal activities is of course the most powerful argument for us getting ahead with ratification of the convention by as many countries as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I am right in saying that 160 nations decided to establish the international criminal court and the statute of the court was approved by about 120 states, so there should be no problem in moving from the 50 who have ratified to the 60 figure which we require in order to move things forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We have certainly pursued the importance of ratification with the United States. We do not, as the honourable Member will know, accept the US position on the ICC. We continue to argue our case with them and we will argue it with Russia and Japan and other countries as well. It comes up fairly regularly in our bilateral contacts and I would make sure that it did if that were not the case. We think this is potentially an extremely important institution, particularly in view of some of the appalling things that have happened in the last few years.

<p class="contents">The Brenner is one of the crucial transit routes via the Alps and is therefore a good example of the need to act in a balanced way, with regard to both railways and roads, in order to protect the environment and, at the same time, guarantee the free movement of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the railways, the Commission – as the honourable Members know – supports the measures adopted by the Member States to develop and implement the Brenner railway project.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brenner high speed railway line has been included on the list of maximum priority Community projects and has received considerable Community funding via the Trans-European Networks.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the roads, we must stress that an increase in road traffic in no way automatically implies more pollution. For example, the Eco-point system has shown that the emissions of polluting gases from lorries in transit through Austria have dropped despite the increase in the number of journeys made.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the Commission will continue to seek solutions to the environmental problems caused by traffic. In this respect you should be aware that the Commission has committed itself, in this year’s working programme, to producing a communication on traffic in the sensitive regions of the European Union, which include the Alpine region.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of this communication will have an influence on the future actions envisaged which, according to the initial guidelines, will include a coherent package of supplementary measures to reduce the effect of traffic in sensitive areas: technical standards to improve environmental and safety requirements, instruments for setting tariffs in order to adjust the levels relating to transport to the real cost of transport in all its forms, and an increase in the efficiency of transport, especially by improving intermodality, and increasing the competitivity of rail transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you are talking about a price which discourages transport, the problem is that high tariffs are being paid to cross certain specific areas, when there is currently no alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, until the implementation of the agreement with Switzerland – and I hope that will be next year – which has been ratified by the Swiss people, an agreement which will undoubtedly open up alternatives to the current routes and will allow some of the north-south traffic to use certain corridors through Switzerland, there are not many alternative routes, especially because certain routes have had problems with tunnel accidents in recent times.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I believe that the main effort should be made with regard to creating better rail connections, which may be real alternatives, which may really even transport lorries by rail. This is one of our current objectives. However, such a complex and accident-prone area, geographically, requires projects, which we are working on, which need time to develop. This in no way means that we have abandoned them. On the contrary, we are continuing with the idea of taking them forward with the support of the Commission and the support of the countries involved. This is the reason for the creation of a public interest association, seeking public-private funding, given the size of the project and possible future viability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 22 January 2000 edition of the Turkish ‘Hürriyet’ newspaper reported that some of the funds provided by the European Union to assist the victims of the earthquake which occurred last year were used to purchase 35 automobiles to a value of TRL 500 billion to facilitate travel by Turkish MPs. Can the Commission state what was the total amount of funding granted by the European Union to Turkey following the disastrous earthquake last year and what measures were taken to ensure that the Community funds were properly used? What is the Commission’s position concerning the above allegation contained in the ‘Hürriyet’, a Turkish newspaper with a very wide circulation? More specifically, will the Commission demand the return of those funds which were used for purposes other than that for which they were intended, in flagrant violation of Community rules, in order to satisfy consumerist requirements of Turkish MPs rather than providing assistance to the victims of the tragic earthquake?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The programmes were started in August and are still ongoing.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the specific question relating to an article in a Turkish newspaper on the 22 January, I can say that there is no Community funding involved in what this article relates to. We have received assurances on this from two different sources. Written confirmation has been received from the Commission's representation office in Ankara that the article in question makes no reference to European Union or any external source of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Also there has been confirmation from ECHO's office in Istanbul that the Turkish Parliament Foundation is a private organisation established by, and financed by, the parliament members individually. The way the money is being used is decided by the council of the parliament after being voted by the members.</p>
<p class="contents">The background for the newspaper article was that a unilateral decision was made by the head of the Turkish parliament to allocate funds to the earthquake area. These funds had earlier been earmarked for the purchase of 35 cars for members of the parliamentary council and the council members objected to this reallocation considering that the original decision to buy new cars should be reinstated in the interest of cost-effectiveness. The funds in question actually belong to the Turkish Parliament Foundation and this is financed by the members of parliament in Turkey.</p>

What bothers me is the fact that the Hürriyet, which is, I believe, the most widely read Turkish newspaper, did not meet with any denial on the part of the Turkish Government and, as we all know, freedom of the press is something of a problem in Turkey. Journalists who go off the straight and narrow and report this sort of information are not just reprimanded, they are usually thrown in jail and sometimes even killed. But I do want to believe that the reply given by the Commissioner following a thorough investigation by the European Union authorities in Turkey paints the right picture. If indeed no such thing has happened, allow me to make a little joke by saying that, in that case, instead of giving these cars to Turkish MPs, they should give them to the MEPs in the regions, who are unable to use their cars and travel by public transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission participates actively in the Livestock Environment and Development initiative. The members of the steering committee here are Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, the UK, the USA, Costa Rica, EFAT, the World Bank, the FAO, Senegal, India, China and Kenya. The initiative's targets are the protection and enhancement of natural resources as affected by livestock production while alleviating poverty. Earlier work under this initiative has identified on a global scale the consequences of increased pressure on grazing and mixing farming systems, and the dangers of the shift to industrial modes of production. It has highlighted the close and complex interaction between government policies and the environmental impact of livestock production, and identified a large number of technologies which are available to mitigate the negative effects in all different production modes, provided the appropriate policy framework is in place. So this is something we are giving quite some attention to. The problem is that it is very big and it will probably be growing, but we are participating actively in the best international efforts to do something meaningful.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If they were all to aspire to eat a US diet we would need four planets the size of earth to produce the extra 9 billion tonnes of grain required. And, in particular, would he agree, or disagree with the FAO when they say that the trend of further intensification of demand in production is inescapable?

This is a very clear pattern and demand for more protein is also increasing. These statistics, the extrapolation if you will, should be taken quite seriously. On the other hand, many projections have been made about where we would be today, which are definitely not being fulfilled. We adopted in the Community already in 1989 a directive on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. In addition, a protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam relates to the protection and welfare of animals, and these policies and ideas are of course taken into account in the Community's development aid in the livestock sector. We have never supported any husbandry industrialisation project, but we have been supportive of an intensification of traditional farming systems of benefit to smallholders, and environmental conservation has always been taken carefully into account.

<p class="contents">This total amount is composed of two decisions taken in the autumn of 1999, one of them relating to EUR 2.4 million, the other for EUR 10.2 million allocated under the 2000 budget. A little more than EUR 10 million are currently under implementation. ECHO is constantly monitoring the further development of the situation and a contingency of EUR 4.8 million for the northern Caucusus has been set aside within ECHO's annual budget, so financially we are prepared to do more.</p>
<p class="contents">If the evolution of the situation should require, these additional funds then can be mobilised. Among ECHO's implementing partners are the UNHCR, the ICRC and several European NGOs. During the first months of the crisis, humanitarian operations mainly focused on the important concentrations of internally displaced persons in Ingushetia and to some extent on the limited number of victims who have found refuge in Georgia and Daghestan. More recently operations have increasingly been focusing on Chechnya itself. Unfortunately humanitarian aid work in some areas of Chechnya strongly affected by the hostilities is still not possible, as lack of security makes these areas inaccessible. ECHO programmes in the northern Caucusus cover a broad range of aid sectors, for example, food, medical aid, shelter, water, sanitation, essential relief items and psycho-social assistance. Planning of future assistance has to take into account the volatility of the situation on the ground. In order to facilitate programming, ECHO carried out a technical assessment mission in Chechnya in May. Pending a positive evolution of the general working environment, a further increase in operations inside Chechnya itself will be a major priority. Bearing in mind that a quick return of all the displaced persons currently residing in Ingushetia becomes more and more unlikely, it will also be necessary to duly take into consideration an adequate follow-up to the on-going operations in this area.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Nogueira Román, I pay close attention to the information which we request and which the Member States send to us on this question. I am able to tell you that, to date, the Commission has not identified any Member State which has failed to apply the principle of additionality when implementing the Structural Funds, as defined in the general regulation, especially since Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to be perfectly objective, I do realise that, since this principle was introduced in 1989, difficulties have arisen as regards the transmission of information to the Commission by a number of Member States, from the point of view both of the methodology used and the regularity and frequency of the reports. In view of these problems and in order to solve them, the Council decided, at the Commission's proposal, to simplify the control and application of additionality for the new programming period starting this year and ending in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, Mr Nogueira Román, additionality is now only verified three times during the period, rather than annually. In the same spirit, each Member State is allowed a certain degree of flexibility in setting the starting point for average expenditure between 1994 and 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I am, objectively-speaking, satisfied with the ex ante verification of additionality prior to the adoption of programming documents for 2000-2006. But that does not mean that I shall relax my vigilance, nor does it mean that I shall stop asking questions; as I have reminded several governments, I shall continue to monitor the application of additionality closely. Most Member States have sent in appropriate information, especially regarding funding. This information indicates, generally speaking, that their own structural public expenditure has been maintained and, in most cases, that there will be an average substantial increase in this expenditure between 2000 and 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to point out that several of the least developed countries benefit from both regional policy funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is true, Mr Nogueira Román, and there is a text with which I must comply, stating that the Cohesion Fund is not subject to additionality requirements. It is not subject to this principle because, may I remind you, the Cohesion Fund was and still is there to help less developed Member States catch up and, in numerous cases, accede to monetary union. That is one part of my reply.</p>
<p class="contents">Now you are calling on me in your question to use the general regulation at my disposal and really ensure that the principle of additionality is applied. I must admit that there is a weakness in the regulation as regards possible sanctions for countries which do not comply with this principle. That is why I put in so much effort, in a preventive sense, when we approve the Community support frameworks, when we approve the SPDs, when I meet the ministers who come and see me, when I go and see them in the field, almost every week in some region of Europe, in stating my attachment to a number of principles. The principle of additionality, the principle of partnership, compliance with major policies – we shall discuss that later with Mrs Frassoni – and compliance with the major European policies, especially environmental policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the general regulation for the Structural Funds makes no provision for specific sanctions for Member States which do not apply the principle of additionality. However, in application of article 11 of the general regulation, the Commission makes and will continue to make approval of Community support frameworks, SPDs for 2000-2006 and mid-term approval and reprogramming conditional upon our departments being sent information on the principle of additionality and compliance with it by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have it; I have been frank with you. I admit that there is a weakness from the point of view of sanctions for those who do not comply with additionality. At the present time I am being particularly clear and attentive and I can assure you everyone will have an extremely precise mid-term meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Barnier has said that from 2000 to 2006 there will definitely be an increase in expenditure but nothing guarantees that the state increase in expenditure will be focused on the areas which the Community has taken as targets for structural funding. Indeed, Mr Barnier has made it absolutely plain that the Community does not and cannot inquire into that point.</p>
<p class="contents">So it seems to me a little bizarre that we spend ages trying to build up exactly correct structural maps in the full knowledge that nothing under the additionality principle actually guarantees that the Member State will increase expenditure in the region in question. That does seem to me to be a radical fault in the concept of additionality and one that needs to be reformed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, you must expect a Commissioner to implement the policy which you want and to comply with the texts and regulations laid down by you and the Council. In this specific case, I said ‘a weakness’. When I say ‘weakness’, Mr Nogueira, Mr MacCormick, I do not just note that it exists, fold my arms and say: ‘That's how it is, there is nothing I can do!’ I am not a fatalist. So, as soon as we start preparing the new regional policy for 2006 and 2013, I shall ensure that account is taken of these weaknesses and shall submit my proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">There is probably another point which needs revising, as Mr MacCormick has pointed out, and that is that we need to check if the principle of additionality is being applied and we can only do so at national level for both Objective 1 and Objective 2. That is our problem. We can confirm that the principle is being applied at national level and, at the same time, that it is not being applied in a region where it is needed. That is what Mr MacCormick has highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">Again vigilance is my watchword and has been, especially vis-à-vis the United Kingdom. I ask questions, I draw attention to specific cases pointed out to me, as the honourable Member has done. Nonetheless, I must also say that the regulation does not allow me, on this precise point, to issue instructions. I can do no more than demonstrate that I am keen to enter into dialogue and that I am available, in the case which you have pointed out to me and in every other case, to do so as actively as possible, while at the same time complying with the general regulation of the Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission is negotiating the new 2000-2006 Structural Fund programmes.

<p class="contents">Several Member States have yet to send in lists of zones to be protected under Directives 92/43 and 79/409, more generally known as the Natura 2000 Directives. The Commission has instituted proceedings before the Court of Justice against the Member States most in arrears. On arriving at the Commission, and because I am in charge of regional policy and also because I was Minister for the Environment in my own country and have an irrevocable passion for and commitment to these issues, I decided to take a close look at the problems of coherence, in a continuing bid to prevent and anticipate. But our predecessors, Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs Wulf-Mathies had already worked on this and I and my colleague Margot Wallström decided to get on and regulate this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in agreement with Mrs Wallström, I submitted guidelines to the Commission which were approved on 14 March. I personally sent these guidelines to each of the Member States on 28 March. I would draw your attention to the fact that these guidelines only apply to the Member States which still have not notified the sites for protection under the Habitat and Birds directives by the time the Commission approves the programming documents for the new period 2000-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">This guideline calls on Member States to take immediate action to present their lists of sites protected under Natura 2000 as quickly as possible and, in addition, to undertake to ensure that sites protected under Natura 2000 are not damaged when projects cofinanced by the Structural Funds are implemented. In the event of any irregularities in connection with the conditions of implementation, i.e. if undertakings to submit lists of protected sites are not honoured, the Commission will formally notify the Member State in question of its intention to take any suitable measures immediately, in accordance with the provisions of the general regulation on the Structural Funds or the regulation on the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the Commission will be able to have recourse, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, to provisions governing the suspension of payments, unless special circumstances apply. Because these guidelines were only recently adopted – when the Community support framework for Portugal was approved on 14 March – and the new programming period 2000-2006 is only just starting, I am honestly not in a position to quote specific examples. </p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about putting these new provisions into practice in specific Member States; let me also tell the honourable member that, to date, the overall situation concerning the submission of lists of Natura 2000 sites to the Commission is unsatisfactory, at least in five Member States: Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium and the United Kingdom. These are the countries on which we are keeping a very close watch, as I mentioned earlier in connection with another matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This plan will promote the structural reforms needed so that Greece can honour its commitment within Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations to establish this Community support framework have allowed certain aspects of the strategy for the regional development plan to be strengthened, especially with regard to education, vocational training and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, Mr Hatzidakis, the challenge which we must take up together is to genuinely achieve these objectives by ensuring that the Structural Funds and the corresponding national funds are managed efficiently. The Commission has drawn the attention of the Greek authorities – I personally have done so twice on two visits to Athens within the space of nine months – to the need to set up efficient administrative structures before Community appropriations are transferred. The most important thing is to set up management authorities and, as a matter of priority, the management authority for the Community Support Framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has welcomed the intention of the Greek authorities to adopt a new specific legal framework by the autumn, to regulate all these matters. I personally – since I shall be in Greece for an official visit to Athens and Crete in October – shall have an opportunity to specify and verify this point. Negotiations on the adoption of the Community support framework are in the final stages, even though a number of points have yet to be finalised, with regard mainly to the distribution of financial allocations and the definition of the implementation system.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect and we hope, Mr Hatzidakis, that these points will also be quickly finalised. Negotiations on the adoption of operational programmes have started in parallel with the final stage of negotiations on the Community support framework. These negotiations are progressing normally and I trust that we will be able to approve certain programmes by the end of August.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On page 1-119 it says that if the 2nd Community Support Framework had been completed between 1994 and 1999 in accordance with the relevant plan, this would have increased the average annual rate of growth in the Gross National Product for the 1994-1999 period by 0.6%. This would have meant additional GNP in the order of GRD 1.6 trillion over and above what we actually had. The government accepts this and, between the lines, I think that you accept that there are problems with the public administration in Greece. More importantly, I think that you will have problems with the management committees and I should like you to tell me specifically what you intend to do with the Management Organisation Unit and relations with the Ministry of the National Economy, which could be better? What is to be done about outsourcing the external employees whom we need? Will there be incentives and penalties from now on in order to ensure that the Community Support Framework is applied correctly to those who need it? More importantly, what is to be done about the gaping wound in the Social Fund in Greece which, in my view, is no more than a black hole which just swallows up Community funds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is well aware of the problems, especially those which you have just pointed to in connection with the operational nature of the Management Organization Unit<span class="italic">.</span> We think that Greece, which is now a full member of the Economic and Monetary Union, is more conscious of its administrative weaknesses and of the need to rectify them than it was in the past because all this is essential, as you have quite rightly said, if maximum profit is to be derived from the new third Community support framework now getting under way.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, Mr Hatzidakis, we shall monitor how implementation progresses very closely, both within this framework and within the context of our regulatory powers and I shall not fail, if necessary – let us not talk of sanctions – to do my duty.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as more efficient management is concerned – over and above what has already been done under the previous Community support framework, – I would remind you that the Greek authorities have agreed to draft a bill adapting administrative practice to the rules of the Structural Funds. This law is based on the provisions included in the Community Support Framework. The same authorities will also need to appoint qualified people, define administrative responsibilities and ensure that there is proper information and training for staff at all levels. The computer system for integrated management will also need to be fully operational.</p>
<p class="contents">We have stressed, Mr Hatzidakis, the importance which we attach to translating agreements into an efficient organisation on the ground, well in advance of payment of the first appropriations by the European Union for the new programming period.

I do not intend to sit ensconced in my office and content myself with receiving ministers passing through Brussels. I want to go and see for myself. I spent last week in a region of Finland. As I said to Mr Hatzidakis, and at his invitation, I shall be going to Crete, to one of the Greek regions, in October.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the way to accept one’s responsibilities, not by repression and not by sanctions. I do not want to point my finger or make a priori judgments. I prefer education.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, for example, I convened a seminar at the beginning of June to which all the management authorities throughout the European Union in charge of Objective 1 appropriations were invited. 500 administrators attended, from all the management authorities, from the whole of Europe. And I shall do likewise, in the autumn, with the Objective 2 management authorities. We have also invited Mrs Theato, the chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the Court of Auditors, to help with this financial and managerial education programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I referred earlier, during my reply to Mr Hatzidakis, to training. Before getting caught up in regional management – I must also respect this notion of decentralisation – I want to check with the Commission's normal contacts, i.e. the Member States, that all the systems really are in place. So I shall be checking with the Greek government that everything is in place at the level of this new Community support framework. And the framework to be implemented must of course include a proper evaluation system for each region, especially proper management and disciplinary systems, as well as the principle of responsible decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that you understand my position on this issue, but I must first work with the national governments, because that is how the Structural Funds need to be managed at this stage, within the framework of the general regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Reclamation work in Dublin Bay</span></p>
<p class="contents">Reclamation work is taking place in Dublin Bay in an area submitted for designation as an SPA last July under the Wild Birds Directive. The boundaries of this extended SPA were altered, following representations by the Dublin Port Company to Duchas, so as to enable the company to carry out its proposal to infill 52 acres of Dublin Bay in order to expand the port, chiefly on economic grounds. However, according to documents secured by an NGO, Dublin Bay Watch, following a request under the Freedom of Information Act, it emerged that objections made by a local authority were rejected by Duchas on the grounds that ‘the proposals to designate an extension would proceed unless a scientific case was made’. Final designation and submission to the Commission of the altered SPA occurred last February. Dublin Bay Watch has complained to the Commission and provided extensive evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this information, will the Commission initiate legal proceedings against the Irish Government for altering the boundaries of an SPA, and will it urge the Government to redesignate the entire SPA as it was first advertised in July 1999? Does the Commission intend to withdraw EU funding of such a project and prohibit any work which would seriously affect an SPA? Does it believe that the public consultation process was adequate in this instance and in line with the EIA Directive?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, it knows of the concerns about the exclusion of an area of about 20 hectares from the 1999 extension to the Sandymount Strand and Tolka estuary special protection area in Dublin Bay classified under the Community's Wild Birds directive.</p>
<p class="contents">While included in the 1999 proposal for extension of the SPA, the area in question was omitted when the extension was finally adopted at the end of 1999. By way of background: the 1999 proposal for extension followed a Commission request to the Irish authorities to enlarge the SPA. It was particularly concerned to ensure that major Community investment in sewage treatment for Dublin would take place within the legal framework provided by SPA status.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal deadline for completing Irish SPAs expired in 1981 and the Commission has for some time been concerned that the Irish SPA network remains incomplete. In April this year the Commission notified a letter of formal notice to Ireland under Article 226 of the EC Treaty in which it drew attention to the general failure to complete the Irish SPA network. Dublin Bay was mentioned as a partially classified important bird area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not aware of any intention to use Community funds in relation to the port reclamation project.

For decades they have ignored their obligations under EU directives. As regards the special protection areas they have completely ignored their obligations. In this case they have basically done what they want. They change the boundaries whenever they feel like it. The public consultation, in my mind and in the mind of many of the local people in the Community, is completely and totally inadequate. This is just one more example of the way that the Irish government is behaving in relation to its obligations under EU directives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask you, Commissioner, are you going to push much further with the Irish government and explore every possible avenue. I welcome the recent decision on fining Greece and I would like to see the same thing happen with the Irish government if they fail to comply with directives. It seems the only thing they are willing to listen to is the threat of fines. Unfortunately the taxpayer will have to pay the fines but real pressure has to be put on the government at this stage because they have got away with it for far too long.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Management of toxic waste</span></p>
<p class="contents">Environmental organisations in Greece have alleged that toxic and hazardous waste is being buried without any controls. Of the 264 571 tonnes of hazardous waste produced in 1999, a mere 0.12% was shipped abroad for incineration. There are no controls on the disposal of waste produced by the lead-acid accumulator recycling plants. Greek Electricity Board (DEI) condensers with substantial amounts of Clophen have been abandoned at Aspropyrgos. In Attica there is only one incinerator with a capacity of 0.5 tonnes of hospital waste a day, even though some 20 tonnes of such waste is produced a day. As regards PCBs, Greece has no processing facilities and it is unknown what happens to them. Over the last ten years no substantial steps have been taken to ensure the proper management of this waste. </p>
<p class="contents">Article 16 of Directive 78/319/EEC<a href="#def_1_5" name="ref_1_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> states: 'Every three years, and for the first time three years following the notification of this Directive, Member States shall draw up a situation report on the disposal of toxic and dangerous waste in their respective countries and shall forward it to the Commission'.</p>

The Commission has very little information on waste management in Greece. Greece did not report on the implementation of waste management legislation between 1989 and 1997. However at the end of last year Greece answered four questionnaires regarding the implementation of four waste directives. According to that answer 280 000 tonnes of hazardous waste were generated in Greece – the year is not indicated – of which 95 760 tonnes were recycled, though Greece indicated that it has no installation for the processing or disposal of hazardous waste. The hazardous wastes are reported to be either temporarily stored or exported for final disposal in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion that a number of Community requirements are not being complied with by Greece and has taken action under Article 226. The most important aspects concern the absence of management plans according to Article 7 of Directive 75/442 on waste, Article 6 of Directive 91/689 on hazardous waste and Article 14 of Directive 94/62 on packaging and packaging waste, the failure to transpose Directive 94/62 and transmit data according to Article 12 concerning the packaging waste industry, the absence of a programme according to Article 6 of Directive 91/157 on batteries and accumulators containing certain substances and non-compliance with Articles 4 and 11 of Directive 96/59 on the disposal of PCBs and PCTs.</p>

According to the report from the European Environment Agency on the state of the environment, the Topic Centre on Land Cover 1998 estimated that there are 750 000 polluted or potentially polluted places within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Current EU legislation, like that which is proposed, focuses on the prevention of pollution. Directive 96/61 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control, the IPPC Directive, states that Member States must take all necessary measures that are required in order to restore industrial land that is no longer in use. Such measures must already form a part of the operational situation. This directive must be enforced completely before November 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Another instrument which may help to prevent future pollution of land is the directive that we are currently working on in relation to environmental liability. To deal with pollution that occurred in the past, certain Member States have developed special financial instruments – there are taxes or different funds that have been set up for this purpose. It is already clear that this type of clean-up costs, or will cost, Member States very large sums of money. At EU level, the European Regional Development Fund can contribute a certain amount of support. I might also add that I can see how big a problem this is in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, however, not as yet planning any form of global or European clean-up strategy. As far as the past pollution of land is concerned, the proximity principle ought to be applied, because national, regional or local authorities are in the best position to deal with these issues. Also, this type of pollution is not a transnational issue, and the problem is not first and foremost an administrative one, but a financial one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Up to now we have mainly regarded this as a local and national issue. In order to be able to clean up in the best way possible, we need to consider what sort of pollution is involved and what the local conditions are like. We have nothing against creating a strategy, if the Member States also want that, but in that case we must also get hold of the resources to deal with it. As it looks so far, this has not been something that we have given the highest priority to, but naturally I think that it is very important for a proper inventory to be made and for a plan to be drawn up by the Member States, and why not also research and development in the area in order to find the best methods for cleaning up polluted industrial land. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very evidently a problem that must be dealt with at national, regional and local levels. However, if the Member States should so desire, we obviously have nothing against taking on this task. I think that we are already doing this when we see that there is great necessity for doing something. For example, in connection with the follow-up of the disaster in Baia Mare, we are trying to identify where the hot spots are and to see if we can identify dangerous places where we really need to keep our eyes open to ensure that no new disasters happen. When it comes to the pure clean-up work, I certainly think that the proximity principle ought to be applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 45 by Arlette Laguiller (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0548_EN.html">H-0548/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Fireworks factories</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 2 June 2000 an explosion occurred at the Liborio Fernandes fireworks factory in the Portuguese village of Lanhelas. Nine people were injured, and the village was badly damaged. A similar explosion has just occurred at the Pyroma de Feugueyrolles factory in France. These two explosions, which occurred only a few days after the tragic incident near Amsterdam, not to speak of the persistent explosions in Spain, are a reminder of the danger posed by these factories when they are located in residential areas. The manufacture of fireworks has become all the more dangerous since the old craft methods gave way to industrial methods. This means both the stockpiling of more explosive substances and greater reactivity.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures does the Commission intend to propose in order to impose or strengthen safety standards aimed at eliminating the risk of explosion in these firms, to prohibit the location of such firms in residential areas, to prevent the transport of explosives from posing a threat both to the transporters and to the inhabitants of the areas through which they pass?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The manufacture and storage of pyrotechnic substances is covered by Council Directive 96/82 of 9 December 1996 on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, the so-called Seveso II directive. This directive obliges operators of establishments having dangerous substances within certain threshold limits to establish a major accident prevention policy. It also obliges them to set up safety management systems and emergency plans and to demonstrate this to the public inspection authorities by submitting a safety report.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Seveso II directive contains the new provision recognising that the implications of major accident hazards should be taken into account in the land use planning policies of the Member States. These are obliged to pursue the aim of the directive, that is, the prevention of major accidents and the limitation of their consequences for man and the environment. This has to be done through controls on the siting of new establishments, modifications to existing establishments and new developments such as transport links, locations frequented by the public and residential areas in the vicinity of existing establishments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term land use planning policies shall ensure that appropriate distances between hazardous establishments and residential areas are maintained. Member States shall also ensure that all competent authorities and planning authorities responsible for decisions set up appropriate consultation procedures. The inclusion of this provision can be regarded as a major step forward in the process of major accident mitigation.</p>
<p class="contents">A review of the Seveso II directive is already under way. After a full investigation of the accidents that occurred, the Commission will evaluate the threshold limits assigned to pyrotechnics substances as part of the review. A proposal for amendments to the Seveso II directive should be ready by the beginning of next year, that is 2001. This can only be done when we have evaluated the experiences following the accident in Enschede as well as the accident in Romania. This process will be carried out in close cooperation with the Member States, the European Parliament and other interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The transport of explosive materials is covered by Directive 94/55 on the transport of dangerous goods by road. This directive makes obligatory the provisions of Annex A and B of the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road for road transport within or between Member States. Annex A contains the provisions concerning the packaging and labelling of dangerous goods and Annex B contains the provisions concerning the construction equipment and operation of the vehicle as well as the minimum training requirements for the driver. The application of this legislation guarantees a high level of safety for the transport of dangerous goods including explosives.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It appears perfectly obvious to me that factories such as this, companies such as this, really should not be located near residential areas. The tragedy in Enschede, in the Netherlands, illustrates this all too clearly and in Portugal, which I referred to in my question, 159 houses in the village of Lanhelas in the province of Minho were hit by the explosion. Some were completely destroyed, others were partially destroyed and the victims’ protection association that has been set up has estimated the damage at over EUR 1 billion. I think that we urgently need to get these directives applied and to introduce others prohibiting firework factories near residential areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
