<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kathleen Van Brempt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you see before you a very happy rapporteur, because I think that we – and I very much emphasise the <span class="italic">we</span> – have produced a report that will hopefully soon be adopted almost unanimously, as all political groups in Parliament have worked intensively on it and in close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and the regulations it addresses have a lengthy history in this House. It had its origins, specifically, in the recovery plan launched in 2009 in the wake of the economic crisis. At the time, EUR 4 billion was freed up at European level, and these funds were earmarked specifically for economic recovery. The objective was that that money should also finance energy projects in particular: large-scale energy projects, devoted to carbon capture and storage, to infrastructure, and to a number of large offshore wind energy projects.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time, Parliament having of course approved these projects, there were quite a few objections from various quarters and from Parliament itself, especially vis-à-vis the large-scale nature of the undertaking and the question of whether this or that project would create enough jobs. However, the most important criticism regarded energy efficiency. This was followed by a political agreement and the current situation is the result of that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">You would think that if Parliament, the Council and the Commission reach a political agreement about investing all surpluses in energy efficiency, that the report and the negotiations would be easy. That was not the case. We have been through some difficult negotiations, especially with the Council. However, I can say that we – and we did have to reach a compromise, let us be clear about that – were able to score a home run on most of the points. I would like to run through them briefly because they are crucial to a proper understanding of the current situation concerning the funds and how they should be implemented in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this is about renewable energy projects but, in particular, those which focus on energy efficiency. That, Commissioner, is what lies at the heart of the energy debate these days. I am very much in favour of renewable energy, but we know that, if we want really rapid results, we have to invest all our efforts in energy efficiency: it is a good solution if you want to reduce consumption; it helps alleviate the major problem of energy supply and – a very important point – it ensures lower energy costs for our companies and families. That is incredibly important. We are also working on industrial policy and we will definitely get back to you on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and this is very much linked to energy efficiency, the local level. Very often, Europe works almost exclusively with national Member States, and even the previous recovery plan focused primarily on major projects. Well, this one could not be more different. It focuses on the local level, on cities and municipalities, on small-scale projects which can be implemented immediately, delivering immediate results, and which can thereby have a major impact, not just on energy efficiency but also on jobs. That remains a very important consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, funding. The previous major recovery plan consisted of what we call upfront funding; simply subsidising major projects, whether by means of cofinancing or not, because that is specific to Europe. It is the typical way in which Europe works. However, that is not the case with this fund and, for that reason, it is very innovative. The way resources are used here is by providing support in order to get those projects funded through guarantees and other financial means. With the exception of technical assistance, which is still funded through upfront funding, this means that you will have major leveraging. You need to multiply those EUR 146 million by approximately eight in order to get an idea of what the impact could be.</p>
<p class="contents">I have now come to my last point, over which we have squabbled for a long time: the cap on money; that is, the money that is available to us. Parliament would have liked to see a different solution; which, indeed, was what we had agreed, let us be clear about that. Any remaining funds had to be invested in this project. We have reached a compromise: all the funds that are left over today have been registered and I firmly believe that this will mean that this project will be assured a long life – and I think that, if we carry on working together as we have done, we will also be able to ensure that it becomes incredibly successful for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one more second, Madam President. I know I have run out of time. I would once again like to expressly thank everyone who has worked on this, in particular, all the shadow rapporteurs. I was particularly pleased with our cooperation, and I am not saying that out of politeness, but simply because it was an example of very fine and effective cooperation. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Up to this point, as part of the implementation of the programme established for us by Parliament and the Council, we have made 43 financing decisions for gas projects, energy infrastructure projects, offshore energy and carbon capture and storage. This has allowed us to spend around 98% of the entire budget of EUR 3.98 billion and to ensure that the programme has, to a large extent, achieved its objectives. There were only a few projects which could not be implemented. We are introducing this amendment regulation with the aim of meeting Parliament’s requirements and initiating pilot projects for renewable energy, but importantly, also for energy efficiency. I regard these pilot projects as an opportunity to trial our activities in the field of energy efficiency, which will be one of the focal points of my work over the next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Van Brempt very warmly. I would also like to thank all the strident Members of this House and the Belgian Presidency, because we have worked hard in this area over recent weeks and we are able to present a document today which will definitely provide a stimulus in the area of energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that this amendment regulation, which is due to come into force now, takes effect quickly, our officials have already been making preparations for its implementation. In the next few days, EUR 146 million will be made available for projects which are important to all of you. Our partners in these projects, chosen by you, are municipal, local and regional authorities which have close links with the projects in question. These local partners will ensure that the funding is used in the best possible way, for public buildings, private buildings, combined heat and power facilities, district heating networks, decentralised renewable energy sources, more environmentally friendly urban transport systems and local infrastructures, such as intelligent networks, efficient street lighting and smart measurement systems. This means that we are doing something which will have an immediate local impact and which will act as a benchmark for my future activities relating to smart cities.</p>
<p class="contents">If you make the appropriate decision today, our offices will begin implementing the amendment regulation straight away. In March or April of next year, we will definitely be able to report that our economic recovery programme is having a very positive effect, in the form of both large projects and small, decentralised projects, and is allowing us to learn lessons which will be important in future financial years. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include. This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt. This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject. Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt. We are very concerned about this. It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas. We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued. We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so. This is where the budget needs to be more flexible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have seen a few timid signs, not yet brought up to date, in the Marguerite Fund. This represents, for us and for the PPE, a benchmark method to be followed for intelligent use of the European Union budget. The instrument is an ad hoc fund that deploys various methods such as loans, guarantees, equity shares or cofinancing, and will be governed by a special asset management company.</p>
<p class="contents">The fund was set up with an initial sum of EUR 147 million and we do not understand why the door cannot be left open for the other residues due to the Recovery Plan. A significant sum could be raised by applying significant leverage through the EIB, the KfW, the Deposit and Loan Banks and other financial institutions, and this could have a great impact on the start-up of projects considered valid and given economic and environmental priority.</p>
<p class="contents">From my point of view, the central aspect of the fund that will be set up by the end of this year is that it could become a kind of virtuous pilot project for the future organisation of a broader energy fund for appropriate inclusion in the next financial perspective 2014-2020. This principle could also be repeated for other sectors, such as TEN or eTEN networks. If you would allow me, some tangible sign at this critical time in the face of an employment crisis would make us all a little happier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EUR 146 million has been provided for projects which will be crucial for Europe and for the various countries and, in particular, as the Commissioner has said, for the local and regional authorities which will, I hope, be handling this money or these grants. </p>
<p class="contents">I first of all want to congratulate the rapporteur on the presentation of her report on financial assistance for energy projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly welcome this initiative, which provides for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The financing of projects in this area will help to stimulate economic recovery in Europe, and indeed in my own country, Ireland, and help to create new employment opportunities and also help in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">In all parts of Europe now, and particularly in my own country with a very high rate of unemployment, we want to ensure that all funding can be diverted into areas where jobs can be created. The funding of EUR 146 million which is available under the amended proposal must be targeted towards projects that will have a rapid, a measurable and a real impact on economic recovery. EUR 146 million is the funding that is available, but there is a multiplier of at least six or seven times that amount, which will be the overall investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the establishment of a dedicated financial instrument will allow for this funding to be administered in the most efficient manner and the beneficiaries, as I said in my own native language, will include local and regional authorities. We all have a responsibility to bring this to the attention of those authorities, and our government will be making an individual application and then liaise with the regional authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I firstly want to thank our excellent delegation from all parties, under the leadership of Kathleen. I think we did a good job. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> I would also like to praise Mr Oettinger. Unfortunately, during the presentation of the energy agenda yesterday, we were obliged to be highly critical. However, this instrument has also come about because you have made a personal effort, in part in the face of opposition from the German Government and your partners in the Christian-Democratic Union in Germany, to ensure that it was able to happen. </p>
<p class="contents">Why is it a small and bitter victory? Because – and some have said this – this is EUR 150 million for the decentralised, the local, energy investments, where, on the other hand, we have billions – one billion for carbon sequestration, for example. I am still wondering if this one billion will be used. We are getting increasing indications that this project will not work. There is no balance between the decentralised, near-to-the-citizens, local-area projects and the big projects, some of which will, I think, fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we, as Greens, nevertheless voting for this project today? It is because we are optimists. We are optimistic that this EUR 150 million, well managed, will create the base for a much bigger instrument which we will get under the next financial perspective. There are two conditions for that. The first condition is quality projects. I think that the EIB and KfW, which will manage it, will also look at deep renovation, and not only shallow renovation, projects. We need to leapfrog, especially when it comes to buildings and efficiency. The second condition is cutting the red tape for the local authorities that will apply for projects to get cofinancing.</p>
<p class="contents">These two issues are crucial. Therefore, my questions to you, Commissioner, are: what will the Commission do to make sure that this fund will finance or give credit to quality projects? And how will the Commission act to cut red tape so that local authorities have easy access to these funds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Green energy should also be supported. However, it should be said honestly that the idea that green energy is the solution to all of Europe’s energy problems – a kind of thinking which is often expressed here – is an illusion. However, the Union does need large, and I stress large, investments. The basic purpose of these is to ensure diversification of fuel supply. Such a solution is possible, for example, by building the Nabucco gas pipeline to connect the huge gas deposits in the region of Central Asia with customers in Europe and by developing transmission networks and building new interconnectors in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We do want to develop green energy, but at the same time, unfortunately, development of methods for extraction of shale gas is being completely overlooked and is not being appropriately funded. This is an unconventional gas which is already playing an enormous role in extraction in the United States and is giving America complete independence in terms of access to gas. Large amounts of this gas are found in France, Poland and Bulgaria. Here, in the face of the opportunity to use this great potential, complete passivity is to be seen. European solidarity requires that the Union support these projects as strategic for its future and as projects which guarantee the uniform development of all European states. It is a pity we are not talking, today, about great investments which will really solve our energy problems and unite and develop the European Union. While we are talking about important measures related to green energy, let us, however, remember that the idea that green energy will solve our energy problems is an illusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are here to discuss a very specific programme to aid economic recovery, which is in the crucial area of energy in this case. In the current crisis situation that we are experiencing, proposals such as this one that help create jobs are essential. There is no chance of restructuring the economy if we do not make job creation our priority. This report sends a very positive message by drawing our attention to how to respond in this area at local level: how to respond specifically to local needs. We are in a period when we are debating, and will debate a great deal more, a series of legislative proposals in the field of energy, and we often tend to concentrate too much on the large-scale projects and networks, forgetting other causes in which intervention is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that this report could help us not only to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is very important, but also to provide concrete benefits for local communities, which naturally means concrete benefits for the European public as a whole. That is why, Madam President, I wish to conclude with two final points: it is important never to forget that energy efficiency is also achieved, to a large extent, by cutting energy use through microgeneration projects like those included in this report; and, finally, it was a great victory for this House to ensure that the amount of financing to be allocated to these projects would be specified. That was not what we were aiming for, because we needed much more.

The support for measures in the construction industry to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, which annually consume up to 40% of energy in the EU, shows the justification for, and good sense of, this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding to cover the activities of this financial instrument may be obtained by transferring unused resources from a number of programmes in which it is not objectively possible to use the allocated funding in time to the planned extent. An example of this would be the European Energy Programme for Recovery, which has a financial reserve of around EUR 150 million, as well as the multi-year GR programme for the climate sector, which was set up with a similar aim. I therefore think it would be very sensible to consider how we might best use the financial resources saved in order to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and, it would seem, necessary, single purpose financial instrument for supporting energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewables.</p>
<p class="contents">We can make it easier for public bodies at the local, municipal and regional levels to implement projects in the area of energy saving and renewables thanks to this effective new financial instrument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it was up to the Member States, this figure would be substantially lower. Unfortunately, however, the legal form and structure of the fund remain uncertain, as does the question of what financial projects it will provide. In the interests of transparency, potential applicants should know who will decide on applications and how the selection committees will be appointed.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to dispel the suspicion that the newly established fund is targeted mainly at those who have not used the resources allocated within the EUR 5 billion package of the economic recovery programme due to non-implementation of projects, representatives of the new Member States should also be included in the selection process. The fund may be primarily intended for local and regional authorities, but we should also consider whether it would not be appropriate to allow private entities to apply as well, and not just where they are acting on behalf of public bodies. Increasing energy efficiency and the share of renewables should be a shared responsibility of both the public and the private sector, and European funding should therefore be available to both sectors.

It is positive because its procedures and timeframes are fast; positive because it is aimed at highly qualified project categories; positive because it is aimed at urban contexts, in other words, at local authorities which, by making specific decisions, are able to bring about real change in the state of affairs and improve air quality, housing quality and urban transport quality; positive because it is aimed at profitable projects and can therefore yield a return of resources; and positive, lastly, because the strategy will bring many more resources into play.</p>

Unfortunately, this action has not been taken at the right time. Indeed, the ‘smart cities’ initiative has only had a small amount of money allocated to it due to the fact that, ultimately, if any funds remain unused, the Commission must allocate this money to the ‘smart cities’ initiative, which is happening via this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled an amendment calling for the level of management expenses and costs linked to creating and implementing the instrument not to exceed 5% of the value of each use so that the largest share of the money does not end up with financial intermediaries, but goes into investments for projects linked to energy efficiency in homes and the use of renewable energy resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I also called for greater transparency and for the site www.buildup.eu to be used, not to mention for the applied model, whenever this instrument is used, to be made available free of charge to anyone who is interested so that we can benefit from best practices.</p>

However, there are obvious shortcomings in terms of funding. The main aim of the European Energy Programme for Recovery is precisely to facilitate the funding of investments in this area. Its efficient implementation requires compliance with all environmental legislation and project promoters must keep to their funding commitments. In my view, active cooperation between national, regional and local authorities would facilitate the issuing of the required permits.</p>

At that time, the money was intended for just two types of projects, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, i.e. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and wind farms in the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as this assistance and assistance for renewable energy in general is concerned, we generally cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach for the whole European Union. We must take into account the situation of each Member State, in particular, as regards energy independence. I therefore welcome the European Commission’s proposal to review the procedures for the allocation of money according to the programme mentioned, taking into account the promotion of energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I feel that we should not talk about this purely in the context of the financial crisis, because even once a normal economic cycle has been restored, the issue of energy efficiency will remain.

The European Energy Programme for Recovery, which is now being proposed, should be welcomed. Priority issues in this project are, in my opinion, support for cross-border gas and electricity infrastructure projects, including inter-connectors, and also support for Carbon Capture and Storage projects. I also consider it necessary to insist that the draft resolution also include projects in the area of electrical efficiency and renewable energy sources, which stimulate economic development by creating opportunities for additional jobs and help in the fight against climate change.</p>

Firstly, I would like to say thank you, because you have fought to ensure that it was not EUR 114 million, but EUR 146 million, and that the Member States were prepared to go slightly beyond their rather restrictive limit.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the experimental laboratory is concerned, we have four interesting questions to resolve. The first question is how we can achieve success in the field of energy efficiency. I believe that, of the three requirements relating to CO<span class="sub">2</span>, renewable energy and energy efficiency, the 20% increase in energy efficiency presents us with the most difficult and complex challenge. This is not just about mandatory national requirements, but about specific projects. Basically, we are using this manageable programme to evaluate which projects, such as building renovation projects and those relating to the field of energy in general, will be feasible. I hope that in two or three years, the first assessment of these projects for the next budget period will show that we have had some useful positive and negative experiences with regard to energy efficiency. I would like to make it clear that in two to three years, we will definitely be more knowledgeable than we are today and that we will have had some good experiences and made some mistakes. If this is the case, we will have invested the money wisely.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this programme allows the European Union to enter into a direct partnership with the municipalities. This is something which does not happen every day. It is clear that the energy requirements and consumption in public buildings and in private buildings that can be renovated, in other words, a smart city approach, can only be influenced by the EU via the municipalities. This means having direct contact with what is actually happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I hope that we will be able to demonstrate with this programme that there is European added value for everyone. If we were only to obtain money from the Member States without providing any added value, we would be unnecessary. We must offer added value in the form of experience, effectiveness and competence. In this case, within two years, this programme will give us good arguments that we can use in the budget debates – a poker game involving the Commission, Parliament and the Member States – to obtain more money from the Member States in the interests of all the citizens of the European Union. This means that this is also an experimental laboratory for more budget funding. This controversial issue will affect every one of us over the next two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need an experimental laboratory for our partnership with the structural banks – the European Investment Bank (EIB) and KfW Bankengruppe – and with external private investors and funds. This means a partnership that goes beyond the Commission’s offices with companies which have a close relationship with us, but which must demonstrate that they can do more than just manage public money.</p>
<p class="contents">This may seem like a large amount of funding, but in fact, it is very little. This is not about the EUR 146 million. It is about a four-way test of our partnership with the municipalities, with the EIB and KfW, with the subject of energy efficiency at a local level, and with the proof that at a European level, this is the right area for more budget funding.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I would like to thank you very much. Let us stay in contact. I am sure that in two years, we will all know much more than we do now.</p>

We have heard some comments and very many good examples have been given. However, the connecting thread here is the enthusiasm over what we have achieved. Not without criticism, because I could very easily criticise the cap on money that has been set.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great deal of enthusiasm because this a good fund, because the money is available, because this is about energy efficiency and renewable energy and because this gives us, as Members of the European Parliament, the opportunity to take local action, too, through this project. That is what is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">What is our common responsibility? In the first instance, of course, responsibility lies with the Commission, the European Investment Bank and other partners in this story. However, Parliament and us politicians are also responsible for ensuring that this project becomes a success, that it has a canvassing effect, and that involvement at local level becomes so large that the EUR 146 million multiplies not by eight but by 80, so to speak, because we have set many things in motion. In that regard, I have a lot of confidence in the Commission and the Commissioner. I know that this is a project which is close to the Commissioner’s heart. He also has very good staff – as I have seen for myself over the past few months – and that will be very important for the outcome of this project.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude – I forgot to say it earlier, which is really remiss of me, particularly as a Belgian – I would make the point that the Belgian Presidency has given an exceptional account of itself here. To begin with, from the outset, a large majority in the Council was actually against this project. It is thanks to the major efforts of Minister Paul Magnette and his team that we now have a very good compromise and one that we will soon, I think, also adopt with a great deal of enthusiasm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our discussion today on the report amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 is of particular importance: the proposal to use otherwise unused financial resources to support sector projects represents an opportunity in these times of difficult access to funding. In my opinion, the European Energy Programme for Recovery, which aims to finance initiatives and projects in the sector of energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies, supporting the investment of European public authorities, in particular, in urban settings, can give a tangible stimulus to the recovery of the European economy and the creation of job opportunities for young people. I am encouraged by measures on energy efficiency in the building sector, which uses 40% of EU energy, and that would represent a support to small and medium-sized enterprises at local and regional level. This assistance would also favour the development of promising initiatives in the energy efficiency sector at the level of local authorities which, due to the recent crisis, have suffered a drastic reduction in revenue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also pointed out that the aid package neglected the Central and Eastern European region, which is most threatened from the aspect of energy security, and that energy efficiency projects did not benefit from the aid either. However, it would have been precisely through energy efficiency projects that the main objective of the package, namely rapid and effective job creation, could have been achieved. I am pleased that the new proposal allocates as yet unused funds to this very field. Renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are not only among the main means of achieving the 20/20/20 targets, but also increase supply security and competitiveness. These projects bring impressive results in the short term as well. They create new jobs in a geographically diverse manner and effectively dynamise economic actors. Spending the EUR 146 million fund on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects is a good start but we must admit that this amount is insignificant even at Member State level. We are very pleased that the Energy 2020 strategy unveiled by the Commission yesterday sets out the creation of an energy-efficient Europe as one of its main priorities. We trust that the strategic commitment to energy efficiency will also be reflected in the distribution of other funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was absolutely imperative to create a financial instrument specially intended for using the funds in this energy programme, which could not be committed until the end of 2010, so as not to lose the remainder of the financial package. One particularly important aspect mentioned in the European Energy Programme Regulation is the geographical balance of the projects. This is a key element enabling the impact of this regulation on the economic recovery to be guaranteed across the whole of the European Union. It also acknowledges that there were projects in some Member States which were either not financed at all or only partially financed. Last but not least, I want to emphasise how important it is to renew these types of financial instruments aimed at promoting long-term energy efficiency in the EU. I call on the Commission to assess carefully the effectiveness of renewing these types of instruments and to examine the potential of using a similar approach in the future when dealing with other unspent funds from the EU budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Energy efficiency and renewable energy have frequently been named as EU priorities helping to implement the 2020 strategy and ensure energy security. Investments in this sector during the economic downturn are very important, as they will create a possibility for new jobs and will promote competitiveness, the spread of innovations and economic stability. Furthermore, the financial instrument planned – like the setting-up of a fund for European financial institutions – will increase the amount available several times over, thus increasing opportunities to finance projects. It is only regrettable that the financial instrument planned is not continuous, but hopefully it will establish a suitable incentive for further energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
