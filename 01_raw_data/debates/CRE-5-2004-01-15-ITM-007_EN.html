<p class="contents">We were all shocked by the brutal murder of Monsignor Michael Courtney – the Apostolic Nuncio, and a man who had been playing a key part in the peace process in Burundi – in a road ambush on 29 December 2003. All the indications are that he was murdered by Agathon Rwasa's rebel FLN. Despite the murder, we welcome the fact that the FLN has now expressed for the first time a willingness to engage and meet with the President of the Republic with a view to opening peace negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November saw the peace process gather momentum, with the signing, on 16 November, of a peace agreement between the transitional government of Burundi and the Forces for Defence of Democracy movement. Yet fighting is still going on in several provinces, especially in rural Bujumbura. The UN Secretary-General has rightly said that the Burundians must experience an improvement in their living conditions if this peace process is not to be jeopardised.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation continues to get worse, and so we urge the African Union and its Member States to exert every possible pressure on the FLN with a view to bringing them to the negotiating table in an attempt to seek a peaceful political settlement. We call on the UN Security Council to consider the rapid constitution and deployment of a UN peacekeeping operation to support the peace process at this crucial moment and to strengthen and complement the African Union's peacekeeping mission, which has already been deployed. We also call on all states participating at the Donor Conference for Burundi to make sure there are sufficient funds for human rights promotion and protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Democratic elections were held in 1993, which gave some hope for the resolution of this bloody conflict. However, this progress was short lived, as the newly elected Head of State was assassinated and this triggered yet another massacre. Since this period, Burundi has lurched from crisis to crisis, with many thousands of people losing their lives in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">A ceasefire was brokered by Nelson Mandela in 2002 but later collapsed. A second power sharing deal was signed in 2003, which finally brought three of the main rebel groups into government, although, regrettably, fighting and abuse of human rights continues in several areas. Only the National Liberation Forces rejected this deal and this group has been linked to the death of the Irish Archbishop, Michael Courtney, who was the Vatican's envoy to Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">Archbishop Courtney was heavily involved in the peace process and played a significant role in bringing about this recent progress. Unfortunately, he paid a high price for his noble and unselfish involvement in the Burundi conflict when he was murdered by rebel groups on 29 December 2003. This was senseless and a terrible tragedy for his family, friends and colleagues from the church.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Ford also pointed out, Michael Courtney made a valuable contribution to the current peace process in Burundi and I would hope there will be a full inquiry into his death which will bring those responsible for his death to justice. Perhaps the tragedy of his death will intensify regional and international pressure on the FNL to sign up to the peace agreement following their long-overdue talks with the government, so that no more lives are needlessly lost and so that peace is finally restored to Burundi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The figure of 300 000 has been quoted – an enormous figure for a small country, but the reality is that we do not know. The murder of the Nuncio is one of the latest acts of senseless violence. The signing of the peace accords has reduced the violence, but the situation is highly unstable.</p>
<p class="contents">The FNL, which still refuses to enter into any agreements, is being reinforced by disaffected elements from the earlier rebel movements that, despite earlier agreement, continue to resist. There are armed militias returning from the Congo, many other armed gangs wandering around and enormous numbers of handguns circulating among the population, handed out by the government itself, allegedly for people’s self-defence.</p>
<p class="contents">There are of course obstacles to the acceptance of the latest group of rebels, for which we are calling, for what real motivation is there to accept them? Those who accept the peace agreements must then give up their seats in government, and the Hutus will then be even more of a minority in relation to the Tutsis. I am aware that these are very sensitive issues in Burundi, but it is known to be the case that the groups that agree to peace must themselves bring on board new signatories to the peace agreements at the cost of their own seats. You will understand that this, in Africa, is a very difficult thing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">A genuine human rights agenda has to be implemented in Burundi, for the continuing violation of human rights is a scandal. Finally, the UN peacekeeping force that we support is probably needed more than ever, as the African peacekeepers have inadequate resources and cannot operate effectively enough. It may be that we can improve matters in the meantime, for this is a matter of extreme urgency. Perhaps then there will be less need of a peacekeeping force from outside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people responsible must be held accountable and punished. The important work for peace done by Archbishop Courtney must not, of course, die with him, but must live on. We also extend our condolences to his family and relatives and to the Irish people. Perhaps what happened may lead to the Irish Presidency intensifying its work to support the peace process in Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unclear who murdered Archbishop Courtney. The rebel movement, the FNL, has denied all involvement, but nor does it support the peace process. We would, however, call upon them to lay down their weapons and support the peace process, and we would also express our pleasure at their having in actual fact agreed to meet Burundi’s President and engage in talks with him. Perhaps that will lead in time to support for the peace process and negotiations. Burundi is a tragic country in every respect, with extensive destitution in social and humanitarian terms, a good deal of violence, especially against women, and acts of considerable cruelty involving a disregard for human rights. The peace process is very fragile. Many people are guilty of extremely serious war crimes. We strongly oppose any move to grant these people any kind of general exemption from punishment. Burundi should instead implement what was decided in the Arusha Agreement and ratify the charter of the International Criminal Court, or ICC.</p>
<p class="contents">The wounds in Burundi following 300 000 or more murders will never heal if justice is not seen to be done and the murderers not held accountable. People must be given the opportunity to move forwards, and the national process of reconciliation must continue. We support the setting-up of a UN peacekeeping operation and hope that the EU may do all it can to help in supporting the peace process. We have high expectations of the donors’ conference later this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am quite sure that Archbishop Courtney's family and many friends will appreciate the support of the European Parliament at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Michael Courtney was known to many of us here in Strasbourg when he served as Observer to this Parliament. We came to know and admire him as a man dedicated to his calling, his work and to peace. He went to Burundi as Apostolic Nuncio and it was there, while returning from a pastoral visit in one of his dioceses, that he was murdered. We have lost a true friend. I would like to tell the House that on learning of his appointment he told me and some parliamentary colleagues that he had a premonition about going there, but he brushed that aside and set about fulfilling his mission there.</p>
<p class="contents">We have lost a brave and distinguished friend and I would like to express my thanks to the Irish presidency for the acknowledgment of the life and work of Archbishop Courtney made by An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern during his response to yesterday's debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is typical of the man that he died trying to fulfil his mission of peace. I am particularly pleased that Parliament's resolution recognises and appreciates the quiet and effective ways in which Archbishop Courtney had been helping the peace process and alleviating the suffering of the people of Burundi. He had been instrumental in persuading some of the rebel groups to give up their armed struggle and had helped to secure the release of hostages last June. It is my sincere wish that his legacy will now be recognised as a man of peace who worked tirelessly for all those in need.</p>
<p class="contents">The military option in Burundi must be abandoned once and for all. The recent peace agreements must be swiftly implemented. On-going hostilities and human rights abuses must halt. Initiatives by the international community, focused on obtaining a political settlement, must ensure that human rights issues are addressed at every stage of the peace and democratisation process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I simply have to say that he was one of the truly great ecclesiastical figures in the tradition of the great Irish churchmen of the Middle Ages, who was always actively committed to the cause of peace and humanity; it was he who made it possible for us, here in Strasbourg, to join together in a service once a month, something he started along with a few of us in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I can still remember how Archbishop Courtney took his leave of us when he went to Burundi to actively involve himself in the peace process there. As soon as his aircraft landed there, it was shot at; there were rockets to welcome him. He then, in peril of his own life, spent five years participating in the peace process, drawing on the wide experience he had gained from his missions in trouble spots on four continents. He was meant to go to Cuba this week to take up office as papal Nuncio there and help human rights and freedom of religion to prevail. His mysterious, brutal and deliberate murder put a stop to that. We should honour his memory.</p>
<p class="contents">He would certainly not, though, want his murder to be the only reason for us to focus on Burundi and thereby forget that murder is a daily occurrence in that country. In recent years, over 200 000 people have been murdered there, not because of what we term ethnic conflicts, but because of a deliberate policy of genocide, and the fact that the situation in nearby Rwanda is even worse, and that in its neighbours Uganda and the Congo no better, should not hide from us the fact that we have a special obligation to this region, tormented as it is by ethnic killings that know no borders. Europe does have obligations here, and our respect for Archbishop Courtney and for his legacy demands that we take appropriate action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission calls upon the government of Burundi to find and bring to justice those responsible for this heinous crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes, with some optimism, the news that the armed movement, the FNL, is prepared to negotiate with the transitional government of Burundi. We very much hope that these negotiations will finally lead to a ceasefire agreement and the integration of this group into the transitional government.</p>
<p class="contents">Events in the last year have demonstrated that the consolidation of the peace process is achievable. The Commission has closely followed and strongly supported the peace process in Burundi, using the instruments at its disposal to ease the conflict and promote reconciliation. For example, we made food aid available for combatants to support the ceasefire of December 2002 and used the rapid reaction mechanism to support the deployment of African Union observers in April 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not wait for the establishment of the peace support facility to prepare an emergency programme to support African Union peace-keeping in Burundi and to make available EUR 25 million for the African Mission in Burundi, keeping the peace on the ground. The financing agreement for this programme, seeking a timely contribution to peace, was signed in Brussels this morning during the visit of the President of Burundi. The Commission is also contributing to economic and social reconstruction. Our rehabilitation programme amounts to EUR 48 million and focuses on economic and social infrastructure destroyed by the civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">Last August, the Commission signed with Burundi the national indicative programme for the Ninth European Development Fund. This programme, for EUR 172 million, will make available much-needed budget support and promote rural development and good governance, including support to the transitional institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission confirmed at this week's Donor Conference on Burundi, this new programme comes on top of the ongoing programmes amounting to some EUR 200 million. Humanitarian assistance, through ECHO, will be continued in 2004, and EUR 15 million is earmarked for that. It should therefore be clear that the Commission has the means and the intention to make a substantial contribution to the peace process and the reconstruction of Burundi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
