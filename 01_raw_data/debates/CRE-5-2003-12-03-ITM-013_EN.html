<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cashman (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the members of the Committee on Citizen's Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for their unanimous support on this very important report.</p>
<p class="contents">To provide a context, at present there is no EU-wide provision uniformly governing the repatriation of mortal remains from one Member State to another. In the absence of any such provisions, cross-border transportation of mortal remains is governed by two instruments of international law, but primarily the Strasbourg agreement concluded in 1973. The world, methods and technology have changed much since then. It is also interesting to note that only some Member States have actually acceded to this Strasbourg agreement, which, in many respects, is obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of the above-mentioned agreements, the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his country of origin results in much more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place, and higher costs than if the death had occurred in the deceased person's country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">We encourage people to live, work and settle in states other than their own national Member State. Currently, over 5 million people reside outside their national Member State; add to this the millions of EU citizens who holiday throughout the European Union every year, and we are looking at a growing number of people who die abroad. Their relatives are faced with appalling bureaucracy through which they have to wade.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has recently stated once again that EU citizens should be able to move between Member States on terms similar to those applicable to nationals of a Member State, and that additional administrative or legal obligations should be kept to the bare minimum required by the fact that the person in question is a non-national.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand at present, it is still far from true that a Community citizen who dies in a Member State other than his own is treated in the same way as a national who dies in his home country. This has been pointed out to the Commission and the Council on numerous occasions by many Members of the European Parliament. We are presented with the ludicrous situation that we are supposed to be a Europe without internal borders, yet as soon as somebody dies, when there is a great need for understanding and sympathy, we erect the borders merely because the body needs to be transported from one country to another. That means that a zinc coffin is required, at enormous expense.</p>
<p class="contents">A family from Coventry in the UK had to repatriate their son who was tragically killed on his first night on holiday in Spain. They were given no help. They were given a mass of bureaucracy – in a foreign language – through which they had to wade. They were given no translation, no help from the consular services and had to meet the cost of over GBP 3000 for a zinc coffin alone. We are presented with a ludicrous situation in which the repatriation of a corpse from Salzburg to Freilassing – a distance of ten kilometres – requires a zinc coffin, but the transfer of a body from Ivalo to Helsinki – a distance of 1120 kilometres – requires no such coffin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that we need a uniform approach to this situation. We are currently 15 Member States, soon to be 25. We are encouraging people to live in other countries, to embrace other cultures; yet when they die, suddenly, the border is erected and the bureaucracy comes into play. It is very simple: in 1973, we were worried about the deterioration of corpses during transit. Embalming is now common, technology has moved on. We have to say to the reluctant Commission that this issue will not go away. All of us here are protected – we have organisations, trade unions and institutions that will return our bodies to where our families want them to be. But imagine for a moment the plight of a mother, Dolores Shambley, dealing with the death of her son, Kris Shambley – barely 20 in 1998. Dolores Shambley is a woman with very little money, who was given very little assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fundamental right. If we are really interested in upholding the rights of our citizens, I urge the Commission to bring forward proposals and accept the principle of free movement. I believe that the right to move freely only ends when the body is interred. There has been a reluctance within the Commission to accept this own-initiative report. Be brave. Be courageous. Accept the challenge. The goodwill is there. I now want the political initiative.</p>

This report sets out very clearly the problems regarding the repatriation of mortal remains that exist within the Union today. I know how strongly many Members feel about this issue. Many Members of this House have personally intervened to assist families of constituents who have faced these difficulties when trying to repatriate the mortal remains of their loved ones. I therefore appreciate the particular importance that must be attached to this issue. The Commission agrees with Mr Cashman that these problems will multiply as EU citizens increasingly use their rights to work and reside in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission fully recognises the importance of this issue and the urgent need to deal with it, I must admit that it has been somewhat hesitant, as the report has clearly pointed out, in determining precisely what to do about this. The Commission has signalled, in response to a number of questions by Members of Parliament, that it does not believe, at this stage, that specific harmonisation is required. I wish to stress today, however, that this does not imply that we cannot move to resolve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming weeks, I shall be asking my colleagues to adopt a directive on services in the internal market, and I believe that directive will help resolve a number of the problems raised by Mr Cashman's report insofar as they reflect restrictions on the exercise and provision of cross-border funeral services. In particular, it will simplify administrative procedures and abolish authorisation requirements that are not consistent with the principle of proportionality. I also hope to be able to deal with the specific problem related to zinc coffins insofar as a coffin is obviously an essential element of the funeral director's services.</p>
<p class="contents">There will remain problems caused by different national requirements such as those on death certificates and autopsies. On those issues the Commission doubts that it is legally possible to apply the principle of the free movement of people to contest restrictions on the transfer of mortal remains. It also believes that harmonisation on these issues would be likely to be contested on the grounds of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mr Cashman once again for this report and I should like to reassure this House that the Commission will seek to resolve as many of the problems raised in it as possible, but I cannot guarantee that we shall solve all the problems, given the uncertain legal situation regarding the free movement of people. In resolving the restrictions to the provision of funeral services the Commission will do its utmost to make Member States aware of the very important problems raised in this report regarding differing provisions on autopsies and death certificates. In particular, we shall indicate that national legislation in this field should respect fundamental rights, and in particular the dignity of people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the Commission on announcing that it is going to propose a services directive and simplify some of the procedures necessary for free movement – in this case of mortal remains <span class="bold">–</span> and we eagerly await the presentation of this proposal by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this issue is of particular importance. It is said that societies are measured in terms of their respect for their elderly people, and even more in terms of their respect for their mortal remains. I believe it is our obligation to make as much progress as possible in simplifying as far as we possibly can the procedures necessary – which affect the families so much <span class="bold">–</span> for the free movement of mortal remains within the Union in the event that death takes place far from their places of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that Mr Cashman – if you will allow me a little humour on such a serious issue <span class="bold">–</span> is showing his great qualities as a politician, because he is showing concern for people who are never again going to be able to vote for him.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the fact that certain countries of the European Union have not signed the Strasbourg Agreement, as the rapporteur has quite rightly said, obliges us even more as the European Union – in view of the imminent entry of ten new countries – to establish certain rules in order to simplify as far as possible the procedures necessary for the free movement of mortal remains within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my own 35 years in the funeral profession, I never encountered the problems of not being able to send home or receive mortal remains. What I have repeatedly witnessed, however, is the appalling conditions in which some bodies have been received because of the lack of proper embalming or care treatment in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, there is no attempt in this report to tackle this serious issue, despite a reference to it in the introduction to the explanatory statement, wherein it is hinted that this is the main problem. The rapporteur has informed me that the Commission would not accept amendments on this essential issue, so the chances of standard systems of embalming being introduced are zero.</p>
<p class="contents">This report will no doubt be adopted nevertheless without the real issue being confronted. By voting for this report, Members should be aware that they will do nothing to alleviate the stress and emotion suffered by the bereaved who frequently fall victim to the tragic catastrophes of the repatriation of mortal remains. Unfortunately and regrettably, factual errors in this report make it obvious that it has been written by a layman who has no real understanding of the problems of repatriation or indeed the funeral profession, and I therefore see that this report has not addressed the real issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, it is incomprehensible that the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his or her country of origin results in much more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place, and higher costs. This clearly runs counter to the Community approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, measures must be adopted to simplify or even harmonise the process of repatriating the mortal remains of persons who have died so as to bring this process more into line with the Community approach which is not, of course, taken into account in the international agreements governing this field. These are the 1937 Berlin agreement and the 1973 Strasbourg agreement which, because they are quite old, are not relevant to the situation we have in Europe today and have therefore become largely obsolete. Furthermore, these agreements established a form of indirect discrimination because they apply essentially to ‘non nationals’, which contravenes the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in Community law, thereby breaching essential rules of Community law. It consequently falls to the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that these are compatible and to adopt the necessary measures to guaranteeing that they are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it should be pointed out that not all Member States have ratified these agreements, which is another reason for the unacceptable disparity in the measures adopted by each of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report is based on a resolution that I tabled. Following on from Mr Titford's comments, today I tried to contact an undertaker friend to see if he had anything he wished to add tonight, but it seems he is on his holidays somewhere, as it so happens.</p>
<p class="contents">We all accept that Mr Cashman’s excellent report is still and I do not mean to denigrate it - an aspirational report. It aspires to improving a situation that is indeed common. Every year I hear of one, two or even sometimes three cases where people experience problems in relation to the repatriation of remains. If we look at the dates of the various pieces of legislation that Mr Cashman has mentioned in his report, we see that they are all at least 30 years old.</p>
<p class="contents">30 years ago the world was very different. As Mr Cashman said, huge numbers of people are now moving about and spending holidays in other Member States. In two of the cases I have very recently heard about, the deceased had been killed under what were considered to be suspicious circumstances. Only this morning I had a phone call from the mother of a young man. She has been waiting 17 months to have his remains repatriated, and local courts have constantly changed their minds about the prosecution of the person believed to have been involved in the death of this young man.</p>
<p class="contents">So, it is not just a question of the technical matters relating to repatriation. Very often, delays also occur in relation as the report mentions - to the circumstances of the death. I have just received a copy of one of the questions the Commissioner referred to. This was an answer to a question I tabled on 11 October 2000: 'the Commission, following extensive consultations with all parties concerned, concluded that detailed harmonisation of national rules in this area, over and above those that already exist, is neither desirable nor necessary and would not be justified from the point of view of subsidiarity or proportionality'. That is a depressing answer, Commissioner, so I hope very much that, in the provision of services directive you are proposing, you will recognise that this is an important issue, and above all that in these situations we are very often discussing a deeply human tragedy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would point out to him that the report is about the adoption of measures concerning the repatriation of mortal remains. It is about barriers to movement rather than the conditions of the corpse. I want the principle to be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Titford could, at any time, have suggested amendments to me. Despite discussions in Strasbourg on my report, he subsequently offered no amendments. I am deeply saddened. I always deal honestly and openly with all my colleagues, but he flattered me privately and failed to act publicly. I need to correct the record in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
