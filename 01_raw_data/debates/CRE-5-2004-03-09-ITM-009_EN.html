<p class="contents">The amendments proposed address some of the key points in our relations with the Western Balkan countries. We have noted all the proposals and carefully considered them. The Commission and the Council need Parliament’s full support and commitment in their efforts to assist these countries with their reforms and in bringing them closer to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly describe the background to this proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of European Partnerships, which goes back to the European Council held in Thessaloniki in June 2003, at which the Heads of State and Government reiterated their determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries. The Stabilisation and Association Process has now been strengthened and supplemented by several elements that have been implemented in the course of the ongoing enlargement process. The introduction of European Partnerships is one of the most important proposals to this end. The Commission was requested to present the first European Partnerships for approval at the end of this month, together with the next Annual Reports on the Stabilisation and Association Process. Like the Accession Partnerships for candidate countries, the European Partnerships establish short- and medium-term priorities that those countries are required to comply with in order to move closer to the European Union. They will be adapted to the countries’ specific needs and respective stages of preparation, and to the specificities of the Stabilisation and Association process, and will also take account of regional cooperation. In accordance with progress achieved, the European Partnerships will increasingly be steered towards adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Progress will be monitored by the Commission and assessed in the annual reports. The texts of the individual European Partnerships will be transmitted to the European Parliament, and, exactly as in the case of the Accession Partnerships, the European Parliament will be kept appropriately informed about the progress made by the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has noted the rapporteur's comments about financial assistance for countries in this region. I would like to stress once again that the proposal does not have any financial implications. The priorities of the European Partnership will continue to form the basis of the programme of assistance, which will be provided under the CARDS programme. I should, however, emphasise that the Partnerships have their own priorities, the achievement of which has no financial implications whatsoever, such as the acceptance of legislative provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand Parliament’s concerns about the conditionality of Community assistance. Respect for the principles of democracy and constitutionality, and for human rights, minority rights and fundamental freedoms are a prerequisite for the granting of Community assistance. If these general conditions are not met, the Council can decide to suspend financial assistance. The Commission has agreed to make specific reference to this point in draft Council decisions on the individual partnership priorities. The priorities of the European Partnerships are just as much EU priorities as the priorities for Accession Partnerships were for the accession countries. Of course, the governments of the countries concerned will be informally consulted on the European Partnership. Their agreement will not come as a surprise. The Commission agrees with Parliament's proposal that a passage on the consultation of the national governments should be added to the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the mechanisms established under the Stabilisation and Association Process for this purpose, we have regular contacts with these countries. We assume that these countries are working out plans setting out a time frame for compliance with the requirements for further integration with the European Union. This work is intended to give them an increased sense of responsibility and a better understanding of the process. Implementing the priorities of the European Partnerships requires commitment, political will and the provision of appropriate funding. The partnerships will provide a solid basis for steering the reform efforts in the Western Balkan countries to moving closer to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, before I discuss the Commission proposal, I should like to ask whether we ought to attach any political significance to the fact that Mr Patten has left the Chamber and has been replaced by Mr Verheugen, because as far as I know, Mr Verheugen is still responsible for candidate Member States and acceding countries. Is this an indication from the Commission that the Western Balkan countries, although, officially, they are not yet among candidate Member States, have now suddenly been included among their number? Let there be no misunderstanding: I would welcome it. It is, in any case, striking.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposals themselves are concerned, the Commissioner has already referred to their source, namely last year's Thessaloniki Summit. At that summit, the European Council, under considerable pressure from the Greek Presidency, wanted to make a gesture towards the Western Balkan countries, the most important political message being that they have very definitely turned into the road to Europe and that the EU wants to help them on that path by offering them an additional instrument in the form of European Partnerships. The reason for this initiative was that there is no doubt, including in this House, that those countries will be members one day. The question is only when and under what conditions. However, when I read the Commission proposal implementing the fine decision of Thessalonica, I am, quite honestly, very much starting to doubt whether that decision was such a wise one. What is – and that is at the same time the central question in my report – the added value of introducing a new instrument, namely the European Partnerships, at this present time? We in the European Union – you know this better than we do – are involved in an extremely complicated process of concluding Stabilisation and Association Agreements with all the countries of the region, or at least, that is the goal towards which we are working. We managed to do this with Croatia and Macedonia, and we are still negotiating with the three other countries. This process is jerking along. It is not easy. There are still major problems in three of the five countries, and there is still a great deal of work left to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Now all of a sudden, in the middle of that process, along comes a new instrument, the European Partnerships. These do not follow the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, but cut right across them. Commission, I really have to say that I fail to grasp the meaning of this; I think that the Commission, like Parliament, is bound by the Council's brief, although it, like we, cannot say so out loud. I fear that the new instrument that has been created is one that nobody needs and for which nobody is waiting. It creates uncertainty in the region and I think that we have to be very careful not to hand those countries an empty shell, while we ourselves are unsure as to what we want from this initiative. Here, politics is being played with symbols, and we have to tread very carefully indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">If we persevere with this initiative after all, I should like to make two observations. First of all the finances which are normally speaking part and parcel of partnerships such as these – suffice to look at the great example of these European Partnerships – namely the partnerships that have preceded the status of candidate Member State. If we create a new instrument after all, why do we not set aside some new money at the same time? Your colleague, Commissioner Patten, has repeatedly told this House that, as far as he is concerned, it is no trouble to spend the money that he now has at his disposal, and that he would like to receive more money from Parliament in order to help those countries. That is why I can accept the concept of European Partnerships, provided that it is clear how much money we are willing to contribute. If no additional funds are being set aside for this than are already available, then the whole initiative is nothing but an empty shell.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more important is the conditions. The new instruments should not impose yet another set of new conditions. We have subjected EU assistance to those countries to very strict conditions as it is: the return home of refugees, the fight against corruption and cooperation with the Tribunal in The Hague. I urge you to leave it at that. Whilst I am pleased that the Commission has stated in this context that the existing conditions will not be changed, this should be made sufficiently clear. The new instruments should not involve any new conditions. I am, however, very much in favour of the European Union adhering to the existing conditions to the letter, because now and again, I have noticed in the Council a tendency to go over these lightly and not to adhere to the criteria that were established in the past. This is, however, necessary. The root-and-branch approach has to be adopted, because the problems in that region are extensive and if we create the impression that the countries in question will automatically become members at some point, things will go wrong. Let it be clear: I am in favour of carrying on, of giving the reforms and reformers my warm support. The European Union has no choice but to back those countries and the pioneers who carry out reforms. If we need new instruments to achieve this, so be it, but if we can make a good deal of progress with the present instruments, whilst the new ones only create uncertainty, I will reject the new ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Stability Pact is the right answer to the region's problems. The negotiation of the Stabilisation and Association Process, together with financial assistance such as the CARDS programme and the annual progress review, assists progress towards the frequently mentioned objective of the ultimate accession of these countries to the European Union. So this is the right way to go. What then is this new cliché about ‘European Partnership’? The Stabilisation and Association Agreements are the launch pad for a partnership and if all the criteria are met, the application for membership is the next step. Is there any room for a new catchword without any new financial backing? This proposal from the Council is meaningless, and the Commission knows that, but it cannot say that in so many words. We, on the other hand, can say what we think!</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Commission and the Council could demonstrate how serious they are about this much-vaunted partnership by taking Croatia as an example. Croatia has been on the right path for years. Cooperation is good in all areas. The extent of cooperation with The Hague is also positive. Two more generals have just been sent to The Hague. We should not be setting ever-higher standards just because one general with a French passport is still at large and is nowhere to be found. We should remember what has been achieved already.</p>
<p class="contents">This positive view of Croatia would give a signal and add impetus to compliance with the European Union's criteria throughout the region for which European Partnerships are envisaged – and I know what I am talking about. Our common foreign policy in South Eastern Europe is currently being put to the test, and a rigorous one at that. The proposal for a European Partnership without any substantial added value as compared with the Stabilisation and Association Process and without any additional financial assistance will not, I regret to say, enhance our credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that Commissioner Verheugen will push for that, as I am assuming that he will play a key role in the new Commission – he certainly deserves to – and I assume that he will also have a corresponding influence in ensuring that the European Partnerships become an instrument based on clear criteria. My recommendation, which was not accepted by the committee, was that the Stabilisation and Association Agreements should be successfully implemented over a period of years. Successfully, mind you, not just any old how!</p>
<p class="contents">My visit to Kosovo as part of the delegation led by Mrs Pack made a lasting impression on me. That impression is that neither the Albanian side nor the Serbian side have come under enough pressure to do what they ought to do – to work together for the future of Kosovo. That impression also applies to several other countries. But Croatia, both under the previous administration and under the present government, is an exception to that, because they have grasped what is at stake and also wish to move forward accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and we in this House bear a certain part of the blame for this situation, and we should endeavour to ensure that Europe's voice is heard more clearly and distinctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Our meeting with President Rugova was symbolic of this. I have a high regard for him and have known him for a long time, although not so well as Mrs Pack does, but I have a very good relationship with him. But when we visited his official residence – and I know that we are only talking about Kosovo and not yet an independent state – Albanian, Kosovan and American flags were flying, but not a European flag, and nobody seemed to think anything of it. What does that say about Europe's voice, I wonder? We will be taking him a European flag in the hope that it will find a place at his residence.</p>
<p class="contents">He is not the only one, however, to whom this applies, and this is in no way intended to be a personal criticism. I believe that just as Europe is not represented amongst the flags flying at his residence, Europe's views are unrepresented or at least underrepresented in many parts of the Balkans. The Council, the Commission and Parliament must work together to make our voice more widely heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen, if we are debating this in a year's time and you can convince me that the European Partnership has achieved this much, or has at least made progress in that direction, then I will support the Lagendijk report retrospectively, but I shall not be voting for it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, then, is at issue here? The issue is that the Thessaloniki Council asked whether we could not draw a few conclusions from the successful progress of the enlargement process with a view to bringing the countries of the Western Balkans closer to the European Union more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The question was a simple one: are there lessons that we have learnt, are there instruments that have been successful in that process, and which we could apply here as well, subject to any necessary adjustments? The answer to it is ‘yes’. In the case of the accession countries we had the ‘Europe Agreements’ as a legal basis. These correspond to the Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the Western Balkan countries. We developed the ‘Accession Partnerships’ as an instrument for implementing those Europe Agreements, and I will tell you in a moment why that was a good thing. The corresponding instrument in the Stabilisation and Association Process will be the European Partnerships, because we could not very well talk about ‘Accession Partnerships’.</p>
<p class="contents">The great advantage of this instrument is that it is very flexible, very exact, easy to monitor, and that progress can be assessed very precisely. It is the Commission's intention to prepare these partnerships following exactly the same pattern as for the Accession Partnerships. That involves describing in precise terms what is to happen in the first year, as a short-term priority in other words, in all areas – political governance, economic governance, adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> – and then medium-term priorities, for which we will give ourselves two or three years, and lastly the long-term priorities. The big advantage of all this is that it can be checked and fine-tuned at any time, and that the other instruments at our disposal can then be adjusted to meet the objectives of these partnerships, for example the technical assistance instrument that we intend to use in future. But I also have in mind the instruments already at our disposal and all the other instruments available.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you from my own experience of the enlargement process that this instrument will be helpful, that it is a very manageable instrument, and one with which we had very good experience during enlargement. I therefore urge you to at least give this instrument a chance. I would like to ask my friend Mr Swoboda to perhaps give the instrument two chances, and in a year's time we will be very happy to carry out a joint assessment of whether or not it has achieved anything. I am quite convinced, though, that it is an instrument that will help the Western Balkan countries, which will be more manageable for them, and which will make the direction in which the whole process should proceed clearer and more credible. For that reason I can indeed give this instrument my wholehearted support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
