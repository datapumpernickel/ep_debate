<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Soares (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my report on the European Union and Macau was discussed twice in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, which then unanimously approved it. As a matter of fact, I had previously incorporated some conclusions from the opinion issued by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. In December 1999, in other words, just over a year ago, Macau stopped being a special territory under the administration of Portugal, which it had been, peacefully and with the consent of the people, for 450 years. It is today a Special Administrative Region that is part of the People’s Republic of China, in accordance with the Chinese principle of ‘one country, two systems’. I wish to take this opportunity to say that there is a serious mistake in the report, in item No 9 of the explanatory statement, where it says, in repeating this principle, ‘one system, two countries’. The Chinese idea is completely the opposite – ‘one country, two systems’. This is a mistake which still needs to be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Portuguese citizen and having enjoyed direct constitutional responsibility for Macau, I must state that Macau’s handover from Portuguese administration to the Chinese was done consensually and with enormous goodwill under the terms of the 1987 Joint Sino-Portuguese Declaration, which is still in force today and which will remain so for the next fifty years. This last year has also been peaceful and consensual, according to first-hand information that I have received from various sources and, in particular, from the Portuguese and Macanese who still live and work there. I have already passed this information to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the policy of the People’s Republic of China towards Hong Kong and now towards Macau seeks to achieve a rapprochement between Taiwan and China and, eventually, to integrate it into China. Despite the fact that there have been, and still are, minor and inevitable problems with this integration in the case of Hong Kong, a much larger, more populous and richer territory than Macau, albeit with a much more recent past, it is widely known that the these two territories have, by and large, enjoyed a relatively smooth transition. As I pointed out, Macau was never a colony. It was a territory under Portuguese administration, by agreement between Portugal and China. Following Portugal’s ‘Carnation Revolution’, when I arrived for the first time at the United Nations in 1974 as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs said to me, ‘Be careful, do not decolonise Macau, because Macau is not a colony and never has been.’ In 1949, when Mao Tse Tung came to power, he said ‘Portugal has spent 400 years in Macau without ever having waged war against China.’ This was a very important point for Macau, and still is.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Macau is not as rich as Hong Kong, its development in many areas in the last ten years has been extraordinary. Formerly, gambling alone ruled, but today there is a very strong sector producing goods for tourists and toys and various objects, and many other industries, including the textile industry. Relations between Hong Kong and Macau are and have always been excellent. It is worth bearing in mind, and I shall take this opportunity to remind Parliament, that every territory has its peculiarities. They are all different and the European Union should therefore deal with them all as separate issues even though they are closely related. These territories must not be lumped together, particularly in terms of the European Union’s representation there. Portugal has historically enjoyed excellent relations with the People’s Republic, which are still improving at various levels. This year, there were several visits to Portugal by Chinese Ministers and by Portuguese Ministers to China. Relations are still very close between Portugal and Macau. The current Governor of Macau, Mr Edmond Ho, who was actually appointed by the Chinese Government, paid an official visit to Portugal this year. As a matter of fact, this was his first trip abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the terms of the Joint Sino-Portuguese Declaration, the People's Republic of China made a commitment to respecting the economic system and the political and legal system instituted by Portugal when it established the Special Administrative Region of Macau for the next 50 years. As a founding member of the World Trade Organisation, Macau is a signatory to the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights and the International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It has a kind of economic and trade delegation called the Macau Economic and Trade Office. I say ‘kind of’, because this delegation is not recognised by the European Union, since responsibility for foreign relations and defence lies with Beijing. In principle, the European Union is supposed to appoint its own permanent representative in Macau. This is important and I believe that it has already been done.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal left Macau with a complete, western-style democratic legal system, with political institutions that function well, with a Chief Executive appointed by Beijing replacing the former Portuguese Governor, with a Legislative Assembly of 23 members, independent courts and a Court of Final Appeal as well as an efficient police force. The Joint Sino-Portuguese Declaration defines civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, which have been respected, and the territory does not have the death penalty. Portugal enjoys excellent relations with the People’s Republic of China, as I said, and continues to have a considerable presence in Macau through its investors and businesses and in the civil service and the liberal professions. There is a Portuguese high school in Macau which is thriving and where Portuguese continues to be taught.</p>
<p class="contents">Macau can and must retain its importance for the European Union as a centre for business and investment, not only in the territory itself, but also for the business that is traditionally entered into there with China and with other Asian countries. Because Macau is a Special Administrative Region with its own cultural identity and a population that is mixed, although largely Chinese, the European Union can only gain by maintaining a presence there, for both of these reasons. I must therefore insist that the European Union sends a permanent representative to Macau and that we step up economic, political and cultural relations between the European Union and Macau. The European Union must not lose interest in Macau, because what happens over the next 50 years in this territory, which is under special jurisdiction, depends to a certain extent on the vigilance with which the European Union watches over Macau. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graça Moura (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, with Mário Soares’s particular knowledge of Macau and the close attention that he has paid to developments in the Special Administrative Region that has been created there, he has provided this House with an extremely important and timely document. His report starts with an analysis of the institutional and legislative framework that has been designed for the region and of the potential of the modern democratic structures that these have lead to. The report takes account, of course, of the particular culture and the specific historical, social and economic bonds that underpin Macau’s relationship with Portugal and the European Union on the one hand, and with the People’s Republic of China, on the other. In this way, the report outlines the expectation which the clearly positive changes in the Special Administrative Region have confirmed, even though we know that we cannot yet take account of as many tangible figures as we would like, in order to have a true picture of these first twelve months – in fact a very short time.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as we hope, and as the Soares report has already indicated, these positive aspects are fully confirmed, we must see this as the result not only of the careful preparation for the transfer of sovereignty on the part of Portugal and China, but also of the special commitment demonstrated by Macau’s current authorities. These positive aspects are also, and it is important to remember this, the result of the truly outstanding action of the last Portuguese Governor of Macau, Vasco Rocha Vieira, on whose merits Parliament had the opportunity to hear the specially authorised statement by Commissioner Patten, in the December 1999 plenary. The benefit of this action on the ground was to guarantee lasting respect for fundamental rights, amongst other things, and this was a serene and heartfelt fight without the histrionics that characterised the fight for which the Sakharov prize-winners were rewarded, and yet it was carried out with similar efficiency and with equally far-reaching effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The very positive aspects that I have just mentioned must not, however, lead the European Union’s authorities to pay less close attention to later developments. My justification for saying this consists of a few points, which are perhaps explained by the differences in outlooks. We know that, in the meantime, changes have been made to the company code that are likely to clash with the rules on transparency in the field of invitations to tender. We also know that the Portuguese language is being used less, both at an official level and in schools and social situations. There even appear to be signs of changes to electoral law and to certain aspects of public administration and the classification of civil servants, the health system and higher education. It is to be hoped that these are superficial aspects that do not herald a moving away from the European Union and a diminishing of Macau’s autonomy for the sake of practices employed in other countries in the region or for the sake of a watered-down situation that is less acceptable to China itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Soares report reiterates the need for the statute and the legal framework adopted for Macau to be fully respected, both with regard to fundamental rights and to the other rights and principles of democratic law that stem from the Joint Sino-Chinese Declaration of 1987 and the Basic Law of 1993, the thrust of which it would be useful to summarise. This law insists on the need to stimulate cooperation between Europe and Macau in all areas, because the importance of rapidly appointing a representative of the European Union to that Special Administrative Region is clear. For these reasons, congratulating Mr Soares once again, I wish, in conclusion, to express my support and my praise for his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Soares, on his excellent report, with which he honours this Parliament, and to highlight three points made in this report: firstly, the need for Europe to remain vigilant over the autonomy and specific character of the Special Administrative Region of Macau; secondly, the need for the European Union to maintain a physical presence there through a representative; and thirdly, the need for closer relations and dialogue with that territory, as Mr Soares made very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">As for my second reason, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech is intended to mark an important point in the debate on this report, because in addition to being a long-standing member of this House, the rapporteur is a former President of one of the Member States of the European Union with a history that honours us all, not only the members of his party or his compatriots, but all Europeans. This report, which bears his stamp and his signature, increases the credibility of the European Parliament. It is worth highlighting that it is not only the contribution he has made in this document but also the active and resolute way in which he has always fought and continues to fight in this House to defend the highest values of the European project itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that preserving and valuing these links under the new framework initiated in December 1999 is a highly appropriate proposal. The European Union is Macau’s second largest trading partner and its third largest investor as a result of the trade and cooperation agreement that has already been in force since 1993 and of other one-off agreements between the European Union and Macau in various other areas. Lastly, the Portuguese administration has made a huge effort, especially in the last twenty years, to modernise the territory and its infrastructures. In its negotiations with China, it managed to ensure the establishment in Macau of an institutional legislative framework, which is of particular importance from a European perspective, for the particular way in which we see Asia and the Pacific and in terms of our relations with the great nation of China.</p>
<p class="contents">The main quality of this report and of the motion for a resolution that we are now debating is that it has rigorously and punctually respected the timetable and has not let Macau fall into oblivion. In saying this I am not detracting from the importance of the report. On the contrary, I consider it to be extremely appropriate, precisely in order to prevent our documents in this area being interred in a graveyard for good intentions and ending up in a drawer or, even worse, in the bin.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking around the Chamber, one might think this was a Portuguese debate, but what I wish to state once again is that the 1999 handover also marked the fact that Macau became a European issue of the first order. The timeliness of this Parliamentary report by Mr Soares exposes the main weakness of the Commission, which is not to have marked this fact. This clearly warrants our criticism. First of all, it is unfortunate that a year should have passed without the Commission publishing the annual report on EU-China relations that it promised and which we were expecting. Secondly, it is also unfortunate that, as far as we know, no one has yet been appointed to take charge of bilateral cooperation in Macau, which runs counter to the announcement made over a year ago in the Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all perfectly familiar with the reasons why we must maintain and improve bilateral cooperation with the new Special Administrative Region and it is not worth repeating them now. I wish to congratulate Mr Soares on his excellent report and I hope that the Commission will now be able to make up for lost time and step up and better organise cooperation with Macau. I hope that it will address the challenges facing us more actively and that it will duly reread and comply with its own communication of 1999 in time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Parliament's rapporteur on Hong Kong, the current status of the Macau Special Administrative Region holds obvious interest to me, and I have been fortunate enough to visit the region twice within the last year.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, Macau's economy has progressed significantly since the handover, enjoying a 4% growth in GDP during the year 2000. Another positive development is Edmond Ho Hau-Wah's stated intention of breaking up the casino monopoly and aiming to create an Asian equivalent of Atlantic City. I welcome the fact that Macau's crime rate has also improved. Statistics show that the overall drop in crime is around 5% and that the police have significantly reduced gang-related crime involving the gambling industry.</p>
<p class="contents">On the negative side the unemployment rate has reached 7% causing unrest among workers. Their fears and uncertainties have been compounded because of their belief that immigrants will pose a threat to future employment. Macau does boast a sound education system but its economic dependence on gambling and textiles, and its failure to attract high-tech industries do not augur well for the future employment prospects of the young population.</p>
<p class="contents">Other worrying developments are the claims of police brutality made by Falangong practitioners who were refused entry to Macau during the visit of President Jiang and who were also denied the right to protest against the government's crackdown on the group. Furthermore, President Jiang's plea to Macau's government not to allow criticism of Beijing raises fundamental questions about the Chinese Government's commitment to allow freedom of expression which is fundamental to the success of the one-country two-systems policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, progress has been made since the handover and that progress can be described as satisfactory. However, it is imperative, as also with Hong Kong, to continue monitoring to ensure that there is no erosion of democracy, human rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure the last speaker that this is not simply an issue of interest to the Portuguese. It is an issue of interest, not only to the European Union, but to the world and those who want to see Macau and Hong Kong progress, so that basic freedoms are guaranteed and are not eroded by the country to which they have been handed back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just wanted to tell you that I read this text with great interest. I am of the view that the European Union should not underestimate this issue. The thing is that we, as the European Union, live on this Eurasian continent and a large part of humanity is crowded into Asia. For us, the relationship between Europe and its Asiatic partners is of strategic importance. In this, Macao is of great importance because, in this region, a European cultural tradition has become intermingled with an Asian tradition and a whole host of thoughts about human rights and freedom has sprung up. Despite its relatively small size, Macao has an extraordinary bridging function.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am of the view that we Europeans must never abandon Macao. We must also acknowledge that we are not entirely innocent in the fate of many people who lived there in the past and, possibly, of many who will live there in the future. That is why we have an obligation which goes far beyond what Portugal generously took on. I am pleased that Mr Cushnahan and I are speaking in this debate. This gives us a chance to explain that this situation is not only a legacy of the former Portuguese colonial empire but an essentially European concern. We as Europeans must recognise that Asia is our most important strategic partner and whatever brings the European body of thought closer to the Asian body of thought and vice versa, and whatever consolidates thoughts of democracy and the rule of law on the Asian continent, is not only in the interest of people living there but it is also a basic interest of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">I am happy to note that Parliament and the Commission have reached similar overall conclusions on how to approach the future for Macao. I welcome the positive developments that have occurred in the Macao special administrative region (SAR) over the past year since the handover. We attach great importance to the people of Macao being able to continue to live their lives with the rights and freedoms they have enjoyed for so long. We share Parliament's view regarding the importance of the 1987 joint declaration and 1993 Basic Law as the main instruments for defining the status of the Macao special administrative region. This is why the Commission has given its commitment to watching very closely the process of transition and to helping the smooth implementation and retention of the 'one country, two systems' principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first year since the handover, Macao has established the required administrative institutions and adjusted to the new situation. The government, the legislative council and the judiciary have all made impressive efforts to adapt to the new situation. Macao has also been active internationally in its own right in areas such as telecommunications, civil aviation and investment protection, affirming its individuality and autonomy in areas covered by the Basic Law.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Parliament, we also welcome the fact that Macao has been provided with a modern legal system, including an express ban in the penal code on the enforcement of the death penalty. A modernised legal system will be of great benefit when applying the Basic Law under the 'one country, two systems' principle.</p>
<p class="contents">On our side, we will support their correct implementation where possible, including through our cooperation programme and particularly our legal cooperation project. We share the view of the importance of the 1993 EU-Macao Trade and Cooperation Agreement remaining in force to strengthen relations. We consider the agreement is fundamental to EU-Macao relations and is the basic requirement for the development of increased business cooperation, especially business-to-business links. It is also the basis for improved cooperation in those areas where Macao has retained its autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to develop our trade as much as we can and the situation is improving. We will be supporting efforts to position the EU better in Macao by encouraging more investment by European companies and by helping Macau diversify its economic base when the time is right. We are pleased that last year was good for Macao's economy. Economic growth was positive, reaching 4% for the first time since 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament report and the resolution call for a dynamic approach in the activities of the EU-Macao Joint Committee. I can report that EU-Macao relations remain extremely good. The Joint Committee held its annual meeting in Brussels on 30 June 2000. This provided an excellent forum for both sides to exchange candid views and detailed information on the work in progress of transforming Macao into a special administrative region. They also discussed ways to improve and strengthen bilateral links, including through cooperation and trade and economic relations based on the recommendations of the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to cooperation, the resolution calls upon the Commission to settle quickly the question of appointing a technical cooperation officer for Macao. Here I would have liked to be able to report that the nominated technical cooperation officer had been appointed in November as had been planned. Unfortunately the selected candidate withdrew at the final stage after a selection procedure that lasted several months. We continue to consider the appointment of the technical cooperation officer very important.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the situation in Macao has been positive. The Commission is finalising its first annual report on Macao and hopes to transmit it shortly to Council and Parliament. Parliament's report itself is timely, as its observations and recommendations will provide another source of advice to draw on when finalising the Commission's first annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already mentioned, we attach great importance to maintaining the rights, freedoms and democratic principles of Macao and its people. The Commission's report will look closely at the full range of issues that have characterised Macao's daily life during the first year of the SAR's existence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I am pleased to report that the Chief Executive of Macao, Mr Edmond Ho will visit Brussels on 7 May 2001. I know that the Commission will be keen to discuss with him the most recent developments in Macao. I hope that some of you will also have the opportunity to meet him.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure Parliament that the Commission will continue to maintain an active watch on events in Macao, especially those regarding democratic principles and human rights. The Commission remains committed to assisting Macao wherever possible and to helping it develop and realise its full potential. We also remain fully committed to keeping Parliament informed of progress throughout Macao's transition process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
