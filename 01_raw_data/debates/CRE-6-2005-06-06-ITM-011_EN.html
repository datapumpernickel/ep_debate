Aids, malaria and TB are generally known problems. Less well known are Chagas disease, sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis. Together with AIDS, TB and malaria, these diseases kill 14 million people each year, mainly in poor countries. They claim more victims globally than traffic accidents, famine and terrorism combined. Three billion dollars would be enough to fund the research needed to produce better treatments for these diseases. The solutions are within reach if solidarity and human sympathy are mobilised.</p>
<p class="contents">For many, ‘tsunami’ was an unknown word six months ago but, when the devastating power behind that word became generally known, we were rapidly able to mobilise aid for those affected. Now, attention is being paid to other less well-known diseases such as Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, which affect millions of people. This time too, let us show how we can teach ourselves new concepts and take new initiatives to combat these afflictions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After what we had heard, several members from Latvia met with the Hungarian Association in Latvia. Hungarians, just like other permanent residents of Latvia, have every right to obtain Latvian citizenship. Many Hungarians have already done so, but the issue, as it turned out, was not about citizenship. The biggest problem for those people who are by no means well-off is the impossibility of travelling to visit relatives in Hungary without visas, which cost quite a large sum of money. For this very reason, Hungarians in Latvia had approached the Hungarian Government, asking it to issue them with special certificates for entering Hungary, such as those living in other countries already have. Since their request was refused, Latvian citizenship becomes the only way in which to travel to Hungary without a considerable outlay on visas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hegyi, I call upon you as a member of the Hungarian Socialist Party not to mislead Parliament, but to appeal to your party colleagues in the government and to propose that they stop requiring that their own Hungarian people have visas in order to enter Hungary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last few weeks alone, indigenous Hungarians were badly beaten up by Serbs recently settled in Vojvodina, for the sole reason that they were speaking in their mother tongue – which, incidentally, is an official language of the European Union. This calls for urgent action by the European Parliament to monitor Serbia, not only in the Delegation to Yugoslavia, but also – and this has not happened since February – in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the unexplained denunciations of Hungarian leaders in Vojvodina in recent weeks, bear all the hallmarks of a concerted political attack. This impression is reinforced by the sentence that was imposed exclusively on Hungarian youths in Temerin and which has become infamous due to its excessive severity and one-sidedness. So far even war criminals have been treated less harshly by the Serbian judiciary. The reason behind all these incidents – as the investigating delegation from this Parliament also pointed out – is the fact that minorities are not proportionally represented in the Serbian judicial system or the police, or indeed in the public administration. Moreover, the Belgrade leadership is also dragging its heels as regards keeping its promises on education for minorities. All of this raises the question of the responsibility of the European Parliament and Union institutions, because, for example, the Interreg CBC plans fail to give Vojvodina autonomous status – despite the fact that the province was autonomous until 1989 – and yet it complies with all the requirements laid down for NUTS2 regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following objective and credible investigations, the delegation found that offences are indeed committed, but not in an organised manner. Recently, however, I am sad to say, we have once again witnessed disturbing events in Vojvodina. The greatest cause for concern is the fact that the recently appointed Serbian public prosecutor in Subotica has issued an indictment against József Kasza – president of the most important organisation of Vojvodina Hungarians, the VMSZ [Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians] – to investigate abuses of power allegedly committed by him nine years ago during his time as mayor. Denunciations of this sort have been made against József Kasza several times in the past, but have never been proven. The timing in the present case is no coincidence. Kasza was the person who was most vociferous in condemning the violent acts committed against Vojvodina Hungarians and he cooperated closely with the European Parliament’s fact-finding delegation. Mr President, I ask you and Mrs Doris Pack to take care that VMSZ president József Kasza does not become a political victim in a show trial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This programme provides a fast, London-wide removal service for abandoned cars, removing around 75 000 a year from London streets. The scheme has saved many neighbourhoods from the blight of scrapped and burnt-out vehicles littering and polluting the environment, making a real difference to the quality of citizens’ lives.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to coincide with World Environment Day yesterday, the UK Government made known that this funding would end in September. This would not be so bad if our government made manufacturers liable from that date, as it has the possibility to do under the directive, before manufacturers’ liability becomes mandatory in January 2007. The government has not done that, putting corporate profits before a sustainable environment.</p>

Ever since export subsidies for the transportation of live animals were introduced in 1989, this House has on many occasions voted in favour of their removal from the EU budget. Although the animals’ torments, particularly on journeys over long distances, and the resulting disadvantages for consumers, are a matter of general knowledge, their transportation continues to be subsidised to the tune of EUR 41 million in 2001, EUR 57 million in 2002, EUR 67 million in 2003, and now the figure has reached EUR 77 million per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving subsidies in this manner amounts to promoting extreme suffering for animals, and we should therefore surely reject it. I wish therefore to call upon the Members of this House to endorse this statement, and would advise the ladies and gentlemen currently engaged in negotiating the EU’s budget that the abolition of these subsidies would remove several hundred million euros from the budget, and to do so would be surely to give it some justified relief. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer to the Lukashenko regime’s persecution of the newly-elected leaders of the Union of Poles in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">Violations of fundamental human rights in Belarus are something to which we have been accustomed for many years. I need only mention the fact that two leaders of the democratic opposition, Nikolai Statkevich and Pavel Severinets, were sentenced a few days ago to three years in a forced labour camp for organising anti-government demonstrations. Nevertheless, the recent attacks on the Polish minority organisation deserve to be singled out for particular criticism by the EU authorities. I would remind the House that although new leaders were elected at the March congress of the Union of Poles in Belarus, the Belarussian Ministry of Justice not only refused to recognise these elections, but also threatened to outlaw the organisation entirely. What is more, the publication of <span class="italic">Głos znad Niemna</span>, the country’s only Polish-language newspaper, has been suspended, and a Polish diplomat has been expelled from the country. These facts give a full insight into the persecution suffered by Poles in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The drastic measures to which the Belarussian authorities have recently resorted are a clear indication of the fact that they fear their country will experience a repeat of the democratic revolution seen in Ukraine. I hope that their worst fears come true, but the European Union must pursue a more proactive policy to ensure that this happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that is not the point I want to draw attention to. Another Member has already mentioned the G-8 summit, which is going to take place in Edinburgh, and also the Live-8 campaign, which is seeking debt relief, trade justice and increased aid for Africa. However, financial measures alone cannot solve Africa’s problems. If we are going to bring about real change for the better in Africa, this must be accompanied by action to ensure that good governance is practised, the rule of law upheld and human rights respected. I look at the case of Zimbabwe, where in March Mugabe had another sham election and where, at this moment, he is involved in clearance of urban areas inhabited mainly by opposition supporters, whom he is ruthlessly suppressing. The international community is doing nothing about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council said that it would review sanctions in the light of the elections that took place in Zimbabwe. Nothing has happened. I call upon the Council and the Commission to take robust action against Mugabe and similar dictators who are abusing the oppressed people of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
