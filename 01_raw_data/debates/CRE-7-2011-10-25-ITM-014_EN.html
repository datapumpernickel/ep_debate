We received 400 amendments and drafted 47 compromises, all of which were adopted. This demonstrates the importance of this issue of new skills and jobs, and the interest it has generated. In the end, this is about preparing Europe’s human resources, and anticipating the needs of the labour market over the next decade. The key strategy when drafting the report has been to reformulate common ideas, so as to avoid repetition and ensure its coherence. I think we have achieved this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the crisis currently affecting us has demonstrated the weakness of the European economic and social model, and has wiped out several elements of the progress made in the past. Since the first effects of the crisis started to be felt in the labour market in 2008, Europe has already lost more than 5 million jobs. There are almost 23 million people unemployed today. Youth unemployment is even more shocking: the rate of youth unemployment is around 21%, which is more than double the overall unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, unemployment rates vary according to levels of qualification in all the Member States. This means that people with better qualifications find work more easily. We also know that, in the near future, needs in terms of aptitudes, skills and qualifications will increase in all types and levels of profession. As such, Europe is facing four challenges: firstly, job creation; secondly, the need to be involved and stay competitive; thirdly, the sustainability of social security systems; and, finally, the difficulty of finding people with adequate skills to fill job offers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, this report essentially has two objectives: firstly, to stress the need to act fast to fill Europe’s skill gaps; and, secondly, for us to anticipate the skill needs of the labour market. Several measures are important in order to achieve this. Firstly, in order to ensure that qualified workers are available, we need to improve basic skills, as well as skills in the sciences, in innovation, in information and communication technologies, and in foreign languages. As I have already mentioned, skill needs must be identified early, at least 10 years in advance. We know today the potential for a new, sustainable, green economy, and that environmentally friendly investment is needed. Next, participation in lifelong learning and retraining, and in reducing the school drop-out rate, needs to be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important area is mutual recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications and the urgent need to make progress with this recognition. Fourthly, we would draw attention to the link that should exist between educational establishments and the needs of the labour market. Internships should be high quality and supervised by tutors so that they lead to a job, so as to put a stop to potential abuses of the intern’s situation. Particular stress is also given to the role of social partnerships and social dialogue. The report also proposes measures to promote job seeking and creation. We have the future before us and we must create jobs. Small and medium-sized enterprises play a decisive role in achieving this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need to strengthen the internal market, so as to facilitate the free movement of workers, which results in the need to coordinate social security systems in order that the rights that workers have won might be guaranteed, in particular, the portability of pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of labour market flexibility: in order for the labour market to work better, we must adapt the rules of flexicurity to the socio-economic context of each Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maria Damanaki, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Bastos for this report and all Members of Parliament for their proposals to strengthen the actions set out in the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have to recognise that we face a challenge. It is a challenge for the European Union as a whole, and for many other regions in the world: how best to support growth and the jobs which are so desperately needed in a climate of stringent fiscal consolidation. That is the challenge, and there is no easy answer to it. A lot depends on political leadership and decisions on the financial and economic crisis, but let us try to do what we can do, in the light of our roles.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to step up the impact and visibility of the Commission’s contribution to the Europe 2020 goals and to meet the deadline – we are at about 75% of the target employment rate – we have undertaken to present a set of employment initiatives in early 2012. Let me now inform you about those concrete actions.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the Commission will duly reopen the debate on flexicurity policy as a means of tackling labour market segmentation, so that everyone in Europe, whatever their background or sector and wherever they live, can have a quality job. The conference on flexicurity on 14 November will provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to present their views on this key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the present economic situation, there is unlikely to be net job creation in the Union unless the Member States step up their policy to stimulate labour demand. That is something we have to realise. There is nothing automatic about creating new jobs. The Commission will therefore present principles for generating conditions that foster job creation for the benefit of all key players, including the public authorities and the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, geographical and occupational mobility is a crucial way of tackling imbalances between sectors and regions where there is high unemployment and where there are labour shortages. The Commission will therefore outline the way EURES, our tool for mobility, can be modernised and turned into a powerful tool. We also intend to open a debate on how the Union can face the situation of the mobile workforce, and particularly of migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to see how employment policy might address the long-term challenges facing us so that we will be able to make the most of employment opportunities in the future. In particular, the restructuring of the economy and of businesses, as we discussed previously, and the transition to a low carbon economy, should be managed and anticipated better.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission will bring forward proposals on developing a more strategic and integrated skills governance model. Indeed, initiatives at national and EU level currently suffer from a lack of coordination and of mechanisms for exchanging information on the anticipation and analysis of skills.</p>
<p class="contents">The most pressing challenge for our societies today is the high rate of unemployment among young people. That is the real problem. To tackle it, the Member States committed themselves in June this year to implementing a comprehensive set of measures under the Europe 2020 flagship initiative Youth on the Move. One particular concern is that 7.5 million young people aged between 15 and 24 are neither in employment, nor in education or in training. Just imagine that. We are talking about 7.5 million young people. Unless something is done, they will become a generation of wasted talent.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a wider and economic social cost such as tax revenue loss, the extra cost of health and medical services, the price to pay for crime and mainly social exclusion – we are talking about real social exclusion now. The Young Opportunities Initiative announced by President Barroso in his State of the Union speech in this House will focus on many issues, including getting young people who have left school or training without any vocational qualification back into school or training and, secondly, providing opportunities for work experience to those who have a qualification but have not found work. The initiative will give the Member States and all the actors involved the necessary support for delivering on the measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report rightly points out, it is vital not to forget society’s most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in this time of economic difficulty. Here we have the European Platform Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, and a commitment to lift out of poverty at least 20 million people by 2020. Last week, the first annual convention of the European Platform Against Poverty took place in Kraków, with very good results.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by saying something about the EU’s future spending plans. On 6 October, the Commission brought forward a proposal on cohesion policy legislation for 2014-2020, and on the role of the European Social Fund. We propose that after 2013, that fund should increase by at least 7.5% and thus account for at least 25% of cohesion spending, or at least EUR 84 billion for the seven-year period up to 2020. The Social Fund will contribute to three of the five EU headline targets: employment, education and reducing poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal for a regulation on the European Social Fund in the future involves allocating at least 25% of that fund to promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. That is a substantial increase on the current EUR 10 billion. I hope that the Member States and Parliament will support this very significant increase for the most vulnerable groups. I welcome the fact that we can share views on how the Agenda should be implemented, and look forward to working with Parliament on this in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I think that developments in our economy have now overtaken us. We heard earlier about the shake-up on the job market in connection with Nokia and Arcelor. In my country, in Greece, it has been decided that a large number of civil servants will leave their posts and be placed in a transitional ‘reserve’ scheme, while in the public and private sectors in general, large numbers of workers are being made redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Fund has a great deal of experience in reintegrating the workforce and in retraining the workforce. I should like to ask you this: have you any major, tailor-made workforce retraining programmes in mind for Greece at this time of serious recession? The Social Fund has both the expertise and the money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agenda talks about a qualified workforce, about the groups at risk in terms of employment, such as young people, women, older people and people living in remote and poorer regions, who are often highly-qualified experts.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for this agenda in the Committee on Regional Development (REGI), I would urge a more effective use of funding to develop new skills and the greater participation of national governments in supporting new job creation. Emphasis is given to the importance of synergies between the individual European funds, and a decentralised approach in using the resources from these funds, with the aim of meeting the requirements of the labour market. There is much talk currently about the future of the cohesion policy. I am therefore delighted that strengthening the impact of cohesion policy instruments – including the European Social Fund – has been included in the motion for a resolution, with a focus on concentrating the funding on a smaller number of priorities, strengthening the partnership principle and emphasising clear and measurable objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, the resolution talks about improving the functioning of the labour market, supporting inclusive labour markets, and improving the quality of jobs and working conditions, and we therefore support the motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a committee, we support the new skills and jobs initiative very much, of course, and we believe it is exactly what is needed to make a difference at this time in the crisis on the naturally fluctuating labour market, by reassessing the needs of the market. Our committee also made a planning proposal, of course, which was passed by consensus, and which calls for cooperation between labour and education ministries in setting limits that will specify what kind of education we will need for employment over the next 10 years at least. Naturally, when talking about education, which is the primary aim of this initiative, we must not forget what comes first, in other words, excellent preparation. We discovered that some of the professions we are training people for are not competitive, and that the humanities, for example, are in decline. The main thing from our perspective is the very important emphasis on vocational training, manual work, technical subjects (IT), technology and languages. We believe that investment in education and the cooperation of multiple programmes at EU level can reduce the alarmingly high level of youth unemployment. We would also be delighted to continue giving financial support to existing programmes operating in the EU, such as the Leonardo da Vinci programme, for example, which helps with vocational training. In our opinion, it is also very important to recognise diplomas and qualifications and, of course, to equip young people with the skills they will need. I hope this report will ultimately go down well, since we, as the Committee on Culture and Education, have various reservations about it, as does my political group, but I am currently talking on behalf of the Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, I would like to remind you of the needs of women and the important role they have in our effort to increase the rate of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States and the European Commission must integrate their actions to be taken in order to increase women’s participation in the labour market. These actions should relate to the creation of appropriate numbers of child care and elderly care centres, and to the introduction of new and flexible forms of employment. Thanks to these facilities, women will be able to harmonise professional and family life. In addition, the as yet untapped potential of women must be exploited, particularly in those areas of employment where women constitute a noticeable minority as a result of unequal treatment and social stereotyping rather than their own choice.</p>
<p class="contents">While creating new jobs, in existing sectors such as health care and social services, as well as in recently emerging sectors such as the ecological sector or sustainable jobs, we should apply appropriate solutions to prevent the new jobs from being the source of the old and commonly practised gender-based discrimination. Good practices should be implemented from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to stress that all these activities must be brought down to a common denominator. The governments of the Member States must revise the implementation and enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, because often we have a good law, but the lack of proper implementation or effective protection measures mean the continued existence of gender inequality in employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate on these important documents is very important and comes at an opportune time. One feels that when there is trouble – and these days we often hear about how great this trouble is – we tend to learn faster.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, when we started the debate on the 2020 strategy, we came to the conclusion that closer and deeper cooperation was needed both in terms of financial and economic processes. Social policies and employment policy, which are deemed social rights in the EU system, are also hit by a deep crisis these days, and we have realised or must realise that we need much closer cooperation, a common way of thinking, and joint efforts in order to change and improve the alarming data that many have quoted recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we all support the Commission’s initiative regarding new skills and new jobs, just like the rapporteur. We agree that we need to reform the European labour market to make it more flexible and more efficient. We also agree that one of the major weaknesses of our European labour market is that it is characterised by structural tensions. While we are facing severe and painful unemployment, there are many people in and around the labour market with inadequate knowledge and skills. Furthermore, demand changes very rapidly. Even current skills and knowledge can become outdated very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, therefore, has the right inventory of actions which we, as a Community, can take, from labour exchange to a skills catalogue. There are many useful initiatives pointing in this direction. However, we need to stress – and our colleague very rightly does so – that while attempting to tackle the financial crisis, the second wave of the economic crisis, we should bear in mind that it is wrong to reduce and cut back training and education costs, because we risk losing future opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight two elements which I consider important. It seems that compared with the Commission’s proposal, the report probably shifts emphasis where support for small and medium-sized enterprises is concerned. It also puts forward more subtle and detailed proposals on ‘flexicurity’, regarding which we are ready to cooperate with the Commission in the future, because we believe that atypical work is one of the options of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As shadow rapporteur on behalf of the S&amp;D group, I would like to mention that the achievement of sustainable growth has to be based on an inclusive labour market. Therefore, we underline the necessity of reducing labour market segmentation. We know that sectoral collective agreements normally establish minimum conditions which can be improved by collective bargaining at company level, and that these minimum conditions are essential to protect workers from being exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal on the decentralisation of collective bargaining is not in favour of social partners having the autonomy to decide what the appropriate level for collective agreement is. We call on the Commission to respect and promote this right. We should link the segmentation of the labour market to the simultaneous achievement of a high and adequate level of protection for workers under all forms of contracts, including those on typical temporary agency contracts and workers in economically dependent situations. However, the single open-ended contract proposed by the Commission does not support the principle of equal treatment and, in our opinion, promotes discrimination in the workplace and is not in line with the directive on equal treatment in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is stated in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that the European institutions have to respect and promote the rights recognised in the Charter. Therefore, I call on the Commission to take into consideration these aspects, and I call on the Members of the European Parliament to support the amendments tabled by the S&amp;D group. Please, Commissioner, take into account what I have said about the single open-ended contract with regard to the rate of youth unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that many highly qualified people are currently unemployed, but despite this, the people who have no education or few qualifications are also the ones who have little or no chance of finding a job, even when the economy recovers and the labour market takes off again. Therefore, it is precisely these people that we should be concerned about. It is our responsibility to ensure that these people have the chance of a new life.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that 14.4% of pupils in the EU leave school early and this is an average, which means that in some places, the figure is much higher. What is happening to all these young people? They will have no opportunity in the foreseeable future, regardless of whether or not the economy is growing, to live an independent life or get a well-paid job. For this reason, we must invest in this area. I believe that, while it is a good thing for the European Parliament to call for this to happen, it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. It is up to us to demonstrate which projects are already running successfully. At the moment, there is a model pilot project which involves looking after early school leavers and providing a youth guarantee. The project is attracting attention to this subject and giving it a high priority. This is a key issue on which we need to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are, of course, all the people who already have a job. We must not forget that in many countries, the talk is of people retiring much later. My generation will probably retire at 70, if at all. This also means that it is not enough to train once for a job. We must invest in further education and make flexible and attractive training available within the European Union, so that people can continue their education alongside their family life. These are all factors that we need to take into account and I am confident that we will be successful and will take a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need to encourage reform in Europe’s labour markets, but the best way to achieve this is through encouraging flexibility and creating the right conditions for businesses to grow. In terms of education, we need to ensure that alternatives to traditional teaching are available, such as apprenticeships and vocational training. Most importantly, education needs to be tailored to the needs of the labour market and this can only be achieved at a national level.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I especially welcome the mention of the University-Business Dialogue, which has the potential to be a very useful tool in harnessing the particular needs of business with the teaching of higher education and making sure that we plug the skills gap and deliver prospects of employment and real jobs for graduates.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to encourage these reforms, we need to ensure that there are provisions in place to allow simple, effective mobility for professionals and graduates. In doing so, we will be providing opportunities for engineers, teachers, doctors and others to move to another country and practise their profession and encourage cross-border trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I do find some aspects of this report particularly concerning and, whilst the goal of supplying every EU citizen with employment is very noble, it is simply unrealistic to ask Member States to meet arbitrary employment targets. Moreover, asking Member States to review the critical austerity measures they have been forced to take as part of their financial crisis could be seen as hypocritical given the fact that the EU itself consistently asks for increased budgets year on year.</p>
<p class="contents">The report talks about better working conditions for employees and touches on the social security systems in Member States. I do not believe that this will do anything to increase job creation; it would do quite the opposite. More rights for workers, especially in a society which already has the best workers’ rights in the world, will mean jobs are lost, as employers will find recruitment more and more expensive and burdensome.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the focus on job creation, the promotion of inclusive labour markets, the need for more mobility, innovation and research, are all necessary proposals, but let us not eliminate the real possibility of job creation by adding excessive burdens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It sounds like a green process for modernising the European economy. However, if you take a look at the report, you will find that this is entirely wrong. Unfortunately, the Commission is not playing a leading role in exploiting the employment potential of a green economy. Sadly, this is not the case. The Commission is focusing on making fundamental employees’ rights more flexible, which is the wrong approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to modernise the European economy, we need well-trained, skilled workers and companies can only retain these workers if they offer good working conditions. I have experience of this in the region where I come from. It is a major centre for the solar industry in Europe, but because the pay there is poor, in other words, worse than elsewhere, there is a lack of skilled workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bastos report corrects the Commission’s approach and rightly so. It demonstrates that a well-functioning labour market must be inclusive, as a previous speaker has confirmed. Most importantly, good jobs must be combined with investment in training. This is the only key to the success of an industrial society and the only opportunity for Europe to become a leading industrial society, by means of green modernisation. This will create enormous potential for green jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am curious to find out when the Commission will finally submit its communication on green jobs, so that we can begin to deal with the issues highlighted in the Bastos report and with the parliamentary initiative launched by my report. This will give us the opportunity to create real jobs in Europe and to combat poverty and unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are revolts of workers with precarious and poorly paid jobs; of millions of women and young people to whom a job with rights and a decent salary is being denied, and whose future is being mortgaged by increasingly neoliberal policies that intend nothing more than greater gains and greater profits for the usual suspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this report does not get to the crux of these problems: it does not analyse the causes of high unemployment, or the real reasons for the loss of 3.5 million jobs over the last two years and the forecast of the loss of 2.5 million more jobs over the next few years. It limits itself to blaming the crisis, neglecting to mention that the policies of the Stability and Growth Pact, free competition, liberalisations and privatisations, and workforce flexibility contributed to creating and exacerbating the crisis. As such, while there are positive points here and there, the majority are mere palliatives; simple aspirin for the cancer of the capitalist, anti-worker and anti-social policies that are spreading in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There are now thousands of highly qualified people who are out of work. That means the most urgent thing is to bring an end to the procession of companies going out of business, to the relocation of multinationals, to the destruction of industrial and agricultural sectors, and to the attacks on public services and small and medium-sized enterprises. That means the most urgent thing is to call a halt to the so-called austerity policies; to the programmes of aggression against the workers and peoples, such as in Greece and Portugal. If we do not do this, we will have no kind of agenda for new skills and new jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Remember the Lisbon Agenda – the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world leading to more and better jobs, a 10-year programme which started in 2000? Where is it? It failed, of course: simply because you keep on thinking you can solve a problem by central decree. Sorry, it does not work that way. Such programmes need a written plan, and then rules and regulations, and there we go: straight into the red tape jungle. If you could only understand that: cut the red tape and all the restrictive regulations, and let people get on with what they do best – making things and selling them.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I must remind you that big business can cope with red tape and can afford compliance officers and well-paid lawyers to bail them out if they make a mistake. SMEs, which employ half the workforce, do not have those resources, so when they get into trouble, they fold. Another one or two jobs go, and fewer youngsters are taken on to learn a trade. Take this morning’s farce in the vote on tyres for motor vehicles and trailers – not really a farce: it is another headache for the motor trade. For how many small garages will this be the last straw before they go under?</p>
<p class="contents">This whole agenda is another one-size-fits-all idea, or rather, one-size-that-fits-no one. The euro is one of those: now falling apart before your eyes, and all you can think of is to try more of the same. The first casualties of that disaster are, of course, the SMEs – and more jobs are lost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the statistics show that the likelihood of being unemployed increases exponentially, the worse a person’s level of education is. This is about every level of education. In schools, it is important to ensure that every pupil can understand the teaching being given in the language of the respective Member State. We must not allow the standard of living of future generations to suffer as a result of poor integration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, we need to offer incentives for lifelong learning to people of all ages. More IT courses should be available for older people in particular so that they are not faced with unnecessary obstacles. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a central role in providing education and training, both in highly specialised and innovative sectors and in basic manual skills. For this reason, the EU should provide financial support for internships in SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that, as we all know, the economic prospects for 2012 are not good at all and there is talk of an imminent recession. The EU must draw the necessary conclusions from this fact and place restrictions on economic migration. Given the number of people who are currently unemployed and who will be in future, it makes no sense to allow more unqualified workers into Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 23 million unemployed Europeans demand that institutions and governments take the necessary measures and adopt the reforms that guarantee competitiveness in the job market and the creation of jobs. This agenda is on the right track, and we will only achieve this aim by working together within a strengthened single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make a specific reference to one of the sectors that create most jobs within the Union, and which is suffering the most at present: small and medium-sized enterprises. The importance of SMEs in the European Union is clear if we bear in mind that they generate 84% of jobs. In my country, Spain, that figure is even higher.</p>
<p class="contents">This means we have to focus our efforts on the flexibility of the job market, the removal of cumbersome processes that slow down company creation, and to provide incentives for the self-employed and SMEs.</p>

Your colleague, Ms Damanaki, reiterated on your behalf the proposals that you are making regarding the use of the European Social Fund (ESF), to ensure that 25% is dedicated to training and to the use of the ESF in every project. However, we are concerned about the idea that, at this time of crisis, which we have been debating all day long, we might penalise countries that are finding it difficult to meet the Stability and Growth Pact criteria by reducing the structural funds, particularly the European Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe will not have the means to rise to the challenge it faces, namely, overcoming the crisis and implementing the Europe 2020 strategy – for which the objectives of job creation and combating social exclusion are absolutely paramount – in this way. If we wish to successfully rise to this challenge, the issue of training, as Ms Bastos has suggested to us, is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, we also need to ensure that the creation of new types of jobs does not make us lose sight of one of the pillars of European democracy, namely, the functioning of social dialogue. We do not believe that it is necessary to depart from this idea of collective agreements, which have ensured the success of social democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, through your colleague, Commissioner, you also pointed out that the European Job Mobility Portal, EURES, is a precious asset when it comes to the free movement of persons throughout Europe. I believe that together, we need to take a fresh look at this matter so as to ensure the effective operation of this tool. I have heard it said, here and there, that we might be able to improve its functioning, and I would like it if we could work towards this together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now more than ever, we need a competitive and flexible European education and vocational training system. This is precisely why I think that significant increases need to be made in investments in education, research and innovation, taking into account the possibility of allocating investments from the structural funds to this area, so as to be able to create the conditions for smart, sustainable economic growth. Vocational education and training make an important contribution to acquiring skills and expertise that are adapted to the requirements of the labour market. This is why I think that this system must be encouraged to become much more attractive and capable of addressing the current economic realities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, apart from supporting SMEs, which are the driving force of the economy, I think that an entrepreneurial spirit and skills must be encouraged throughout the whole period spent in education.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has always advocated the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises and thinks that a much closer link needs to be established between the business sector and educational institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to emphasise the key role that Member States play in implementing effectively all the European requirements and recommendations in the areas of education, research, innovation and employment.

The crisis has shown, however, that there is a need to continue with labour market reforms and to focus on supporting the transfer of workers and reducing the segmentation of the work sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I take a positive view of the discussed flagship initiative of the European Commission, which sets the target of contributing to the greater competitiveness of Member State economies, reducing the transaction costs of doing business in the EU and generally creating a better business environment, strengthening and improving the tertiary education system and the modernisation and greater flexibility of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nonetheless necessary to emphasise that the newly launched employment policy activities should not be too prescriptive, and that the flexicurity policy must be based on the conditions, priorities and needs of individual Member States. It is not possible to determine a specific mix of policies for the whole of the EU: individual approaches are needed. It is a case of a single contract, for example, where I may agree with the general aim of reducing differences in protection between fixed-term and non-fixed term obligations, but I nonetheless firmly believe that the specific form of implementation for this aim must be adapted to the conditions, needs and traditions of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to call for a sober and realistic approach to the implementation of this flagship initiative. Job creation through the reduction of administrative and legislative obstacles deserves our particular support. A reduction in the non-wage costs of labour, and facilitation of the transfer from informal or undeclared work to proper employment, also deserve our support. Fiscal intervention that distorts the market, the enthusiastic drawing up of tables and excessive regulation definitely do not deserve our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree with the Commission’s observation as regards the need to raise the qualification levels of young Europeans as well as the need to redefine certain skills that students might need today. We must not limit our proposals to satisfying the needs of labour market areas; we must also guarantee fair and universal access to quality public education and lifelong learning, so as to promote the intellectual and social development of every citizen, and particularly of young people, given the unacceptably high rate of unemployment among that age group.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, I believe there are two crucial aspects: firstly, digital literacy, which is becoming increasingly important for our evolving knowledge-based society. Emphasis must be placed, first and foremost, on literacy-based initiatives, and on refreshing and updating key skills in the field of communication and information technology, so as to reduce, or indeed eliminate, the digital divide. The next step for the Member States, therefore, is to integrate digital culture into teaching and training systems, while teaching a critical approach to modern forms of communication and media content.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and more generally, education and training have a place in the Green New Deal that we environmentalists wish to implement in the European Union. Indeed, we need to start by speeding up the transition towards a sustainable economy and developing the huge potential for green jobs that exists throughout Europe, with a view to protecting and restoring environmental quality and the quality of life of our fellow citizens across a wide range of sectors, such as transport, energy supply and even public services …</p>

I agree with the previous speaker that we must guarantee that everyone has access to high-quality education and qualifications. This must be one of the basic tasks of the European Union. However, especially in times of crisis, it becomes clear how solid the foundations of a united Europe are. I am concerned that parts of these foundations are starting to shake and crumble.</p>
<p class="contents">We have spoken about the European Social Fund (ESF) and also about the question of social dialogue. In contrast to Mr Vlasák, I do not believe that flexicurity will give us solid foundations. We do not need the flexicurity approach. Workers are effectively being forced to take poorly paid jobs which generally offer poor social protection. This will not give them the motivation to acquire new qualifications and to attend training courses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the EU is to get out of its current economic difficulties, this Agenda will be a defining part of that. The Member States have set the ambitious objective of a 75% employment rate for the 20 to 64 age group by 2020. In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, the September figures show an employment rate estimated at 67.3% for 16 to 64 year olds, which is an increase of one per cent during the course of the year. However, Northern Ireland still has the second highest unemployment rate among the twelve regions of the United Kingdom, with the figure currently 7.3% – still significantly lower than the EU average of 9.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of that rise in unemployment in Northern Ireland can be attributed to the collapse of the construction sector, which was seriously affected by the collapse of that industry in the Republic of Ireland. Trade in both goods and services between the two economies, as well as the job market, have all been detrimentally affected by the economic difficulties of our neighbours in the Irish Republic. These are difficult and trying times for all of us throughout the United Kingdom and the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said by Prime Minister Cameron about the chilling effect the euro crisis is having on UK recovery and growth. It is essential that we also recognise the chilling effect of the EU on business as a result of the restrictive, costly and time-consuming red tape and directives handed down by Europe. The UK Parliament last night debated, in the House of Commons, a motion for a referendum on relations with Europe. While I believe in the sovereignty of the nation state, it is interference from Europe that will drive the agenda in a referendum campaign. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Becker (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, hardly any other report would complement the current situation of the labour market and of the economy as perfectly as Ms Bastos’ report does. As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and of the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to focus on the area which is most important for the future of young people. Ms Hirsch has also mentioned that youth unemployment in Europe is very high. It is growing twice as fast as average unemployment across the entire working population. In some Member States, it has reached levels of up to 50%. This is why the Bastos report is so important, because it will allow us to give younger people a real chance in the labour market. We must take the measures called for in the report immediately. The younger generation must not be allowed to lose its hope in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a number of factors which are used in Europe for benchmarking. There are apprenticeships: a successful model based on the partnership between management and unions. There is the initiative for lifelong learning, which is an essential parallel measure to help reduce early school leaving rates. There is competence in communication technology, as computers and the Internet are the third essential skill after reading and writing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Ms Bastos and everyone involved on this important report. Finally, I would like to make one more point. There are some jobs which are particularly important for both young and old. This includes the field of care, support and assistance, where there will be huge demand and significant employment potential as indicated by the demographic forecasts. Young and older people must join together to encourage the Commission to take action. In addition, we must all make our own contribution in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the issue we are discussing today, new skills for new jobs, I would like to stress three training-related elements that I believe are of fundamental importance, primarily for combating youth unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is to promote training in disciplines that help to develop cross-cutting skills, such as digital skills in using new ICTs, creativity and the spirit of initiative, the ability to work in a team and language learning, all in an environment that encourages mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element is to ensure mutual recognition of degrees and qualifications obtained through any kind of learning, be it professional training, informal lifelong learning, volunteering, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to stress that, although these skills are primarily the responsibility of the Member States, the European Union should continue to provide resources for education and training programmes in order to provide good-quality education that is accessible to all.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am delighted that the Commission has planned to increase the budget for 2012 for these programmes by approximately eight per cent. This is the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that at present in Europe, there are great difficulties associated with employment and training. It should not be that way, because Europe in 2010 was supposed to be the world’s leading knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We failed with the Lisbon strategy, however, and now the worldwide economic crisis that has held sway since 2008 is also affecting Europe. Over what has been at least a two-year period, Europe has lost 5.6 million jobs. Furthermore, the cycle only seems to be continuing. At present, the unemployment rate among the working population is 9.5%, which means that we have 23 million people unemployed in the European Union. The target should be full employment, which is what it is in the Commission and the European Union. The Europe 2020 strategy is based on the notion that the employment rate will rise to 75% among those between 20 and 64 years of age. In my view, however, we cannot accept a 25% unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we respond to a situation where the world has changed and the so-called China phenomenon is having a very powerful effect on us? We can only respond with training and investment in innovation, new research and product development. In these economically difficult times, we need to invest heavily and put money specifically into innovation, new research and product development. Only in that way can we make a new start, achieve new growth and provide jobs which can generate European added value, and which will help us to succeed in global markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Skills that just 20 years ago were mastered by only a handful of specialists in the field of computer literacy, for instance, are a fundamental requirement for most jobs today. The European Union should encourage as many of its citizens as possible to embrace the idea of lifelong learning so that they can effectively meet the new challenges they are faced with in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must also pay ever more attention to the demands the European labour market will present in the future, especially when it comes to specialist skills. Taking appropriate action in order to adapt Europeans to an increasingly demanding labour market is particularly important today in the context of the economic crisis which is haunting the Union. We need economic growth on a massive scale to get out of this crisis. This growth cannot be achieved without significantly increasing the level of employment. We should therefore ensure that the citizens of the Union are prepared in the best possible manner for the future challenges of the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that almost 6 million jobs have been lost in the EU recently confirms the need to make fundamental changes to current economic and social regulations. Despite the fact that the unemployment rate is approaching 10% of the active European population, there is still a shortage of qualified workers in many areas, such as IT, health care and research and development, for example. Employers from industry confirm the lack of specialists in many professions on the labour market. Therefore, we should now provide operational support, in particular, for requalification and training in those professions where employers still have vacancies, despite the continuing economic crisis. We should also involve employers more closely in the processes of preparing study courses, training methods and the assessment of qualifications, as well as material encouragement for those employers who undertake to train their workers themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One has to agree with this statement; at the same time, it is to be stressed that in reality, no other model has proven more workable. Both Europe and America are not only engulfed in enormous unemployment, but they are also full of people who are not able to get out of poverty despite having a job. More importantly, this problem mainly affects young people, as exemplified by the current social movements of the so-called Outraged or the 99% Movement.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that this situation stems from two important sources. On the one hand, the educational system is not able to respond to the needs of the rapidly changing economy and, at the end of the day, we have to admit openly that we are not able to predict accurately what skills will be needed, not even in the coming decade. Thirdly, the so-called junk job contracts give rise to a feeling of insecurity among workers, and thus destabilise the consumer market. A person who is unsure about his future will never make a good consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">What lies before the European Union and its Member States is not an easy task. On the one hand, it is necessary to create educational systems that will prepare young people for the rapidly and unpredictably changing labour market, and will support them through practical programmes. The Stage Project, which was mentioned by the rapporteur Ms Regina Bastos, and which prepares graduates for finding jobs, is a good example. On the other hand, it is necessary to apply skilfully the principles of <span class="italic">flexicurity</span>, which allows the flexibility of the employment relationship to be combined with social guarantees that help employees to achieve appropriate living standards, so that they can develop their career and work out their pension schemes with some stability. Additional action is needed to promote entrepreneurship and to create small and medium-sized enterprise-friendly and investor-friendly conditions. All these measures require immediate implementation, and therefore they must be designed properly so that their implementation is possible under the conditions of the still ongoing economic and financial crisis. Savings in the Member States are necessary to ensure the stability of public finances. However, they should not adversely affect the creation of new jobs that will bring Europe the much-needed sustainable economic growth. Finally, I would like to thank Ms Bastos for the excellent cooperation in drawing up this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this must not mean that the labour markets are made more flexible unilaterally, without the involvement of unions and management, and, at the same time, that workers have little or no social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Flexicurity, a combination of security and flexibility, has so far only been used by the Member States as a magic word which will allow them to gradually increase flexibility and also to make working conditions more precarious. We do not want flexicurity under these circumstances. A cheap approach will not create jobs. We have established this during the discussion on the previous item. Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again that we are strongly opposed to the single open-ended contracts proposed by the Commission. From our perspective, offering contracts which will result in a lowering of social standards to young people who are starting work will not create one single job. Instead, it will play the different generations on the labour market off against one another.</p>
<p class="contents">Labour market reforms must be negotiated with unions and management and must provide robust pension systems, training, employee rights and social security. We are very much opposed to interventions in the national systems for wage negotiations involving management and unions. I would like to thank everyone involved. I hope that tomorrow, we will adopt this positive report which would be further improved by the two amendments from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A year has elapsed since the European Commission's proposal concerning the agenda for new skills and employment, yet unemployment in Europe is still growing. One can say that European strategies are ineffective and do not keep up with reality. More and more people are excluded from the labour market. Member States are forced to reduce public spending, which has very serious social consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is essential to release the initiatives as soon as possible and to launch a number of European hardship funds. Without doubt, the most pressing issue is the problem of employment of young people – graduates of universities and vocational schools. They are often forced to take jobs in very difficult conditions and for very low pay. I support the idea of creating incentives for entrepreneurs in order to develop work experience programmes that allow young people the earliest possible contact with the labour market. This will help reduce the scale of social exclusion of people entering their adult life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The global crisis led to a rise in unemployment, including in the rate of young unemployed people, which reaches 40% in some Member States. Unfortunately, in many cases, even employed young people have to take on jobs below their level of skills or qualifications, and their knowledge and talents remain untapped.</p>
<p class="contents">The new socio-economic environment requires better employment, educational and organisational strategies. I agree that it is indispensable to improve qualification levels in a targeted manner and by adjusting them to demands in order to help people acquire new skills. For this, we need to inform young people continuously about foreseeable demands for various qualification levels. Thus, they can focus on improving skills that are truly in demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Forecasts project a serious shortage of IT, health care and research professionals by 2015, which means that we should focus on these fields. Regrettably, most education and training systems are still not adjusted to labour market demands, which hinders young people’s transition from education into work.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, at the time of the crisis, Member States tend to cut back on their education and training budget, even though this is the area that is in great need of reform programmes in order to adapt to the rapidly changing labour market. Our response to challenges must be flexible and almost up-to-date. One solution to this could be the adequate supply of training and retraining options, which would enable us to keep up with labour market demands.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that economic ‘know-how’ and technical and vocational training must be overhauled, which requires major investments. We need more investment in education and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with and support the fact that in the upcoming legislative proposal on professional qualifications, we should reinforce the mutual recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The creation of more and better jobs should be a priority for the European Union: 23 million unemployed is a shocking figure. The high rate of unemployment has economic and social consequences, and threatens the sustainability of social security systems. There is, therefore, a need to improve skills in the areas of science, education and new technology, amongst young people above all. In this way, we will put Europe on the path to progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are in a peculiar situation: they comprise 60% of new graduates, but very few of them choose the areas of science and technology. Part-time work is dominated by women. This means that part of women’s potential is not being utilised, and this threatens their economic independence in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should support specific programmes promoting the recruitment of women for technical professions, following the good practices of some countries. I should also like to stress the important role of microcredit, which is an important tool in increasing women’s employability and constitutes one of the most effective means for women to become economically independent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The negative figures from the 27 Member States, as quoted by the rapporteur, along with the uncertain financial prospects and large numbers of people suffering poverty mentioned in Ms Damanaki’s speech, make it an uphill struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the target of 75% employment for the 20-64 age group by the end of 2020 is over-ambitious. The commitment should perhaps be revised and made more realistic given the dramatic evidence of the financial crisis. In fact, I believe that if we set exaggerated targets, it is easy to fail when identifying the tools necessary for achieving them, and the conclusions drawn at the 2010 Lisbon Summit should make us ponder this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing this in mind, I share the rapporteur’s conviction that the Commission’s commitments, which were announced in a communication last November, are to be supported and can, in any case, be improved with everyone’s help. More specifically I believe that the creation of a flexible and secure market is a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, it is essential to step up efforts to define flexible contractual provisions able to cater for social and geographical variations and, above all, to safeguard workers against insecurity; to introduce new tools to promote active labour market policies, with measures increasing the accountability of intermediaries; to modernise education and training in order to bring qualifications into line with market demand; and to revise safety systems to make them more efficient without impacting on costs, especially with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, measures should be adopted to make the market inclusive, in order to guarantee access by women, young people and disadvantaged groups, and the return to work of people who have left the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I must also say that I am perplexed by what the Commission says in its report and also by what it fails to mention. For example, it highlights the fact that in the coming years, 85% of the jobs created will require a high-level qualification. This is a warning to the next generation that, if they want to find a job in coming years, they must be trained and that this training must also be continuous. We are asking them for more qualifications, and yet we are offering them less security. Does this not seem contradictory to you? Does it not at least strike you as lamentable that our response to harder work is fewer rights?</p>
<p class="contents">The maxim of ‘the more the temporary employment, the higher the employability’, has failed. We have created employment with growth and we are destroying it in times of recession. Meanwhile, we have not at any time managed to solve the underlying problem, which is that, regardless of whatever cycle we are in, the youth unemployment rate is always twice as high as the general unemployment rate. Young people have fewer rights than a decade ago, but still have the same unemployment rates.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that, if we do not criticise the single contract that the Commission proposes in this report, if we do not stop the attacks on collective bargaining, if we do not call for an end to rising insecurity as the only possible way forward, if we do not say that the problem with new jobs is not the social costs of the workers, we will be falling once again into the mistakes of the past and will consequently also be complicit, once again, in the problems of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We undertook to raise the employment rate among people aged between 20 and 64 to 75% over the course of the next few years. The fact is, unemployment is in full swing. It has destroyed jobs and has hit young people particularly hard. As Ms Bastos has said, there are two forecasts prompting us to change our course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a significant change in the type of jobs that will be created, on the one hand, thanks to the end of the crisis and, on the other, because many age groups will have retired. This change in jobs will require workers to adapt to new conditions and to a new level of corporate competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it will result in higher qualification levels. Almost 15% of low skilled jobs will disappear, and 15% of highly skilled jobs will appear. Hence, workers as a whole will have to be moved. This is already happening in companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Social Fund (ESF) is there to support this process. These are dynamic appropriations, Commissioner, and that is why I urge you to ensure that the ESF is not penalised twice for reasons associated with Member States’ good governance. You can imagine this association with Member States’ governance of land management funds, but not of the ESF; this is because the latter is used to support workers and to support the competitiveness of businesses. That is the only way Europe will be able to overcome the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is that in order to create new jobs and boost growth and development, it is essential to remove social safeguards and reduce the rights of people who are working and who will be joining the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, traces of this idea are present in the Commission’s communication, because decentralising collective bargaining, which would nullify national collective bargaining, not only objectively harms weaker people, who would not have the same protection as before, but also introduces a form of social dumping between those who have one condition and those who have another, and alters the competitive mechanisms of the companies themselves. The same is true when considering encouraging the creation of a contract that would be stable, but based on very basic conditions, which once again affects people’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this cannot be the point of reference, but instead this should be what Europe wrote in Lisbon as long ago as the year 2000, and that is that belief in know-how, in the growth of knowledge and the ability to innovate, in terms of both the product and the process, and working men and women, is one of the main, fundamental values of any concept of business now and in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Cofferati has just said, we have addressed here an important point, a matter which is definitely part of the EU 2020 strategy, in our discussion about new skills that should also create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is really very difficult to determine at the present moment what the jobs are that will be needed over the next ten years, in order for us to subsequently determine the quota for training people. That will not work. What does work is a continuous system whereby people can receive retraining or further training and, with such retraining and further training, we have to ensure that we can prepare ourselves rapidly for any job market.</p>
<p class="contents">Young people need special attention. Special attention also needs to be given to older people who are unemployed. We have said that we want more hands in the labour market. We believe that we should have continued guarantees for our pensions. That will only be possible if we get more people into work. I therefore say: let us have young hands, but let us also have the older hands. We really should create programmes aimed at retraining them or providing them with further training. We must not spend the next twenty years talking about it, but really get on with the job. We must ensure that we get a better labour market, which will also allow us to resolve many more problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recession and unemployment rates are spiralling, especially among young people. Work is being deregulated. The EU 2020 strategy and its seven flagship initiatives are being promoted in order to address the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to increase the employment rate among men and women to 75%. The Agenda for New Skills and Jobs is being promoted with the objective of immediately reforming the labour market to make it more flexible and more secure, investing in training, constantly improving qualifications and the mobility of workers, and encouraging employment by reducing the administrative burden.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all well and good and we are in absolute agreement. However, the Commission’s proposed agenda should adopt more measures on investment in state education and to support pension systems and green jobs, more measures to reconcile family and professional obligations and, more importantly, to strengthen social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed, first and foremost, is a proper plan and effective employment, education and training policies, so that workers’ skills and qualifications can really adapt to the needs of today’s labour market, not tomorrow’s.

<p class="contents">Ms Bastos is my friend, I love her dearly and she has prepared an excellent report. It was a difficult report because, when we prepare a report in the European Parliament, we do not prepare it <span class="italic">in vitro</span>, in a test tube. We prepare our reports <span class="italic">in vivo</span>, in life, and life is proving rather difficult at the moment. We are in an economic crisis and we are in recession. Ms Bastos has to take account of this very difficult situation and to produce a very specific report that speaks about the future and that sees into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">She is being called upon to be ‘politically short-sighted’ but not to be ‘long-sighted’. How will she manage? We socialists shall help her, because we want flexibility, but we want it alongside security. If there is no security, that means that we are politically both ‘short-sighted and long-sighted’ at the same time, which will rob Europe of its future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need to bear in mind that workers’ rights are sacred.

The numbers speak for themselves. Since the crisis erupted in 2008, it has cost the Union more than 5.5 million jobs. This represents millions of our fellow citizens from EU Member States who are unemployed. However, the report on this programme unfortunately includes a number of very problematic points. It is a pity that the right are exploiting the crisis to promote the idea of the kind of labour market flexibility they want to introduce, without simultaneously adopting and strengthening the social protection systems negotiated with the social partners in the tripartite dialogue. The programme tries to weaken tripartite relations and advocates reforms and forms of employment law relationships that are not covered by rights. There are also shortcomings in the programme in the area of active measures, Commissioner. Reductions in unemployment benefits, the privatisation of pension systems, the lack of investment in public education systems and also the lack of green investments are all problems which make the programme hard to swallow in such a form. I therefore hope that we will be able to find a compromise that will ensure the resolution of a critical situation in such a way that the employment position in the EU will improve without cutting the social standards we have achieved in Europe over recent decades. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need new skills and continuous training to ensure that if and when the economy picks up, it should not do so without the creation of new jobs. Very often, training and development should start at a very young age, in order to avoid the preservation of initial, start-up inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">According to OECD research, investment in education and training has a very high yield, because highly trained people pay more taxes, public revenues exceed expenditures, and the rate of employment is also higher among people with higher qualifications. However, we must pay particular attention to people who are the furthest from the labour market, whether due to their disabilities, ethnic background, family circumstances, age or other reasons. They, too, should not be forced out of the labour market, because sustainable development should also be based on inclusion where the labour market is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment is particularly dangerous for young people because it can impact their entire future career. The regulations concerning utilisation of the European Social Fund should be set up in such a way as to reach the target groups of the flagship initiatives: the poor, the young and the Roma. This will be our most important tool in the next budgetary period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have followed Ms Damanaki’s explanation carefully. She said that there is no automatic mechanism for creating jobs. The Commission can only provide the instruments. For this reason, I would like to look at the instruments proposed by the Commission and I would like to debunk one myth. It does not pay to be as flexible as possible, either financially or in other ways, when first starting work or later in life. The more flexible employment relationships are, the less people earn and the worse their social protection is. One very important point is that the increase in flexible, precarious jobs and in endless internships does not give people the incentive to acquire the necessary innovative knowledge, qualifications and skills for the future, which we need just as much as our daily bread. If I have to run round to find a bread roll every day, as we say in Vienna, in other words, if I have to constantly search for an internship or worry about whether I will get the next short-term contract, I will expend most of my brainpower and energy on these activities, which would be much better spent on acquiring suitable qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">A study by the European Youth Forum carried out in 2011, in other words, quite recently, shows that three-quarters of the 4 000 people surveyed, most of whom were under 25, were not being paid at all or were receiving inadequate pay. This means that most interns need financial support from their parents. Therefore, I am making a clear call for the establishment of a charter for the rights of interns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that by tomorrow, we can have agreement on a number of improvements, which will enable the Socialists and Democrats Group to fully support this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment growth is the most urgent need in Europe and must be built into our response to the banking and economic crisis. There seems to be a disconnection between the economic and social policies in Europe. On the one hand, we have the skills and jobs agenda and, on the other, austerity programmes which insist that Member States cut social support to the unemployed on the spurious grounds that the unemployed are being disincentivised to take up work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, studies in Ireland have shown that the unemployed are better off financially if they can find even a minimum-wage job. The problem is that even low paid jobs are not available. The Troika reports that Ireland’s programme is on target, and I am often asked why there are no riots in Ireland. I could advance many reasons for this, but one of the most fundamental reasons is that the government has negotiated with the trade unions the reforms in the labour market and in the public services that are required.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge that we have some common sense. Flexicurity without security is a contradiction in terms and, if it is imposed, it will result only in deeper alienation. It will result in a deeply stagnant economy and higher levels of poverty. I believe we must ensure that, when we move forward, we do so on the basis of a broad consensus of labour and capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the direction that should be taken in teacher training, the promotion of training partnerships between companies, training centres and research centres and the promotion of high-level training. Today, we have a two-speed market for young people, and the situation is getting worse.

Political representatives must focus their attention on establishing preventive measures for avoiding unemployment by boosting the skills of the workforce and, at the same time, raising awareness of the current medium and long term outlook for employment on the labour market. I would like to emphasise the need to integrate disabled citizens into working and social life by creating adequate jobs with the support of the European Structural Funds.

This applies, in particular, to technicians and IT professionals, but also to many specialisms in the wider area of health care.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal is the following: we should extend much greater support to areas where there is a shortage of workforce, and eliminate existing barriers. Many people gain qualifications in their respective countries and are not able to take up work in other countries because those countries do not recognise their skills. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur rightly points out that the national reform programmes do not sufficiently address the challenges for growth in employment and for combating poverty. In the recently published draft regulations, the European Commission stressed that future operational programmes would be based on national reform programmes. Thus, it is necessary to improve them in order to utilise effectively the instruments of the cohesion policy. Participation of the regional and local levels in their preparation, implementation and evaluation, as well as in the implementation of the main initiative discussed today, is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this initiative will contribute to a fuller exploitation of the potential of people whose access to the labour market today is difficult, such as young parents, people with disabilities and those caring for dependents. Moreover, I hope that this initiative will provide the impetus for closer cooperation between educational institutions and businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by Ms Bastos contains some good suggestions, but, as we all know, the deployment of measures to change the administrative practices of Member States, for example, will, unfortunately, take years. The problems connected with unemployment and exclusion among the young do not allow us to wait around even for a moment. Without adequate action, those problems will get worse from one year to the next, with active young people keen to find work and able to do it gradually becoming passive and unwilling to work.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland, it has been estimated that every excluded young person – just one – costs society EUR 1.2 million. Although that figure varies from one Member State to the next, we are talking about huge sums of money. We must take this matter seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By this, I mean, above all, young people, women, older people, people approaching retirement and people with disabilities. All of these groups are united by one common goal – these people must obtain the required qualifications, education and retraining in a timely manner and must have appropriate skills so that they really are suited to the job. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that employers really should be involved in the preparation of professional training programmes and various other training programmes, because this would mean that they have to specify the sort of qualified people we need now and the sort that we will need in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why new skills? Changes in the labour market undoubtedly make it necessary to change and acquire new skills. However, what should we do with the skills that represent our heritage and our traditions?</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Bastos highlights the need to maintain the craft tradition and its associated skills. However, we need to do more. What about the trades that were once pivotal to the economy in certain areas? These areas, for example, in the mountains and foothills, no longer exist, having been abandoned in favour of the cities. One solution which could help create jobs and therefore help with employment might be precisely to rehabilitate certain trades and traditions, which would also help disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure certain jobs continue, we need to invest in the young and give them a leading role in projects, traditions and trades that have fallen into disuse in the areas in question. Training aimed at finding young people jobs in small companies in these areas would have a two-fold benefit, helping to rehabilitate abandoned areas and increasing youth employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much of the discussion, and most of those who contributed, stressed the importance of education and training as a key element of employment policies. I fully agree with this, but I would like to avoid reducing employment policy to just education and training, which is the key component of the supply side of the employment policy, and a key component that can help investment in human resources. We should not forget that there is also a demand side on which we have to work, and there are labour market institutions where we have to work on better functioning and greater improvement and development within the Member States, but especially at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important theme has been, and continues to be, the concept of flexicurity and, especially, how we should judge flexibility within the labour market. Again, what I would like to highlight is that flexicurity has four components: not only the flexible arrangement, but also, for example, lifelong learning, which was referred to in a very positive manner in the discussion. We will actually revisit the concept of flexicurity in a consultation conference on 14 November, especially on the understanding that because of our experience of the crisis, we need to take a fresh look at this concept, or its four components, and the capacity of flexicurity to contribute to job creation in the coming period.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this conference, with the involvement of the social partners, will help us in going forward, and pave the way for our package of employment policy initiatives next Spring. Flexicurity will be the backbone of this package, but within the same package, we will also put forward a ‘green jobs’ initiative, as President Barroso also announced in his letter to the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But, as the President highlighted in his State of the Union message, the most burning issue in the whole area of employment policy is the question of youth in the European Union. This is not simply because the average youth unemployment rate in the EU is very high – 21% – but also because this average covers up huge differences within the EU. Especially in the Southern European countries, but also in the Baltic states, Ireland and Slovakia, the youth unemployment rate is unacceptably high.</p>
<p class="contents">We have some good experience. The better-performing countries should not be overlooked; we should appreciate that some Member States manage to maintain youth unemployment at a relatively low level, and we should learn from their experience. That is why we have been advocating the ‘Youth Guarantee’ that Austria used, for example. We are putting forward new proposals for apprenticeships and traineeships. As Ms Berès pointed out, we are preparing to give a boost to the EURES network, which is a very important and effective tool at EU level. In fact, EURES is the most frequently visited website of the European Commission, and helps a huge number of people to find appropriate vacancies.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to work on quality. I fully agree with those who said that it is not only the quantity of the jobs which is important, although, of course, this is the key question now. But without ensuring that, for example, in the case of traineeships, the quality improves, I do not think that we can be satisfied. That is why I am also preparing an important initiative in the context of the employment package in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long run, there will be a different balance, a different emphasis on other issues and other challenges. For example, the question of active ageing will be very relevant, with a strong employment dimension. I believe that next year, in the context of the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, we will have opportunities not just to discuss this but also to look for concrete proposals and solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to those, like Ms Berès and Ms Morin-Chartier, who pointed to the capacity of the European Social Fund and its importance in supporting employment policies in the Member States. This can support our skills agenda by improving and modernising education and training, including vocational training and lifelong learning, providing targeted support for specific groups where the employment rate is relatively low and the challenges are the greatest for job creation, such as young people, older workers, people with disabilities, women coming back to the labour market after childbirth, and ethnic minorities, where we have new commitments, for example, in the form of the Roma inclusion strategies. We must not only talk the talk; we also have to walk the walk, and the ESF will have to help in that.</p>
<p class="contents">The ESF can support tailor-made policies (there was a question about Greece). In the context of the crisis, we have demonstrated that there is flexibility, adaptation and a reaction to the changing circumstances – just like in the case of Ireland, where the positive experience was cited by Mr De Rossa. Indeed, the jobs initiative, however small, points in the right direction and can be supported by the ESF, and this can be a model for other countries as well. This is why I am also working closely with the Task Force and its Head, Mr Reichenbach, to ensure that, within the room for manoeuvre that exists in Greece (and hopefully from tomorrow there will be more), we can do more for jobs there too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one very important point about the social dialogue. I believe it should not, and cannot, be doubted. The social dialogue is an essential pillar not just of the European social model, but also of our economic model. It is an economic asset, and it is no coincidence that those countries that performed best in the last few years from the point of view of economic growth and job creation, protecting jobs but also improving quality, are the countries where the social dialogue is the strongest and best institutionalised.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have to rely more on the cooperation of the social partners in all different ways, from legislation to skills planning and adaptation. Of course, the crisis, and especially financial stabilisation, is always a test, a difficult period for social dialogue. But the commitment of the Commission to developing the social dialogue further and boosting its quality at European level, as the President stated in the State of the Union message, should not be a matter of any doubt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone made very useful speeches and contributed to a very constructive discussion on an ambitious agenda at a time when we are experiencing a serious crisis. In fact, this debate is taking place on the very eve of a European Council meeting that will show whether or not there is the political will to overcome the problems that we are experiencing, whether there is the political will to deepen our economic coordination, and whether there is truly a harmonised and unitary will to move ahead with the ambition of this agenda. This ambition is to have new jobs in the next decade; new jobs that give the young people who are unemployed today and those who are training hope in the labour market; new jobs that give them hope in an inclusive labour market and respond to their ambition of achieving dignity through work; new jobs that are also capable of being a new and permanent driving force to meet the challenges of a globalised economy, which has a dynamic without parallel in recent generations.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that our ambition is really for jobs to be created and for the economy to grow. This is in response, not just to those who are unemployed following the crisis, but also to those who are going to enter the labour market. It is also in response to the great challenges involved in the green economy, in health and related services, to transport services, to housing: all of these require a different vision, a smart vision and an inclusive vision of the labour market. Many thanks to all of you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This situation has grave consequences for the EU’s growth and social security systems. Equally disturbing are the difficulties encountered by some employers in recruiting staff, especially for highly skilled posts. Reinforcing human capital and employability by means of updating skills will mean putting Europe on the path to recovery. The Agenda for New Skills and Jobs is aimed at devising effective policies for employment, education and training, and facilitating individuals’ career choices. It is therefore necessary to improve the ability of the Member States and the Union to forecast and anticipate the nature of future skills and ensure that they are in line with labour market needs, which requires greater investment in research and development, in order to create added value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States are responsible for achieving these objectives, which is why they must respond effectively to the current challenges. I think that significant investments are required in education, as well as in research and development. The necessary incentives also need to be offered to citizens to help them update their skills and allow them to adapt to the new requirements of the labour market. Furthermore, measures need to be adopted to reduce the school dropout rate, and Member States must offer pupils alternative forms of training and apprenticeships. The integration of young people into the labour market must be supported while they are still studying. Efforts need to be stepped up with the aim of recognising diplomas and professional qualifications of citizens, both across the EU and in third countries. Last but not least, I think that we need measures to guarantee conditions conducive to creating jobs on the labour market, especially by reducing the administrative burdens and labour-related taxes, in order to facilitate economic recovery and protect the EU’s competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Education, beginning at a young age, should be a priority for ensuring future employment. Education increases human capital and will provide for the rising need for skilled, as opposed to unskilled, workers. Member States should learn from one another in order to best provide citizens with proper education. I also propose that skills training programmes should be increased in order to give currently unskilled labourers the chance to move into the skilled labour fields, particularly in areas related to the IT and health fields, which currently demand more labour. Furthermore, I stress the importance of working towards job creation in sustainable fields. Parliament should work to increase human capital, via education and skills training, and towards creating jobs to enable the EU to stay in line with the 2020 target of 75% employment. The current economic situation should not stop the EU from meeting its current goals and striving towards sustainable growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
