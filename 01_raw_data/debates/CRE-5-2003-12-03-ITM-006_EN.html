<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr Antonione, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will be the last in a highly eventful year. Indeed, almost every week brings with it developments and decisions that will have a major impact on our future. Last week was no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Before turning to the debate on the Constitution, I should like to focus briefly on another topical issue for the European Union. The forthcoming European Council will be preceded – as Mr Antonione said – by an extraordinary Tripartite Social Summit, to be attended by the Heads of State of the troika and representatives of the social partners and the Commission. Indeed, it is vital to involve the social partners at this stage of the constitutional process and it is essential that we listen to their points of view. The involvement of trades union and employers is the best guarantee of success for any initiative promoting employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting will address two issues which are at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy: our Growth Initiative and the European Employment Strategy. The key moment will be the presentation of the task force’s report on employment by Mr Wim Kok. The report describes how we can respond to the major changes taking place in the economy and the labour market. Its main points include the need for firms and workers to become more adaptable, for more investment in human capital and, lastly, for new social dynamics to sustain reforms and speed up their implementation. The Commission will take account of the task force’s report and recommendations when it drafts the Joint Employment Report for presentation to the Spring Council next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall now turn to the central theme of my speech, the Intergovernmental Conference, which is entering its final stages and of which Mr Antonione has already given an extremely balanced, commendable overview. The stakes will be high at the European Council in Brussels on 12 and 13 December. In the decisions taken we will see the fruit of the new Convention method, proposed by the European Parliament and the Commission and approved by the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken European Council in December 2001. Any return to the method of intergovernmental bargaining we witnessed in the early hours of the Nice summit would represent a political failure for the European Union. Public opinion would no longer accept it. The key task for the Intergovernmental Conference is now to decide how the enlarged Union can achieve its goals and increase its decision-making capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is faced with three major challenges. Firstly, it needs strong policies and better European coordination aimed at economic growth, job-creation and social protection. Then we have to give a common response to the international challenges related to security, freedom and justice. Thirdly, we must join forces in order to shoulder our global responsibilities and promote our values and interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 3 of the draft Constitution solemnly sets out the Union’s objectives along these lines. The Convention did not, of course, produce a perfect Constitution to address these tasks. All the same, the result matches the proposals contained in the Laeken Declaration, maybe even exceeding expectations. The Intergovernmental Conference has clearly so far been more occupied with internal disputes between Member States than with creating the right instruments to respond to Europe’s needs and problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly disappointing that there was no progress whatsoever on adoption of a procedure making amendment of the policy part of the Constitution possible. The Commission will support all the Presidency’s efforts to achieve this objective. Considering the new challenges that we will face, the Constitution cannot and must not become a constraint on future action. The only significant progress made so far on the work of the Convention has been the definition of structured cooperation in the field of defence. For all other issues, there is still a danger that the Intergovernmental Conference might take steps backwards towards the intergovernmental method. This is also true of European cooperation on criminal law, at precisely a time when all the leaders are aware of the threat of international crime and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, some want to undermine the credibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs – as Mr Antonione made clear – while paying lip service to the need for Europe to become stronger and play a leading role on the world stage. Some ministers maintain that more intergovernmentalism would strengthen economic policy coordination, while what is really needed is a greater European ability to put economic governance at the service of the growth strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries would even like to reintroduce the right of veto in areas where the Convention has already abolished it, in trade policy for instance. Clearly, therefore, there are only two options: a divided Europe that is only a spectator on the world political stage or a united Europe contributing to peace, growth and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">With a choice between these two opposing options, Europe is in danger of being relegated to the sidelines in world affairs, surrounded by other powerful actors. In its current form, the draft Constitution gives a united Europe the means to act more effectively. Nothing less, but nothing more. It does not create a political project for the future. Hence, the key question facing national leaders at the Intergovernmental Conference summit is not whether to commit themselves to an ambitious European political project. The key question is whether, in the future, they will find the collective ability to adopt the necessary instruments which any European project will need.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention preserved and improved the balance of powers between the various European Union institutions. A strong Commission is indispensable for impartial application of the Union’s rules and so the Commission’s powers in key areas such as state-aid control should not be watered down at the last minute. Our goal of becoming a genuine Union of states and peoples finds expression in the double-majority system proposed for Council decision-making. Democratic legitimacy has been reinforced by strengthening the role of the European Parliament in legislative, political and budgetary matters, and the Court of Justice's role in upholding the rule of law has, in part, been strengthened. One thing is certain, ladies and gentlemen: the Commission will hold out against any attempt to weaken the powers of the European Parliament, especially in budgetary matters, right to the end of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">How can the European Parliament and the Commission be expected to explain and promote to the citizens a Constitution which Parliament itself would have rejected? There is no explanation that would stand up.</p>
<p class="contents">For its own part, the Commission welcomes the Presidency’s acknowledgement that making a distinction between Commissioners with and without voting powers is too complex and, above all, will not work. There is a simple solution which preserves the equality of all Commissioners: a Commission made up of one Commissioner per Member State, with a more decentralised decision-making structure, and a system of checks and balances to ensure total collegiality. This is the solution that the Commission wants to see in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the double-majority voting system proposed by the Convention <span class="bold"></span> 50% of the Member States representing 60% of the population - is simple and fair. Any change should be aimed at facilitating the College’s decision-making process. Of course, the Commission’s preference remains a system based on 50% of the Member States representing at least 50% of the population. Under no circumstances should the Intergovernmental Conference decide on a voting system that would make decision-making in the Council even more difficult than under the Nice system.</p>
<p class="contents">There is simply no justification for a Constitution ‘worse than Nice’. Moreover, in Brussels, we must, at all costs, avoid the kind of last-minute bartering that would serve only to undermine the credibility of the Constitution before we have even had a chance to present it. Remember that the first referendum on the Constitution will be held a mere six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before winding up – and without entering into a debate that will take place in this House at a later date – I should like to make a few brief comments on last week’s Ecofin Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">My assessment is based on both the substance of the decision and the procedure. As regards the substance, the Council reached overall agreement on deficit reduction plans, which, moreover, are in line with those proposed by the two countries concerned. The Council therefore accepted the commitments given by Germany and France that they would consolidate their 2005 budgets. From a procedural standpoint, on the other hand, the affair has more serious implications because the Council has opted for an entirely intergovernmental course of action instead of that mapped out by the institutional procedures. Here, I must repeat my basic criticism: we should not take short cuts whenever the rules of the Pact and the Treaty, rules that were agreed unanimously, become demanding or inconvenient. The usefulness and value of the Treaty and the Pact depend on the certainty of the rules to which we all – Commission, Parliament, Council and Member States – must adhere.</p>
<p class="contents">This is such a serious matter that I do not wish to gloss over it. My hope is, however, that, as has so often happened in the history of the Union, a serious crisis will give rise to the most innovative and lasting solutions. I therefore believe we should look ahead, fixing our eyes on two objectives: one for the immediate term and one for the future. In the immediate term, I am sure that the Member States will see the Council's final declaration as an indication of a greater, more resolute undertaking in the area of growth and stability, and that they will realise that the rules have to be applied systematically. For our part, we shall continue to discharge our duty by applying the Treaty and the rules of the Pact. It is our responsibility, particularly in this phase, to ensure absolute equality of treatment for all Member States. Furthermore, budgetary discipline and stability are essential to Economic and Monetary Union. In any case, the affair also teaches us a lesson for the future. You will all remember the critical remarks I made a year ago. I did not mean to condemn the Pact; my remarks were intended to be a strong appeal for the Pact to become a better thought-out instrument for coordinating budgetary policies at European level. Now that the single currency is a practical reality, the markets and all the citizens need to be able to rely on proper economic governance, for which we need a genuine economic policy. We have to embark on a new phase of consolidating and managing our achievements and fitting them to the new situation, but always in a disciplined manner and, above all, always treating everybody equally. We must restore the credibility of our instruments of economic governance and of the rule of law now that we are in the midst of a debate on our new Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as a year ago, the Commission took an initial step in this direction by presenting specific proposals for strengthening and coordinating economic policies and interpreting the Pact in a way that would make it both more flexible and more rigorous. This line of action proposed by the Commission was approved by the European Council. Moreover, our contribution to the Convention already contained a section on strengthening and coordinating European economic policy, and parts of our proposals were taken up by the Intergovernmental Conference. These tentative steps forward cannot be called into question now.</p>
<p class="contents">Ecofin’s decisions, however, show that the real problem still to be resolved is the genuine weakness of our present system of European economic governance. The real challenge facing us is how to solve this problem. The Commission will now take careful stock of the situation and prepare a forward-looking initiative<span class="bold"> </span>to take on that challenge. Indeed, in my view, it is not enough to revise the rules for implementing the Pact. We must have an in-depth debate on fiscal policy in the wider framework of the general monitoring and coordination of economic policy. Above all, we need to link budgetary policy more closely to the more general objective of boosting growth potential without jeopardising the long-term sustainability of public finances. To this end, we should be more proactive in using the broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact together as instruments to coordinate economic policies in a way that will secure the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union and ensure that we achieve the Lisbon objectives. We need, therefore, to strike a new balance between these two instruments in order to preserve budgetary discipline while, at the same time, stimulating growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the few days left before the Brussels European Council, we must act with determination and optimism if we are to achieve the major goals we have set ourselves. If we do that, the Constitution now taking shape will clarify our basic objectives, define the European Union’s area of action more precisely and make the working of our institutions simpler and more transparent. I am confident that we shall pass on to future generations a Union that is not only larger and more influential but also more coherent, more democratic and closer to the European citizens. We must not settle for less at this great, historic time.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, let me start by thanking the Italian Presidency of the Council for having so far kept its promise to stick as closely as possible to the Convention’s draft. On behalf of my group, I would encourage them to keep to this rule. It must be apparent to us that what has happened with the Stability Pact has lost us credibility in some areas, with an effect on the relations between smaller and larger states in these negotiations and, as regards two states, it has certainly not led them to adopt a more conciliatory negotiating position.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I may start by saying something that I think is important, namely that these negotiations must not interfere with the stability and strength of the European Central Bank, and that the attempts in various quarters to do so must be nipped in the bud. It must be clear to us that there has been a great deal of progress in many areas, to which Mr Antonione has referred. I am particularly pleased that Naples has seen such progress in the area of security policy with regard to structural cooperation and the mutual assistance clause, including the protocol, to such an extent that it can indeed be described as a breakthrough. The Convention, I believe, always took the view that the door should be left open so that other countries could join, and that this should not be seen in opposition to trans-Atlantic relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">I just hope that the Foreign Minister can gain acceptance in the same way, and I think it extraordinarily important from the point of view of the Commission and of Parliament that the Foreign Minister should be a full member of the Commission, with all that follows from that, although there is no doubting that he will have particular duties of loyalty to the Council, and the clarification that the Italian Presidency of the Council has provided in this regard is also important. I also think it crucially important that he should also chair the Council of Foreign Ministers – indeed, it makes no sense for him not to, and only then will the whole edifice make sense. I am not sure that I can take seriously the idea that it is the foreign ministers, of all people, who find the title of ‘Foreign Minister’ problematic. I do not quite understand what is so problematic about it.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am reading Naples the right way, it also seems to be important that the President of the European Council should not have the power to intervene in the General Council and in what it does. I hope that the negotiations will leave this unchanged. This is part of the institutional balance – President of the Commission, General Council and European Council – and we have accepted the idea of a President of the European Council only if he has no influence over the rest of what the Council does and over the lawmaking process. I believe that this will prove resistant to the attempts about which we have heard.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that there are two points that leave me profoundly saddened. Trying to solve the problem of voting procedures in the Council by setting a fixed date, in 2009, when it has to go back to taking decisions unanimously, is an escape route. It is one that has never worked yet, and if we want the Council to function, it must be enabled to take decisions by dual majority, as proposed by the Convention, and I hope that this will not be too readily abandoned in the course of negotiations over the next ten days. We took a critical line on Nice because it did not provide the capacity to act that enlargement demanded. This of all points must not be the cause of the negotiations’ failure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to address is this: if Parliament is to lose out as a result of changes to budgetary law, then I regard that as the breaking point. If – as the Ecofin ministers tell us – the intention is that Parliament’s budgetary rights should revert to being what they were before the Inter-Institutional Agreement, or even pre-1978, then that is not acceptable. What we have is a finely-tuned balance, including the fact that the Council alone has the last word when it comes to own resources. In this context, this is a balance, one that is destroyed if any point of it is changed. Although I have gone over time, I would like to say that approval of the Budget is Parliament’s prerogative. No parliament can agree to a constitution that violates this prerogative.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, let me start by making a point relating to method, since the President of the Commission – quite rightly, in my opinion – has touched on the Stability Pact, which is the next item for debate. The President-in-Office of the Council informs me that Minister Tremonti will deal with this subject, not him. We will have to tell both of them what we think about this budgetary and economic issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start at the beginning, however. On the subject of the Social Summit, which will be covered in greater detail by other Members, I would like to start by saying that I hope the Summit will not just be a bolt-on extra. The Lisbon Strategy has shown us what happens to good intentions in the absence of commitments. We feel it is incredibly important at this time that we should devote ourselves to devising proactive policies for our most valuable asset: human resources. We therefore support Wim Kok’s proposals and hope that the Council will draft policies which are more than just a list of good intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the outcome of the ministerial meeting in Naples – which apparently, although there was no black smoke issuing from Vesuvius, was marked by a storm that darkened the end of the meeting – I would like to state, in clear opposition to the position adopted by the Italian Government, that we still want to see an agreement on 13 December. We want the Italian Presidency to be a success. I have to admit that the Italian Presidency has maintained a constructive approach, often going much further than most governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the issues under discussion today, I would like to draw the Council and the Italian Presidency’s attention to the responsibilities of this Intergovernmental Conference, which is being held after the Union has opened its doors to democracy. Those doors were opened, but have been shut again. We cannot now accept last-minute deals and haggling that are not only against Parliament, but also against democracy and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we in the PSE Group do not consider the question of the Legislative Council settled. In the name of dignity and in order to maintain the ordinary legislative process, the Intergovernmental Conference ought to reconsider the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Commission’s composition, I would like to say that, in principle, the majority in my group feels a flexible solution is required. We are not in favour of having one Commissioner per Member State, but whatever happens, we have to remember that we are thinking in terms of transition periods, when actually the Commission needs to be a responsible executive body for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have noted the Italian Presidency’s proposal regarding qualified majority voting, which is based on a double majority of citizens and States as in Article 1 of the Constitution. There is room for fine-tuning, but what we must not do is go further, to the triple majority established at the Nice Summit, because this approach definitely does not work.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the progress made on structured cooperation on defence under the Common Foreign and Security Policy and we support the Italian Presidency’s proposal on extending the use of qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very disappointed with the current third pillar proposals, particularly those relating to judicial cooperation, criminal and civil matters, and the role of the European Public Prosecutor. There is a very clear regression on these points compared with the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude, Mr President, by commenting on the Council’s all-out attack on Parliament, despite the fact that it has no authority to do so. Let us be clear: Ecofin does not have authority over the powers of this House. I would say that this is an offensive move on the part of the Council and also of their advisors, the <span class="italic">sottogoverno</span>, as they are called in Italian, since Coreper is the next level down from the Council, and it is in Coreper that the papers are prepared for the Council, as the Ministers are not usually experts in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that this kind of proposal is wholly unacceptable to us. There is a clear demarcation line that must not be crossed. In fact, I would go further: there has been a harmonious balance of power between Parliament and the Council since 1975 and we are not going to take these changes lying down. If the Council dismantles the budget system, we will respond in kind, and we will see who is willing to go furthest. We are not just going to sit still and bemoan our lot. We have powers, and we shall defend them to the bitter end.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, all eyes are on efforts to agree a Constitutional Treaty before the year is out. The irony of our leaders making new rules for the European Union only days after breaking the Stability Pact will not be lost on our citizens. At the same time, we look to the European Council to shoulder its responsibility, to stand up for the rights of European citizens who continue to be held in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p class="contents">In Naples, our Foreign Ministers managed to move closer to agreement only by moving further away from the Convention text. My group regrets that the tide of reform will not now rise to the high water mark set by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention's extension of codecision to budgetary powers would have made the European Union more accountable and transparent. No viable parliamentary democracy can exist without the power of the purse. The obduracy of finance ministers on this matter is a battle pitting raw politics against the principle of reform. I welcome the remarks of the President of the Commission. We must not cede on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to resolve the issue of voting weights so that the efficiency and accountability gains promised by the Convention are not entirely lost.</p>
<p class="contents">To us, what really killed the Stability Pact was certain countries confusing their power to break the law with the right to do so. In Guantanamo Bay, the United States has fallen victim to the same confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">America was founded on the principle that the free are governed by laws, not men. Countries have borders, but principles do not. There is no line on a map beyond which such values no longer hold. The prison at Guantanamo Bay squanders a precious American legacy and surrenders vital high ground.</p>
<p class="contents">For two years the 660 men and boys in Camp Delta have been denied the rights of prisoners of war or of civilian criminals. They have been charged with no crimes. The military commissions that will judge them will grant no right of appeal and no access to an effective defence. Dostoyevsky once wrote: 'You can only know the nature of a civilisation by visiting its prisons'. Of all the tests that a civilisation can be handed, the responsible use of power over the powerless is the greatest. Sadly, the standards of detention and justice at Guantanamo Bay are unworthy of a country with America's proud history of civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome the news that some detainees may shortly be repatriated, winning a reprieve from this disgrace for a few Australians and a few Europeans renders more stark the injustice committed to those who will be left behind. Europe must press for every man and boy in Guantanamo Bay to be either immediately charged, face justice in their home country or be released, regardless of nationality. President-in-Office, I hope that will be high on your agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon this House to demand of the European Council an unequivocal statement of Europe's dismay, and I call upon our President to convey that message. I call upon the European Union’s leaders to ensure that bilateral deals do not silence Europe on the greater principles at stake. The Liberal Group adds its support to calls for the European Parliament and for the Council to submit an Amicus Brief to the US Supreme Court on behalf of the detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">Two of our greatest enemies in the fight against terror are the fear that makes us cheapen our freedoms and the power that makes us cynical of them. If you at the Council can find the will to do justice to our enemy, then we will already have won.</p>

I fully agree with the comments that my fellow Member made about the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and my group will also be appealing to the Presidency to stand firm on this matter at the next Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to call for the Council meeting to express its support for the Geneva Initiative for peace in the Middle East, under which a number of courageous Palestinians and Israelis have now signed an agreement that may succeed in breaking down walls. It may be our hope for peace in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, when the Convention chose to draw up a whole treaty, that is what it was: a choice. Laeken, of course, primarily called for answers to a number of different problems, and, since the Convention nevertheless chose to draw up a single, unified treaty, I also think that it has been party to risking the method of working somewhat. Perhaps the Convention has raised the European banner so high that its feet do not touch the ground. It is to be hoped not, but I should like to say that the product of this – the European Constitution – has several weaknesses and also several strengths. Above all, however, it baffles me how we can sit in this House in a parliamentary assembly – an elected assembly – discussing a constitution which will possibly not be put to the vote, on which our citizens are not permitted to take a position, and to which European citizens are not given the opportunity to give their assent or dissent.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Member States are to hold referendums, but the mere idea of introducing something resembling a constitution without consulting the citizens is too far removed from my understanding of democracy, at any rate, for words. After all, democracy is more than just democratic institutions, although that is part of it. Democracy is also more than just free, democratic elections between multiple candidates and multiple parties, although that is part of it. Democracy also comprises the possibility for dialogue with the citizens in the process. Citizens should not just cast their vote and go home. They must also be consulted in the case of important events, such as the drafting of a European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will be such that it can be accepted by those citizens who are able to vote on it. That will, however, be quite some task, for example on the subject of economic policy. We have just had a little talk about EMU, and this will also be discussed a little later in connection with the Stability and Growth Pact, but the policies behind the Stability and Growth Pact have of course been incorporated into the draft Constitution, and, at the same time, as was said during the Danish referendum, we are now seeing how the small countries have to comply with the rules whilst the large ones are let off. We do not care for this policy, and I also hope, therefore, that the Council meeting will find a solution to this problem, so that Germany is able to solve its economic problems and we do not just have to follow rigid requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cohn-Bendit (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the Intergovernmental Conference is not going well. In my view, the result expected in Brussels at this stage appears to be dreadful. I believe that one of the great capacities of politicians who want to say ‘yes’ is having the courage, when it comes down to it, to say ‘no’ or to refuse to sign. I feel that it is only right that the Presidency, the Commission and everyone involved should try to reach agreement in Brussels. However, if reaching agreement in Brussels means replaying the palaver of the last night in Nice, the Intergovernmental Conference must not end in Brussels. There must be no repeat of Nice! You have heard of ‘Dying for Danzig’; now, the Poles have brought us ‘Dying for Poland’. Mr Prodi said: ‘We are going to die for the budget’. I say: ‘I do not want to die for Brussels’. No one is obliged to die and no one is obliged to sign if it is a poor Intergovernmental Conference. That is the situation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I know that the governments usually laugh because this Parliament does not have to say ‘yes’. I know that they say that in the end Parliament will be won over. In fact, even the majority in this Parliament, against a minority, was won over in Nice and said ‘yes’ to Nice, while we said that Nice would make enlargement impossible or that it would be impossible for Europe to function.</p>
<p class="contents">You, ladies and gentlemen and Mr President-in-Office, can tell them that they will have to see to it that this Constitution is ratified, whether it be by Parliament or through a referendum. Tell them, too, that if the vast majority of us, the Members of the European Parliament, do not agree with what they have signed, we are capable of swinging the referenda towards the ‘no’ vote. We can still be a nuisance even if you do not allow us to make the decision with you. If you do not receive the support of the most European of Europeans, in other words, of this Parliament, you will not receive the support of the people of Europe. You must get that into your head. Therefore, if you revise the Convention’s draft Constitution, if you do not want to talk about the legislative council any more, if you do not want to talk about institutional equality with regard to the budget and to Parliament’s right, if you are unwilling to come up with the double majority, if you want to call into question the definition of the content of Europe as defined in the first part of the Convention’s text, the most European of Europeans will fight against this text.</p>
<p class="contents">So I say to you that you must not sign, for if you do not reach agreement you must continue to talk. You must talk to the Poles. You must talk to the Spanish. You must talk to my grandmother and to my grandfather and to anyone else. As far as I am concerned, signing before doing this would be a crime against Europe. That is what we will say to the people, and we will try to persuade our governments not to sign in Brussels if the result is not satisfactory and to leave it to the Irish Presidency or the Luxembourg Presidency to finish the job. The fact is that it is never too late to finish but it is sometimes too early. That is what I am afraid of and that is why I say to you that you must trust in Europe and must not sacrifice it to a signature of which you will be ashamed, just as you have been ashamed of Nice. That, after all, is why you launched the Convention.</p>

I say this because now the European Union governments are discussing what I would describe as the bottom-line issues relating to areas of concern with regard to the likely provisions of the new European Union Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Government needs to be commended for accelerating the pace of these negotiations, and the holding of this recent meeting in Naples was a very timely one. EU leaders are now meeting next week, on 12 December 2003, to see whether they can hammer out the final agreement which will govern the future of the European Union. I believe, in the light of the spirit of cooperation and determination that prevails at this moment, that an agreement can be reached at the forthcoming meeting of the heads of the European Union governments.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not to say that there are not problems or areas of dispute. I have always believed it is very important that there is equality of representation with regard to the future composition of the European Commission. Equally, there are different concerns from the perspectives of different Member State governments within the Union. It is clear that the likely direction of the decision-making process within the Parliament and within the European Council is going to be based on codecision and majority voting procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the citizens of Europe are demanding to know the exact responsibilities of the new political portfolios that are being created within the European Union. They want to know exactly what the roles of a likely European Union Foreign Minister, and a possible President of the European Council, will be. It is important that clarification be given to these questions and that there is no duplication of roles. This would blur what the European Union should be doing at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there is still a concern within Europe with regard to a few sensitive national concerns. I very strongly take the view that taxation issues should remain the preserve of the individual Member State governments. I do not believe that the European Union should be given powers to raise taxes by means of a procedure of qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, I believe that the qualified majority voting procedure should not apply to decisions concerning the operation of legal systems within the European Union. This would be an incorrect step because of the different criminal legal systems operating in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that over the next ten days there will be further intensification of dialogue between all contracting parties in an effort to broker an agreement for a new European Union Treaty. The goodwill is there to reach an agreement at the forthcoming European Council. While the Italian Government's timetable is certainly ambitious, it can be achieved under the right circumstances. I wish it every success in doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Laeken Declaration set the task of bringing the EU closer to its citizens. Now, a large number of new decisions is to be transferred from the national parliaments to officials behind closed doors in Brussels. More decisions are to be transferred from open parliaments to semi-secret Council working parties than decisions in the Council are to be made open. Overall openness will diminish. Legislative power is essentially being turned into executive power. In essence, the electorate is having its influence curtailed. The democratic deficit will increase, although the task was to reduce it. The federalists in this House are clapping their hands with glee, as they themselves will obtain more influence. Instead, they should be opposing the fact that national parliaments are ceding much more power than the European Parliament is gaining. The electorate and the elected representatives will be the losers. Lobbyists and officials will gain legislative power if the present draft is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State or Government will be given the right to appoint those who will hold power in the EU. The President of the EU, the EU Minister for Foreign Affairs, the President of the Commission and his/her vice-president will all be appointed by an alliance of 17 out of 25 Heads of State or Government. Eight countries can be outvoted and their wishes disregarded. Out of those 17, ten will probably be able to continue as leaders in their own countries. The seven who do not hold on to power back home can then share jobs in Brussels. When politicians lose the confidence of the people in their own country, they can have their rejected policies embalmed for five years. The monopoly on making legislative proposals will rest with people who can no longer be elected. The Commissioners are not elected and are not answerable to the electorate. The Commission can only be unseated with a two-thirds majority, and doing so will at most create a crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament itself is undergoing a crisis, with ever falling voter turnout and an inability to make the Commissioners comply with a bookkeeping law applying to every book-seller in the EU, for example. Effective means against fraud do, however, exist, namely openness and democracy. Let the Commissioners be appointed by, and be answerable to, the national parliaments. Thus, no Commissioner will get away with saying ‘I am not responsible; I did not know what was happening’.</p>

Mr Fischer said: ‘I am leaving Naples more concerned than when I arrived’. Commissioner de Palacio said: ‘It is clear that only a minority of States support the Giscard d’Estaing project. Mr Villepin said: ‘I will not accept watered-down compromises’.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council himself has stated that Austria, Estonia, Denmark and, to a certain extent, Spain, Poland and the United Kingdom would, if they had to choose, currently opt for Nice rather than the new system. No comment. This is the picture.</p>
<p class="contents">In his excellent speech, which we all applauded with pleasure, Mr Cohn-Bendit stated that he did not want to die for Denmark, Europe or America nor from any illness. Bravo. Nor do I. However, this policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this lack of policy on the part of our, or your, Europe, is condemning tens of thousands of people to death in the Middle East and jeopardising the region’s fate and future.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, and I support the appeal made also by the former President, Mr Cossiga, on this matter – on the issue of war and peace – pacifists, the only thing you can say is that we must withdraw our troops. Bravo. You are no different from the people in 1939.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now necessary, and this is our specific proposal as radical members of the Bonino List, in compliance with international law and the rules of war, that experts be consulted as a matter of urgency. We must act quickly to legalise the situation and, therefore, the UN, Europe, the Arab League, and, I believe, even the United States, must call for an official peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The error committed in Italy by the Allies, who even at that time were liberators, is being repeated in the Middle East. On 8 September 1943, when the Italian army disintegrated overnight like Saddam Hussein’s army, Italy could have been liberated in two months. Instead, it took them months and months. It took them six months just to set up the Republic of Salò.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be no territorial Republic of Salò, but we are clearly witnessing the clandestine reform of the Iraqi army, not least in that it remains unpaid.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, Italy, and now Europe, must take the initiative of convening a special Council meeting for the purpose of proposing a peace process to the UN, the United States and the international community. In accordance with the rules of international war, Saddam Hussein is to be characterised as a clandestine fighter so that – as happened for instance in Cassibile in Italy – haggling can subsequently take place not over Saddam Hussein’s immunity, but over his exile and impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a genuine political initiative. It can bring together France, Germany and even neo-conservatives in the US. Italy and Europe are once again shuddering as they did in the case of the former Yugoslavia. The image of Srebrenica symbolises our failure to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to you: let us live forever, as Mr Cohn-Bendit wants. Indeed, let us ward off illness, but let us not continue to condemn to death entire populations of the world in the name of freedom and legality.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think the Intergovernmental Conference is turning out as could have been expected. I am not at all surprised by the developments in the Conference. I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that I think that the Italian Presidency is doing well in some areas. I think good progress is being made on certain subjects, such as the social clause. This was something we did not succeed on in the Convention. I think it would be a positive step if your Presidency succeeded in putting this on the agenda, and we could then see how many Socialist governments support the idea.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that there are other matters on which you will manage to obtain reasonable agreements – the question of a European Public Prosecutor, for example. If your proposal entailed a European Public Prosecutor who would deal with matters affecting the Union’s financial interests, I think this House could accept it, provided that the Public Prosecutor was appointed using the ordinary legislative procedure rather than by a unanimous decision. You have a consensus proposal here which, I think, will allow us to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, some other issues where the Italian Presidency has not sought to find a compromise solution, and I do not understand their reasoning. Take the question of double majority, for example. I do not see why the Italian Presidency has refused to come up with any alternative proposal to the Convention text when they have done so in several other cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is marching on. I believe there is only one more ministerial meeting scheduled before the definitive Council meeting, and I am not sure we will achieve a result that will be acceptable to all parties. Obviously, in political terms, this is not really the best time to be addressing the subject, since the breakdown of the Stability Pact seems to suggest that there are two different standards in use in the European Union – and I would appreciate it if you would pass these comments on to Mr Tremonti – which is not really helping to create a climate conducive to obtaining a consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike a previous speaker, however, I do feel that we have to complete our work by 13 December. I do not think that having more time to consult our grandparents – to use the words of my fellow Member, who is not here at the moment – will lead to a better result. I do not think it will work. In my view, the situation is cut and dried: we are all familiar with the solutions that have been put forward, we know what alternatives are available, and I think we now have to give a political signal by approving the Constitution on 13 December. That is the political signal we need to give.</p>
<p class="contents">I think enlargement is another reason why we need to do so. Enlargement is the big gamble for Europe and for this Parliament, and has to go hand-in-hand with the political recasting embodied by the Constitution. It would be very hard to explain if enlargement were completed on 1 May 2004 but for some reason there was no Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge you to persevere, and call on the national governments to demonstrate pride in the European Constitution, to forget national interests and consider that what we need at the present time is a Constitution for a Union of both States and citizens, which will allow us to work together in the exciting period the coming years represent.</p>
<p class="contents">So, keep up the good work, President-in-Office of the Council. Keep on trying to reach agreement. Keep on working towards completion on 13 December.</p>

Let me give two examples: the explicit reference to equal opportunities for women and men as being among the values of the European Union was not of the Convention’s doing. That you should propose it, and that it should be accepted, amounts to progress, and that is something we should make clear. Your proposal that decisions in specific areas of the Common Foreign and Security Policy should, subject to certain conditions, be reached by qualified majority voting, goes beyond what the Convention came up with, and that is something I explicitly underline in order to make clear the extraordinarily positive role you play in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, have to tell Mr Brok, who is now no longer present, that what you have proposed with regard to the European Central Bank does not interfere with the Bank’s independence. It goes no further than what we want for other areas, that being that decisions on specific technical issues should be capable of being taken by a simplified procedure, and that means that if the Heads of Government want to change something, they have to do so unanimously. Unanimity remains in place; the only thing is that, if we want to sort out technical issues, we do not have to set the whole process of revising the Treaties and the Constitution in motion. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we all see this as a quite crucial point, and I would ask the Council Presidency to see it in that light too.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Parliament’s budgetary rights, both in medium-term financial planning and in the annual Budget, we cannot and will not accept less than what we have already. Such a thing cannot be acceptable to a democratically elected parliament, and we will resist it with all the means at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I might add that I welcome the unambiguous stance taken up by the Commission on this point. We may well not always be on the same side, but, in this instance, Mr President of the Commission, we are glad of your support, for our allies are thin on the ground where this is concerned. I am glad that you are numbered among them, as also is the Presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one final point that I would like to address. I, too, have my criticisms of Naples. Like Mr Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, I came away from Naples more depressed than I was when I went there. My worry is that we are leaving open many issues that will then be squeezed into the package for the Heads of State or Government, and that we will then end up with a repeat of this ‘night of Nice’ and its compromise, not merely on the lowest common denominator, but with a collection of compromises, completely unrelated and mutually contradictory. The danger of a repeat performance of Nice in Brussels on 13 December has become greater since Naples. My fear is that we will then end up with this peculiar ‘rendezvous clause’. For over ten years, ever since Maastricht, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that really has been the customary flight response of the Heads of State or Government. At Maastricht, we said that we needed the political unification of Europe. We postponed it, deciding that we would do it later. Then we had Amsterdam, and then its celebrated leftovers. They were then deferred until Nice, where you could not sort it out, and so we passed it on to the Convention. Now the Convention has come up with a proposal. Please, I beg you, Mr President-in-Office, do not do the same thing again! The situation is getting no better. If there are more leftovers from any decision taken on 13 December, then the European public as a whole will see that as a failure on the part of the European Union’s Heads of State or Government. Mr President-in-Office, I urge you to prevent such a failure. They will be judged not only on their ability to achieve a result, but also to propagate a solution – and so will you.</p>

<p class="contents">The main thrust of our deliberations will be to support the work of the Italian presidency in defending the work of the Convention, but I fully agree with Mr Hänsch that we will fight the notion of <span class="italic">rendezvous</span> clauses on key elements of the package. Procrastination will not make tricky decisions simpler to solve: the time to act decisively is now. Nor will we approve proposals to inflate the size and distort the shape of the Commission - or indeed this Parliament - to avoid concessions to the self-esteem of Member States. Such ploys do not contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of those authorities, and to ignore the settled will of this Parliament is certain to jeopardise the prospects of the new settlement being brought into force. It will sour the political atmosphere and wound the democratic legitimacy of the Union.</p>

They experience on the ground the increase in unemployment, shrinking incomes, the campaign against and even the abolition of the eight-hour day and their other rights as a result of the famous Lisbon agenda, the application of which is to be assessed by the Council. They know that all this is being promoted in the name of competitiveness and productivity, with the sole objective of increasing the profits of big business in the European Union. This is also the more general objective of the constant reduction in labour costs, even where we have increased rates of growth, such as in Greece, where the workers are the most productive and the worst paid in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As with all the other issues which will be discussed, such as the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Constitution, which institutionalises capitalism, the further militarisation and autocracy of the European Union, the strengthening of repressive anti-labour mechanisms, the – as far as the peoples are concerned, negative – enlargement with ten new countries and immigration and asylum policy, the sole aim of the Council summit is to safeguard and increase the profits and the power of big business in the European Union. The continuing occupation of Iraq is also resulting solely in increased profits and is continuing to claim victims among the Iraqi people, as well as among the conquerors and their allies as a result of the justified resistance of the Iraqi people.</p>
<p class="contents">So the European Council in Brussels will not only not change these political orientations, but will also take measures to reinforce and legally safeguard them. In my opinion, the only way to change this situation is develop resistance and counterattack by the peoples, which fortunately are burgeoning constantly. We shall do everything within our power to strengthen this prospect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the Intergovernmental Conference. I ask myself why in fact the governments summoned a Convention, when, even without one, they could still have had the age-old spectacle of the nations haggling over their interests. While the governments are turning the Convention draft inside out, we in this House have gone back to drafting resolutions, repeating ourselves, protesting against the eternal sameness of things, but to no avail, with neither a response nor even a serious debate to show for it. The question we should be asking ourselves is what we should be doing. The governments think they know what our response is going to be; we gave it to them after the partial failure of Amsterdam. It was, ‘this is better than nothing.’ Then, after Nice, where the failure was complete, we gave it to them again: ‘this is better than nothing.’ Now I have come to believe that a bad constitution is not better than nothing. We should make it plain to the governments that it is not they who are the masters of the treaties, but the parliaments and the people they represent, and that it is these who can bring this constitution down.</p>
<p class="contents">We are then told in tones full of emotion that the dignity of every single Member State must be safeguarded. What about Europe’s dignity? Nobody said a word about that. I cannot imagine that the dignity of any single Member State demands that the principles of the separation of the powers and of the public nature of lawmaking be violated, or that the legislative council – the Convention’s big idea for greater democracy – be done away with. I cannot imagine that the dignity of a Member State demands that the undoubted legitimacy of dual majority be traded for the lottery of Nice. I cannot imagine that the dignity of a Member State means that more laws have to be passed in Council, or that more offences against parliamentarianism and the public nature of lawmaking are called for. That has nothing whatever to do with national dignity, which does not require an attack on Parliament’s budgetary rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last debate, and in the corridors and behind the scenes, I have heard people calling for compromise. To hear Mr Méndez de Vigo speak about it, you would think it was about this House renouncing its loyalty to the Convention and setting out on the treacherous ice of compromise. We are offered compromises only when we are in retreat. We are offered negotiations only when democracy and the rights of Parliament are disputed. Nobody seems to me to be offering to negotiate concerning our demands over and above the Intergovernmental Conference. This time, we should make it plain that a bad constitution is not better than nothing.</p>

I must, however, acknowledge the merits of the Italian Presidency and the progress that appears to have been started in Naples. Naples represents a very positive step in the development of the Intergovernmental Conference, on which I heartily congratulate the Italian Presidency, and which has given rise to positive expectations in many areas. It would be extremely damaging now to disappoint these expectations. Progress was also made on enshrining the rule of one Commissioner per Member State with full and equal status. The limits imposed on the powers of the President of the European Council is to be welcomed, as is the creation of a diversified and versatile system for the rotating presidencies of the various formations of the Council, replacing the unnecessary elimination of the rotating presidency system. I welcome the rejection of the so-called ‘simplified’ methods of revising the Treaties, which would constitute an abuse of the traditional model of international and constitutional law.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, however, some points still present cause for concern and on these I would appeal to the common sense of Europe’s leaders and to the imagination of the Italian Presidency. Firstly, the principle of the primacy of Community law must be clarified and in a way that does not destroy the very principle of national sovereignty. Secondly, the transparency and openness of the legislative workings of the Council must be guaranteed, since the prospect of our having a legislative Council appears, unfortunately, to have been abandoned. Thirdly, there must be considerable caution and limitations imposed on the passerelle<span class="italic"> </span>clauses: these must not be seen as a means of re-establishing so-called simplified methods – which are also irregular, in my opinion – of revising the Treaties. Next, there is no need to use this too ‘forward-looking’ vocabulary, including ‘minister’ or the word ‘constitution’ itself. A solution must also be found to the issue of recognising the heritage of Christianity, of the Judaeo-Christian religion, together with other components of Europe’s historical and spiritual inheritance, and the secular nature of the institutions must be confirmed. One would have to be extremely intolerant and prejudiced not to accept the proposal of the Italian Presidency. I wish to say a few words on the issue of qualified majority voting, which Spain and Poland appear to see as an obstacle: we are in favour of parity (60% plus 60%). Spain must understand that it is the largest of the medium-sized countries and not the smallest of the large countries. Europe needs more medium-sized countries, not more countries obsessed with the idea that they are large. This is extremely important for the development of Europe’s common interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been no backsliding over the text adopted by the Convention, and the Italian Presidency’s resolve not to brook any compromise merely for the sake of having the Treaty signed has therefore paid off.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Parliament, which, this week, has the task of encouraging the Member States to reach an agreement that will, at last, give Europe its first constitutional charter, cannot but agree with the position adopted by the Presidency. President Cox has rightly insisted on the need to act effectively with due haste. We fully support his comments and share his sentiments completely, but we do not identify with the comments of those pessimists who appear to want to throw in the towel at the sight of any difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support, President Antonione, your comments in favour of abandoning national particularism. Europe cannot miss this extraordinary opportunity. I am certain that no State will want to be held accountable for shattering a dream. Finally, as a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I call on the Intergovernmental Conference once again to insert in the preamble an explicit reference to Europe’s Judaeo-Christian roots.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Watson, a word on the Guantanamo question: you speak Italian well, you understand it very well and I hope you read it too, because, according to the reports I have read in the Italian press, it appears that, on more than one occasion, the Presidency of the Council has called on the US authorities to respect human rights in Guantanamo as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking the constitutional debate first, I would like to wholeheartedly endorse what President Prodi had to say. We have to become actors on the international stage rather than spectators. And, as this is not just about the content – although it certainly is that too – but also about the name, I would also like to speak in support of Mr Antonione, who stated plainly that this is – and must be – about a foreign minister. We are not talking here about a High Representative or an ambassador, but about a European foreign minister, not supplanting the national foreign ministers, but supplementing them and organising their work more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, while I am on the subject of foreign policy, let me say that we have a problem, and – if I may discuss it briefly with Mr Antonione, let me say that the problem is the Middle East. In recent days, we have seen an agreement reached – known as the Geneva accord – which is a private agreement by two people and many others from Israel and Palestine, and the Council wants to consider this matter actually only one and a half weeks after the event. Never before though has a private agreement been given such prominence by the media, never before has an agreement called forth such high hopes, and never before has an agreement been so perfectly in line with European foreign policy, so I hope that the Council will indeed turn its attention to this Geneva initiative and will indicate our support for it even more strongly than Secretary of State Colin Powell – thank God! – has done, because, although it could be a European initiative, it is even more valuable by reason of its originating from the region itself, from men and women who know what continued suffering would be like, and without whom there would be no accord.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is Europe that has to be the base for the decisive campaign against terrorism, that has to do with the fact that terrorism will spread – as it has done in recent weeks – for as long as the problem in the Middle East is no closer to a solution – a solution which, it must be conceded, can be arrived at only step by step. With this in mind, we profoundly regret the terrorist attacks in Istanbul. Like New York, Istanbul is not only a city of many ethnicities, it is positively symbolic of how they can cooperate, and terrorism of course militates against such association and relationships across ethnic lines. I also think we have to give Turkey solidarity and support, but that does not mean that terrorism brings with it some sort of bonus, and, like the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, I am very much in favour of us proceeding exactly as we have done before, with criteria that are objective and subject to scrutiny. Terrorism must not be allowed to affect Turkey’s position either for the worse or for the better.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would like to mention something to which many other Members have referred. I rarely concern myself with budgetary matters, but, whatever our nationality or whatever the social or political grouping to which we belong, all of us in this House are aware of the importance of every parliament’s rights when it comes to drawing up budgets, and I just want to support you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. This House’s position is clear. We are not just drawing up a resolution. One may ask, as Stalin once asked the Vatican, ‘where are your armies?’, but how is a European constitution to be brought into being on the back of referendums and by national parliaments if it meets with massive resistance from this House? This is what I ask you to accept: no curtailments, at any rate not of the rights of this House, Europe’s freely elected and democratic institution.</p>

Large countries can apparently get away with more than small ones. French and German flouting of the rules of the Stability Pact has delivered a serious blow to the confidence of the Dutch people in the European Union. The man on the street wonders why he should support a new treaty if it is uncertain that it will be observed. It is important that discussion of the Stability Pact should not be avoided, particularly in the light of the referendums about the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The referendum will be more about context than about the text of the treaty. It will be a yardstick for confidence. We set great store by the Convention's proposals concerning the voting procedure in the Council and Parliament's full budgetary rights. As far as we are concerned, however, the Member States may retain their fully-fledged Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">If legitimacy is to be enhanced, then they must be directly elected by the European Parliament, without any nominations by the European Council. However, only when in Europe, agreements are more important than political opportunism will public confidence have a real chance of growing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The President-in-Office mentioned that the question is being raised as to whether the minimum number of MEPs per state is too low. Is it wrong to retain a relatively low basic membership in a new and enlarging Union? Let us pause and reflect upon this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, in Britain <span class="bold"></span> which is composed of three nations, England, Scotland and Wales <span class="bold"></span> Wales is currently represented in this House by five Members. After the new Constitution comes into effect, if it does, the number of Members representing Wales in this House will drop to four. Malta will have five. I do not object at all to Malta having five Members: it is a fine thing for small countries to have proper representation. As a Scot, how could I think otherwise?</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, however, that the principle of degressive proportionality has a deep justification. Degressive proportionality says that every state in this Union must be represented in this House by a sufficient number of MEPs so as fully to express the political diversity of that state. Rightly, therefore, even the 400 000 citizens of Malta should have at least five Members, but perhaps no more. If you insist, rightly, on keeping a maximum ceiling of membership, the upshot of increasing yet further the degressive proportionality threshold above five will be to cut the representation of significant parts of existing Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debates we had about the competences of the Union, Mr Lamassoure reminded the House of the importance of partner regions, countries like Flanders, Galicia, Euskadi and, indeed, Scotland. These are significant parts in the Union. If you cut their representation you deny them the degressive proportionality on which you rightly insist for countries such as Malta or Cyprus. Do not do that.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a trivial point. At the Convention, as a Member representing Scotland, I tried many times to alert colleagues to the significance of entrenching certain aspects of the common fisheries policy that are unacceptable to us. I was not heeded. The upshot of that is that it will be impossible for me, as a strong supporter of this idea of a European Constitution, to persuade my political colleagues in Scotland to back ratification of the text because I now know that on that point it will not be changed. My appeal was neglected. Had I been representing a larger force I might have been heard. What a pity! Do not neglect degressive proportionality for the <span class="italic">components</span> of the states of the Union in insisting on it for the states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe it significantly alters the balance of power between Member States and the European Union institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is one more stage in the process of setting up a federal super-state with its flag, currency, army and now constitution, rather than a simplifying treaty basing itself on a unique supranational creation between sovereign Member States. We are concerned at the new, high-profile role of the Council President and the proposed Foreign Minister and EU legal personality, which will enhance the perception that the EU is a <span class="italic">de facto</span> state and will shortly be demanding membership of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to the passerelle clauses which jeopardise our veto rights over taxation, social security and, most worryingly, CFSP, which includes security and defence. Theoretically, it becomes possible for a new British Government to be out-voted over the deployment of its own troops already committed by a previous administration.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also seen concessions over a separate planning headquarters for autonomous EU operations, which will play into the hands of isolationist US strands who will be happy to see Europeans go it alone as they question the need to keep the US tied into NATO, an organisation which in my view has served us well for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject the Charter of Fundamental Rights - with its vague rights to jobs, health and social security - becoming legally binding. It is a recipe for the activism of the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice in its agenda to enforce the social market economy and undermine the Thatcherite economic reforms of the 1980s which made my country a magnet for foreign direct investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we are adamant that such major constitutional changes require a full public debate in all the Member States. With particular reference to my country, I call upon Prime Minister Blair to allow the British people a say through a referendum on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, over the Christmas holidays, you are in the wonderful city of Bolton, please come and join me in a visit to my local pub because you will surprised to discover that most people there are not talking about qualified majority voting, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Intergovernmental Conference. They are talking about other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I mention that point not to denigrate the discussions on the Constitution, which are important but, rather, to emphasise that the endless institutional debate that we have does not bring us closer to the electorate because it does not address the issues which voters regard as very important. Since I became a Member in 1989 we seem to have had endless institutional debate. We must stop that institutional debate, because it is vital for the political legitimacy of the EU that we come to an agreement in this IGC quickly but, more importantly, that we come to an agreement that will stick.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Hänsch that we cannot carry on endlessly with one IGC dealing with the leftovers of another IGC. When we get an agreement that sticks, we can then start to focus properly on the sorts of issues which concern the citizens of a Europe of 25 Member States. We need to start making practical progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not take it for granted that enlargement is on course to happen smoothly. We must make sure that candidate countries fulfil the requirements set out by the Commission in its latest annual report. We must ensure that the accession of these countries to the European Economic Area <span class="bold"></span> something people forget about - goes very smoothly, because that has not been the case until now. We must not lose sight of Romania and Bulgaria, or their objective of joining in 2007. We must continue our work on Turkey and, as Mr Swoboda says, show greater solidarity with that country, particularly at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also look at other issues concerning our citizens: more and better jobs. We must revitalise the Lisbon process and ensure that we have an active social policy that gets people into work. As Wim Kok's report has shown, there are too many people excluded from the labour market and we are building a wall between those who have a job and those who do not have a job. We must do much more with respect to that. In particular, Member States must stop dragging their feet. It is the Member States who are dragging their feet on Lisbon and on the European arrest warrant. Crime is important to our citizens and we need more Member States to actually ratify that.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are also largely responsible for the fact that the European Court of Auditors, in its a yearly reports, tells us that it cannot trace all the accounts because of the way Member States spend the money. We need to demand much more of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On security policy, I welcome the progress being made but let us ensure that we focus on capability rather than institutional structures because we will only be judged by how capable we are.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could ask for a Christmas present <span class="bold"></span> given that I still believe in Father Christmas <span class="bold"></span> I should like to see IGC conclusions which are agreed upon, which are upheld and which leave no leftovers. I would like us to focus on delivery for our citizens, because that is what the European Union will be judged on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This looks hypocritical since the Council agreed a very restrictive text on family reunion rights. Indeed it is so mean, that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market advises that the European Parliament should seek the annulment of this text in the European Court on grounds of a breach of the family rights provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. I welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has been left in no doubt as to the strength of feeling in this House about the internment without due process of Guantanamo Bay prisoners. As co-rapporteur on this topic, I am helping to prepare a submission from this Parliament to the Supreme Court, but only the Council can make representations on behalf of the EU as a whole. It has already signed a legal cooperation agreement with the US, so the Americans cannot dispute the Council's legal status.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be outrageous if governments <span class="bold"></span> such as the UK Government <span class="bold"></span> doing bilateral deals frustrated a Council initiative.

I should like to make two or three brief comments about this.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the final arrangements for defence and foreign policy are very important. I welcome any progress achieved. I should like it to be more substantial, especially as regards the unified assistance clause but, in all events, it is good for us to show that we learned from the war in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, all the Member States should be represented in the Commission. In Greece, in particular, it would make a very bad impression if the smaller countries were not represented.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is better for us to have no agreement in December if the agreement is not going to be satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, a few brief comments about the sector which particularly concerns me in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, there is the development initiative to incorporate the programme on priority trans-European networks, Quick Start, which is to be discussed. The impression has been given that Parliament is being bypassed and that the decision will be taken solely by the European Council at the Commission’s proposal. Apart from the fact that this is wrong, it is also contrary to Community law and Parliament is not prepared to accept it. We are joint legislators as far as the trans-European networks are concerned and we shall claim our rights until the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, there is the question of substance. We can draw green and red lines on the map and say, ‘There you are, new roads and railways!’, but the trans-European networks must be funded. So there must be the political will on the part both of the Member States and the European Commission, so that, with the public and private sectors working together, we can proceed as quickly as possible in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Life penalises those who arrive too late, unlike the Vice-President, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, who has been a bit lenient in still giving me the opportunity to speak, for which I am very grateful. Speaking on behalf of my group, but also of the German Social Democrats in particular, I want to thank our own government and the Italian Presidency of the Council. Mr Antonione, my expression of gratitude to the Italian Presidency of the Council may perhaps be rather surprising, but it is very emphatic, as I get the impression that the Italian Presidency of the Council is making a respectable effort when it comes to defending the outcome of the Convention and to keep in check a number of foolish courses of action that are evidently dominating the Intergovernmental Conference. I know that my own government, that of the Federal Republic of Germany is currently, in the Intergovernmental Conference, making valiant attempts to talk certain Member States’ governments out of their belief that they do not have to take on board any of the progressive things that the Convention has decided on for Europe and to lead them into the way of compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">For this, we Members of the European Parliament must be especially grateful, for anything else would gravely endanger the European Union both as it is today and as it will be. I want to pick out two points that we regard as positively essential in their significance. The first has to do with this House’s budgetary rights. It would appear to be the case that a number of finance ministers have persuaded their governmental colleagues – but not, it is to be hoped, the Heads of Government – to limit unanimity on the Financial Perspective and to change over to mere consultation rather than approval, thereby both restricting a right of the European Parliament and also qualifying Parliament’s right to give final approval in the Budget procedure – which is actually the most powerful right that this House possesses in the Budget procedure – by making it a right shared between the Council and Parliament. It would appear that some are determined, as part of the constitution-framing process, to have this core right of the European Parliament in their sights. The only thing one can say to this is that if you want to give Europe a constitution, you cannot be serious in attacking in this way the right to approve the Budget, which is the prerogative of the future main legislative authority, namely the European Parliament. So let me tell you that those who would take an axe to our budgetary rights are taking an axe to the constitution in its entirety, so we in this House would be well advised to send an unambiguous signal to the Intergovernmental Conference to the effect that this is something that Parliament takes very seriously indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to mention a second point. We believe that we have to compromise on the distribution of votes and on the composition of the Commission, and that both sides can and must live with those compromises. It is quite clear to me that the smaller Member States fear that they will be outnumbered. Their fears may or may not be justified; it is not for me to pass judgment on that. Whatever compromise eventually emerges, this House must not lose sight of the fact that, in the next Parliament, there will be 732 MEPs, and that is quite a lot to start with. It is quite possible that, between 2007 and 2009, the number of MEPs in this House will increase to 800. Against the eventuality of further attempts to inflate the number of MEPs, I can tell you that we do not want to become a sort of Chinese People’s Congress; we want to be a working parliament. To this issue too, I ask the Council, its Italian Presidency – which, I know, is trying to get sense to prevail – and the Intergovernmental Conference, to actually find a solution that will enable this Parliament to keep on working. I arrived late and I have spoken for too long, so thank you, Mr President, for everything.</p>

In spite of many sceptics, the Convention proved to be a great success. A proposal for a European Constitution was put forward that, although deficient in a number of ways, is, in very general terms, a very good compromise. I think that Altiero Spinelli must have been smiling from beyond the grave when the proposal was put forward in June 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">What is going on now is embarrassing. It is as if the Convention had never been held, and the Council were back in the old Nice routine with all the hullabaloo and horse trading going on behind closed doors. Do you never learn?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU faces huge tasks. It must grow, reform itself and engage in deeper cooperation. Moreover, it has major problems of legitimacy. The row about the Stability and Growth Pact has scarcely improved the EU’s reputation. People deserve better than a watered-down compromise seasoned with national interests. They deserve a democratic, dynamic and energetic EU. They deserve to be taken seriously through having the work done by their representatives in the Convention respected. I therefore wish to appeal to the Italian Presidency: do not disappoint them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That the Convention’s draft was important as a foundation is not in dispute, but nor is there any dispute about the need for various points in it to be improved. One hopes that all the politicians want to bring the work to completion and to find a compromise with which all parties can live, including on the composition of the Commission, with each Member State having one Commissioner who is entitled to vote. Public opinion in the EU is one reason why we should not create Commissioners of unequal weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else to be welcomed is the European Court of Justice’s monitoring of the decisions of the EU Council, which will make for judicial control and transparency. There is also a need to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact, not only to make it more solid and substantial, but also to improve its flexibility, for there must be no repetition of what has just happened with Germany and France – bad examples must not be allowed to catch on.</p>
<p class="contents">In security and defence policy, a commitment to mutual assistance along the lines of Article 51 of the UN Charter should have a permanent place as a self-evident act of solidarity in a shared Europe. Issues of the weighting of votes in the Council should not be over-valued; after all, in the European Union’s political practice, it is usual to arrive at a consensus and a compromise in which ‘small or large’ is not the determinative issue. The dual majorities – 15 States, 60% of the population – appear sensible, and I agree with those Members who say that Parliament’s original budgetary rights are important and must not be curtailed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Citizens stand to gain a great deal by this draft Constitution. The Constitution offers us more democracy and enables us to achieve more concrete results in areas that matter in Europe. Neither I, nor the citizen, lie awake at night thinking about the trifling details which everyone seems to get het up about. One vote more or less, every Member State having its own Commissioner – or even two for the big boys – or a puppet on a string at the helm of the European Council. These are not the core issues. I go along with the idea of each country having its own Commissioner. What matters is that Europe is able to catch criminals who completely ignore national borders, that we speak with one voice in foreign policy and that there are enough good jobs for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of Government should finally stop whinging and accept that what we have seen come out of the Convention is – subject to a few minor practical changes – the best solution for all of us and for an enlarged and deepened Europe. They should not pretend that citizens consider their bickering about power and people as important. That is for the little boys who compare their brawn in the playground, but not for the citizens. The public want to see results, and we can obtain those results with the new Constitution. More rights for Parliament and more codecision in the fields of justice and home affairs, agriculture and budget. Many of my fellow-MEPs have already said that if the Finance Ministers get their own way, Parliament’s rights will revert back to what they were before 1975. That is wholly unacceptable. We would then cross a line which we would certainly advise against approaching. That will have an effect on all referendums here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to act on behalf of our citizens as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, information is required in good time, otherwise the citizens will not be able to make their views known in the many referendums that will be held about the Constitution. Europe needs the Constitution, because on 1 May, ten new countries will be joining, and they should not join without any clear rules. Such an historic reunification should not founder because Heads of Government behave in a wholly unacceptable manner, throwing their weight around and refusing to accept an adult outcome.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Summa summarum</span>: either you agree to the present proposal as Heads of Government or you are opposed to it. But beware: less democracy and fewer rights for Parliament means that Parliament will be obstructive. The governments should not think that the deal can be thwarted only from their end. They should also realise that they cannot let things get that far. That would be a God-awful shame, irrespective of the fact whether God is incorporated in the Constitution or not!</p>
<p class="contents">On St Nicholas Day, which is nearly upon us, we in the Netherlands always give presents to each other. The Heads of Government should also push out the boat this year, and give us a Constitution that is worthy of the European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Credit must therefore be accorded to the Italian presidency for the significant progress that it made on very sensitive issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I welcome the agreement that was reached on structured cooperation on defence and the positive signals emerging relating to the creation of an EU Foreign Minister and one Commissioner with full voting rights per Member State, and also the budgetary powers of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this progress, much work needs to be done. To have an effective influence on the world stage, we must end our paralysis in Common Foreign and Security Policy decision-making. The presidency's proposals for the use of qualified majority voting, and acting on the proposal for an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs, represent a step in the right direction. However, I would like to see progress in a number of other areas:</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal that there should be a full-time President of the European Council has the potential to undermine both the role of both the President of the Commission and the Foreign Minister. Up to now, the only permanent presidency in existence was that of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President of the Council will have responsibilities in the field of CFSP, this could conflict with the role of Foreign Minister and could cause confusion as to who authoritatively speaks for the EU in this field. It would be more sensible to refer to this post as 'Chair' of the European Council and not 'President'.</p>
<p class="contents">In congratulating the presidency on the progress made to date, I would also like to issue a warning. The draft Constitution represents a bottom line compromise. Agreement at the Intergovernmental Conference is therefore not solely a matter for Member State governments. If the outcome of the IGC is to be ratified successfully it must also secure the consent of other institutions such as the European Parliament, the European Commission and members of national parliaments. The Italian presidency would ignore this reality at its peril. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is that everyone wants to make their concessions at the last possible minute - and preferably not at all. So there is a danger that despite a general willingness to conclude at the December European Council, we end up, as in Nice, with it going on long into the night with last-minute deals cobbled together. There is a danger that no agreement will be reached at all.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, Member States to a degree are still posturing. They are taking rigid and firm positions even though they know they will have to compromise if they want to succeed in December: therein lies the biggest danger facing the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that a reasonable, acceptable deal can be found on the bulk of the points, but there is one that seems to be extraordinarily difficult: the system of voting in the Council. The Convention wrestled with the age-old problem of whether we want equality of states or equality of citizens. It came up with the novel and balanced solution of the double majority, with one vote every state counts equally, and with the other vote states are weighted according to their population: absolute equality of citizens. What could be fairer?</p>
<p class="contents">Poland, Spain and some other countries, however, are insisting on returning to the opaque Nice formula, which is neither very fair nor very logical. I regret this, and I hope that they will shift their position. I know too from discussions - notably with Polish colleagues - how difficult the national context in Poland is and how this has regrettably become a <span class="italic">cause célèbre</span>, notably for opposition parties - Poland has a minority government. But how can we compromise, how can we find a way out between two radically different solutions?</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking purely personally, and off the top of my head, may I invite the Italian presidency to look at what happened in the early 1990s, before enlargement to Sweden, Finland and Austria? There was then a big row in the Council about adapting the qualified majority system, then it was about the threshold: what threshold is needed to obtain a qualified majority and what is a blocking minority? At the time, one state - regrettably and shamefully my own, the United Kingdom - refused to change the system. It wanted to keep the same blocking minority in an enlarged Union, which would have made decision-taking even more difficult. There was deadlock.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened, in your own country Mr President? At Ioannina, a compromise was reached <span class="bold"></span> the so-called 'Ioannina compromise' <span class="bold"></span> whereby the Union switched to the new system, but a declaration was adopted saying that in the future, states that were in the minority, but which would not have been outvoted under the old system could, if they wished, then object to the decision and insist that discussions continue. In practice, that clause was never used but it enabled face to be saved at the time, it enabled the transition to the new system and perhaps something along those lines is the only way forward on this very difficult point of the double majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we should switch to the new system, but with a declaration allowing states <span class="bold"></span> perhaps for a transitional period <span class="bold"></span> to invoke the old system if they found themselves in the minority. I am sure they would not do this very often, but it would allow them now to save face and go home with an acceptable solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the present Treaties state that decisions on the Trans-European Networks, including the priority list – perhaps the President-in-Office of the Council would be so kind as to listen to me, and the honourable gentleman could perhaps move to one side – according to the present Treaties, the revision of the Trans-European Networks is subject to codecision by the Council and Parliament and is not within the decision-making competence of the European Council. The European Council exists to set down policy guidelines. If, though, the Brussels European Council, in the course of revising the Trans-European Networks were to make decisions on the list of actual priority transport projects that had the effect that practically all the funds for the next few years were spent, then that would be a flagrant violation of Parliament’s right to share equally with the Council in decisions concerning the Trans-European Networks and their revision. I therefore appeal to the representatives of the Council to take care that the European Summit does not trample upon those rights that the present Parliament already possesses. I also appeal to the President of the Commission: it would be devastating if you, Mr President of the Commission, having made such a clear statement on democratic and parliamentary rights, were, at the Council, to so tangibly to ally yourself with a Council which defines the priority projects in such a way that the European Parliament’s rights of codecision are practically nullified.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us see to it that this European Council does not take back the rights of codecision on Trans-European Networks that Parliament already possesses. We want more rights; we want a democratic and more transparent Europe. I hope, Mr President-in-Office, that you can provide us with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The important thing is that once again it seeks to strike the essential balance that was established at Lisbon: the balanced policy mix combining economic, social and employment policies in an overall framework of sustainable development. I hope governments will not succumb to the temptation to try in any way to skew that policy mix at the forthcoming summit.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one element in the resolution that causes me some concern: the second part of paragraph 10. My Group will request a separate vote on that point and many will be voting against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Why would that be? Are we in favour of needless, additional regulation? No. The first part of paragraph 10 <span class="bold"></span> which we support <span class="bold"></span> makes that absolutely clear. It is equally true, however, that certain sections of this House, and local employers' organisations outside it, are increasingly calling for ever more stringent, narrowly-drawn business impact assessments as a way of blocking the Commission’s right of initiative on much-needed proposals. We cannot allow those calls for cost-benefit impact assessments to be used in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">We on this side of the House support the idea of true and honest cost-benefit assessments that take account of all the costs and benefits. For example, in a debate on the revision of the working time directive last week in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the point was made very forcibly by Liberal Members that we need a full business impact assessment. I make the point in reply that what we need is a true cost-benefit assessment that takes account of all the costs and benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">What, for example, is the cost of a long-hours culture in terms of damage to family life, damage to children and marital dysfunction? A cost must be imputed to those things as well in such a calculation. We therefore urgently need to bring forward revisions of that sort.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to paragraph 9 of the resolution, which refers to opening up the market in postal and passenger services, it is important that a true cost-benefit assessment is applied there too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that in fact the Treaties are very clear. In the area of employment and social legislation, there is already a very clear requirement built into the Treaty: 'such directives shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation, and development of small and medium sized undertakings'. The Commission already applies those tests to every piece of legislation it brings forward in the employment and social field. That is right and proper. It is good that it takes place already, but we should not try to narrow it in order to needlessly block much-needed social and employment proposals that will help maintain that overall policy balance established at Lisbon.</p>

And I have asked to speak also because I believe that the experience of the last few weeks also clearly shows us that the debate on the constitution has been, in part, nationalised, and that we must take care that the nationalisation of a European project does not jeopardise this great project through national referendum. If there is to be a referendum, then let there be one consultation of the European people, with one Europe-wide result and dual majority of votes and countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked about how the Constitution must make Europe more transparent and more democratic and bring it closer to the people, which is what it is meant to do. So I appeal to the President of the Council to see to it that the Commission is strengthened, that this House’s rights of codecision are extended, that Parliament retains sovereignty over the Budget, and nothing is done to aid and abet the attempt by the finance ministers, in their letter to the President of the Council, to force the Commission and Parliament to keep silent about their rights. The Europe we need is Community-oriented rather than intergovernmental. The Constitution is the outward expression of strengthened Community institutions, and I ask you to counteract all the attempts made by groupings within the Council to hand back Europe to the nation states.</p>

This is not what we are going to get out of the IGC if things continue as they are.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention, of which I was a member, painstakingly constructed a blueprint for the kind of Europe I have just outlined. Neutralising that text in the areas of common foreign and security policy, defence cooperation and social policy, stripping out qualified majority voting in relation to these areas and, worst of all, stripping this Parliament of its budgetary prerogatives, is a recipe for defeat. It is a recipe for defeat for the outcome of the IGC, but it is also a recipe for the defeat of Europe. Such a defeat would be a victory for the eurosceptics. It would be a victory for the lamentable fearmongering that we constantly hear in this House from Mr Bonde, with his simplistic, opportunistic clichés.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appeal to the IGC to listen to this Parliament, to the Convention and the 200 parliamentarians - from all sides of the political spectrum, both in government and in opposition right across Europe <span class="bold"></span> who produced the Convention document.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, President Prodi, I ask you to read today's <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, which carries an interview with you on the occasion of your visit to Ireland yesterday. The headline reads: ' "States that reject the Treaty may have to leave the EU" says Prodi'. That is an appalling message to give to the people of Ireland, who had to vote twice on the Nice Treaty. It is disrespectful of the rights of the citizens of Europe and for the dignity of the people of Europe. If it is not accurately reported, then you should immediately correct it. If it is accurately reported then you must make it clear that it is your personal view and not the view of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland, such statements quite simply polarise the debate about whether we defend the nation or build Europe. So you must correct this if it is an incorrect reflection of your views in that interview. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have overrun on the time allowed and, therefore, in order not to eat any further into the time for the next debate, I will attempt to be extremely brief.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with, and in view of the fact that Mr Watson and others who wanted to discuss the Guantanamo issue are present, I should like to offer some comments for reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Italian Presidency, and thus the European Union, I must say that we have made known to the US authorities at every possible opportunity – on the most recent occasion directly to Colin Powell during the meeting held in Brussels – the concerns of the European Union and of the general public regarding this matter which undoubtedly provides us with food for thought and is a cause of concern. I must also point out that, at the joint press conference, certain journalists put the question to Colin Powell too, who gave a public undertaking to provide a response and to examine the matter, that is to provide a response to the specific concerns raised. Therefore, I must reiterate that attention has been given to this matter and will certainly continue to be in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, as regards the discussion concerning the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, I take this opportunity, which will be the last opportunity for me as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union to address Parliament, to thank the House, to thank all of you for the contribution you have made to the work and the endeavours of the Italian Presidency, a fundamental contribution, containing, of course, a great deal of criticism and many suggestions, but also, I acknowledge, many appreciative comments, which always give much pleasure and help to lighten the sometimes heavy burdens of an overfull schedule we have to bear on some occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, we do this in the knowledge that the outcome, if positive, will be so not only for the Italian Presidency but for all of us because the spirit which guides us is a spirit consistent with the European spirit. Should we fail, it will undoubtedly be a failure for all of us. I am still optimistic and must say that, in the light of the debate held in Naples and today’s meeting, I believe that we can look to 12 and 13 December with confidence based on the fact that there are signs that some sort of positive solution can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards individual points, it is difficult for me to go into detail now, but I should like to take up some general points: first, I confirm that we will seek to maintain the greatest possible consistency with the Convention’s text, which, for us, is the reference point. As you know, all levels took part in the Convention: national parliamentarians, European parliamentarians, members of governments, representatives of civil society. The result is clearly a very important document that we are seeking to improve upon but which, as far as we are concerned, is the guiding point of reference for obtaining the final outcome. We will not accept watered-down compromises and we will avoid any horse-trading, as it has been called in the last hour.</p>
<p class="contents">It is normal for negotiations to take place. I should not like to undervalue such negotiations because the interests that each country represents are undoubtedly worthy and important interests. The negotiations may be intense, but I believe that the spirit which guides us and which I have seen in all those who have participated first in the work of the Convention and subsequently in the Intergovernmental Conference is indicative of the fact that everyone is hoping for a major result, a worthy outcome. Further, as regards protecting the prerogatives of the European Parliament and of national parliaments in general, I can confirm that the Italian Presidency considers this to be essential, and even more so when a Treaty having constitutional validity is being constructed because, if there is no connection with the primary democratic source which is bound to Parliament, we will undoubtedly end up doing something which is not positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you once again for your contribution, and I hope that Mr Berlusconi, who will be in the House with Mr Frattini to report on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference the week after the Conference ends, will be able to bring you good news and that you will be able, at that time, to voice your appreciation or criticism so that everyone can subsequently, as the wish has been expressed, come together to celebrate a result that we all hope will be extremely positive.</p>

Suffice it to say that I wish him every success in defending these arguments and also call on him not to dismiss any of the issues which have been set to one side for the moment. I refer, for example, to the matter of the Legislative Council. This is one of the issues which has suddenly disappeared from sight despite the fact that so much energy and thought was given to it in the institutional framework. The problem is that when part of this framework is changed the whole framework is affected as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I will reply briefly to Mr De Rossa. I am not in the habit of withdrawing my statements because I usually consider them at length before making them. To the journalist of the Irish Times, who made great play of taking these statements out of context, I said that if a country says ‘no, no, no, no’, and I said ‘no’ four times, it must be recognised that it is not right for that country to be able to paralyse the Union permanently. I think this is a position which is universally shared. I added that the instruments do not exist at the moment but the problem cannot be avoided in future. It is pointless for us to hide it. I said the instruments do not exist but the problem does. The problem, I added, is not a current problem, but there is no escaping this question.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important for the Commission President to raise these matters – even if they are not a current problem – since they constitute a problem which concerns all of us. There is no point in continually running away from problems because, if we do so, we will never succeed in resolving them.</p>

In our opinion, the correct solution would be the opposite of this: accepting the idea of a differentiated Europe, ensuring greater respect for national sovereignty and clearly organising the process of variable geometry.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the countries, such as Spain or Poland, that are being accused today of slowing the progress of the IGC with regard to the Convention by defending their national interests are in actual fact defending the general interest of Europe, which is to keep free nations and national democracies alive.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the two major topics of debate that will be discussed once again at the next Council in Brussels – the composition of the Commission and the qualified majority in the Council – we reiterate our unchanging proposal: the key aspect is to recognise a national right of popular opposition, which each population could exercise formally against a European decision. This innovation, which would give control back to the national democracies and help to compensate for the democratic deficit, would also put all of the discussions on the Commission and the Council into perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These include enshrining and deepening the economic and social model of neoliberal capitalism, extending the militarisation of the European Union and institutionally consecrating the Union as a political and military bloc and also promoting the federalist institutional approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Indicative of this trend is the compromise reached between France, Germany and the United Kingdom, under the auspices of the USA, on the militarisation of the European Union, cementing its institutional bases as a more or less autonomous pillar of NATO. Although some differences remain on institutional issues, compromises are being reached on the idea of a cabinet, with blackmail over Community funds increasingly forcing the small and medium-sized countries to accept a submissive position. This leaves the fight being maintained by Spain and Poland, who are seeking to have the same weighting in the decision-making process as the other ‘large countries’.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘primacy’ of the so-called ‘European constitution’ and of Community law over the laws and Constitutions of each country is also reiterated, which is equally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It will fall to the peoples of the EU Member States and to the progressive forces within those States to combat this draft, which has been designed to benefit Europe’s economic and financial groups and the ambitions of the elites that, in each country, unashamedly serve these interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
