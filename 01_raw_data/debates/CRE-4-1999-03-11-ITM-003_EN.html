Like all other Members, I have the definitive voting list here, in which this split vote is not mentioned. I should like to know exactly when a request for this was made, and if it was not tabled before the deadline, why is it being introduced now? As it was our group that originally requested a roll‐call vote, I would not like the request for a split vote to be added to the request for a roll‐call vote just because too many of the latter have been requested. I should like a specific answer on this point.</p>

The report was the subject of many committee meetings and it was even considered by the political groups before it was debated in the House. Since the deadline for tabling amendments has passed, I object to the fact that we are putting Amendment No 182 to the vote because the request was tabled too late.</p>

We decided that questions relating to employment contracts concluded between parliamentary assistants and Members should be governed by general administrative provisions adopted by the European Parliament. There is no legal basis for this decision in the European Treaties. That is not only my opinion; it is also the opinion of the European Court of Auditors and is reflected in the decisions of the European Court of Justice which I cited yesterday. Moreover, we have contradictions once again in our decision, contradictions which were contained in the report as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and which we are carrying forward into the vote today.</p>
<p class="contents">So if we want to come up with a prudent solution, with a proposal which can be adopted by the Council too and which ultimately clarifies the contractual position between ourselves and our assistants in an effective manner, it is my view that the Legal Affairs Committee should re‐examine this report. On behalf of my group, I therefore request, pursuant to Rule 129, that the report be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. At the same time, I wish to intimate that, should this motion fail, my group will regrettably be compelled to vote against this report.</p>

There are, however, several political sections which seek to go much further by giving the European Parliament more power than there is provision for in the Amsterdam Treaty, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that, under the Amsterdam Treaty, Parliament gains the right to approve nominations to the Commission. The report however proposes ‘election of the Commission', which goes much further. At present, it is the people of the Member States who indirectly nominate a Commissioner through their governments. The intention here is to shift that power increasingly from the national level to the European Parliament and hence to the supranational European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 69 on international representation is another example of an attempt to go further than the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some proposals in the report which are not acceptable for other reasons. Amendment No 90 proposes that a single group may not table mutually exclusive amendments. This type of censorship is undesirable. It must be possible for many different views to be accommodated within the various political groups. Besides, the gain in efficiency which this amendment may offer is entirely negligible.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 15, according to which it will no longer be possible to form a group with Members from only one country, is also not acceptable. It has been motivated by the desire not to give large countries an advantage, but it is untenable. Large countries always have an advantage, for example when it comes to securing 29 signatures. The intention behind this amendment is to tone down national political differences in this House and thereby to give it a more European character.</p>

It is regrettable that, on this important issue of the future financing of the Community budget, this House, as is often the case, allowed ideological and political criteria to take precedence over the fairness and transparency which should characterise the financing of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the solution proposed by the Commission and by the Court of Auditors in its report concerning the assessment of the system of own resources was to continue the development of recent years and increase the GNP‐based resource, which is the only genuine indicator of Member States" wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the majority of Parliament advocated financial autonomy, for reasons solely linked to a determination to increase the European Parliament"s powers. This is incompatible with the need to rationalise the Community budget, the overall total of which can be, and must remain, subject to strict ceilings, as the Commission itself confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">I naturally welcome the fact that the various paragraphs on cofinancing have been rejected. This was the only area of expenditure subject to amendment. As we have already said, the adoption of such a stance is incompatible with the aims of the Treaty, because agricultural expenditure is compulsory. Moreover, no provision was made regarding the need to reduce other non‐compulsory forms of expenditure. Therefore, although we welcome the fact that the Committee on Budgets" proposal on this matter was rejected, we disagree with the overall tone of the report and were therefore unable to adopt it.</p>

We are opposed to the idea of revising the European budget at the expense of our farmers. Moreover, we are also vehemently opposed to the development of new ways of providing the EU with its own resources, because we do not wish to impose any additional burdens on the people of Europe. It is also wrong to dispute the connection between the Cohesion Fund and the euro area. No country that is ready for the euro is in need of these funds. Solidarity cannot and must not be one‐sided.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, the aim on the revenue side of the EU budget must be to create greater transparency and an equitable distribution of burdens. Since the House has rejected the principle of cofinancing – a decision which we welcome – and since some parts of the report that reflect our views were adopted, while others were rejected, we abstained in the final vote.</p>

The EU budget is much too wide‐ranging, which is clearly leading to considerable problems. Not least among these are all the reports of fraud and irregularities, which are costing the EU taxpayers some 40 billion a year in Swedish money, i.e. a sum corresponding to double the Swedish membership contribution to the EU. There must be changes here. In the first instance, much of this has to do with the fact that no one has any sense of belonging to the EU, and that most only see the EU and its budget as a source of grants and subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider the proposal that the EU's biggest item of expenditure, the agricultural policy, should be financed jointly through the national budgets to be an important and correct step in the direction of reducing the total EU budget. We believe that, as a result of this, the Member States are bound to become more involved in the EU's agricultural policy and to show greater concern over how appropriations under the agricultural policy are managed.</p>
<p class="contents">We oppose all the demands in the report that the EU should take on responsibility for fiscal policy and should direct the coordination of economic policy, especially against the background of arguments such as that of the Union having a role as a ‘global political and economic actor of growing importance'. The Member States, Europe and the world do not need and have nothing to gain from a superpower, whether it be an economic, political or military one.</p>
<p class="contents">We have strong objections to paragraphs 9 and 11, because they seek to give the Union clear responsibility for fiscal legislation, and moreover powers to raise and appropriate the taxes. Fiscal policy and economic policy must be decided at national level, even though a certain degree of international cooperation is needed on some clearly specified taxes or duties. But that is not the same thing as a fiscal policy decided by the EU, in which the EU takes control of the taxes raised.</p>

While we are debating here today the issue of the rebate which the European Union gives the British Government on an annual basis, this matter should now be put into its overall context.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that some Member States of the EU, most notably the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, believe that they are contributing too much money to the European Union annual budget. It is argued that the British Government secured too favourable a deal at Fontainebleau in 1984 with regard to the rebate which the European Union gives to it annually.</p>
<p class="contents">This is now a matter for negotiations between European Union leaders, the European Parliament and the European Commission. A framework for the future financing of the European Union for the period 2000‐2006 must be put in place. One particular financial equation is certainly very clear. The European Union annual budget will still be raised by means of a levy on individual Member States to the maximum of 1.27 % GDP. Decisions have already been taken that the future financing of the enlargement of the European Union is to come from within the parameters of this 1.27 % budgetary allocation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that a compromise is going to have to be found between those countries which are claiming that they contribute too much to the EU, as equally, those countries which have received favourable treatment from the European Union annual budget in recent years. The British Government certainly falls into this category and as the negotiations progress to the Berlin summit on 25 March next it is clear that there is bound to have to be a relaxation of the rules governing the amount which the British Government receives via rebates from the EU each year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future financing of the European Union, one option which cannot be considered is the possible renationalising of the common agricultural policy itself. Such a decision would have serious implications for Ireland because of our unique dependence on agriculture and the importance of family farming as an essential feature of the economic and social infrastructure of rural areas.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martinez </span> <span class="bold">(NI), </span> <span class="italic">in writing. – (FR)</span> For the third time since the Luxembourg Treaty of 1970 and the Fontainebleau summit of 1984, we are faced with the problem of how to finance European integration. The Member States agree with the assessment of the problem, but are extremely divided as to how it should be solved. At the heart of the problem lies the complicity and injustice of the way in which Europe is presently financed; in other words, it rests on four supports with four forms of resource.</p>
<p class="contents">The injustice lies in how the burden is distributed. Germany contributes more than it receives in return, as does France, which is why we talk in terms of ‘net contributors". On the contrary, Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal benefit thanks to the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Member States" financial contributions are much more complex than that. For example, Belgium and the Netherlands seem to pay a great deal because there are customs duties on imports through Antwerp and Rotterdam. Belgium and the Netherlands therefore seem to pay a great deal but they do not really have to bear the cost of these customs duties.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, each Member State"s financial contribution is subject to the criterion used to make the calculations. If we were to compare how much each inhabitant pays out of their income in terms of per capita GDP, the result is reversed. People in the Netherlands who contribute to the Cohesion Fund make a greater individual sacrifice than people in northern Europe. This just shows how complex the system really is. An examination of exactly how the VAT‐based or GNP‐based resources are calculated, as well as the technical mechanism used to cap the British contribution, would reveal an even more unlikely complex situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This technical impenetrability hides many mistaken beliefs, in particular, the belief that the European Union is financed by its own resources, by taxes, through VAT, whereas in reality, it is still financed by state contributions. It is also a mistake to think that enlargement towards the East and the extension of the EU"s powers will be achieved with the same budget envelope of 1.27 % of GNP, as the Commission would have us believe.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow"s Europe will require ever more financial resources and will eventually be forced to tackle the problem of taxation. This is where the disagreements arise in terms of the best solution to adopt. Although the mistakenly good idea of cofinancing, which in fact would be a new resource created on the sly without being ratified by national parliaments, has been ruled out, fundamental differences on principles and techniques remain. As regards principles, should the British idea of the ‘<span class="italic">juste retour</span> " be upheld? Should we limit, out of simple common sense, the sacrifice imposed to prevent the despoliation of some countries, such as France?</p>
<p class="contents">Should we really move towards a ‘single tax" with an ever‐increasing GNP‐based contribution, even though we know that a single tax is a grossly unjust tax? Whichever resource or resources are chosen, should they be progressive as Spain advocates, or proportional? Above all, as regards decision making, should the unanimous rule, which is the only way to guarantee security, be maintained or should we opt for majority voting, which we usually do when there are drifts involved? The differences involving principles and techniques are inseparable.</p>
<p class="contents">Will Europe finance itself by making CO<span class="sub">2</span> pay? Only the Greens believe that this is possible. Will there be a European income tax? These concepts are to be avoided. We should instead stick to the present system, in other words, financing through state contributions, because we know that old taxes are the best and are the ones that will be respected.</p>

Once again, I regret the fact that many Members did not think things through rationally enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we succeeded in rejecting paragraph 13, which put forward the idea of cofinancing the CAP, albeit with a small majority, other parts of the resolution were not acceptable and, in our view, should not have been accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Several paragraphs of the resolution stated that Parliament wanted control of the overall Community budget. As a consequence, I think that those who voted in favour of this resolution are also in favour of eradicating the principle of compulsory expenditure. In fact, since the Treaty of Rome, all agricultural expenditure under the Guarantee section of the EAGGF has been compulsory. In other words, Parliament is limited to giving an opinion on this type of expenditure and the Council is the only institution empowered to make decisions on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of this legislature, some have been critical of the fact that 48 % of the Community budget is allocated to one socio‐professional category representing less than 5 % of the European population. Experience shows that if the European Parliament were ever to gain full control of the agriculture budget, it would progressively reduce it in order to transfer funds to other areas and policies, forgetting that the CAP is the only fully integrated policy at Community level. In terms of the European Union"s GNP, I should like to remind you that the agriculture budget only represents 0.5 % of the Member States" GNP.</p>
<p class="contents">A second factor influenced my decision to reject this report. Several sections of the text adopted by the House propose increasing the budget of the EU"s institutions through the creation of additional forms of resource, without, however, increasing the overall fiscal burden on the people of the Member States of the European Union. The question immediately arises as to how this will be possible, with the only plausible answer being to transfer funds from the Member States" budgets to the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the enormous difficulties we are experiencing today in balancing the European budget with regard to all the constraints imposed by the convergence criteria linked to the introduction of the euro, I think that such a proposal is completely unrealistic. The European Union"s priority is to give precedence to its common policies. It will not solve budget problems through cofinancing or by gradually reducing agricultural subsidies, but by providing these policies with the necessary budgetary allocations. Not so long ago, before 1992, the CAP accounted for 70 % of the Community budget, and at the outset, it even accounted for almost the entire European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">European farmers have contributed financially to the introduction of the euro by doing away with the differences between the rate of the ecu and that of the green ecu. Today, all we are doing is asking them to finance the EU"s enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, while being fully aware that their future hangs in the balance. This is because the European Union only thinks in terms of concluding free trade agreements and dismantling what is left of the Community preference.</p>

As can be seen from an interesting table to be found in the Valdevieso report, this would do a lot to help us escape from the current regressive trend, already reduced in 1997, because of the proportionately greater importance given to GNP among the current resources.</p>

Two other suggestions that could be implemented by the European Union are a tax on profits made from coin minting by the European Central Bank and a tax on short‐term speculative investment (the Tobin tax).They are both very interesting, but need further consideration and, in any case, would make only small contributions to the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that it would lead to greater revenue, fairly distributed and identifiable by the public (thereby strengthening the desirable notion of accountability), we cannot understand why progress is not being made, as a priority, on a tax linked to personal income.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the CAP, rather than renationalise it we should be making moves to reform it, lowering consumer prices, taking measures to restructure agriculture and give the less favoured farmers income support.</p>

I believe that in principle only the Council should continue to decide on the Union's own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the cofinancing of agricultural expenditure, I do not think that is an appropriate solution.

For example, the collection of the traditional own resources gives rise to a great deal of red tape, irregularities and fraud. It is therefore entirely appropriate to carry out a detailed cost‐benefit analysis of this source of own resources, as the rapporteur proposes. Another important point is that the benefits and burdens of the EU budget are unfairly distributed among the Member States. I am quite happy to support the rapporteur"s proposals here, such as the introduction of cofinancing of agricultural expenditure by the Member States. I also share his criticisms of the correction mechanism for the United Kingdom. Five other Member States are now in more or less the same net contributor position as the UK, so there is no longer any legitimate reason for maintaining the correction mechanism just for one country. However, I feel it is going too far to reject any correction mechanism on the revenue side of the EU budget out of hand. I think a compensation mechanism which applied to all Member States could be a perfectly viable instrument for helping to remedy the unfair distribution of the financial burden among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I support all these various proposals, I felt I could not vote for the Haug report, mainly because of the proposal for a fundamental review of the own resources system, eventually replacing the national contributions to the EU budget with European taxes. This is designed to create a Union which is entirely financially independent of the national governments, and while this is very much in line with the supranational European model that many people in Parliament still want to see, it is completely at odds with the kind of Europe we support. The European Union must remain a collaborative undertaking between national Member States, and this means that the national governments must continue to have influence over how it is financed.</p>
<p class="contents">An integral system of national contributions based on the level of affluence of each Member State (GNP), which is what Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy calls for in his minority position, offers the best guarantee for a balanced and transparent financing system, with a cost‐benefit ratio which is also in its favour.</p>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it exploits this good idea in that it harmonises, or begins to harmonise, a statute at European level, in which the European Parliament, in particular, would be the employer, even if the Member himself was naturally free to hire and fire his staff.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the rapporteur, this development would be based on a broad interpretation of the new Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty, as consolidated by the Amsterdam Treaty, which provides for the implementation of a standard European statute for the Members of this House. The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations opposes this standardisation as, in our view, such a statute should remain under the remit of each country.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore also opposes the broad interpretation of Article 190(5), which seeks to extend this harmonisation to Members" assistants. In our opinion, each Member of the European Parliament represents his country and should be remunerated or compensated by that country, and his assistants should be treated in the same way. If this is not the case, we will soon have assistants that are fully integrated into the European regime and way of thinking, making spontaneous proposals to their Member on positions to advocate ever deeper integration since they will have become functionally incapable of thinking anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very wary of the potential influence such a statute might have on an individual"s behaviour. This is why I think that the equity needed in the management of assistants must be established at national level. What is more, the assistants of the Members of the European Parliament must be managed according to the same laws and practices and by the same services as the assistants of members of national parliaments.</p>

Apart from the fact that this is a cumbersome procedure, which might frustrate the Council, the rapporteur"s proposal had two drawbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, by creating an excessively detailed structure, it distorts the nature of the contract between a Member and his assistant or assistants, by determining working methods and the framework of their daily relations. Secondly, by amending the Commission"s text, Parliament is prevented from amending this statute, if needed, without putting forward a proposal to the Commission which then has to be approved by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all politicians and the majority of our assistants are, through us, serving their own political beliefs.

Reform of the agricultural and structural policies and new agreements on the financing of the Union are absolutely vital if the Central and Eastern European countries are to be able to join. Broadly speaking, we agree with the joint resolution on this issue and therefore voted in favour of it, but we would still like to make the following points.</p>
<p class="contents">We can live with the Commission proposal to set aside 0.46 % of GNP per year for structural measures in the period 2000‐2006, but only under two conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as with other expenditure headings, this must be an expenditure ceiling rather than a spending target. The current privileged status of the Structural Funds tends to mean that the available budget has to be spent at all costs, which does nothing for efficiency and is financially irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the appropriations for structural aid for the applicant countries must be integrated into the EU programmes upon their accession without exceeding the expenditure ceiling of 0.46 % of GNP. This means that clear priorities must be set. The Agenda 2000 proposals are too focused on the acquired rights of the southern Member States, and we must realise that in future the poor regions are going to lie to the east.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not share the PPE and ARE Groups" objections to the Council"s plans to nominate a new Commission president before the European elections in June, and we therefore did not vote for the amendments on the subject. The Commission President is the most senior official in the European civil service. Officials are not selected, they are appointed, and the appointment of the Commission President is first and foremost something the Member States must agree on among themselves. The decisive factor here must be a candidate"s personal qualities, not his political affiliations. If the nomination is made dependent on the outcome of the European elections, then too much weight will be attached to the candidate"s political background.</p>

The accusations levelled against that country are unfounded and it is wrong to say that freedom of expression does not exist there. Belarus is gradually developing a regime that gives greater precedence to progress and freedom, based on the present constitution. Any step backwards would be a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticisms levelled against Belarus are reminiscent of those levelled against General de Gaulle by some Anglo‐Saxon circles during the Fourth Republic. On the pretext that he intended to create a new constitution through a referendum, he was accused of anti‐republican fascism. This type of accusation is absurd. There is far more respect for human rights in Belarus than in pro‐American countries such as Turkey, which benefits from an association agreement with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stop making accusations that are inconsistent with the principle of friendship among peoples, something that is particularly essential in today"s enlarged Europe.</p>

Apart from the financial aspects of this reform, the principle of subsidiarity is at stake. Like our President, José Maria Gil‐Robles, I think that this reform must be viewed as a whole, so that we can give a clear political message to the people of the European Union and of the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the more specific proposals put forward by the Commission, I have several comments to make.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as regards the CAP, I think that, on one hand, we need to guarantee a stable income for the whole of the agricultural sector, and on the other hand, we need to promote an agricultural model that is not connected to world markets and that is responsible for planned rural development that is accepted by all.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to structural policies, I still support the idea that areas leaving Objective 1 should be given a transitional period in which to adjust. Another challenge that the European Union must face relates to areas that are very densely populated. We do not need to be reminded of the number of Europeans living in such areas to reaffirm the relevance of the URBAN programme and the need to maintain it, as the European Parliament has already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I also share the view that the Structural Funds must be consolidated as a tool for creating jobs and combating unemployment. In this respect, I agree with the fact that the European Union must consider establishing a system of own resources that allows us to prepare for enlargement without undermining the principles of solidarity and cohesion, two of the most fundamental ideas behind European Union integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree with the ideas on human rights and balanced development, which must be major objectives for those countries wishing to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Berlin summit is undoubtedly of particular importance and it forces our leaders to send out a strong message a few weeks before a deadline when our citizens will take full advantage of the opportunity to express their views on the Europe they are being offered.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martinez </span> <span class="bold">(NI), </span> <span class="italic">in writing. – (FR)</span> The fact that the European Council will be held in Berlin is already a significant symbol of the new strategic order, as Germany is taking advantage of its presidency to defend its interests in the financing of the European budget, in enlargement towards the East and in the CAP. France"s interests are different in all three cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The industrialised and Atlanticist Germany would easily sacrifice the agricultural Europe, giving Washington a monopoly over the food weapon. France, on the other hand, would not.</p>
<p class="contents">Germany – which is the leading net contributor to the European budget, since it pays in more than it receives – would like to receive at least a financial return that is not extremely unjust, if not quite a ‘<span class="italic">juste retour</span> " as Margaret Thatcher demanded in 1984. With regard to this budgetary issue, France, which has lost more than FRF 20 billion in a single year of financing the European budget, is sensitive to the excessive inequalities in each Member"s financial contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget that, although Germany makes a substantial contribution to the European budget, it has also made other states in the Union pay a considerable amount since its reunification. The high interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank to finance the five Länder of the former East Germany are one of the major causes of the recent economic recession and the fact that six million French people are unemployed. France has paid a large part of the dowry for the marriage of the two parts of Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is displacing the European Union"s centre of gravity further towards the former Comecon area, where the currency was the Deutsche mark. This shows the extent to which we are under Germany"s sphere of influence. For France, the accession of the countries of Eastern Europe, where 25 % of the active population work in agriculture, is going further than the problems posed by the present CAP reform, which goes against our national interests. In other words, the interests of the Franco‐German partnership are not necessarily the same in terms of the independence of nuclear energy, the reform of the CAP, where we reject the idea of cofinancing as it would make us pay with giving us any power of decision, or the financing of the CAP, where no clear decisions have been taken on the principles involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of talking about limits, ceilings or correction mechanisms, we really need to make a decision on the principles, that is, whether or not Europe should be financed by taxation or by contributions from the Member States. If we opt for fiscal measures, what form should the tax take? Should it be progressive, as Spain hopes, proportional to wealth, or a head tax?</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in Berlin, Europe is at a junction where all roads meet: the roads from the East, the budgetary roads and the strategic roads. The time has come for European integration to get rid of any ambiguities and the first of these is to decide if we are building a European Europe or a globalised Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning, the National Front has made its choice clear: it favours the Europe of realities and truths, the tangible Europe, and the Europe of states and nations.</p>

<p class="contents">This is true of the point made in recital A that the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund are the main instruments of economic and social cohesion, while the importance of economic cohesion is also emphasised in paragraph 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Emphasis should also be laid on the statement in paragraph 4 that budgetary restraint needs to be reconciled with the guarantee of sufficient funds for the essential tasks of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point to be emphasised is the approval in paragraph 6 of the proposal to earmark 0.46 % of the European Union's GNP every year for structural actions during the period 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that these are not just good intentions since the most powerful leaders, focusing on Agenda 2000 instead of worrying about having enough resources to meet Europe"s ambitions, are basically concerned with setting a sacrosanct limit of 1.27 % of GNP for the Union budget. What is more, in Agenda 2000 the Commission is proposing to transfer EUR 45 billion from the Structural Funds to actions preparing for the accession of the new Member States, leaving the current 15 Member States with EUR 10.2 billion less or, in other words, 0.39 % of GNP.</p>
<p class="contents">These are major points which should have been resolved or clarified.</p>
