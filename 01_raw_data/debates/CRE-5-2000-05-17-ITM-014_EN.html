<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Plooij-Van Gorsel (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank Commissioner Busquin for launching a broad debate on a European research area. It comes at exactly the right time, between two framework programmes. At present, there is no European research area as such. The research policy of the Member States and that of the Union are running parallel without forming a coherent unit. In addition, we invest far less in research than the United States and Japan. </p>
<p class="contents">These two factors have caused the chasm between us and the United States to widen even more over the past few years. If the European Union wants to invest in more competitiveness, and thus more employment, we will need an approach which is broader and more innovative than the one we have pursued so far. </p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming enlargement of the Union makes this all the more pressing. The European Member States need to leave behind their technological nationalism and strive more towards a European Union for research and technology too. This means that European researchers need access to each other’s national programmes. The European framework programme for research and technological development is a useful instrument for stimulating international cooperation, but this programme on its own is not enough to boost the joint European research efforts. </p>
<p class="contents">Although it only makes up 6% of total European research expenditure, the framework programme fulfils an important multiplier function, a kind of flywheel function. Industry pays 60% of total investments in research in Europe, 90% of which is spent on research to improve existing production processes and, in this way, to retain the competitive edge. Only 10% is spent on new innovative research. As such, the framework programme certainly makes a considerable contribution to this 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has no problem converting euros into research, but has far greater difficulty converting research into euros. It appears that commercialisation, i.e. injecting expertise into a product, seems to be much more successful in the United States than it is in Europe. A better link is required between the development of new technology and application in the market. In this respect, increasing expertise is not a goal in itself, but translating expertise into innovation and industrial success, however, is. It creates employment and prosperity. Universities and companies therefore need to work more closely together. As is the case in the United States, the work of scientists should alternate between academia and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Busquin has now indicated how a European research area could be brought about. However, he mainly focuses on optimising the infrastructure by, among other things, incorporating centres of excellence into a network and by setting up Virtual Centres. But I believe that in order to bring about a European research area, we will need more than measures in the sphere of infrastructure. Infrastructures do not innovate, neither do electronic networks, although they are a prerequisite. But a European research area can only be created if, in addition to an advanced infrastructure, we also have a European identity and European creativity. In my view, the potential of women has been neglected for too long in this respect. </p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the lack of a Community patent. The existing European patent system causes fragmentation and leads to considerable extra costs. A patent application in Europe is ten times more expensive than it is in the US and far more involved. Not only do we not have a Community patent; the mechanisms to help small companies protect their patents are also lacking. Will the Commissioner consult Mr Bolkestein to do something about this? After all, small- and medium-sized companies do not have the means to pay for expensive legal procedures. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to state that Europe needs a joint research policy which accommodates both applied and fundamental research in various technical specialist fields and which takes into account the fact that innovations often emerge at the interface of different scientific disciplines. In future, new employment could mainly be created within the specialist areas of bio-technology and ICT, but also research into human and social sciences will remain necessary in the European Union, with its large diversity of cultures. I would like to thank my colleagues for their kind cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If there is any impulse which contributes to good research it is the impulse of pure curiosity. It has been work done out of pure curiosity for the sake of knowledge as an end in itself which has, in the end, produced the big spin-offs that make a real difference.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with her, however, that it is not enough to justify spending public money on the ground that somebody suffers from acute curiosity. Therefore, it is the promise of long-term applicability and long-term economic contribution that justifies the expenditure of public funds. But we must remember that public funds will not be well spent unless they are spent on people who have the drive of curiosity and the commitment to knowledge for its own sake. That is something which we in Europe forget at our peril. It is mentioned in clauses ‘n’ and ‘o’ of the preamble. I am very grateful for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed I am very grateful to Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for the way in which she has worked into the report of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy practically all the points that were contained in the draft opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for which I was responsible and which is the reason for my addressing you tonight. The whole is better than the sum of its two parts. It was very good of her to work it in so effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments by Mr Pietrasanta and Mrs Maes, which add the points about sustainability, environmental goods and health, to the other economic points that we have been making, are important and should be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">There is indeed a European crisis in research funding. We must increase it. It must go up to 3% from the current pathetic 1.8% – about half of what our Japanese and American friends and competitors put in.</p>
<p class="contents">Legal devices are important. We should improve the European patent. Subsidiarity is all-important; subsidiarity, as the Commissioner has said, in its broadest sense – regions contributing to research as well as Member States and the Commission, right down to the research team. They are the people at the sharp end. We must make sure that we never have systems of research support that are so over-burdened with bureaucracy, with application mechanisms so difficult to penetrate that we use resources in applying for research funds that should be spent doing the research itself. Simplicity is all and subsidiarity means, in this context, simplicity and an appropriate period of research review.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need other things. We need due and proper attention to mobility and all that goes with it, proper research careers throughout Europe, the chance for people to gain employment in research and to move freely. The omens are not entirely good. We have seen, in the case of the foreign language lecturers in Italy, that 12 years have passed with immobility enshrined in European law because the right to free movement without regard to nationality has been denied and has not yet been effectively enforced by the Commission. We really must insist that improvement is achieved here and is carried through from the teaching community into the closely allied research community.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we must do at Community and Union level the things that can only be done at those levels and push the rest down. All that is stated in paragraph 40 of the report. We must also be better at developing and applying the knowledge we achieve. My colleague in Edinburgh, Professor Salter, has developed a device for destroying mines safely. It has never been taken up industrially. Many good ideas that are developed do not get taken up. That is also vital.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I have great pleasure in responding on behalf of the EPP and ED Group, and on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, who was the shadow rapporteur in the Industry Committee but who unfortunately cannot be here tonight. I have the pleasure of shadowing Mr MacCormick in the Legal Affairs Committee. You have already heard that this is indeed a formidable combination and an extremely comprehensive and thorough report from Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, but Mr MacCormick added his own distinctive touches to the report, the flavour of which you have just heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the thrust of the Commission’s thinking that has gone into this report and indeed our response has focused on two aspects: competitiveness and coordination, because research capability combined with the ability to translate that research into products and services of real commercial value is going to be the key to the competitiveness of the European Union and the enlarged Union into this new century.</p>
<p class="contents">We really need to make better use of all the intellectual capabilities that we have across the European Union by improving ways of working together, particularly by better focusing our efforts, by not duplicating that work, by bringing together the original thinkers that Mr MacCormick was talking about. Anyone who has worked in research will know that if you get people together you spark new and creative ideas all the time. That activity cannot really be achieved by a lot of centralisation. The Commission has a job to do as a catalyst for the process. As Mr MacCormick says, we have to get people across the Union together talking region to region, university to university. We have to have better information networks, we have to have this exchange of information horizontally, not coming into the centre and going out again.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now fantastic new tools to be able to do that. After all, the Internet was a tool intended to facilitate research networking. That is what it was originally designed to do and we now have the ability to use it and to think about how we are going to develop the telecommunications capability, the ways of using it, the structure that we talked about in our early debate on telecommunications, the idea of virtual centres of excellence. That, I think, is a factor of very great importance in trying to achieve this focus and this synthesis of ideas. If anything should be brought forward very quickly in a pilot stage by Mr Busquin and his team, it is the idea of moving into the virtual centres of excellence and achieving progress in certain key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make links in with our competitiveness. I echo very much the closing phrases of Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel to us just now: we have to encourage research and development of skills on taking products to market. We have to improve the ways that we do that. The processes of original design are prototyping, testing and making. We have to reduce the time to market, to take these ideas and move them out to consumers as soon as possible, to make products simply, quickly, more effectively, more flexibly. Those are very important skills that we need to develop and research has a very important part to play in that. In welcoming Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel’s report, we are anticipating the next stage, Mr Busquin, in meeting these challenges that we have thrown down. We look to you to turn these proposals into tangible ideas to achieve the objectives that we all share.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cooperation, which we could already describe as consolidated and which is laid down by Articles 165, 168 and 169 of the Treaty has, up until now, only existed in theory. Your communication has brought the provisions to life. We hope that, having come into being, this cooperation will then grow, but I will come back to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would, of course, also like to congratulate Mrs Plooij­Van Gorsel on her report – and not just as a friend or colleague. Even though she was pressed for time and had to work under conditions which were not always favourable, the result is completely satisfactory. We will therefore support the report, especially since it has been improved upon by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would not like it to be inferred from the reading of Mrs Plooij­Van Gorsel’s report during this sitting that the alpha and omega of research and development consists of nothing more than finding a solution to what has been dubbed the European research paradox: high level research which lacks the innovation necessary for it to reach United States quality. Consequently, there is a great temptation, and you have succumbed, ladies and gentlemen, to the temptation to say that the most important element is clearly the transition from laboratory research to the reality of the market. You have stressed, extremely vigorously I would say, all the elements which facilitate this transition: benchmarking, aid to private investment, tax exemption and a certain amount of support for enterprise and SMEs with high technological added value, all of which is important and necessary. In effect, we must convert research into growth and growth into jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">But how could we think that a European Community, which devotes only half the amount of resources to research and development that the United States or Japan do, would be able to maintain a sufficient knowledge and skills base? If, tomorrow, we want innovation, our knowledge base has to be up to the task. The best means for achieving this end put forward by this major communication, in my opinion, are precisely the establishment of centres of excellence and networks to link these centres, infrastructures, the sharing of large facilities and better structured mobility. In short, everything which will contribute to consolidating our knowledge base. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as my predecessor, Mr Harbour, used to say, henceforth, Commissioner, you can count on the wide support of the European Parliament. I know that you already have the support of the European scientific community and that is extremely important. Now we must convert the test into proposals, but also into more radical changes. A meeting will be held midway through the fifth framework programme and, without waiting for the sixth framework programme, this may well be the right time to formalise the announcements you have made today, which seem to offer great potential, as laws and new priorities.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As things are now, resources are wasted due to overlapping and lack of coordination. On behalf of the ELDR Group, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, for a good report and for her extremely enthusiastic work for this cause: your views have the full support of my Group.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics indicated in the communication regarding the poor level of investment by EU countries in research are cause for concern. Even worse is the fact that the gap with respect to the USA is widening. However, some Member States have made considerable investments in research, and this appears to have paid dividends, particularly in the area of information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">While I have the floor, I would like to bring up a few additional points. I would prefer to talk about cooperation or strategy, rather than research policy. The word policy has a connotation of activities being closely controlled by Brussels. In research, however, objectives for activities should not be defined at too detailed a level. Each research community is best aware of its own needs for investment and development – these should not be too tightly controlled by policy. The participation of women in scientific research within the EU continues to be too fragmented. More tangible action must be incorporated in the programmes in order to promote this participation. Researcher exchange programmes and interaction between research teams are matters which deserve our full support. They are a means of disseminating information and skills; these activities will create true European cooperation – networks which will also bear fruit later on. The COST secretariat has already produced some commendable work. Its position as research coordinator should be further strengthened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be built openly, sharing competences and resources at as early a stage as possible, in order to ensure optimum synergy. I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her very dynamic work on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We must naturally consider the economic impact and job creation, as our fellow Member, Mr Desama, said. In the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we do not give priority to the pursuit of competition and competitiveness at any price, or to the commercialisation of research. Both fundamental and applied research must, above all, retain public support and a public dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to the areas of biotechnology focused on genetic manipulation or patenting the living organism. On the other hand, we are in favour of research focusing on sustainable technologies, particularly in the areas of the environment and health.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Committee of the Regions advocated in Mrs Blandin’s report, we wish to emphasise support for decentralised research, the formation of networks, collaboration with the regions. For example, the cooperation which has developed through the ecosites, in the field of ecotechnologies, according to the criteria of sustainable development, is appropriate to local development and to supporting SMBs and SMIs. Europe may be a significant driving force in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress the aid which we wish to provide for new information and communications technologies by developing virtual laboratories for data collection, analysis and diagnosis, and prevention in the area of major risks. There is here a potential which can only be realised fully at European level, in collaboration with universities, centres of excellence and the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to flag the interest we have in the Joint Research Centre, a subject that is well worth thinking carefully about. Its nuclear bias, which was topical when it was set up because of the involvement of Euratom, must now be reconsidered. It is not a matter of duplicating the installations or the research carried out in some European Union Member States but instead of developing, as Mrs McNally suggests, a shared system of technical and scientific references for political applications. In this respect, there is also a need for serious thinking about the STOA.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to thank our Commissioner, Mr Philippe Busquin, for undertaking, as soon as he arrived, this investigation into a European research area which we support. He did not neglect the areas of schemes on behalf of young people and the participation of women in research and, in continuing liaison with the Member States and with Parliament, he is working towards developing a knowledge-based Europe in the latest fields, without neglecting social and human aspects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us begin, however, in a spirit of constructive criticism, by welcoming the fact that this contribution towards achieving better integration of the European scientific community seeks to safeguard the balance between fundamental and applied research in order to combat the brain drain, to prioritise the problem of unemployment among young researchers within a European policy which is aware of the reality of the situation, and to recognise the leading role played by businesses in research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">We might then, also, reiterate what the report said, by emphasising the risk that concentrating research infrastructures, with a view to establishing a cost-effective critical mass, would represent for the peripheral regions, which are, in general, increasingly being disregarded by European programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Attention should also be drawn to the need to adhere strictly to the principle of subsidiarity, in order to leave the Member States and, through them, the regions with genuine local driving forces for research centres in direct contact with the worlds of business and academia, the ability to define their own priorities and methodologies under their own responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us dare to hope that your laudable concern to develop communications and translation services in order to eliminate the language barrier to the desirable synergy between the work of our respective researchers is not a cover for a further attempt to promote one of the Union’s languages above all the others, a language whose imperialism would be no less neutral here than elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group is going to vote in favour of your report, but I would ask you, in practical terms, will it be effective enough for us to achieve our shared goal, which is high-level scientific knowledge generating improved performance in every field? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Clearly, the development of research within the European Union is one of the keys to the future. The twenty-first century will be the century of knowledge and grey matter. Progress in communications effectively increases the rate of dissemination of knowledge, as the development of the Internet demonstrates, and is a powerful factor in promoting economic growth. In the broadest sense, then, research will, more than ever, be a fundamental element of future development.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the figures made available by the Commission, Europe is definitely lagging behind the United States. Here are some examples of this: the average investment in research for the European Union as a whole is no more than 1.8% of GDP, as opposed to 2.8% in the United States; the number of European graduate students studying in the United States is twice that of American students in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, the proposals of both the Commission and the Plooij-Van Gorsel report lead me to make a few observations. The first is that European investment in research is at least as important as the European research area. In the United States, there is rather less concern for semantics and more for practical action. The second observation is that approximately two thirds of research is undertaken by private companies and that the European Union must take this situation into consideration when focusing its resources. My third observation is that we must absolutely avoid anything which, from a distance or close up, looks like what has just been referred to as a master plan for European research. Research is, first and foremost, a matter for freedom and not for planning.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all included in the Commission communication and the report by our fellow Member. There is, however, no prioritisation in the proposals, and this is something I would like to suggest. This prioritisation should focus primarily on researchers and businesses. As far as researchers are concerned, their standard of living throughout Europe must be enhanced. As far as businesses are concerned, research work must be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is as follows: that we should first back the people involved, then business and, finally, that we should ensure that the European Union does not hinder the activities or the development of either party. This is what our approach must be. So the area ...</p>

I thank the Commissioner, whose timing is very good and so is his idea of launching this debate. There is indeed a growing feeling of unease at the lack of coordination in European science and research. The response has been positive, as the Commissioner knows from his contacts throughout Europe, including a recent visit to Cambridge. We are looking forward to seeing his analysis of the results of the consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a growing awareness in Europe of the dimensions of the threat from the very well-resourced, very well-targeted United States of America. Frankly, the EU is not punching its weight in research, although some Member States are very good. I would name Finland, Sweden and countries like the Republic of Ireland, which have made good progress. Apart from industrial competitiveness, of course, as Mr Desama says, we have serious environmental and social problems which need research to put them right.</p>
<p class="contents">A target of 3% of GDP on research is realistic and essential, as is the recruitment of far more scientists, including women. Please do not underestimate the potential of the Joint Research Centre, which is itself a scientific centre for policy – a reference centre for policy – and is ideally suited to the role of networking the centres of excellence. It is itself a centre of excellence in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support paragraphs 16 and 17, which call for informing the European public about scientific achievements and looking at ethical questions. We look forward to regular reports from the Commissioner about the implementation and realisation of this very exciting and essential project.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his ambition, which is considerable. Trying to create a European research area is an ambitious plan, because this research space is currently lacking and we only have ourselves to blame. We make insufficient resources available, although we all – and Mrs McNally underlined this a moment ago – acknowledge the link between progress, development, and creating prosperity and jobs. This is evident to all of us, yet our governments fail to set aside sufficient funds. This is true for the Member States and regions, some of whose percentage levels are shamefully low. We should, as it were, sound the praises of certain Member States and regions, but should not work on averages. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is good to emphasise cooperation. Pyramids and hierarchies are not really of much use here, because we know that talent bubbles up from below and from all those regions and all those milieus where talent breeds, both male and female, although female talent – and this has been pointed out many times before here – can only ascend to the very pinnacle of academia very slowly. </p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation, however, requires organisation. And really, the absence of this is something we only have ourselves to blame for. If our organisation of the scientific environment lags behind, we will not achieve a European research area. After all, it is exactly this area, where people can communicate a lot more freely with each other than before, which has to ensure that scientists feel at home in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That being the case, Mr Busquin is assuming one of the major responsibilities within the European Community. As far as we are concerned, it is all about encouraging researchers to engage in one-to-one conversations. Scientific studies have demonstrated that one-to-one conversations between researchers are the best way of making progress. What we need to do is to bring researchers from all over the world to Europe, and particularly those from countries wishing to join the EU. Researchers there are producing outstanding results that have yet to be acknowledged and marketed, and which can be intensively developed. </p>
<p class="contents">This leads us onto the subject of youth. I believe we should make sure that we impart this entrepreneurial spirit, the pleasure derived from innovation and research, to young people. It is good to see young people getting involved in research projects. Perhaps it would also be a good idea to set up a LEONARDO for researchers, an exchange programme between universities, schools, companies and research institutes. I believe that each individual has a great deal of knowledge to contribute, and that, ultimately, communication between specialists is the best method of conveying this knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the small and family-run enterprises, but also the suppliers, to have access to the major research institutions, to the top research centres. We in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have proposed to the Committee on Budgets that an additional allocation be made. We have said that at least 10% of research expenditure must be for the benefit of small- and medium-sized enterprises. I would say that a larger slice, 20% or 30%, should be closely tied in with cooperation between small companies, suppliers, and major research institutes, so as to bring about a dramatic improvement in the networks and in communication in this sector, and create brand new opportunities. An active and passive licensing and patenting policy – I wrote my dissertation on this at university – is the basis of successful research. As we have already heard today, it is vital for the European Union to give attention to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What obstacles are there? I believe we should distinguish between large and small assistance projects, particularly when it comes to expenditure. It is particularly important to keep administrative expenditure to a minimum in the case of small companies and small-scale projects. The Commission ought to concentrate on large projects, albeit with the proviso that the major projects undertaken are divided into small units; a proportion should be stipulated here as well. On a final note, Commissioner, I would just like to say that I am already looking forward to, when the next benchmarking projects….</p>

Where I come from, a survey was carried out in order to ascertain why this should be. This had surprising results. We had always believed that young people are no longer choosing to study the natural sciences or engineering at university because the job prospects are so poor. This is not the case. They do not study physics and chemistry because they are no fun. In a society that prizes having fun so highly, it is evidently extremely important for things to be fun. We are evidently failing to make the material attractive to people and suited to the lifestyles they have these days. They are from a different generation to mine. Therefore, I advocate that we bear this in mind when we find ourselves talking in such scholarly terms about the next generation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal I would just like to make is as follows: we are discussing the European research area. We are going to enlarge the European Union, marvellous! Indeed all these States are already taking part in the fifth research framework programme at the present time, and they will also participate in the sixth. I would therefore recommend involving the Parliamentarians and Ministers for Research of these countries in the preparation for the sixth research framework programme as well. I would envisage doing this here in the European Parliament – the French expression is <span class="italic">assises de recherche </span>– so that we can have a joint discussion about the guidelines for the sixth research framework programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, of course, also like to thank all the members of the committee, irrespective of their political party, and, in particular, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the academic world to Commissioner Philippe Busquin for the extreme sensitivity he has shown in creating, at last, a European common research area. </p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a common research area in Europe will, at last, make it possible to fully exploit<span class="bold"> </span>networks of high quality centres and achieve that critical mass which is essential both for the progress of knowledge <span class="italic">per se</span> and to provide practical answers to the man in the street: answers which cover a range of issues, from the control of terrible illnesses such as AIDS or cancer to neurodegenerative diseases or injuries caused by environmental pollution and so forth. This is why we support the Commissioner! Dear Commissioner, what a challenge! We will keep fighting in order to overcome that red tape which tends to delay the achievement of these goals. </p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the amendments I tabled will greatly promote recognition of the common research area and boost its efficiency. Thus, the first amendment, which calls for at least 3% of the gross domestic product of all the countries of the European Union to be allocated to research, represents a great victory and will allow us to compete with the United States and Japan. </p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment I tabled on behalf of the poor, vulnerable and abandoned regions, the Objective 1 regions of the South, i.e. to invest 5% of the unused regional funds – which would otherwise be taken back – to benefit those regions, will, at last, make it possible to exploit the excellent human resources available to us and close the gap in infrastructures and technology between these regions and the regions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment, which was also approved by our friend Mr Novelli – whom I would like to thank – will apply tax exemption and, thereby, at last make it possible to further increase the level of research carried out in all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would therefore like to finish by paying tribute to the new scientific research structure which you have introduced. On 20 June, two Nobel prize-winners, Rita Levi Montalcini, holder of the Nobel Prize for neuroscience, and Renato Dulbecco, will pay tribute to this initiative, in recognition of the fact that, at long last, in establishing the research area, you have conferred great honour on all research scientists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Investment in research and in cooperation must lead to more economic growth and more employment. This effort deserves all our support, and this is why I can give my full backing to the report by Mrs Plooij, to whom, by the way, I would like to convey my sincerest compliments. </p>
<p class="contents">But I would prefer it if we were a little more precise in our debate. We have to ascertain that not all research leads to more economic growth or more employment. The demand for research is huge where supporting policy choices, risk analyses, environmental effect reports, monitors and comparative research is concerned. It is all part of the preparation or assessment of political decisions in the environmental sector in the area of food or public health. In these particular areas, European cooperation is meaningful. The Joint Research Centres, the JRCs, have many examples of sound cooperation projects. </p>
<p class="contents">In many research areas, the JRC researchers find themselves in a situation much like a spider in a web. Where research in support of policy is concerned, initiatives from the Commission are therefore vital in order to prevent work from being duplicated, to avoid fragmentation and to ensure that the best measuring methods and the best techniques become the benchmark. But in this type of work, no major spin-offs in the employment sphere can be expected outside the research centres. </p>
<p class="contents">There is also great demand for applied research, which can be expected to have a far greater impact on employment. But European policy could restrict itself to creating appropriate conditions, and practical obstacles should be cleared away. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off by saying a few words on basic research. Research situated between applied and basic research now has a lower profile but remains significant. Many fundamental questions in the fields of natural and life sciences remain unanswered. It is precisely in these spheres that coordination of national research efforts is of major importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On account of the amendments tabled in committee, this report ended up being more wide-ranging; when dealing with issues related to research areas, we must not focus solely on scientific communities. The role of the SME sector as a locomotive force for innovation and research work must also be clearly borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication provides an unnecessarily one-sided view of the challenges of European research. It is obvious that, in the preparation of this communication, there has been no horizontal utilisation of the expertise of the various directorates. Since the discussion on the research area touches, for example, on the enlargement process of the Union and on the vitality of the SME sector, one would have wished that the Commission’s communication had presented more visions and concrete content. It is not enough to talk in broad terms about the competitiveness of the Union. Keywords in research policy are flexibility, global thinking, and the more effective use of resources than at present. The self-directed nature of science and the Member States’ own research policy priorities must be accorded sufficient space. It is therefore necessary to give careful thought to what will be required in the future of the joint research centres highlighted in the Commission’s proposal. On no account is it appropriate to enlarge the role of the Union’s research centres in such a way that the operations of national research centres are made more difficult in the context of resource reallocation.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the added value of the internal market approach in research will be acquired specifically through the more even distribution of the research and know-how which is funded by non-public resources. Practical experience has shown that by working within framework programmes it is not possible to react sufficiently flexibly to problems which demand rapid action, such as the BSE crisis. Increasing, for instance, the mobility of researchers according to need and enhancing the cooperation between the scientific communities of the EU and Eastern Europe will create a reliable and credible basis for research projects. </p>
<p class="contents">In this discussion, particular attention must also be paid to the position of women in European research policy; the body of technical experts in particular – which actually suffers from a labour shortage – is alarmingly male-dominated. The EU must accept that one of the most important challenges for its training and research policy is to awaken women’s interest in this sector.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have effectively entered the knowledge society, which has led us to put research back at the heart of our society. In Europe, however, as many people have said, the position of research looks worrying if one looks at the figures. It is therefore necessary, as a matter of urgency, to adopt an overall strategy at European level in order to make up for lost time. It is not a matter of casting doubt on the efficiency of the FRDPs. Their results are plain to see. It must be noted, however, that new initiatives need to be adopted in order to decompartmentalise Member States’ national systems which today represent nothing more than a duplication of efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the many measures which must be implemented, this evening I shall mention, in particular, the training and the mobility of researchers, to go back to a previous debate which involved the Commissioner and researchers from my own region. I am speaking, therefore, to voice their concerns, for we are not training enough scientific researchers and even fewer European researchers. The training of researchers should therefore include a European dimension, which would offer them greater mobility. Schemes do exist, but, in the real world, before and during implementation, there are administrative obstacles to mobility, such as welfare cover, which discourage many researchers.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end by saying that we must also devote ourselves to informing the citizens, in whom scientific progress raises as much hope as concern. I therefore hope that, in June, our ministers will be able to approve the rapid establishment of a whole series of building sites in Europe, on the basis of the Commissioner’s proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am a member of the Committee on Culture and in fact Parliament has not taken up the opinion of this committee. I am the only person from that committee who is speaking in this debate. I very much regret the fact that the contribution of the Committee on Culture has not been allowed to enrich the debate. In this respect I would like to offer some constructive criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to say that this is a laudable and courageous piece of work, because subsidiarity is a straitjacket which is holding Europeans back despite the brilliance of their desires and their minds. Nevertheless, it lacks a parallel project, which is concerned with human resources. Much is said about money and companies, but we never take into account – or at least we only do so in the small print and indirectly – the fact that it is a question of human resources and that therefore research requires training, training and more training.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe there are no training programmes for researchers. FEDER and the FEDER projects do not cover grant holders. Furthermore, the fifth research plan only includes one person per project, although it is impossible to carry out a far-reaching project with grant holders alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The personnel available to us include very few post-doctoral teachers and we do not have sufficient staff. How can we talk about mobility if we do not have researchers? This is the great challenge we have to face and, in this case, I would support Mr Rübig and others who have proposed specific training programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We must support the universities and researchers because, in Europe, working in research means sacrifices and a career full of risks and very few rewards and, of course, no economic reward.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that we must recycle our teachers. Only by means of a strategic European resources plan can we do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to express my fear that only centres of excellence will be recognised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns the close relationship between research, economic growth and employment. In order to respond to the challenge represented by the United States, the Union as a whole and certain countries in particular must allocate a higher proportion of their resources to research and facilitate investment by private companies. I subscribe to the view that we need to propose tax relief, harmonised at European level, as a guideline for the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Point two: research and development have generated an extremely well integrated system. In some areas, it is not easy to distinguish between basic and applied research. However, public financing and the European programmes need to target chiefly medium- and long-term economic and non-economic objectives, whereas competence for market-related research should lie chiefly with the firms.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the tertiarisation of research policies and the consolidation of the role of the regions: The territorial aspect of research policies is important chiefly in terms of the transfer of scientific and technological knowledge towards the small- and medium-sized enterprises which characterise many industrial districts. Small- and medium-sized enterprises are one of European industry’s strong points, in certain countries in particular, but they are still poorly integrated into the research system.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for the excellent report she has drawn up within a very short time limit. I should like to thank Mr MacCormick of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and all of you for your contributions, as well as for your contributions to the debate this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, I believe that this debate requires collective action and that you, as Members of Parliament, can play a decisive role in relations with the scientific community and industry. Rest assured that I and the other members of the Commission will be ready to pursue this dialogue and this debate tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I think that this Parliament resolution is going to provide strong democratic support for the text ratified by the Lisbon Council which, moreover, set practical goals and deadlines. We should realise the extent to which the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Lisbon served to highlight – what I believe is very important – the key role of research policy, as we have again pointed out this evening, and to acknowledge the importance of this role in the advent of a knowledge-based economy and society. We are at a juncture which gives us hope that greater and more crucial progress may be made in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should like to stress the importance of consulting the scientific community, with its awareness of developments, but also the industrial world, which can gauge the importance of the issues at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now outline a few points in the resolution, not in order to reopen the debate, Mr President, given the late hour, but in order to put a few brief comments to you.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that the concept of centres of excellence is one worth developing further and, in this connection, there is one essential principle, and that is that excellence is the condition <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for scientific and technological progress. Such excellence does exist in Europe, in all the Member States, but at an inadequate level of critical mass, and this is a situation which could be improved. This is the significance of all these networks of centres of excellence that must be created without necessarily specifying the exact infrastructures involved. It is a matter of human resources, but it is something that must be set up in order to have the ability to raise levels in Europe. And, as Mr Harbour pointed out, this excellence may also come in a virtual form in the modern technologies and high-speed networks we wish to see set up.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards fundamental and applied research, I think this is a matter of balance. These two aspects are closely linked. Everyone accepts this, both the world of industry and the world of research, of course, in the same way as they accept multidisciplinarity, which is one of the results of scientific developments. In order to create the necessary dynamic, it is therefore essential to develop the concept of benchmarking. I think this is an instrument which will make it possible, at European level, to create this dynamic, and also to instigate proactive and open coordination. I think establishing a patent is a condition <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>, as has been adequately pointed out<span class="italic">. </span>Mr Bolkestein, who is responsible for the internal market, is well aware of this. </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I should like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for having, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference, insisted on initiating a discussion on a European legal body, since this is an essential condition for bringing about this Community patent. Finally, as far as small- and medium-sized businesses are concerned, the matter of the patent is a crucial factor, quite apart from more specific elements.</p>
<p class="contents">The aspect of regional development has been stressed, and I attach great importance to this, as successful experiments have been conducted in some regions and these should be exhibited as an example throughout Europe. I also attach great importance to the link between research and the Structural Funds, not forgetting the role of the European Investment Bank. In connection with this, discussions have been held with the European Investment Bank and schemes are underway to ensure that the EIB has a still more dynamic role in matters related to innovation and transposition and, since this was mentioned, that includes with candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Research Centre and its specialist role have been stressed, and the goal of 3% of GDP is, I believe, an ambitious but necessary goal in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So, to be brief, I should simply like to inform Parliament of the forthcoming stages. The first stage is clear. I would first of all like to emphasise just how important it was that Parliament expressed its opinion today. This is why I wished to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for drawing up her report so quickly, and also all the Members of Parliament for debating the matter in such detail within such a short time period. The next stage, then, is the Council of Ministers responsible for Research, which will take place on 15 June. This report will provide practical examples to support the determination that we must display. For I have clearly understood that practical action is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">So, regarding the practical action, let me quickly list a few points, starting with benchmarking. With national research policies, the methodology exists. I think that the Member States accept this methodology, with the establishment of a high level group of representatives. Initial results will be available by the end of the year. A map of areas of excellence in Europe is being drawn up, with the cooperation of the national specialist institutes. That is no surprise to anyone, I think. I am hopeful that this map will also be ready by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The mobility of researchers presupposes the mobility of workers in general. The ambition of Mrs Diamantopoulou and myself is to set up a group made up of representatives from each Member State in order to identify where the obstacles lie. Regarding Women and Science, in fact, on the initiative of Parliament, a sizeable group of five hundred women has been set up. You are familiar with the very interesting report that this group produced, which triggered policy in each of the Member States. I shall be able to give you the results of this in the near future. Finally, as regards electronic networks, Mr Liikanen and I wish to increase these to several gigabytes very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to tell you briefly, given the time constraints and that I do not want to detain you further. I do, however, wish to express my heartfelt thanks for the interest you have shown in this debate. I believe we have to set up a dynamic, one that must be enhanced, and I promise that I shall give you progress reports on a regular basis. I hope that, together, we shall be able to open up the European research area that I believe in so strongly.</p>
