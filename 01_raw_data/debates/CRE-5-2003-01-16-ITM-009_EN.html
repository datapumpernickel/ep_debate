We have repeatedly stressed that the fight against terrorism is an entirely justified, indeed necessary, fight. However, in the case of Chechnya – and this applies to similar situations in the context of Iraq and other regions as well – we have always stressed that bombs, military aggression and military measures are unsuitable as a means of resolving the issue of terrorism. For this reason, we also need to make it very clear to Russia that we are profoundly disappointed that Russia – which is and should be a partner of the European Union – has failed to pursue a rational policy aimed at combating the causes of terrorism as well as terrorism itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We are deeply disappointed that people are being forced to return to this unsafe country and that even the expellees are being forcibly repatriated. We believe that every option must be exhausted to achieve a peaceful solution here. One such option could be the referendum if it takes place under objective conditions. The people themselves should have a chance to express their views, and I believe that it would do Putin's and indeed Russia's reputation good if Russia could revert to, or basically establish for the first time, a rational and peaceful policy on Chechnya.</p>

Russian troops ride roughshod over the people in their fight against the rebel troops of the Republic of Chechnya. There are people there living in extraordinarily wretched conditions, both within Chechnya and outside. Those who have managed to flee are then forced to return to an area that is really impossible to live in. Crimes by the military are inadequately prosecuted, and by bringing this resolution we want to protest against this. Grozny is still extremely unsafe, which indicates that the fight against the so–called rebels in Chechnya has not yet come to an end by a long chalk. Buildings are being blown up and the people the European Parliament delegation went there to open discussions with are all lying in hospital. In that context, the best the Russians could do was to postpone the visit of the European Parliament delegation to Chechnya. The official reason for this is perhaps odd, but we hear through diplomatic channels that this is on account of the fact that security there absolutely cannot be guaranteed, something which the Russian state naturally views as a scandal, which it is.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context the OSCE is regarded as a busybody whose mandate should rather not be renewed. We also protest against that. We definitely want the OSCE’s mandate to continue, as the OSCE is absolutely necessary for the provision of aid and for political initiatives later on when observing a possible referendum. Another busybody, Mr Erkel, who was the head of <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span> in Dagestan, the territory bordering on Chechnya, has been kidnapped. We do not know by whom. No ransom has been demanded. It is therefore entirely possible that this man has been captured by the authorities themselves, as has happened in the past. I have asked the Commission and the Council about this. Fellow MEPs in various other parties have highlighted this and are completely behind it. We want the Commission to make efforts to find out what has happened to Mr Erkel and to see whether it would be possible to obtain his release. Anyway, the European Union must do whatever is possible from a political and community point of view, and the resolution bears witness to this. A white list for Chechen leaders, as has been proposed in an amendment, seems to us to be counterproductive, however. It is restrictive, and our group is inclined to think that the Danish government pursued a very good policy on this point. They did not need a white list. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indifference makes us accomplices. 80 000 people have died in Chechnya since 1999. Hundreds of thousands have been made refugees. Yes, we appreciate Russian cooperation in the fight against terrorism, but that is no reason to turn a blind eye to humanitarian atrocities by both sides in Chechnya. The only way forward is negotiations for a political solution, a referendum and elections. The OSCE mission must be allowed to stay as an aid to that process, just as the Russians are in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russians are trying to extradite Ahmed Zakayev, the envoy of the Chechen president. The Danish Government refused, due to lack of evidence of his participation in criminal acts. The British Government, now considering a similar request, should tell the Russians that, on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in the EU, we recognise the considered Danish decision and refuse his extradition to Russia. Otherwise there is no point in having this principle of mutual recognition of national decisions within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows how determined Parliament is not to remain silent about this war. According to reports, our Russian friends are not impressed by this type of debate and are also not impressed by the resolutions we are adopting here. I have always been taught that you must always tell your friends the truth, that you must not withhold anything. If friends keep quiet in front of each other, they are doing the wrong thing. I would like to send this message to our Russian friends.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Chechnya is bad. Let us acknowledge that. We all know that, and the Russians must also have the courage to acknowledge it. Various fellow MEPs have already pointed this out. People disappear, people are tortured and relief workers are kidnapped. There is a real guerrilla war in progress. A dirty war on the part of the Russians, but also on the part of the Chechen rebels. The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is terrible. Yet the Russians are now trying to force these people to return to Chechnya. We all know that this is not a good thing to do during the winter months and is in fact impossible. The OSCE is being removed from Chechnya. The Russians evidently do not want any busybodies there. Just as they are actually preventing us from going there with a delegation. They use what I believe to be specious arguments for this in a letter to our President. The truth is that they do not have the situation in Chechnya under control at the moment and they cannot guarantee our safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that our Russian colleagues are very dissatisfied with the resolutions we are adopting. Nevertheless, the present resolution is very balanced. It is a resolution that shows that we in Parliament want a solution and that we really want to make a positive contribution to this. I therefore call on our Russian colleagues to resume the dialogue with our Parliament in order to engage with us in an honest and proper way and to ensure that we can ultimately bring the two parties together with a view to reaching a political solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These crimes, which show utter contempt for human life, can never be justified and the perpetrators must be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I appeal to those affected and the Russian Government not to retaliate with similar means but to seek a peaceful solution. This attack on the civil administration clearly shows that terrorists are not interested in ending the conflict. On the contrary, their aim is the permanent destabilisation of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the plan to hold a referendum in Chechnya in March. This is a hopeful sign towards democracy and self–determination. Wanting to encourage the refugees in Ingushetia to return home to Chechnya is the right approach, but it is fundamentally wrong to subject them to pressure. First, the conditions for their return must be put in place. People must feel safe, and they need housing, electricity and food. The schools must be open and healthcare must be secure. The European Union is willing to get involved here and provide humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian Government's decision not to extend the OSCE's mandate is therefore even more incomprehensible. What possible political objection can there be to monitoring respect for human rights, providing aid for refugees, and supporting conflict transformation? None, in my view, unless it is seen as intervention in a country's internal affairs rather than as an offer of help in a very difficult situation. Or perhaps the Russian Government thinks that accepting help would be a sign of weakness, which it cannot afford for political reasons. In my view, this would be a complete misapprehension, but it can be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the European Parliament's ad hoc delegation on Chechnya, I am disappointed about the cancellation of our delegation visit, which had been confirmed with the Duma. I am disappointed not only because we naturally wanted to gain our own impression of the local situation – and viewed this as a contribution towards further mutual understanding – but also because a basic political question arises here which has been answered in the negative. We were informed that the reason for the postponement is the fact that Ahmed Zakayev had been released from detention in a European country and Parliament had adopted a resolution on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that the Duma has a different political viewpoint from our own. However, I have a fundamental question. How can one hope to achieve a peaceful resolution to highly complicated issues in Chechnya through a process of negotiation with real opponents if one is incapable of accepting that a friendly institution may have a different political opinion?</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ludford, we must refrain, quite categorically, from comparing National Socialism and the persecution of the Jews by the National Socialists in Germany with any other situation. Such comparisons trivialise this monstrous, state–sanctioned violation of human rights, which was unique in history. Please do not make such comparisons again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is being committed by the Russian colonial power in order to safeguard its strategic interests and resources. The fact that this is camouflaged as a war on terrorism – even if there is terrorism there – is simply a cynical distortion of reality. This is why it is important that there should be unfettered access to the war region so that the facts can be presented.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently witnessing a situation in which the Russian power is doing its utmost to ensure that this war fades from sight behind a wall of silence. First of all, the Commission has so far been unwilling to visit the region. We have discussed the matter time and again with Commissioner Nielson and urged him to visit the region. It may be that some influence has already been brought to bear behind the scenes here. Then we said that we as a Parliament wanted to visit the region. Our parliamentary delegation was then prevented from travelling to the crisis region for a variety of completely threadbare reasons. This was not just deplorable, to paraphrase the mild criticism voiced in the resolution before us. It was a scandal. We are supposed to have a partnership with Russia. That means that just as our partner Russia has the right and the opportunity to travel anywhere in the EU to gather first–hand information, we expect to have the same free and unimpeded access in Russia's sphere of influence at any time, in line with all the international conventions which Russia has signed, not least in the OSCE and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The third attempt to construct a wall of silence around Chechnya was the ending of the OSCE mission and the ejection of an international organisation which had made a major contribution to ending the previous Chechen war through a negotiated settlement. It was, after all, under the OSCE's supervision, that President Maskhadov was elected, and, as he is the only representative to have been elected democratically to date, we cannot deny him dialogue. Then a German delegation led by Norbert Blüm, the well–respected former German minister, was thrown out as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I find this absolutely scandalous, and I think we should be speaking a clearer language here than we have done so far. We must make it clear to the Russians that this cannot continue. We want to shine light into the darkness and we want an end to this war.</p>

There are, on the one hand, several generations of Chechens who, to date, have known only war and violence and who may at any moment be led by the most extremist fringe groups to commit thoughtless acts of terrorism. On the other hand, there is a veritable colonial war, conducted by the Russian army, which finds expression in systematic searches on a huge scale, human rights violations, assassinations, abductions and, above all, the scandalous acquittal on 31 December 2002 of Colonel Yuri Budanov, charged with the rape and murder of an 18–year–old Chechen girl. In this context, it is pretty scandalous that a humanitarian worker should continue to be held prisoner.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that double standards should be avoided. If we receive President Putin, we must do something for the minister of health who has returned to Baku and whose visa has been taken away, for Ahmed Zakayev, to whom I spoke yesterday on the telephone and who is still under house arrest in the United Kingdom or, again, for the foreign affairs minister held without a visa in the United States. These people must also be given the benefit of visas, for it takes two to make peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It ought to go without saying that the OSCE should have its mandate extended, that international representatives should have access to Chechnya and that those who have committed serious crimes in Chechnya should be punished. As a Dane, I should particularly like, however, to call for the two amendments to be adopted. The EU did not lift a finger when Russia imposed sanctions upon Denmark after we had, quite justifiably, refused, as the only decent thing to do, to allow Mr Zakayev to be extradited as a terrorist. This is the kind of situation that neither Chechen politicians nor the Member States should be able to bring about in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Oostlander is not here for the moment, but our fellow MEPs who, for two years, undermined this Parliament’s demands for Milosevic to be indicted are the same MEPs who, today, are conducting this would–be realistic policy towards the Russian Federation and Mr Putin and who, at every available opportunity, are concealing the reality of the situation in Chechnya, which is one of veritable genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">We say we are disappointed by Mr Budanov’s acquittal. I think that we should, at the very least, be extremely shocked. We are sorry that we are not able to visit Chechnya. This visit has now been put off four times and it is two years since the European Parliament delegation was due to visit Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">We are mistaking, and losing sight of, all our reference points. We forget that, during the years 1940–1945, there were acts of resistance in our countries targeted against the symbols of the occupying power, against Vichy, against Quisling and against those collaborating with the occupying power. Today, it is the attack on the Grozny government headquarters – inconceivable though it would have been to someone such as myself, who eschews violence – that is an act of resistance. Yet we accuse the Chechens, who are aiming at the very heart of collaboration with Moscow, of perpetrating terrorist attacks. These are not terrorist attacks. The attack was aimed at a cell of people working for the FSB and which was therefore a strategic target for the combatants or Chechen resistance. We have completely lost the plot. We are combining everything under the heading of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">That is extremely serious, as it is also extremely serious to advocate a political solution on the one hand and, on the other, to support a referendum organised by the occupying power; to advocate political negotiations while, in practice, prohibiting Chechen parliamentarians or Ministers from entering our territory to meet politicians from our own countries in the European Parliament, European Commission or European Council, on the pretext that it would be impossible for them to do so. Now, we are very well aware that, under Article 14(3), we have been able to draw up blacklists of Yugoslav or Belarussian politicians and that we are able to draw up a ‘white list’ of Chechen politicians. If we want to talk politics, we must do so with politicians. In this context, we are really beginning to become the accomplices of genocide. It is time that Parliament woke up. Otherwise, we shall be embarking again upon the unspeakable things such as we have seen in connection with Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo. I think we have already paid a sufficient price for what was done there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the conflict in Chechnya was discussed in detail on 11 September at the last European Union Summit with the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the lack of progress towards peace forces us, once again, to focus our attention on the tragic situation that is devastating Chechnya. We are all aware that, from the point of view of security, the situation has worsened since the last Summit in Brussels. I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the Union’s strong condemnation of the recent terrorist attacks, which cut short the lives of more than one hundred people and seriously injured many more.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union takes a strong stance against terrorism, regardless of who is responsible and what their motives are. Car bomb attacks, indiscriminate murders, kidnappings and other methods of terrorism can in no way be justified for any cause, however legitimate it may seem.</p>
<p class="contents">This is obviously entirely valid for Chechnya, but our conviction that the fight against terrorism cannot take place at the expense of respect for human rights is also valid.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all allow me to look specifically at the subject of human rights. Non–governmental organisations of recognised standing continue to report serious violations of human rights committed in Chechnya by the security forces working on behalf of the Russian Federation. The murders, torture, disappearances and other violations of basic human rights should therefore also be clearly and strongly condemned by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is equally serious is the lack of a clear will on the part of the authorities to deal with these violations. The result of the trial against Colonel Budanov is not a positive sign, but quite the opposite. Another negative event was the forced evacuation of the Chechen refugee camp in Akiyurt just before Christmas, which was also described by the European Union as a violation of the international humanitarian principle that displaced persons should be returned to their place of origin solely of their own free will, without the pressure that was applied in that case.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union acted quickly to demand that the same thing should not happen to other similar camps, as it only leads to the suffering of the civil population. People are displaced by the violence of war and terrorism, and until those things stop, they cannot return to their homes without their lives being endangered. They should also have a minimum economic infrastructure, which they do not currently have, in order to continue with their lives. I want to assure you that the European Commission is keeping a close eye on events and that it will take the necessary steps to prevent this from being repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, ECHO is planning a monitoring delegation to Ingushetia at the end of this month. The European Commission is aware of the majority position of Parliament on these issues, and of its efforts to achieve the shared objectives that I have just mentioned. In this sense, it is the Commission’s desire and hope that the planned visit to Chechnya by the Parliament Delegation for relations with the Duma, which has again been delayed, will soon be able to take place, which will undoubtedly help to make the European Union’s voice heard in the conflict in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Another very important matter is the considerable humanitarian aid provided by the European Union. The Russian authorities are continuing to fail to provide the necessary cooperation in order for the non–governmental organisations distributing such aid to be able to deliver it to the recipients under good conditions, despite the repeated observations of the European Union. Our humanitarian workers continue to face countless administrative obstacles preventing them from effectively doing their job. What is even more serious is that the bureaucratic obstacles are endangering their lives and their safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to point out that Mr Arjan Erkel, an employee of <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span>, was kidnapped months ago. We have urged the Russian authorities, and we repeat that request, to do everything in their power to secure his immediate release.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, I would now like to deal with the central issue of the urgent resolution under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, on 31 December, the mandate of the OSCE assistance group for Chechnya expired. The lack of agreement on the content of the mandate for the coming year means that currently the team is being forced to take the decision to leave Chechnya. The Russian Federation has so far maintained the position that the mandate of the assistance group for Chechnya should be reduced in order to exclude any political role. This is a contradiction in terms given the highly political nature of the OSCE as an organisation for security in Europe. The Commission understands that maintaining this group is not only appropriate, but also in the interests of everyone, and especially of Russia. The same applies to the efforts made by the different bodies of the Council of Europe, which are also facing increasing obstacles to their work.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of these international organisations seems to be even more necessary at present when the Russian Federation has the firm intention to take a series of steps towards the political normalisation of Chechnya. Therefore, the presence and assistance of the organisations would be the only way of providing that normalisation process with a level of democratic legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Intensive negotiations are currently going on in Vienna with the aim of ensuring that the assistance group remains in Chechnya and the issue is being raised today in Athens amongst the political leaders of the Union and of Russia. We hope that these diplomatic proceedings will enable us to achieve our objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
