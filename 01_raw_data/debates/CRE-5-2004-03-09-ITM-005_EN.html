You are well aware that it is very irritating for honourable Members if voting starts late. I would suggest that we should give the floor to the first authors of the questions, as they are familiar with the subject, before the Commissioner joins us, and the Commissioner also knows what they wish to say.

Israel does not want to make this distinction, but the European Union does. Politics lies at the heart of the debate. The European Union considers the occupation of the territories in question illegal, and that is why we have made such a problem of this matter. However, the debate, which is in essence political, risks being overrun by scores of practical and legal aspects. The problem, and the reason I am asking these questions now, is that the Commission and the Council, tired of years of squabbling, are now threatening to go along with current practice. This would legitimise an illegal practice, and Member States would lose the legal basis for continuing to make a distinction between products from Israel and those from the Occupied Territories. Hence, I have two questions for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is: what steps does the Commission intend to take by November of this year, when a new Commission takes office, to put an end to the current practice, and when, precisely?</p>
<p class="contents">The second is: can the Commissioner guarantee that every decision he takes that could have an impact on the spirit, the letter or the practice of the Association Agreement will first be submitted to this Parliament for its opinion? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They spoke to us of their weariness and of their daily struggle to survive in the refugee camps. They spoke of their courage and of their undying and dignified longing for peace. In particular, they spoke of their expectations of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, the last few days have been particularly murderous in the Gaza Strip. Fourteen Palestinians, three of them children, have been killed; dozens have been wounded, including Israeli soldiers, as if the announced withdrawal from the zone had to be preceded by acts of destruction with increasingly irreparable consequences. Tomorrow, you are invited to meet Israeli pacifists. These so-called refuseniks have also courageously refused to participate in the occupation at the heart of the spiral of murder in which the Palestinian and the Israeli people are caught up.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we are today considering in particular Israel’s violation of the rules of origin within the framework of the association agreement. It is impossible, however, not to consider at the same time all those other blatant violations committed on a daily basis in the Palestinian occupied territories. These violations are also a complete betrayal of the spirit of partnership enshrined in the agreement signed. Consequently, for those who want to believe in a just peace, the debates on the rights or wrongs of the application of this agreement are indicative of what has unfortunately been seen as a reprehensible excess of caution on the part of the European Union. One is obliged to recognise that Israel treats with derision Europe’s reprimands relating to violations of Article 2 on the respect of fundamental rights, as well as those concerning the rules of origin. Let us consider the rules of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1976, Israel has determined the origin of the products it exports without distinguishing between products originating within its territory and those originating in the territories occupied since 1967. In other words, there is no distinction between its products and those of its settlements. In this way, Israel has continually issued certificates of origin to products that are not eligible for preferential treatment according to Community law. Had it been committed by any other country, such a violation would doubtless have lead to stringent retaliatory measures. Due to Israel’s customs practices, however, it has thus far been impossible for Member States to prevent these preferential imports or to impose taxes. Neither did the Commission, at first, propose adequate measures to combat these practices. Subsequently, the Commission announced that it was going to get down to the task of coordinating the ineffective actions of the Member States. Then the Commission spelt out its position, a clear and lawful position. On 10 May 2001, Commissioner Patten stated in the House that, ‘preferential access to the Community market for exports from the Israeli settlements, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip constitutes a violation of the EC-Israel trade agreements’. The measures taken, however, have failed to put an end to this unlawful practice. Furthermore, the ongoing construction of that shameful wall can only exacerbate the situation. Olive and fruit trees have been uprooted before the villagers’ very eyes. Agricultural land has been rendered inaccessible to thousands of local inhabitants. Will this new illegal annexation lead to still more exports of products from these areas?</p>
<p class="contents">Last November, the European Union stressed before the EU-Israel Association Council the importance of resolving the problem of the rules of origin before any amendment of the protocol on these same rules. The Commission indicated that it has pursued these discussions with Israel since then. Nevertheless, the question still remains. I would like to ask you again, Commissioner, whether the Commission will accept a solution that does not require Israel to stop issuing certificates of origin to products from its settlements within the framework of the association agreement. Will the Commission use the legal instruments available to it? The possibility of amending the agreement is now being put forward. If we accept this principle, however, and if Israel continues to violate the agreement, the European Union could forfeit all its rights to suspend the application of any part of this agreement in order to stop the violation. This would be unacceptable. It would amount to deliberately flouting international law. It would mean recognising Israel as the occupying power in the Palestinian Territories and recognising Israel’s practice of annexing and colonising them. Be that as it may, I would like to make it clear, once again, that it is absolutely essential to consult Parliament before the agreement is amended in any way. Will the Commission undertake to do so?</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is a general one. The European Union cannot continue to be complicit in the continuing occupation of the Palestinian Territories by Mr Sharon’s government, in the theft of the produce of the land, in the confiscation of profits and in the denial to the people of the means of their existence and their very survival. The 1995 agreement followed closely on the heels of the Oslo process. It was designed to be a contribution to the peace process. The situation today is totally different. What type of cooperation can we be talking about? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have absolutely no objections to this agreement in itself. It contains fundamental standards and values that demonstrate respect and, in itself, we can support Israel as a democracy. That is not where the problem lies. What I find incomprehensible, however, and the reason I have asked these questions, is that the European Union has been allowing Israel to violate the rules of origin in the agreement for years. These rules of origin – this is child’s play for you, of course – state that Israel is not permitted to sell products from the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories as though they originated from Israel itself; otherwise, the products from the illegal settlements would wrongfully benefit from favourable import duties in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Lagendijk said, this is a political matter. I also know that the European Commission addressed Israel in this matter and, in reply, was told of Israel’s adamantine position that it considers the settlements to be Israeli territory. European governments are not responding, and are thus acquiescing in the violation of the agreement that they themselves adopted. This makes us jointly responsible for the continuation of the policy of colonisation, one of the greatest obstacles to peace. This is the crux of the matter, in my opinion. We must not share responsibility for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the EC Treaty, the Community Customs Code and the Association Agreement, Member States are obliged to refuse to give preferential treatment to the import of products from the settlements. As the Commission and as guardian of the treaties, you must monitor Member States’ compliance with these obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">These problems must be solved, and without delay, and so I ask the Commissioner whether he now genuinely intends to put an end to these matters and come up with a genuine legislative solution, so that a uniform verification procedure can be followed in the Member States. The Member States’ customs authorities will then be able to collect ordinary import duties for products from settlements without the importers being able to contest this.</p>
<p class="contents">This would seem to me an extremely neat solution: not for or against Israel; not for or against the Palestinians. The issue is merely that we do not want to be jointly responsible for the problem of settlements, and I ask, therefore, that you submit any solutions to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most recently, in a debate in November 2003 we reaffirmed that a solution finally needed to be found in order to bring Israel's repeated violations of international law to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of its practice of labelling products from the occupied territories as ‘Made in Israel’, Israel is not only violating the provisions on the territorial scope of the agreement, notably Article 83, the rules on origin and the provisions on cooperation and mutual assistance between administrative authorities in customs matters, but in doing so it is continuing to display its total contempt for international agreements and for international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is, however, now more pressing than ever before. The European Union is planning to include Israel in the preferential treatment system of pan-European accumulation, which in this case means making corresponding changes to the EC-Israel Association Agreement. If that were to happen without the illegal application of the rules on origin for settlement products being corrected, it would imply <span class="italic">de facto </span>acceptance of such illegal application. The European Union would accordingly be permanently depriving itself of the right finally to insist on legal application of the rules for preferential treatment of exports.</p>
<p class="contents">The preferential treatment of export products from the occupied territories is, however, not only illegal and in breach of international law, it also means that the Member States continue to be faced with the thorny problem of controls and of achieving some degree of uniform treatment. Although the Commission has attempted to find a remedy, the problem has so far not been solved at all. The Commission has quite rightly informed the Israeli authorities that measures must be taken promptly to halt this illegal practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Before there can be any further talk about amending the EC-Israel Association Agreement, I would like to call upon the Commission, as a matter of urgency, to resolve this situation before the end of its term of office. This is a very important issue, Commissioner, because it needs to go hand in hand with the amendment of the Association Agreement. The Commission should consult Parliament on this and thus prevent a situation arising, through inaction and a lack of political will, in which illegality is <span class="italic">de facto</span> legalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, products originating from Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem or the Golan Heights are not entitled to preferential tariff treatment upon entry into the EU, and any claims of preferential origin made by Israel for such products cannot be accepted by the Community's customs authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has explained in detail, for example in replies to various oral questions in May and November 2003, its position on this issue and the actions it has taken. The EU is taking every opportunity to find a solution to the problem of product imports from the Israeli settlements in question. Exploratory talks aimed at finding possible solutions have recently been held between the Commission and Israel, but these discussions have yet to lead to a formal proposal by Israel and the Commission therefore has yet to take a position. However, the Commission will not accept any solution that would mean preferential tariff treatment being granted for products originating from the Israeli settlements and imported under Israeli rules of preferential origin.</p>

It is not just about the legal arguments that have been exchanged with the authors of the four questions during this debate; what is really important is the political issue of whether we wish to promote peace at this point or not. It goes without saying that the occupation of the occupied territories since 1967 is illegal – that is the position of the United Nations. Resolution No 242 says that Israel should withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has now been going on for over 30 years. During that time, settlements have been built, and the signing of the Oslo Peace Accord has brought the two sides closer together. So the question now is this: what will most assist the peace process? For example, would immediate withdrawal from the occupied territories really serve the cause of peace? Everyone – including the European Union and the United States – now knows that we need to include steps towards that peace in the road map. Simple withdrawal tomorrow would not serve the peace process and would lead to fresh conflicts. Any signal that we as the European Union give at this point is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to remember this: the agreement was concluded in 1975, the Oslo Peace Accord was signed in 1993, and from that moment on the European Union has supported the independence of the Palestinian Autonomy Authority, it has given it over EUR 2 billion and has done very good work. In Oslo both partners agreed that both areas, the different zones, including the Autonomy Authority, were parties to trade with the European Union. So regardless of whether the settlement policy is right or wrong, the area in which the settlements are located is an EU partner, either through the agreement with the Palestinian Autonomy Authority or through the EC-Israel Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The comments made by the honourable Member from the political left who spoke first are therefore spurious. No one on the Palestinian side is exploited through the Association Agreement. Quite the opposite: if we were to suspend it overnight, the Palestinians who work there would be the first to suffer again. It is not just settlers who manufacture products there; a good many Palestinian jobs also depend on it. I think that the Commission's position is very well balanced in making it clear to Israel that this does not imply any recognition of the occupied territories, but that solutions still need to be found, so that an agreement of this kind is made to work and so that we do not pour oil on the fire again. I welcome the fact that Israel is once again handing over to the Palestinians the tax and customs due to them, and we in the European Union should not give the wrong signal and suspend the agreement as some people have suggested. That would certainly not help the peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All this is wrong, and it is a fact that Israel has occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 and that the European institutions, including this Parliament, have repeatedly called on the State of Israel to respect the rules of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions’ basic preference was for a constructive partnership, with the hope of attaining the best results by going along this road. As long as there are forces such as those that created the Geneva agreements, we must continue to foster this hope and invest politically in this future possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, since 1995 the EU-Israel partnership has developed within the framework of an association agreement that provides, amongst other things, for preferential treatment of Israeli products on the European market. Since 1976 Israel has, however, determined the origin of its products without making any distinction between those from its territory and those from the territories occupied in constant and repeated violation of Community law, international law and the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are at a critical point in this affair. In fact, the protocol on the rules of origin is also being modified to allow for, on the one hand, pan-European enlargement and, on the other hand, for an Israeli-Jordanian trade system. Is it possible, however, to imagine this enlargement without having resolved the serious dispute with Israel? In 2000, the Council reaffirmed the need to respect international law under the Fourth Geneva Convention in trade relations with Israel. In 2001, Commissioner Patten described the continued exports from the settlements on a preferential basis as violations. In 2003, the Council decided to reach a bilateral agreement with Israel. At this point, Commissioner, I wanted to ask you three questions, but given your reply, I will ask two. The first is that it seems to me that you said that the Commission cannot accept any agreement that does not provide for this illegal practice to stop; yet, how does the Commission intend to tackle this debate with the Council, given that it seems that some Member States are not of the same opinion? Finally, is the Commission prepared to consult Parliament before taking any decisions in this area?</p>

It is important to set the debate in context and bear in mind that the Oslo accords provide for unified customs arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">The real question, therefore, is whether certain products are to be identified in a particular way. The Israelis seem ready to accept this. Negotiations leading to an arrangement of this type will certainly resolve this problem, which is actually a relatively minor one. Regarding the establishment of a special category, I believe that 60 years after the liberation of Europe, we must still guard against imposing a new yellow Star of David, even if it is only to apply to goods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why are we talking about such an issue, for what reason? We are not talking about something in order to contribute to the peace or to bring the sides to the table, but rather we are talking about a legal loophole with no repercussions, not even economic. What will this lead to? What should we do tomorrow morning with the new labels? Do you think, then, that tomorrow morning there will really be a major violation of international law on this matter? Or, should we then talk about the violation of international law in the form of the claims made by Abu Ali in our institution a few days ago, when he defined Hamas as a normal and general political force, rather than as a factor contributing to international terrorism? That constitutes a violation of international law and not a debate on subjects of this nature. Furthermore, the hard-fought-for settlements that have been brought to the table so often in this discussion about associated products are not helping to put an end to peace, that much is certain. It is certainly terrorism that prevents the parties from coming to the negotiating table. Now we are talking about something serious. I say to everyone: let us contribute to peace. I say to the Commission: let us not make absurd allegations when discussing this, when we still have to clarify the issue of funds allocated for humanitarian aid: where did they really go? I believe that when we start to discuss legal matters in this House, the dialogue ends; or we hide behind legal pretexts. So then, let us avoid this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner’s speech is a speech that I would say, automatically to some extent, confirms the Commission’s position. I fear that the Commission would have said the same if we had been discussing the situation in Vietnam, and would have done so on the basis of its usual course of action, that is to say one whereby, instead of monitoring rights and the law, it would have monitored and protected relations with Vietnamese power, murderous as this was.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, it seems to me that the Commission’s tone is to some extent justified by the very reasons stated by Mrs Morgantini and others. The desire to narrow the focus within the framework of a complex situation that is slipping from our grasp<span class="bold"> </span>is, I believe, an error of method. What I detect is not a love of the truth, but passion of the kind exhibited by the French Communist Member, who speaks about the wall of shame.

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this parliamentary term, the real problem – and I am winding up here – is the fact that we continue to forget that the historic reasons that allowed us to make the progress that we have made in Europe to date have their origin in the statement – excellently summarised in the Ventotene Manifesto by Altiero Spinelli – according to which the self-contained nation state cannot produce democracy, freedom, progress or truth. It is by imagining that it can that we continue, for example, mistakenly to posit the national State of Palestine as the problem we have to resolve on behalf of the Palestinians and the Israelis. I believe that Israel too is lacking in imagination, strength and rigour in this area. The Israeli parties too are like yours; they are European. I would like to conclude by saying: let us hope, at the end of this parliamentary term, that the federalist ideals and the federalist method will very quickly prevail,<span class="bold"> </span>with the accession to the European Union of Israel and of a Palestinian state of the kind you want to see: one founded on freedom and not on the abuse of power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Clearly, serious questions arise about preferential access to the Community market for products originating from the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. As far as I understand it, the preferential import from these territories constitutes a violation of Community law. Now I understand that the European Union wants to amend the Association Agreement with Israel with the addition of a pan-European cumulation of origin, and also the implementation of Jordanian-Israeli cumulation of origin. The question is, however, whether a cumulation system such as this is even possible without a solution to this problem of the preferential import of products from the Occupied Territories.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament be consulted in good time before any part of the existing agreement is amended. I agree with the previous speakers: it is important that this take place before the end of the present Commission’s term of office, if possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We set great store by a clear explanation of these problems by the Commission. Does the Commission envisage possibilities for resolving the problems that have arisen with Israel within a reasonable time? I thank the Commissioner for his initial response and look forward to his second.</p>
<p class="contents">As the previous speaker remarked, this is indeed a measure that is neither for nor against Israel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are discussing the legality and legitimacy of products originating from entities, the settlements, which international law considers to be illegal. Established by military force in occupied territories, the withdrawal from which the European Union, the United Nations, the United States, and practically the entire international community consider to be essential in order to create a viable Palestinian State able to live in peace alongside the State of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue on which this debate is based, achieving correct application of the EC-Israel Association Agreement, I do not mind what is done nor how it is done and I do not mind what law is applied nor how. But it must be made clear that Israel cannot continue to unilaterally apply the Association Agreement to settlements which must disappear in order for peace to be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">To allow this to continue in a unilateral fashion would be another absurdity, an insult, a humiliation which this Parliament at least must combat.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the time, and nor do I have the time, to once again condemn the Sharon Government’s lack of political will to achieve peace. It is sufficient at this point to insist on the issue which we are dealing with this morning, and that is that the Israeli Government cannot issue proof of origin to products which, in accordance with Community law, are not eligible for preferential treatment as a result of originating from the colonies established in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember once again the Commission’s clear statement of 10 May 2001 that exports from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, within the framework of preferential treatment, are violations of the commercial agreements between the Community and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">If only for tactical reasons, it would do no harm to remember that on 10 April 2002 this Parliament approved a resolution on the Middle East, paragraph 8 of which calls on the Commission and the Council to suspend the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between Israel and the European Community.</p>

Under the Geneva Conventions the Occupied Territories are not part of Israel and, therefore, products from the settlements cannot be considered covered by this agreement. If the Commission is going to come forward with new plans – as it should – then it should do so before Parliament rises in June to give us time to scrutinise them properly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I agree with those who say that it is time to look at wider measures to do with suspending this EC-Israel association agreement, because that agreement contains an important human rights clause that states that if there are human rights abuses on either side of the agreement, then that agreement should be suspended. The EU prides itself on inserting these human rights clauses into trade agreements. However, if they are there we have to act on them – they have to be credible. Therefore it is time to suspend this agreement, because of not only the human rights abuses associated with the settlements but also those associated with the new apartheid wall, which has nothing to do with security and everything to do with an illegal land grab. It is destroying lives and livelihoods. If the EU does not suspend this agreement, it is guilty not only of an injustice to the Palestinian people but also of undermining its own laws and legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 4 September 2003, this House was already debating the proper application of the EC-Israel Association Agreement. On that occasion, I quoted the conclusion of the Dutch Foreign Minister that ‘in the case of most of the products that carry Israeli proof of origin, the Netherlands can assume that the conclusions by Israeli customs regarding their origin have been reached in a lawful manner. This means that they meet all the conditions of the rules of origin protocol’.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, I asked the Commission whether it could subscribe to this conclusion from the Hague for the other EU Member States too. No answer came at that time. Perhaps today’s representative of the Commission will be rather more forthcoming. I shall not lose heart, however, and shall ask a second question. Is the demanding of additional customs duties from importers of products presumably originating from Israeli settlements a unilateral policy? What is the Commission’s view on this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have no reason to doubt that the rule will be applied, but I do very much doubt whether this Parliament – or a minority within it – wishes to promote peace between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. I have always been convinced that, if we want peace, we cannot play at being the bad guys and constantly penalise one of the parties. If we want to have credibility, we should play positively, and if we want to replace or, at least, compensate for the influence of the United States – which many here talk about – over Israel, and if we want Israel to trust in Europe, what we cannot do is always seek to castigate.</p>
<p class="contents">If the occupied territories are soon – and we hope this is the case – going to pass into the hands of the Palestinian Authority, why leave them in ruins? Why ruin them? Because there is a lot of falseness here. The Palestinian area does have a preferential system, just like the Israeli area. The problem is that there is this contradiction, this illogicality, that this territory is both Palestinian and Israeli, as the Israelis believe.</p>
<p class="contents">We must seek points of agreement, we must seek peace. We must be credible to the Israeli people, and I do not believe we are going to achieve that through a ‘scorched earth policy’. Furthermore, with a policy of this type, subsequent investment by the Palestinians in order to incorporate these territories will be much greater. So I would repeat, why do we not seek points of agreement? Why does Europe not stretch out its hand to Israel? I must repeat that I do not understand why we do not do so.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission takes every opportunity to reach a satisfactory solution to ensure correct application of Community law and to protect the Community's own resources. That is why the Commission works in close cooperation with the customs authorities of Member States and maintains a constructive dialogue with the Israeli authorities. This approach is generating results; duties are being recovered on goods from the settlements. Somebody asked where the customs duties go. They go to the general revenue side of the Community budget. Israel is willing to cooperate to reach a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to remind you that EU policy towards Israel lies in partnership and cooperation. A specific question was raised about amendment of accumulation of origin. I want to reiterate the statement of the Association Council last November, recalling that in July 2003, at the third Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting, ministers endorsed a new protocol on rules of origin which allows the extension of the pan-European accumulation of origin to the Mediterranean countries. The next stage will be amendment of origin protocols in the current bilateral association agreements in order to insert the changes necessary for the application of diagonal accumulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly want to emphasise that the EU notes Israel's support for this project. The EU stresses the importance of solving the bilateral issue of rules of origin before the original protocol is amended. The EU's position is clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
