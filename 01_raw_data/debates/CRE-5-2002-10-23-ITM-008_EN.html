In addition, we must help the developing countries to develop effective strategies for the conservation of wild species.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, in September the Commission proposed guidelines for the Community with a view to the Conference in Santiago. Our proposal was based on respect for the scientific criteria that determine which appendix to CITES different species are listed in. These criteria also include the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to note that the Commission’s viewpoint differs only slightly from the views expressed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. The Commission agrees with the recommendations concerning cetaceans, freshwater and sea turtles and seahorses. I am also pleased that the Committee has decided to introduce a recommendation on the ratification of the Gabarone Amendment, which enables the Community to become a contracting party to CITES.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the inclusion of commercial fish species in the appendices provided that they meet the relevant criteria and that their management is not adequately regulated elsewhere at international level. In the light of this, I concur with your support for the inclusion of basking shark and whale shark in Appendix II to CITES.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s opinion on the proposal to include species of Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish in Appendix II is based on the same principle. I realise that there are important biological reasons for this proposal. At the same time, I am also aware that the exploitation of these species is currently regulated by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), to which the Community is a party. Even though it only covers a limited number of members, the catch documentation scheme introduced by CCAMLR contains provisions very similar to those of CITES. In my opinion, CITES listing should be supported if it has the potential to promote the implementation of this plan and encourage other countries to do the same. The Commission considers, however, that the proposal in its current wording will not bring about the achievement of this goal. I hope that agreement can be reached at the Conference on amendments to render the proposal more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also confirm that the Commission opposes the resumption of the commercial trade in ivory until it has been clearly demonstrated that this trade will not lead to greater protection of poachers or have a negative impact on the status of elephant populations. It has not been possible to draw conclusions on this matter from the evidence available up to now. It is therefore appropriate to choose a course of action based on the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, make a distinction between commercial trade in ivory and the question as to the most appropriate CITES list for the elephants to be entered in. It is undeniable that there is a large number of African elephants in several southern African countries, where the populations are currently covered by Appendix II. These populations are managed well and their numbers are increasing. Therefore, the proposal by Kenya and India to include all the African elephant populations in Appendix I is not justified on the basis of the relevant scientific criteria laid down in CITES. Rather than re-igniting the conflict, the Community should, to my way of thinking, try to find solutions which promote the preservation of the elephants over their whole distribution area, and which enjoy the support of all the states in this distribution area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to inform the European Parliament that, in addition to the points you raise in your resolution, a large number of further proposals has been presented to the organisers of the Conference, which would have positive consequences for the conservation of species and which have the support of the Commission. These include a proposal to include a species of true mahogany in the list in Appendix II and proposals on the improvement of CITES’ working methods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time and time again we find ourselves in a situation in which it seems that now is not the time to opt for biodiversity. Time and time again there are good reasons to abandon, for the time being, strict and specific measures for the protection of endangered species. This is the case now. I am talking specifically about African elephants.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are good reasons for not imposing a total ban on the ivory trade. Firstly, in accordance with scientific advice, the African elephant simply does not fulfil the criteria; the elephant population is growing and is healthy. Secondly, I am not convinced that a total ban would mean that poaching would cease. A ban might lead to a fuelling of illegal trade and push up the price. That will not help any elephant. Thirdly, the idea of the destruction of ivory meets with considerable resistance. Destruction goes against every notion of sustained use. Why should we have to destroy a natural, valued and valuable material such as ivory?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am convinced that protection does not work without commitment from the local authorities and local population. We can try and prescribe laws for others from our ivory towers here in Strasbourg. We can preach morals from our ivory pulpit, but we have to realise that it does not work like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Five countries in southern Africa have presented alternative plans. They have gained experience and have also had some success. We ought to take their arguments seriously at least. Conservation is not something that can be imposed by the international community, and we should not want that to be the case. There are, therefore, good reasons not to transfer the African elephant to Appendix I tomorrow. However there are also good reasons to do so, and that is sending a political signal. The signal that the European Parliament takes the protection of biodiversity seriously. That the European Parliament is now committing to going all out to preserve biodiversity within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I can reluctantly approve the resolution, but, as far as I am concerned, it must incorporate a political pledge – the pledge that we ourselves will also do something about biodiversity. That we must try to find a solution that will also work for the African peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Five countries in southern Africa want to sell their stocks of ivory. That would be very wrong. The previous CITES conferences took the decision to stop protecting the elephant. Unfortunately that was approved by the Commission with the majority of the fifteen EU governments, but against the wishes of the European Parliament. This has proved disastrous. Illegal elephant poaching is now taking place on a much bigger scale, also in southern Africa. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes unanimously to give elephants full protection once more. The Commission must abandon its cowardly, half-hearted position.</p>
<p class="contents">MIKE <span class="italic">(monitoring of illegal killing of elephants)</span> does not work. Let us use European money – EUR 10 to 15 million would be enough – to buy up and destroy southern Africa's ivory stocks, and if the majority of the European governments will not agree to that, then the NGOs will have to collect enough money to stop all the elephants being sold off. There are only 10 000 elephants left in Asia and 300 000 in Africa. Twenty years ago, in 1981, there were as many as 1 500 000. Whoever maintains that elephants are in a strong position is mistaken. I do not approve of the culling of elephants; it is uncivilised. I am curious to see who will vote for culling tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that has nothing to do with the fact that southern African elephants should not be moved back into Appendix I.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether you have seen the letter we received this week from the European Sustainable Use specialist group. It reminds us that such a decision would be directly contrary to the scientific advice given to the parties by IUCN, who are the official advisers to the CITES conference on species listing proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">This advice points out that the elephant populations of the southern African countries mentioned do not meet the criteria for Appendix I, but meet the criteria for Appendix II. So, scientifically we have absolutely no reason to move them. Nor should we if we want to maintain the populations because it is quite clear that the use of wild living resources, if they are sustainable – and they are in southern Africa – is an important conservation tool. The social and economic benefits derived from such use provide incentives for people to conserve them.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is, if we were to take them back into Appendix I, it would send the wrong signal to those countries that have a small elephant population. It would say to them that if they try to invest money in preserving their elephants, they will not get back any revenue. So they will pay out for the elephants, instead of paying for schools or hospitals. What kind of incentive to preserve elephants does that give to countries with small elephant populations?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that more of you were not at the presentation by the Minister of Wildlife and Tourism of Botswana. She said that they loved their elephants. They want to preserve them and the way they can best do this is to keep them in Appendix II. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The <span class="italic">Dissostichus</span> is of great commercial value (it is known as ‘black gold’) and its balance is very delicate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries, of which I am a member, has produced three reports on this resource and I am rapporteur for the one which relates to the creation of a system for documenting catches.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I would like to argue to the House that it should not be included on the CITES list, for the following reasons: we cannot forget that there is already an international organisation – the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which from now on I will refer to by its initials, CAMELAR – which, for twenty years, has been successfully dealing with the preservation of this and other species in the Antarctic Ocean. The Community is a contracting party to this Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to include <span class="italic">Dissostichus</span> in the CITES Convention did not come from us but from Australia. Neither we nor – as far as I know – the Commission oppose this; we simply believe that it would be more useful for CAMELAR itself to take this decision at its annual assembly, which is taking place this week and next week in Chile, and in which the European Parliament will be represented by Mr Stevenson, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Following tough negotiations, CAMELAR has now incorporated Canada and Mauritius with the status of associate members. Together with the United States, Canada is the main commercial destination of the species <span class="italic">Dissostichus</span> and Mauritius, a significant place of transit. Their entry into CAMELAR gives this international organisation control of 98% of the world trade in <span class="italic">Dissostichus</span>. For us, CITES would be useful as a complement to CAMELAR. But we must be cautious, because – if our decision-making moves faster than the natural course of events – we could unintentionally cause unwanted contrary effects, weakening an organisation that, during its long life, has done a great amount of good work with regard to the Antarctic marine environment, which is extremely delicate.</p>
<p class="contents">We must concentrate our efforts, not disperse them, and we must increase our presence in multilateral fisheries organisations, which is the only way to respond to the challenges that the preservation of fish species confront us with on a world scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we move elephants back into Appendix I, at the request of India and Kenya, will this be enough to prevent these animals from tragically becoming extinct in some countries of Africa, even though their numbers are on the increase in other countries? Opinions are divided.</p>
<p class="contents">The MIKE system that has been set up, which is highly sophisticated, has not yet provided, and will not provide, according to a number of specialists, a satisfactory answer. It has, in fact, absorbed a substantial amount of funding which could have been put to better use, had it, for example, been spent on ways to combat poaching or on the training of keepers.</p>
<p class="contents">Elephants are poached for their ivory and their natural habitat has been considerably altered and reduced. Even if their use is authorised, whatever the precise and restrictive framework that might be decided upon, there is a danger that poaching will once again become widespread and that this, in the long term, will led to elephants becoming extinct in some countries of Africa. The European Union must therefore very firmly reject any unlawful resumption of the trade in ivory.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, what lesson could we have to give the local populations who would levy a reasonable tax on their fauna, when we ourselves, in France for example, are incapable of providing adequate conditions for the survival of bears in the Pyrenees or rare wolves in the Alps?</p>
<p class="contents">By way of comparison, we welcome the gesture made by Cuba, which has withdrawn its request for the use of turtles and, in parallel, the European Union has a duty to reject the request, submitted by the Cayman Islands to breed green turtles in captivity, which could facilitate the illegal trade in these animals. The desire and the need to safeguard biodiversity on the planet requires the adoption of tough and proactive decisions which must not allow any loophole for traffickers of any kind, whilst enabling the local populations to use their natural resources, including fauna, in a sustainable manner, even if this may sometimes be akin to attempting the impossible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, I would like to reassure you that the Commission remains opposed to any measures that could increase the illegal killing of elephants. I have already stated that we are opposed to the resumption of the commercial ivory trade until it can be demonstrated that this will not lead to an increase in poaching.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I acknowledge the excellent record of a number of southern African countries in managing their elephant populations. It is easy to understand why these countries sometimes feel they are penalised rather than rewarded for their efforts. If their concerns are not addressed, there is a real risk that these countries will be unable to maintain popular support for elephant conservation or for CITES in general. We should avoid measures such as the proposed stricter classification for elephants in CITES which will only serve to polarise the debate, without achieving any real additional protection for these animals.</p>
<p class="contents">On toothfish, we must respect the competence of CAMLAR and other fisheries organisations, at the same time taking a constructive approach to any proposals that might achieve better protection for commercial fish species. Accordingly, if CITES listing can strengthen and complement CAMLAR's current management of toothfish you may rest assured that it will have my support and that of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
