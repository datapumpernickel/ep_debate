<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lindh,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, almost half a year ago, I addressed Parliament for the first time on the subject of the Swedish Presidency’s goals. Since then we have had an in-depth and constructive discussion on future issues for Europe, the three “E’s” of Enlargement, Employment, Environment, openness and reforms, crisis management and conflict prevention, the future, democracy, development and human rights. Unfortunately, I must express my regret that Parliament has postponed the debate which we were to have had today on human rights, which was an important priority for the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues surrounding the future of Europe will naturally also come up at the European Council in Gothenburg. First, I would like to say something about enlargement – Europe’s historic undertaking and most important issue for the future. The credibility of the entire European Union rests on the completion of our work programme which, six months ago, was seen to be highly ambitious, by some even unrealistic. EU Common Positions have been adopted on all nine chapters which made up the Swedish Presidency’s road map, including several difficult issues such as the free movement of people, acquisition of property and, especially, the environment. We have been able to complete the chapter on the free movement of people with two applicant countries and on movement of capital with seven applicant countries. The environmental chapter has been completed with no fewer than four applicant countries. We can therefore talk about real breakthroughs in the negotiations. The whole internal market area has fallen into place. The four freedoms, fundamental to the EU, can now be implemented with a couple of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also laid a sound foundation regarding central issues such as nuclear safety, food safety and land transport and completed chapters which were actually to be dealt with in the autumn according to our road map. We will be holding open negotiations in all areas with some of the countries which started negotiating last year. As such, we can confirm the principle of differentiation. Each applicant country is assessed on its own merits and controls the pace of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We held ministerial meetings with all the applicant countries on Monday and Tuesday. They were all very pleased with the progress achieved during the negotiations. At the same time, we could see clear concern among them following the referendum in Ireland. Naturally, I and many others are disappointed with the referendum result there, but it is therefore even more important that the work on ratifying the Treaty of Nice progresses, as it is the very foundation for the enlargement negotiations. It is also that much more important that the membership negotiations with the applicant countries are taken forward without any let up in the pace. The uncertainty which the referendum may have caused and spread to the applicant countries must be dealt with by our showing even more clearly that enlargement will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress we have seen during negotiations with the applicant countries would not have been possible if these countries had not implemented major reforms and put a great deal of work into meeting our requirements. It could make and of course is making pro-EU governments even more open to populist attack if there is a sense that enlargement is about to stall.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must draw three conclusions following Nice. Firstly, the Gothenburg Summit must give a clear signal that enlargement will move forward. Secondly, we all have a responsibility to send a clear message that the Treaty of Nice will be implemented and ratification will continue in other countries. Thirdly, we must all become better at making our citizens feel more connected with the EU. On this matter, we can also use the debate on the future of Europe to open up a general debate on Europe, and we all have a responsibility in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed the issues for the future here in Parliament most recently on 30 May. I would just like to add that the report for Gothenburg describes all the initiatives from Member States, applicant countries and institutions, especially Parliament’s resolution of 31 May. With regard to the continuing process, we can also state that many people are in favour of a convention in the preparatory stage. Many are also of the opinion that such a convention should be combined with other measures. This is also Sweden’s view, and we should like to be able to highlight this direction in Gothenburg. However, the exact make-up must be dealt with in Laeken.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Gothenburg, we will also be addressing the Swedish Presidency’s third “E”: Environment. We will be taking some important steps to adapt EU policy to ecological development, sustainable in the long term, by establishing concrete targets, concrete measures and an effective monitoring process. In this respect, we will be building further on the Commission report which proposes, for example, measures against climate change and health risks and for responsible handling of natural resources and improved transport systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is, in fact, the only global power able to push forward environmental issues and sustainable development globally. It is therefore also natural for climate issues and the Kyoto Protocol to be brought up at the Summit with the US president in Gothenburg, which we will be doing. At the same time, we know that if we are to be able to play a leading global role, we also have to put our own house in order.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also true of other international issues on which the EU is now developing its instruments and becoming increasingly coordinated in its action in order to be able to exert influence.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, the common European security and defence policy, ESDP, is one of our most important processes. Conflict prevention, civil crisis management and military crisis management are all brought together into a single unit. We are adding to the positive development of the military area by also expanding civil crisis management with police, in the judicial area and with civil administration. We have also developed work on preventing armed conflict. The Gothenburg Summit will receive a report on progress within the ESDP and a European programme for conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">In this work, the UN is our most important partner. At a working lunch with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in May, we identified a number of priorities for cooperation in conflict prevention and crisis management in which our growing military and civil capacity will constitute a major contribution to the UN. We are strengthening our cooperation in the field through joint fact finding missions and cooperation between special representatives. The Balkans, the Middle East and Africa are particular priorities. Naturally, we are also developing cooperation with NATO, which we have been able to see especially in the current crises in Macedonia and Southern Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">In Gothenburg, we will also be discussing important foreign policy issues, including the Middle East where the EU has been highly active. Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson has visited the region and High Representative Javier Solana has made a large number of consultation visits and is expected to present a road map for the EU’s continued involvement and work in the Middle East at the Gothenburg Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be discussing the Western Balkans, where developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, continue to cause concern. On the Presidency’s behalf and in cooperation with Mr Solana, we have been active in keeping the coalition government together, isolating extremists, keeping the reform process for improving the status and rights of minorities going and continuing rapprochement with the EU. However, as we all know, the situation remains critical.</p>
<p class="contents">In Southern Serbia, developments are more positive. This is also an example of the way we can deal with conflicts through close cooperation between the EU and NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">We are approaching the end of our Presidency, but we have a great deal left to do and hope to take decisive steps at the Gothenburg Summit – on enlargement, jobs and the environment and the EU’s global role. We intend to be proactive and know that, in all the issues which we discuss, we will need the active support of Parliament.</p>

There are many items on the agenda but I intend to focus on just two of them: enlargement and sustainable development. However, another very important subject will also be discussed in Gothenburg: the outcome of the referendum held by the Republic of Ireland on the ratification of the Nice Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Two days ago, the General Affairs Council discussed this matter and the 14 Member States adopted a statement. I would like to make a few brief remarks on the subject. While not wishing in any way to interfere in the sovereign decisions of the Irish people, I am personally deeply saddened by the outcome of the referendum. However, the enlargement process must not be held up. As I will say again in a few minute's time, it is a historical and political necessity. The Commission will therefore continue to do its full duty to achieve this goal. Nevertheless, there is a political lesson to be learned.</p>
<p class="contents">Every referendum tells a story. However, despite the fact that the poor turnout makes it difficult to interpret the result, it cannot be denied that, in freely expressing their will, the Irish people have reminded us once again that our fellow citizens do not understand our method for revising the Treaties – the method used at Nice – and no longer want it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">They have told us so in the most democratic way possible – by voting – but they have also told us so by not voting, revealing the indifference and confusion they feel about the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough to repeat, for the umpteenth time, that we need to communicate more and better with the citizens of Europe and that the real issues are often distorted or misunderstood. That is not the point. We need to take on board the lesson the citizens are teaching us. I am therefore pleased to hear that Minister Lindh does not intend to propose a repeat performance of <span class="italic">cliques</span> of advisers and governments meeting behind closed doors at Gothenburg. It is imperative that we stop this way of working.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, at Laeken, we must lose no time in marking out the only way forward acceptable to our citizens, which is to set up a structure which is representative of the States and the elected members of both national and European parliaments: a Convention which will work on revising the Treaties openly, in the clear light of day, fully reflecting the great debate which is now taking place in all the Member States. We have been starting to talk about Europe again – I am glad to say – for six months now: let us do it properly! The Commission is ready to make an active contribution to this structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now return to my two original topics: sustainable development and enlargement. I would like to outline what I hope the Summit will achieve in these two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, sustainable development. At Gothenburg, the Heads of State and Government will discuss a new policy line based on the Commission proposal, which represents a radical shift in our way of thinking. Indeed, it uses the Lisbon strategy to create an ambitious, yet achievable process for sustainable development. Our proposal is based on the premise that sustainable development is not just about the environment but about ensuring that economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection progress hand in hand. Far from being contradictory, economic, social and environmental objectives are actually complementary. This is the core of the European model of society which we want to build and preserve for future European generations: if we do not do this it will be difficult to integrate Europe. Our proposal brings these objectives together in a single, integrated strategy that seeks to find long-term solutions to the issues which are of real concern to our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you just a few examples of what we want to achieve at Gothenburg. As regards social policy, our proposed strategy incorporates all the targets set by the previous European Councils – at Lisbon and Stockholm – targets to modernise the social security system, to combat poverty and social exclusion and to deal with the problem of our ageing society.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards climate change, our aim is not simply to implement Kyoto but to go beyond it. This will be a long-term process which cannot be decided all at once, but the line we are to take must be clear and consistent right from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards agricultural policy, we unambiguously restate the European Union's latest objectives, focusing now on high quality, healthy food production rather than quantity. Our aim must be to satisfy consumers while, at the same time, taking full account of farmers' interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards transport policy, we intend to break the link between economic growth and the indiscriminate growth in road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement makes action on all these fronts all the more urgent and every single citizen must be involved in making the changes happen. The Members of this House have a vital role to play here: you have local roots and have close links with the regional and local authorities that will be primarily responsible for implementing sustainable development policy on the ground. You are therefore in the ideal, crucial position to be able to explain and discuss the initiatives and to facilitate their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy for sustainable development is essential if we are to bring about a balanced, just society in Europe. We Europeans – and I would stress this – are right to be proud of our social model, although we do seem to have lost the thread rather in recent years have ceased to be proud of it, but this may well be a reason why we need to modernise it so that it will work for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the future of our planet depends on sustainable global development, and the best way for the European Union to promote this is to implement our proposals and lead by example. Even the other continents look to us, although this may not always be apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to my second subject: enlargement. I have never ceased to stress that enlargement is our historic duty: the duty of my Commission, of course, but also, in my view, the duty of Parliament. It must happen now for the time is ripe. The single market, the introduction of the euro, the now tangible fruit of the reform of our public finances and the progress we are making in economic and social reform all combine to make this a very opportune moment for enlargement. We must therefore make every effort to complete the process swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is conducting the accession negotiations responsibly and rigorously, fulfilling its mandate from the Council. Its impartial, institutional role ensures that the process is not thrown off course by short-term political considerations. We are keeping to the principles of differentiation and progress according to merit, allowing countries that began negotiating in 2000 to catch up with those that began earlier. We are scrupulously following the road map drawn up last year and endorsed at Nice, and I am pleased to report that excellent progress has been made. Moreover, I am truly grateful to the Swedish Presidency for the impetus it has given to these negotiations and for the contribution it has made to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The road map is therefore appropriate and must be continued. Thus, I have every reason to believe that we will succeed in concluding negotiations with the best-prepared candidates by the end of 2002 and complete ratification in time for the European elections in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gothenburg Council should therefore note our progress and lay down the necessary guidelines for completing the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The most sensitive chapters are now open. Basically, there are four of them: the environment, the free movement of persons, capital and services, the Structural Funds and agriculture. I have listed them in ascending order of the difficulties they pose. These are undoubtedly complex areas, but it is now clear that, in some cases, transitional periods will help to overcome some of the difficulties. The Commission is therefore ready to propose the necessary technical solutions and the necessary political compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed now is flexibility on the part of all the negotiators and a strong political commitment to reaching agreement even in the most sensitive areas. Flexibility and good sense now appear to be the qualities we most need on both sides of the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the need for public support is clear. Enlargement will increase the Union's population by 30%. It will also be a much more diverse Union in many ways, and it will share extensive borders with large countries such as Russia and Ukraine. Many of our fellow citizens are apprehensive about how all this will affect their daily lives – about its impact on employment, the environment, immigration and law and order. The Members of this House have the crucial task of reassuring the citizens, explaining the problems calmly and objectively but also explaining the great benefits they will draw from the project to unify Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will be the driving force of our economy and the labour market for the whole of the next generation. It will also be our one means of controlling the scourges that disregard national borders such as organised crime and the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings. Together, we can do more and do it better. The enlarged Union will be a stronger and more influential actor on the world's stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is not just a technical process and we must never allow ourselves to become so engrossed in the technicalities that we lose the overall vision. The vision of the Europe that our children and grandchildren can inherit is a common future in a Union which will stretch from the Atlantic Ocean to the Black Sea, from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean. But this is not all. I want us to think in terms of a continent-wide Community of peaceful nations, consisting of the enlarged European Union and all its new neighbours, increasingly sharing common values and objectives. This is not just a dream: the process has already begun, facilitated, as I said, by the Swedish Presidency's major contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">In Moscow, last month, the leaders of the Russian Federation and the European Union agreed to begin work on creating a common European economic area. They began to examine the real possibility of adopting the euro, in the future, for their commercial and financial transactions. We intend, at the same time, to pursue a similar strategy towards Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the enlarged European Union and its neighbours will be able to find common solutions to common problems in areas such as transport, energy and the environment, research, development, immigration and the fight against organised crime. Only a wider Community of the kind we are building can enjoy lasting peace, prosperity and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, enlargement and sustainability are thus the two keys to Europe's future. I am confident that you share my vision of that future and I am equally confident that Gothenburg will enable us to take significant steps towards making that vision a reality.</p>

Because of the referendum in Ireland, the summit in Gothenburg will be even more important than we thought it would. As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we think that, because of the present uncertainties, because of the confusion, because the central European countries are worried about their membership, the message to come out of Gothenburg must be that the central European countries are welcome in the European Union and that the enlargement of the European Union is now our top priority. And we must say as much, loud and clear, to the people of central Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our group has long favoured the first new countries' being able to take part in the next European elections in 2004, and rightly so. We must send out this message. We must also be flexible. We are currently debating the Structural Funds. Some people want to keep everything they had in the past. Others want to do away with the Structural Funds altogether. The PPE-DE Group believes that those most in need deserve our solidarity, which is why we shall continue to need the Structural Funds in the future and why they must focus on the countries in the future European Union which are worst off. Solidarity should not just be a slogan; it should be manifested in the form of specific deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday I had a most impressive conversation, together with numerous colleagues from my group, with Bishop Alfons Nossol from Oppeln, formerly in Silesia and now part of Poland. A minority of 300 000 people live there. Since the demise of Communism in Poland, this minority has been able to worship in both their own and the Polish language. These people in Poland, like the Hungarians in Slovakia or Romania, are looking towards Europe, hoping that we will not slam the door to our community of values in the European Union in their face and that we shall say: you are welcome, provided that you have set up the conditions needed by our community of values.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We also need to be flexible when it comes to freedom of movement, so that we do not create structures which are offensive to the central European countries. Naturally, we need solutions that serve the interests of the European Union, but they must also be in the interests of the candidate countries. I suggest that we make an effort to guarantee the flexibility needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to Ireland. I think we should guard against meting out swift advice to Ireland. It is up to the Irish government now to show the way forward. In particular, I urge the larger Member States of the European Union, which have often erred in the past by thinking they could dictate to the small Member States, to hold back to start with and at least let Ireland respond. Then we shall see what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, you said – and it was music to my ears – that the Swedish presidency is now in favour of a convention. We have come a long way together. But please fight for it, especially if you fail to muster complete support. Of course, the decisions will be taken under the Belgian presidency. But if you are in favour of openness and transparency and two or three governments voice their opposition, name them openly so that they are forced to justify their opposition.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The American president, George Bush, will be in Gothenburg. Our group values partnership and friendship with America. We greet the American president and welcome him to Europe. But having numerous common interests does not mean that we do not have differing views on several counts. I urge you, Madam President-in-Office, and of course you too, Mr President of the Commission, to state in a measured but decisive manner that we Europeans want the Kyoto protocol and the reduction of emissions to be a success. We urge you to represent this position clearly.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Noise, heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But I also say – one fellow member is famous for his heckling and I accept it gladly – that we do of course expect solidarity between Europeans and I am proud of the fact that it is our group, the governments which belong to us, which will be clearly expressing European solidarity in Gothenburg tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Were it any other way, you would hear our voice. But, with your leave, Madam President, one last word. The American president is right on one count when it comes to reducing emissions. If nuclear energy is safe, it cannot be excluded from a reasonable energy mix. That is why he is right on this count. We do not think that nuclear energy, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, should be universally disparaged on ideological grounds, unlike numerous Socialist and other members.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to close by saying that it is developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which concern us most at present. Madam President-in-Office, I urge you to continue your efforts, as you have in the past with Mr Solana and Mr Patten, to bring about a peaceful solution. We cannot afford to fail here, and the fact that today's visit by the president of Macedonia, of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been called off should set the alarm bells ringing here.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you to continue in your efforts to bring about peace, because if we are successful here, it will be a success for the European Union as a whole and a contribution towards a peaceful, free Europe. Please help to bring it about.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her assessment of the Swedish Presidency. Sweden has proved herself and her Presidency has been successful in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that you have acted transparently, graciously and amicably towards Parliament. With you, we have been able to begin to update our relations with the Council, which were still at the level of the Single European Act – I am referring to codecision and the presence of the Council in plenary sittings – I believe that this should be welcomed as a positive step in our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, I regret that lack of time has meant that we have not been able to hold the debate on human rights today, but, in any event, human rights are a permanent element of our political commitment. I would especially like to highlight the progress made in relation to sustainable development and in the social field, one very important element of which has been, after twenty years, to unblock the directive on information and the participation of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Gothenburg Summit, we are all reeling from the shock of the Irish referendum, which is a significant wake-up call.</p>
<p class="contents">The French National Assembly yesterday ratified the Treaty of Nice. France has always been a very colourful and controversial country, but this ratification has not attracted our attention. However, in the case of Ireland, I believe that two issues arise which we must examine. The current members of the Union and those of the enlarged Union, because that is now our perspective, must re-affirm the terms in which we see our common destiny. This means, as from the beginning of this European Union process, that we have to find a balance between our interests – or if you like, our egotism – and solidarity between all of us. I believe that that is what is in question and that is what we have to address very directly to all the Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on behalf of my Group, I have asked the President of the Commission for a Commission statement on economic and social cohesion and enlargement. Because it is not simply a question of discussing whether the Structural Funds are maintained for some and not for others, but rather of finding out, firstly, how we can all contribute, and the President of the Commission has recently talked about the suitability of a European tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The people pay, but they do not know what they are paying and it would be a good thing, from a democratic point of view, to relate funding to citizenship. Then we would have to consider how we can strengthen cohesion and solidarity between all of us on the basis of the principles in the Treaties. I believe that this requires the Commission to participate, by exercising its responsibility and its right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will refer to the conclusions which you have presented to the Council. In my relatively long political experience within the European Union, this is the first time that we have proposed conclusions to the Council which the normal citizen can read, because they are generally written in what the French call <span class="italic">langue de bois</span>, a totally cryptic style. The proposal of the French Presidency does justice to what the European Parliament has said, to what the COSAC has said, and there is explicit support for the convention method – you are prudent and talk about a ‘forum’. However, in any event, I would like to say that if you see to it that we make progress in this direction, I believe that we can finally put an end to negotiation behind closed doors and move on to the democratic method by means of which all the constitutions of the Member States of the European Union are created, that is to say, openly and publicly, which, at this point in history, means via the Internet and the television. That is how things are done.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Madam President, I hope that you will make sure that the approach taken at the Gothenburg Summit, and consolidated at Laeken, will be one on which the European Parliaments, those of the Member States, the Governments and the Commission can all work together. In that way we will be able to engage all of our people.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like to make a final comment about the visit of President Bush. The transatlantic relationship is a constitutional relationship, which is fundamental to both the United States and Europe and, indeed, to the whole world. Now, we cannot hide our profound differences at the moment, which relate not only to the value of international commitments at world level, but to combating such an important factor as climate change. We can make appeals for solidarity, but I would ask Mr Poettering to work with the current and future governments of his family, because it is not they who are supporting a united European position.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the anti-missile shield, to build new missiles can only lead to a return of the arms race. In this respect also I would ask Mr Poettering to speak with his political friends in the governments in order to achieve a process of reducing tension, which is essential to the future of humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group I should like to begin by acknowledging and congratulating the minister on the considerable number of actual results achieved by the Swedish presidency already, even before it formally concludes its work. In particular, you are to be congratulated on the work and enthusiasm that you have put into the enlargement issue. Your approach has been a breath of fresh air and will, I hope, reassure the candidate countries that we are indeed serious about this issue and have demonstrated as much during the Swedish presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I also acknowledge and salute the defence which you, together with the European Commission, have mounted on the climate-change issue. It is important that, in the transatlantic dialogue, we continue to champion the values and the desire for sustainability that we all share and believe in. Your personal efforts and the work with the High Representative, Commissioner Patten and others, particularly in Macedonia, where the situation remains so explosive and difficult, show impressive commitment towards pressing ahead with a common foreign and security policy. All of these areas and, of course, the work you have undertaken with the European Parliament on enhancing transparency, should be recognised as matters of importance and substance.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge, of course, as you have reported, the heightened anxieties of the representatives of the candidate countries following the Irish "no" to Nice. It is very important for me to state here today, particularly as an Irish European, that whatever the complex set of motives and reasons behind it, the "no" to Nice did not signify a "no" to enlargement. Neither the "no" campaign nor the "yes" campaign made an issue of enlargement. Indeed, it could be helpful before Göteborg – if it has not already done so – for the Irish "no" campaign as a whole to issue a single joint statement making it clear that their "no" campaign was not pushing for a "no" to enlargement. I would encourage the minister to continue working towards a reassuring timetable in Göteborg. Perhaps the shock of the Irish result will motivate those who a week or two ago were wondering whether this was necessary. It has become more necessary now to reassure, act and deliver on the enlargement agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Irish result, I should like to make one or two detailed comments. Members may be interested to learn that 50 000 fewer people in the Irish electorate voted "no" to Nice than voted "no" to Amsterdam. The number of "no" voters in Ireland has not grown. The critical question in Ireland is this: why did those who would normally have voted "yes" stay at home? That is a serious issue. Yet the number of "no" votes was smaller than before, not larger, and so in this regard we should retain a sense of proportion.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Irish Government is now going to establish a national forum on Europe to encourage everyone to reflect sensibly on the challenge, the message and the means of reconnecting people with the European vision. After that there will eventually be a second referendum. It is important that we have this period of deep reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">I take note of what has been said in the General Affairs Council, namely that the Council will continue with the ratification process. Indeed, paradoxically, the Danish instrument of ratification of Nice will be lodged in Rome today; the French, as we have heard, have also ratified the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in Göteborg the Council will find the wisdom lacking in the statement of the General Affairs Council to include the European Commission in the search for a way forward. In Ireland the Commission is regarded as an honest broker – someone who can always help when there are delicate textual and substantial political issues to be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the real message that must emerge from Göteborg before all others – the first among equals of messages – should be clearly addressed to the candidate countries, and say: we are ready to do business. I would ask the President-in-Office to continue to champion this issue and emphasise it consistently in Göteborg, especially with a view to enabling the Irish to say "yes" to enlargement there.</p>

I also welcome chairman Barón Crespo’s small penance, when he regretted that this discussion could not take place today. This is a very great pity as I know that Sweden is very dedicated to human rights policy and now this opportunity to enter into dialogue with Sweden has unfortunately passed.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, to my group Gothenburg is above all a summit on sustainable development. We have waited for this for a long time and we do not want to lose this opportunity. The theme of sustainable development must not be overshadowed by a prominent guest but must now be taken seriously. In this context I must make a personal confession. I was a little impatient when the Commission did not seem to be preparing its own proposal on sustainable development and in conjunction with the Stockholm Summit I said that President of the Commission Romano Prodi was ecologically illiterate. Now I have to take back that statement as I have got to know the President of the Commission’s ideas on sustainable development and consider them to be very valuable. He is proposing binding targets and he is ready to commit to binding action in order, for example, to break the link between economic growth and growth in traffic. But unfortunately there is a risk that the summit will not be able to achieve this, i.e. set quantitative targets. Here I am perhaps a little disappointed with the efforts of Sweden as the holder of the presidency, which could have taken things further.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kyoto Protocol is absolutely the key issue in Gothenburg. I welcome the fact that President of the Commission Romano Prodi wishes to hold a discussion which already looks at the period after the goals of Kyoto have been achieved. I disagree entirely with Mr Poettering, when he says that nuclear power must be included in the range of options. There is no more out-of-date technology than this and I would like to warn against nuclear power enjoying a second coming in the guise of climate policy. My group says a definitive no to this trend. We want to focus on the alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is also on the agenda at Gothenburg and my group would certainly like to emphasise that enlargement must continue irrespective of the result of the Irish referendum. It must be clearly stated and signalled to the candidate countries that the Irish people in no way wanted to reject enlargement. In my opinion, the result of the Irish referendum cannot, however, be ignored by thinking that we can continue as if nothing has happened. Instead it should be taken as a clear signal that the European Union must be democratised and citizens must be able to take part in drawing up constitutional issues. These can no longer be addressed behind closed doors. For this reason, we must make haste in adopting this convention model so that we are able to reach decisions on it before Laeken. This means that candidate countries too must be able to be fully included in this process. We need more democracy, more referendums, and more participation not less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet it is possible to make a few comments on it without too much risk of being mistaken.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the official reactions to this bombshell, which took all the leading European figures by surprise. In Luxembourg this Monday, the ministers apparently devoted half an hour or so to this event, which one of them described as merely a hiccup. That is what I would call burying one’s head in the sand. Surely the minister must realise that this rejection represents a new and serious symptom of the crisis that is profoundly undermining European integration. Nearly three quarters of the Irish population said ‘yes’ to the Community when their country joined in 1972 and today the same proportion is refusing to say ‘yes’ to the EU Treaty of Nice – yet the national and European leaders did not even see it coming.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a problem that looms far larger than Nice and Ireland. There were other warnings of the Irish ‘no’, in particular the growing rate of abstention in nearly all the EU countries at the European elections. In my view, and this is my second comment, that ‘no’ vote is first and foremost the price of building Europe without the citizens and at a distance from them. Where are the wide-ranging public and pluralist debates, at which everyone lays their cards on the table, on the issues at stake, the difficulties to be overcome, the values to be upheld and, finally, on the political choices that need to be made completely transparently and democratically?</p>
<p class="contents">There is one example that has a direct bearing on what happened in Ireland. At the summit, the states concocted, at breakneck speed, a defence Europe with imprecisely defined missions and which public opinion, in general, regards as unlikely to be independent. They often glorified this new achievement in tones that the neutral countries in particular, although others too, perceived as militaristic. So this backlash is hardly surprising. The same applies in other areas, especially the economic and social area.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we to think of those leaders of the richest countries who nonchalantly cultivate the net contributor syndrome and raise the spectre of the renationalisation of agricultural aid and the Structural Funds, thereby fuelling the pernicious ‘each for himself’ trend? At the same time, the federalist overstatement of the ongoing institutional debate has played its part in creating confusion in countries that want to protect their place, their role and their identity in a future large complex of which they can perceive neither the nature nor the contours. Added to that, there is the less than engaging spectacle that the Fifteen offered the public in Nice, so that it is not surprising to find a general feeling of disenchantment if not the return of a populist and inward-looking trend.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my third and final comment on a question everyone is asking: what should we do now? First, in my view, we must respect the rules of democracy. Whether we like it or not, the Treaty has not been ratified unanimously and we will have to make some improvements to it. Next, this time we would do well to hold an in-depth debate with the citizens of all our countries on the kind of Europe to build and on the political, institutional and financial implications of our decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must not let our opponents, who are ashamed of enlargement, use this crisis as a pretext to defer to an unknown date this pan-European project that is potentially great and splendid, but is obviously also complex and costly. Here too, we need a responsible debate so that we can evaluate, in the clear light of day, the conditions under which we can all succeed. Just as there can be no ambition without effort, there can be no European project without solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European leaders in Göteborg will address two primary subjects, namely the enlargement of the European Union and how best to solve many of our environmental problems. With regard to enlargement, it is most important that the European Union and the applicant countries get down to negotiating the more difficult chapters, which to date have remained closed. It is in the interest of all the contracting parties that the bottom-line issues that remain outstanding are debated, resolved and finalised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few comments concerning the outcome of the recent Irish referendum, that was held on the Nice Treaty. I am very disappointed at the result of this referendum in Ireland but I fully respect the outcome of this democratic process. I welcome the conclusions of this week's Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers; they too stated that the will of the Irish people must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that the vast majority of the Irish people are committed to the enlargement process and I do not want to see the timeframe for the enlargement of the European Union to include countries from Eastern and Central Europe delayed as a direct consequence of the decision of the Irish people last week. In Ireland we need time now to reflect upon this result in a calm and reasoned manner. Ireland's future relationship with the European Union is a critically important matter. Time for deliberation will be needed if we are to address the complex issues and concerns which arose during the referendum debate.</p>
<p class="contents">This referendum undoubtedly underlines the need for greater efforts to be made by all of us to explain European Union policies to our citizens and to involve the citizens of the EU more thoroughly in the debate about the Union's role and its future direction. There are lessons for us all to learn from the results of the Nice Treaty referendum. It is incumbent on the Commission and all the 15 governments of the Union also to reflect upon this result. We must build a European Union that commands the good will and support and enthusiasm of the 370 million citizens who make up the membership of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the decision of the Irish Government, which last night established a national forum on Europe. This forum will undertake the process of consultation and dialogue on EU policy with the Irish public on matters of concern to them. This forum is also part of the debate on the overall future of Europe that is ongoing in all 15 Member States of the European Union in the run-up to the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. All political parties, the social partners and other interested parties will be represented on this forum, which is expected to begin its work very shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Another very important matter is that Mr Bush, the President of the United States, will be in Göteborg later this week to meet EU leaders. It is very timely, therefore, that this summit will be addressing key environmental issues which need to be tackled, both within the Union and in a more global context. I was very disappointed when President Bush earlier this year stated that he wanted to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord. The fact of the matter is that we need to reduce the level of greenhouse gases that are being produced in Europe and in the United States. This is very important if we are to ensure a halt to the depletion of the ozone layer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU countries have jointly and unanimously decided upon the ground rules which clearly state that a treaty only comes into force once it has been ratified by all the Member States. Following the Irish ‘no’ vote, Ireland cannot and should not ratify the Treaty of Nice.’ How can the foreign ministers simply let the ratifications continue? The Treaty of Nice has come to nothing. It is a constitutional violation to ignore a binding referendum, and it is contrary to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union concerning the principle of the rule of law. We call upon all countries at least to take a break from the ratification procedure and to reflect upon the reasons for the ‘no’ vote. It was not, of course, a specifically Irish ‘no’. We would also see a majority of ‘no’ votes in other countries, if the latter dared to hold referenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice is not, at heart, about enlargement but about shifting power from electors and elected representatives to officials and ministers. Why should the electorate vote in favour of less influence? Nor has the European Parliament been fulsome in its praise for Nice. The initial judgement of the voters is: Try again! Next time, the negotiations must be bottom-up instead of top-down. The Irish ‘no’ vote was presented in the press as a ‘no’ to enlargement, even though the ‘no’ side too had said that the enlargement negotiations should continue. Five countries may be admitted under the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the next group of countries on the basis of the places and number of votes stated in the Summit declaration. The Treaty of Nice is only relevant to the 27th applicant country, and we are deprived of the right to a Commissioner. There is nothing else about enlargement in the Treaty. The declaration is a common position and not a part of the Treaty, and it has not therefore been thrown out in the referendum. Let us now, rather, slim down the EU and create open, democratic cooperation that is close to the people. I congratulate the Irish people on a courageous ‘no’ vote and call upon the Gothenburg Summit to respect the people’s choice instead of ignoring a referendum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the environment: the Radical Party has been raising the matter of the greenhouse effect, the hole in the ozone layer and the related dangers for over 15 years now. We feel that it is especially important that this matter is tackled resolutely and thoroughly in Gothenburg – as the Swedish Presidency intends to do – in the presence of President Bush as well. Parliament will express its opinion later on and we shall see the political groupings going to the defence of the Kyoto Protocol. We feel that it would, if necessary, still be possible to look into improving and fine-tuning the approach and objectives to be followed in order to avoid breaking the ties with our American allies, although they are the primary polluters of the planet, but we must certainly not give in to the temptation to perform further studies. There is nothing left to analyse: studies have been carried out and they show that the planet is in danger and that it is therefore necessary to act and do so quickly. The European countries should therefore put their hands on their hearts too and turn words into action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also, Madam President, like to talk about transparency. You have attached great importance to transparency, and so I have two questions. The Irish referendum has shown that the system is absurd. We cannot negotiate over Gothenburg or Nice in the same way that we negotiated over Westphalia when Swedish and other troops were fighting the 30 Years War. Diplomatic negotiations have had their day: a European Union must be negotiated between citizens, between members of parliament, between players in internal affairs within our Union. The Swedish Presidency could give the signal for this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Madam President, I would just like to say a few brief words about the agencies. Mr Persson is in danger of messing up in true southern Italian style<span class="bold"> </span>if he distributes<span class="bold"> </span>all the responsibilities at Gothenburg, maybe giving the Food Agency to Helsinki, to a country which, I would argue, is the least suitable location for it. Practise transparency in this as well and, if time runs short, carry the issue over to the next summit to allow time for a more public, more open debate on the location of these major European agencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact this risks confirming the view of many people that the European institutions under construction are deaf to the citizens' demands and that in the final analysis, beneath the ideological disguises, their real purpose is to confiscate the powers of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘no’ vote in the Irish referendum, like the ‘no’ vote in the Danish referendum last September, is a warning. The people are turning away from a Europe in which they cannot recognise themselves. To speed up federalism under these conditions would be the quick road to ruin. The Gothenburg Council may still have a chance of getting things back on an even keel.</p>
<p class="contents">What should it decide? First, it should decide to suspend the ratification of Nice by cancelling the General Affairs Council’s conclusions of Monday. Secondly, it should send a strong signal to the candidate states, inviting them to join the Union immediately, without any additional treaty, by acceding to the intergovernmental part of the existing treaties. It should then announce that the supplementary provisions on enlargement will be incorporated in the accession treaties. Finally, it should convene another intergovernmental conference, this time with the objective of establishing a Europe that respects its nations. This IGC would have to be based above all on the national parliaments and not on the new confiscation-based structure that is being invented just now. That is what we propose in our counter-report on the Treaty of Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a victory for those who wish to stop and say no. Referendums encourage short-term, self-interested views rather than long-term acceptance of responsibility. As Europe stands on the brink of a highly successful age, its citizens are vacillating. Reunification can increase freedom, security and opportunities and we can show solidarity with people who have suffered under Communist oppression and the destruction caused by a planned economy. However, reunification is just as important to us, as enlargement is not only a historical responsibility but also a necessary injection and a win-win situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In Gothenburg the EU Heads of State and Government must therefore now set a deadline for enlargement and ensure that its road map is confirmed politically. This is the clear message which I believe is needed. But we should also examine ourselves. Citizens, not only in Ireland, are questioning what the EU is doing. We are poor at explaining the heart and the successes of European cooperation. Many people wish to foist tasks on the EU which can better be dealt with domestically. This threatens self-determination, while at the same the EU’s fundamental task of increasing freedom, ensuring peace, opening up markets and breaking down trade barriers becomes neglected.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement and expansion of the European Union requires focus, consistency and commitment from all those interested in making Europe a success. There is another summit being held. Sweden believes the summit with the US is a significant event and one that is important to the EU. The leadership must focus on what unites us. Understanding the interests of the US may ensure Europe’s reunification and ability to manage crises. Working with the US to ensure peace and increased free trade must be the primary task.</p>
<p class="contents">George W. Bush is good for the US and good for Europe, and we welcome him to Europe. I hope that both summits achieve concrete results and wish everyone the best of luck. I would like to add my congratulations to the foreign ministers for ensuring that the Presidency’s six months, which started out looking rather grey will seemingly end a little more on the light blue side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to give the Swedish government full marks for its work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk about something not on the programme for Gothenburg and that is one of the “E’s” – Employment – which was tackled at the Stockholm Summit in March, but which was supplemented in the social area this week with a hat trick of successes at the last moment. I would say that it was perhaps one of the most successful Council meetings in terms of social issues, as the Council managed to solve three issues: the issues of noise, equal treatment and, especially, informing and consulting employees. The work carried out was excellent and important for the EU’s ongoing social initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention sustainable development and link it to the social issues, as much of the debate has centred on sustainable development and ecological issues. This is the way it should be, but there is also a social dimension. We have the issues of social cohesion between people and creating policies which reduce the divisions in Europe, not least the divisions between the generations. We also have the issues of pension systems and how they will be developed in the future, and reducing the divisions between regions.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is required for sustainable development. We need an economic policy which is not simply focused on short-term growth, but also on long-term growth. Therefore, the ecological aspects must be included in all areas. They must have an impact on transport policy, energy policy and agricultural policy as we develop a society sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The ecological aspects must also have an impact on us globally. Internally, we will succeed in this through the methods we have used so far, but also through augmenting the Lisbon Process, by making the ecological aspects part of the process we already have in the social and economic areas. But we must also act globally. One opportunity will be the Gothenburg Summit and the summit with Mr Bush, at which the EU must stand its ground with regard to the Kyoto Protocol. Of course, we want the US on board, but the EU must take the lead here. Even if the US does not want this, the EU must take the lead globally on this issue. We must also focus on these issues with regard to trade agreements with the WTO by adding ecological and social aspects to the development of global trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say something about the most important of the three “E’s”, which is undoubtedly Enlargement. This is an historic opportunity which we must not let slip through our fingers. I therefore share the view put forward by many others that, after what happened in Ireland, we must be even clearer in our dealings with the applicant countries. The enlargement process must continue, we must set deadlines with the aim of applicant countries being ready to take part in European Parliament elections in 2004. This must be clarified so that the first countries can join. Each country must join on its own merits and as few exceptions and transposition periods as possible must be requested in as few areas as possible. Sweden has achieved a great deal of success during its Presidency. Now the focus must be on further progress and building on this legacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to say something about the common European foreign and security policy, on which the Presidency has worked very well and for which Sweden has received great praise. Anna Lindh in particular has succeeded in positioning Sweden as a leading nation in this process by introducing preventive measures. The fact that we now have a leading role in world politics, in the Middle East, Korea, etc., is to a large extent thanks to the work of Anna Lindh, for which I would like to thank her.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it was good to be so clear on the issue of a convention. As it supports openness, Sweden must also support a convention, but not as the <span class="italic">only</span> method, but as <span class="italic">one</span> method of preparing intergovernmental negotiations next time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a war baby, I am very conscious of the fact that peace is not celebrated with parades and that the arduous everyday work of maintaining peace does not gain huge headlines. War is better in a media society. However, I would like to thank Mrs Lindh for her excellent work so far.</p>
<p class="contents">The main theme of Gothenburg will be sustainable development, and in this context the Kyoto Protocol will be brought up. President Bush is coming to Gothenburg. Should those in power in Europe, including myself, not “put their own house in order” first? Within the EU, we subsidise energy systems which produce the highest levels of carbon dioxide. Should we not first, or perhaps at the same time, do something about this? It is easier to negotiate once one has “put ones own house in order”.</p>
<p class="contents">The other major environmental problem in Europe is traffic. There is also an EU project to create a good, environmentally friendly infrastructure in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and perhaps one of our greatest environmental problems is the common agricultural policy. We are putting a little over EUR 40 billion into this area. Around 5 billion of that will go into preserving cultural heritage and biodiversity, the rest is highly counterproductive from the point of view of the environment, so let us “put our own house in order” as we move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Remember that this summit was launched as the first ‘green’ summit. Thirty years after the UN Environmental Conference in Stockholm and ten years after the UN Earth Summit in Rio, the Heads of State and Government have a historic opportunity, an undertaking and a responsibility to adopt a credible strategy for sustainable development for the EU. However, this strategy must also form the basis for further global environmental responsibility and undertakings ahead of Rio+10 in South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is an important first step, I would say a minimum step. Much, much more is needed in order to achieve a real breakthrough for sustainable development. Major changes must be made in economic policy, transport and energy policy, chemicals policy, and agricultural and fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As faith in the EU fades, as was shown in Ireland’s rejection of the Treaty of Nice, a fundamental debate is required on the future of Europe, a debate without preconditions in which European civil society can take part. The summit must stake out such a path.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit not leading to a credible result on sustainable development would be another setback. There must be a good result. It is not just about us but about future generations.

One country in the EU has allowed its people to vote on the Treaty of Nice and they said no. If more countries had been allowed to vote, the result would probably have been no in a number of countries, not least in Sweden. The European Council in Gothenburg must make it clear that Ireland’s rejection will be respected. This means that the Treaty of Nice has failed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a case of the EU having to follow its own rules. The right of Member States to say no to Treaty amendments is key to the fabric of the EU. Without it, the national democracies lose control of the Union. This is why it is unbelievable that the Swedish government can say that the Treaty of Nice still stands. By doing so, it is ignoring the democratic rules. If the Swedish parliament had voted no to a Treaty amendment, would we not want that to be respected by the other EU countries? I think that is a question which the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs should answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Ireland voted no to the Treaty of Nice. That is a no to increased supranationality, more power to the larger EU countries, a no to new steps towards a European State and EU militarisation. As such, it was also a vote for a better and more democratic Europe. Ireland’s no was not, however, a no to EU enlargement. Enlarging the EU will work perfectly well based on the Treaty of Amsterdam. The influence of the new Member States in the institutions can be regulated in the Accession Treaties as was the case during the last enlargement. Such a model can correct the discrimination which certain applicant countries experienced in Nice. If Ireland’s no is not respected, the message sent out will be clear, namely that the will of small countries is irrelevant and referendums are only respected if the result suits the power elite. It would be a serious matter if this were to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about the strategy for sustainable development which is to be discussed at the Gothenburg Summit. The Commission’s proposal was unexpectedly concrete and good, not least considering its weak proposal for an Environmental Action Programme earlier this year. The proposal contains a number of clear goals such as a continued reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, measures to preserve biodiversity, requirements to stop increases in traffic and abolishing harmful subsidies, for example for tobacco cultivation. The risk now is clearly that the concrete elements of the strategy disappear during negotiations, while the rhetoric committing to nothing remains. A compromise proposal is already being circulated, a non-paper from the Swedish government which looks exactly as I described. I hope that the Swedish government will fight for and succeed in retaining the concrete content of the strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last Thursday, the Irish unequivocally rejected the Treaty of Nice. That means the people of the only two countries that have been directly consulted have expressed, with equal force, the growing dissatisfaction of all European citizens with a Europe that is tending more and more to treat its constituent nations simply as remote colonies.</p>
<p class="contents">Alas, as happened after the Danish referendum, the Union is loftily ignoring the message sent out by the people of Europe. I wonder how long the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission think they can go on founding their Europe on contempt for the people, whom they treat as nobody would dare to treat children today?</p>
<p class="contents">The Gothenburg Summit, to be held only six months after the Nice Summit, will have to take note of the Irish vote and the fact that the Irish people have exercised the sovereign right of veto that the governments did not dare to exercise in Nice. It will therefore have to declare the treaty null and void, failing which the people will regard Europe as an alien enterprise and will soon see it as their enemy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall welcome any more accurate timetable for enlargement to come out of Gothenburg, although to name specific candidate countries would be irresponsible, given the negotiating chapters still outstanding and the Irish vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish vote demands sensible reaction and analysis, even if only 33% of the electorate voted. This is not democratic fiddle-faddle.

<p class="contents">There have been numerous setbacks in the history of the Union: Denmark's no, Great Britain's policy during the first BSE crisis, the resignation of the Commission and the illegal sanctions against Austria. We must make a careful analysis of the reasons behind the Irish vote, which begs the question of what is wrong with the European project. We do not just need a public debate on the reform of the Union; we need more democracy and greater transparency on an integration process which is becoming ever more complex. The involvement of the national parliaments as the representatives of European democracy is a key point here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will be forgiven for concentrating on the Irish situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish people have spoken. The answer is "no". We must respect that decision. Could I plead with the Commission, the Council and indeed the summit to be sure that decision is respected in what they say and in the signals they give. They must analyse it and not treat it as an irrelevancy, sending a message that with or without Ireland they will proceed. If that were the case, they would not need ratification from all 15 Member States. If it is not the case, they must not treat the decision as an irrelevancy. I say this to them as a passionate "yes" voter, because they are causing more damage with the post-Nice referendum signals they are sending than with any pre-Nice referendum signals they sent in Ireland. Please be careful.</p>
<p class="contents">The complexity and the lack of clarity of the Nice Treaty allowed a huge range of issues to be tagged onto the debate during the Irish referendum, issues relevant and irrelevant to Nice, causing concern and fear among the people, which resulted in a huge abstention with a paltry 34% turnout, of whom 54% voted "no". In other words, 19% of people entitled to vote voted "no" and signalled an unwillingness to proceed with enlargement, because that was what Nice was about.</p>
<p class="contents">Please believe me when I say that I do not believe that the Irish people wish to deny the accession countries the opportunities and support that we as a small under-developed country have experienced and put to great use over the last three decades. Our government was obliged by a Supreme Court decision to spend as much money telling the public the reasons to vote "no" as the reasons to vote "yes". The media was likewise obliged to give as much coverage to the "no" campaign as to the "yes" campaign, without challenging the irrelevancies, despite the fact that all the major political parties, farm organisations, trade unions, press editorials and even the Conference of Bishops urged a "yes" vote. There was an assumption that the outcome was a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>. Perhaps that explains why our government did so little, took the electorate for granted and was content to mine the Eurosceptic vote for the forthcoming general election, with several ministers in recent months giving very ambivalent signals.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Solbes Mira's reprimand angered middle Ireland and raised fears of Europe meddling in our tax affairs. Statements from Mr Jospin and Commissioner Prodi during the campaign did not help, but the responsibility for investing time and energy in the campaign lay primarily with our government, and it failed.</p>
<p class="contents">The "no" campaigners, starting from behind with nothing to lose and no one correcting the irrelevancies and, worse, the scare-mongering, beavered away. I voted "yes" and I resent the implication that by doing so I am pro-abortion, anti-neutrality, pro-NATO, pro-nuclear power, pro-euthanasia. The list is endless – take your pick. They are all issues worthy of debate, but nothing to do with the Nice Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We need time to reflect, to analyse the outcome, to learn from it, to respond to the legitimate fears and concerns and, above all, to try and understand why 65% of the electorate stayed at home. Was this an indictment of the European project or a mid-term wake-up call to our political establishment? The jury is out. Following our government's announcement last night of a new multi-party national forum to explain and discuss the European project in general and Nice in particular, I hope a more informed, reassured Irish electorate will allow our government to ratify the Nice Treaty in the next twelve months or so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the Gothenburg Summit, following the Stockholm Summit, at which full employment was once again confirmed as a European priority, will, on the home stretch too, make a major contribution to the sustainable development strategy. But there is no denying that the Irish people’s rejection of the Treaty of Nice could cast a major shadow on the success of Gothenburg if the Summit hides its head in the sand or proceeds with business as usual. I should like to say the following to Mr Poettering: the signal that we Socialists expect from Gothenburg is not just that enlargement is a priority, but that it is enormously important for Europe to be strengthened, and that must be done with the full and democratic involvement of the people. Those two things are not incompatible. Obviously the Irish must be allowed to work out their own solution to the problem that has now arisen, but the low turnout in the referendum and the negative results are not simply an Irish problem. They are symptomatic of the dangerous gap that is opening up between European policy and the public in all Member States, not just Ireland, because of the lack of democracy, the lack of transparency and the lack of dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Mr Prodi for making it clear that Europe cannot be built by diplomats behind closed doors, and I particularly welcome the commitment of the President-in-Office of the Council, who is advocating a convention. I do therefore ask you to make sure it does not become a watered down version. But I also ask that you urge the Member States to step up the public debate on Europe’s future and on enlargement. It really might be a little more than the Member States are now reporting.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would say to the President-in-Office of the Council that I also hope the Gothenburg Summit will be a red and green and not just a green Summit. Mr Andersson has already mentioned the political breakthrough achieved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on Monday on the right to information and consultation, safety and health at work, more equal opportunities for men and women, all areas that relate to the quality of work which is so important to the Swedes. Besides that, I sincerely hope that Gothenburg will give a clear mandate for the introduction of a European strategy on poverty, social exclusion and proper, decent pensions. I think that if Gothenburg can demonstrate that, then it will show people that the European project is worth fighting for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be cutting itself off from influence but nonetheless complying with the decisions taken. It is muzzling itself and shooting itself in the foot. That is the fruit of the anti-European campaign run by nationalists and left-wing romantics and supported by reactionary Britons and former Danish communists who have always opposed European cooperation. Mr Bonde has voted against every scrap of European cooperation. He presents himself as the apostle of democracy and transparency but, until 10 years ago, he supported the most secretive system the world has ever seen and taught at the party schools in the East German dictatorship. Do not listen to him! Let us instead mobilise the large majority of citizens here in Europe who are happy to cooperate but who are dissatisfied with one thing or another and who cannot oversee what we are doing because the treaties are unreadable and unclear and because we too, here in Parliament, interfere in every conceivable matter, with the result that people cannot see an end to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to caution and warn EU ministers in Göteborg to consider carefully the effect that a second resounding defeat would have for the Nice proposals. They should think carefully about the effects on their own electorates who are watching with increasing disenchantment the distant and cumbersome European superstructure.</p>
<p class="contents">The intergovernmental method of negotiating EU treaties where leaders wheel-and-deal behind closed doors on matters of importance for all our citizens has come to an end and is now also dead. A new method has to be found which leads to results that are understood and accepted by all of us, involving national and regional parliaments and, indeed, civil society. The Nice result is not an outburst of Euro-scepticism. It is an indication of a serious rethink about Europe across the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I woke up one morning to find that Irish soldiers were being sent to the Rapid Reaction Force. I did not know how that decision was made. None of our citizens knew how that decision was made. We voted "no" because of those kinds of problems.</p>

The message was really something like ‘business as usual’, too bad, we shall just carry on, give Ireland another chance. I would point out to Mrs Van Lancker that it was the majority of Socialists on the General Affairs Council that decided to go on with business as usual. You do not need to tell us that strengthening is extraordinarily important along with enlargement. We have always maintained that. I hope you will tell your Socialist friends that business as usual is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do believe that Gothenburg should be primarily an opportunity to reflect on what has happened and what the implications are from the point of view of involving our citizens more in Europe. We must make sure our Heads of Government do not come out with all kinds of conflicting views after the signature of the Nice Treaty and simply add to the public’s confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us just think about what we have in common and what we want to achieve together. Let Gothenburg also be the Summit at which, as you so rightly said, at last we shall be using a different method of operation, the convention. But let Gothenburg also be the Summit at which we are ready to think about how we can speed up the process and how the public can become more involved in what is happening in Europe. I think that is how we can benefit from the signal given by our Irish friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, you mentioned the Middle East road map. I sincerely hope that Europe is not going to go back to blueprints again. We need to use our diplomatic skills to help resolve the massive conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. In my view, that must be the main issue and also, in particular, let us make every possible effort to find a solution for Macedonia. Mr Poettering was quite right to draw attention to it. That is the litmus test for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The result of the Irish referendum casts an unexpected and dramatic shadow over the method adopted by the Intergovernmental Conference last year. This result shows a serious lack of understanding by public opinion in the Member States, which is due to the lack of transparency in the negotiations, the tortuous nature of the agreements concluded and the complexity of the issues relating to EU enlargement and the process of integration, all questions which have not really been discussed head-on with the citizens and therefore clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">We can certainly not leave any question marks hanging over the commitments we have already entered into with the candidate countries. At the same time, when the national parliaments come to examine the Nice Treaty prior to ratifying it, they must not disregard the problem posed by the Irish vote. Quite aside, however, from seeking solutions to the situation that has arisen, to which the Irish Government will make a vital contribution, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs wishes first and foremost to reaffirm, with even greater conviction, the positions it expressed in the resolution adopted in plenary on 31 May on the method to be followed from now until the year 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish vote confirms the need not only for a wider debate on the issues relating to the Union’s future but also for a mandate to draft texts that have a constitutional value. This should be entrusted to a convention which, thanks to the participation of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, can guarantee the kind of transparency and complete legitimacy that have been missing until now.

The Treaty of Nice will not have come to nothing until the moment when the Irish government formally tells the other countries that it will not be able to ratify it. And that is something that the Irish Government has not done for the time being so, politically speaking at any rate, we have, in reality, the period up until the end of 2002 to see if we can get the Treaty of Nice ratified. If that has not happened before 2002, then we have a serious problem. Denmark has already ratified the Treaty. That is due to the fact that there is a broad political majority in favour of enlargement, and we have not wanted to place question marks over enlargement. The instrument of ratification is being lodged in Rome today. It is also important, however, for us to have a discussion about grassroots support, which was the Swedish Presidency’s third key point. It is therefore up to us seriously to get some impetus into this debate with a view to the periods both before and after Laeken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Irish Government themselves have ignored the mandate that they clearly got from the people. As Mrs Dybkjær has just said, what they have done is to tell the other EU governments to carry on as usual; they will then go back to the Irish people and get them to vote again until they get it right. They are going to ask the Irish people to vote again on the same Treaty with declarations attached which are not legally binding. That is completely unacceptable to the democratic process and our government is guilty of treachery in its approach to the Irish vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement can go ahead, but we want it to be fair and equitable. We would like to see the new Member States come in under the same conditions as those offered to Ireland. Instead, the doors have been tightly closed to keep those countries out until the rules are changed to suit the big and wealthy countries in Europe. That is not acceptable. The eastern European countries are being misled by those EU leaders who maintain that the "no" vote in Ireland was a "no" to enlargement. That is not so. As Mr Cox has said, we campaigned for enlargement but against the Nice Treaty, because it is not in the interests of the countries coming in, nor is it in the interests of the existing Member States. It merely serves the interests of the more powerful, and that is not a Europe that we want to see emerge in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Irish vote proves that our citizens want Europe, but that they want a Europe they understand, a Europe that is transparent, capable of action and democratic. So exactly how do things stand right now? We have a treaty which no one approves of, but which everyone says must be ratified because otherwise enlargement hangs in the balance. But what will happen if the treaty is ratified in fourteen national parliaments – meaning that not a single comma can then be changed – and is then rejected by Ireland for a second time in the autumn of 2002? That is taking a huge risk. Perhaps we should be preparing other options, so that the formal conditions for enlargement, such as the number of seats and votes and questions for the enlargement treaties themselves can be negotiated, as we did on previous occasions? I think we should at least prepare such an option, so as to avoid delaying enlargement and sending out the wrong message and giving rise to uncertainty in the candidate countries between now and November 2002. We must ensure that the post-Nice process is speeded up through public debate and a convention and can be wrapped up by the end of 2003, as the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report suggests.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, I would advise the governments in the Member States to take a good look at this report, because it contains a whole series of tips on how to manage this crisis. We have no use now for tricks, protocols, opt outs or anything else of the sort; what we need is a treaty which clearly shows our citizens how they can play a part in Europe. And although the Schröders and Fischers and Jospins and Blairs may have given brilliant visionary speeches over recent months, I for one should like to see them convert some of these fantasies into practical policy and for our social-democratic Europe not to go down in history as the Europe which was unable to resolve its problems, either present or future.</p>

Not one single political party in Ireland argued against enlargement, either on the "no" side or the "yes" side: only one organisation – a non-party organisation which campaigned for "no" – argued against enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish people has spoken on Nice and its decision will be respected. The people of the other fourteen Member States are also entitled to have their say on the Treaty in accordance with their constitutions. For them it will be expressed through their democratically elected parliaments. They must not be denied that right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is ironic, that the people in this House who argued against Nice, because Nice was too much Europe, are now saying that Europe should instruct its Member States not to ratify Nice. It beggars belief that this undemocratic attitude is being expressed here by the Irish Greens and by others. Could I put it simply for them, because it seems to be very difficult for them to understand: do they argue that the World Cup should be lost because the first team that plays should lose if it does not score the first goal, or should the game go its full term and should every qualified team play the complete game to the end? There is time for ratification, even if we need extra time, let us take that time.</p>
<p class="contents">As a democracy, where the people are sovereign, the Irish people is also entitled to decide to reconsider its decision and to confirm or reverse it. We now need a sustained debate on Nice. Those parties who supported Nice should seek a mandate at the next general election, which will take place by June 2002, to present a new proposal on Nice to the people before December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">John Cushnahan and I have published a seven-point initiative on measures, which could help to clarify the issues and to assuage fears in Ireland. I am happy to report that one of those initiatives, the establishment of a forum in Ireland on the future of Europe, has been adopted by the Irish Government. That is a proposal which I tabled in December 2000 after Nice. I thank the Swedish minister here this morning for her confirmation that there is going to be a convention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy to discern the myriad of concerns, some domestic, some European, which gave rise to the "no" result in Ireland. There is one overriding and general concern, the sense that people are losing control of their government and their lives. People know that the European project is necessary and important, but they are at a loss as to how they fit into the scheme of things. The bottom line is that if we want people in Europe in every country to initiate a new experiment in sharing their democracy, sovereignty, benefits of freedoms, then we, as their elected representatives have to lead courageously by spelling out in great detail how it will work.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the rights of each Member State and each person who lives in Europe must be guaranteed. That can best be done through a new federalism based on a European constitution. So far, we have only the vaguest outline of what that might represent. We have a mountain to climb, but I am confident that the people in Ireland and the rest of Europe will rise to the challenge when they are given the chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a disgracefully long time. The Commission has submitted a good document, but why did the Swedish Presidency remove this Commission proposal to stop subsidising fossil fuels from the draft conclusions even before the Heads of Government arrived in Gothenburg? Why are they acting so cowardly? Why is Sweden scrapping sustainable development even before the Summit has started? The European Parliament voted by a 95% majority for Europe to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, even without the United States. I urge the Heads of Government to make it clear to President Bush that it is irresponsible for any country to remain outside the Kyoto Protocol. It is bad enough that the United States still imposes the death penalty, as it has again this week, but that is after all a matter for the American people. But President Bush’s energy plan for more oil, more coal, more gas and more nuclear power stations is going to destroy the climate all over the world.

I believe that today Parliament has recognised the efforts of the Swedish Presidency, and yours in particular, to carry out successful work. And I also want to acknowledge this.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that you have acted with political care. For example, on the agreement on the memorandum on the cohesion funds you acted quickly, and that is positive, because Europe is not a Europe of traders, but a Europe of cohesion and of the common principles and values which we all share. And I also believe that in the same way there has been a change in the Swedish Presidency in the latest preparatory documents on an issue which is of great concern to this Parliament; the convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that between the outset and today there has been a change, and that is that you have understood that the next Intergovernmental Conference should be prepared in such a way as to prevent what happened with the Treaty of Nice, and I believe that the convention model is showing the way: this models means participation, openness and transparency, all characteristics which you have a particular interest in. I would like to ask you now to show a little more daring – as a French revolutionary would say, <span class="italic">de l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace </span>[what we need is to dare, still to dare, and always to dare]. You will notice that I am next to François Bayrou and I have been imbued with these revolutionary ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Be more daring, opt for the convention, because I believe that that is the lesson we must learn from the Irish referendum. We must count on the people, listen to them, hear them, and the convention is a useful method for doing this. I therefore urge you to continue in this direction, which the President of my Group, Mr Poettering, has argued for, and to come back from Gothenburg with the good news that that convention has been launched to assess the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to encourage you, Madam President-in-Office, to bring the project which you have started to a successful conclusion in Gothenburg in the form of a strong, specific programme which can be implemented at once.

A Member State, under the provisions of the Treaty, has sounded out its people on the conclusion of Treaty changes. They have for a number of reasons declined these changes. This result cannot be ignored, either on the basis of a lower-than-normal turnout – what price legitimacy? – or because some people feel that the only good referendum result is a positive one.</p>
<p class="contents">As the EU moves towards enlargement, we must not suggest to countries waiting at the door of the European Union that democracy and the rule of law can simply be overruled, by tacitly encouraging the Irish Government to hold another referendum sometime in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">No tinkering around with additional protocols will convince the sceptical public to vote in favour of Treaty changes which are difficult to explain and bring nothing of real benefit to improve the effective operation of the European Union. There is only one way to reassure public opinion and maintain the vital goal of EU enlargement. The Nice Treaty must in time cease to exist. In these circumstances no treaty in these circumstances is better than a bad treaty. Instead we now urgently need to hold a genuine, substantial debate about the future of the European Union. The idea of a non-binding convention, to which other speakers have referred, is an idea whose time has now come.</p>
<p class="contents">This process will only be successful, however, if all European citizens are involved and consulted on these essential issues. By the end of 2003 at the latest, the national parliaments should then be able to ratify either the relevant provisions of the Nice Treaty or those of the convention. Should the European Council not follow this course and be seen to be trampling on the democratic procedures in small Member States, this will only serve to further alienate a European public which is genuinely in search of more information. Europe and its institutions can only be built with the long-lasting support of its peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to take up two subjects so that everything else is not drowned out by the referendum in Ireland. First and foremost, sustainability. I believe that getting this overall strategy on sustainability adopted will be a very positive contribution to European development. We need to see incorporated into European cooperation a compulsory system for integrating environmental considerations into all areas, something which will happen with the Sixth Environmental Action Programme as the environmental pillar for the strategy during the next few years. As we specified in Parliament’s decision, sustainability must be seen in a global context. At the moment, there are no other powerful parts of the world, outside the EU, which are in a position to take on that role, and I therefore hope that the presence of President Bush, who is perhaps the least sustainability-minded of all, will paradoxically make the EU more strongly united regarding this task.</p>
<p class="contents">And now a couple of words about enlargement. We must be careful of rhetoric. I believe we must show respect for the decision taken in the Irish referendum. I am also listening, however, to the Irish politicians on both sides of the referendum debate who say that it was not enlargement as such that was the problem in Ireland. I therefore think it is very important that, following the referendum in Ireland, it should be clearly accepted that the enlargement negotiations can continue at the same pace until such time as a solution is found in relation to Ireland. It would be an historic mistake if, because of this referendum, enlargement were to come to grief or were to be postponed when it was not this that was the problem for the Irish people. I would therefore call upon the European Council, headed by the Presidency, to show flexibility, provide maximum support and make time for finding a solution that is satisfactory to the Irish population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now our duty to rediscover this cultural unity which must consolidate the necessary and, I would argue, right and proper, irreversible decision to enlarge the Union. The Commission, the Council and Parliament have the task of involving the citizens in this process, as President Prodi has stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish vote must certainly make us stop and think: we must not get things out of proportion but it is certainly our duty to involve the European people in the important matters concerning the Union. In its endeavours to achieve the goal of enlargement, the Commission can count on the full, firm support of my political party and the new Italian government, which is involved in a fresh, incisive Europeanist initiative, as Mr Solana and Mr Giscard d'Estaing have stressed and acknowledged today as well.</p>
<p class="contents">However, because it is our duty to involve the peoples of Europe, I feel that an initial stage should be also envisaged in the reform process in which the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the governments and the Commission work together to prepare for the 2003 Intergovernmental Conference. President Prodi, I agree that the debate must not be confined to an elite: there must therefore be less elitism and more parliamentarianism in the reform processes. As regards the other matter, relations between the United States and the European Union, I feel that we must foster transatlantic dialogue and, therefore, I welcome President Bush's visit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must be committed to the Middle East peace process. The European Union must do everything in its power; in the future, once the most difficult stage is over and recourse to terrorism has been avoided, it should take action to assist the economic growth of the territories surrounding Israel as well, for they must not be subjected to economic as well as ethnic and political tension. I feel that the European Union will be able to play a major role in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This summit will also have to evaluate the unexpected results of the Irish referendum on ratifying the Treaty of Nice. We are sorry the Irish people said ‘no’ to this treaty; although far from perfect, at least it resolved the left-overs of Amsterdam and, above all, opened the way to enlargement of the European Union to other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the Irish saying by abstaining so heavily? That all too often the citizens see Europe as some nebulous abstraction, with no bearing on their daily concerns. If there is a message in this vote, it concerns the urgent need to hold a real, popular grass-roots debate on these issues. I am confident that the Union can rise to this challenge. We hope the Treaty of Nice will enter into force before the end of the year 2002, so that the Union can welcome the new Member States in 2004, as it has undertaken to do. All the existing Member States must hasten to ratify this treaty without delay, and I am glad that by its vote in the National Assembly yesterday, France is now one of the first countries to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priority, which the Gothenburg European Council must solemnly reiterate, remains to prepare for enlargement. We will do our utmost to ensure that the post-Nice situation lives up to the European citizens’ expectations with regard to the purpose of the Union, in the light of its political project and its democratic deficit. We will say ‘yes’ to the post-Nice situation, prepared by a convention made up of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, the governments of the 15, the Commission and civil society. We will say ‘yes’ to a European constitution that reaffirms our common values, respect for human rights, cultural diversity and the social model, and that defines the respective competences of the Member States and the Union. We also say ‘yes’ to a federation of nation-states in which each state will retain its specific nature and its competences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lindh,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, enlargement has been the main focus of this debate, which I believe is quite natural. I am very pleased about the widespread support in Parliament for enlargement. Parliament has played a vital role so far, for example with its requirement that the applicant countries will be able to take part in the European Parliament elections in 2004. You will also continue to have a key part to play in moving enlargement forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now return to Gothenburg bearing your stated wish for clear signals from Gothenburg, including a clearer timetable. I will also return with the large majority in favour of ratification of the Treaty of Nice continuing. I would like to say that I particularly appreciate Mr Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Cox, Mr Collins and other group leaders expressing this view.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we will take the referendum in Ireland seriously. We must become better at obtaining more grassroots support for European issues and the European project. We must take the referendum result seriously. It is a common responsibility and common lesson for us all. We will naturally all offer Ireland whatever help it and the Irish government decides it requires. However, in order not to damage the European project any further and not to weaken faith in the Union, we must also move forward on ratification of the Treaty of Nice and enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say how fortunate it is that group leaders Mr Wurtz and Mr Bonde do not have a majority either in the European Parliament or in the national parliaments when they argue against ratification of the Treaty of Nice, for it is precisely this that is causing concern in the applicant countries. The Treaty of Nice is, of course, the precondition for enlargement. A <span class="italic">no</span> to the Treaty of Nice is a <span class="italic">no </span>to enlargement and, with friends like that, the applicant countries do not need any enemies.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for enlargement that the process of addressing the points at issue continues. President of the Commission Prodi and several others have today emphasised the importance of addressing the seriously difficult issues and starting to deal with them, e.g. issues concerning the environment, free movement of people and free movement of capital. I believe it is important to state before Parliament that, following the negotiations which we had at the start of this week, we have now not only created common positions among the Member States on these difficult issues but have also started negotiations with the applicant countries and even completed negotiations with several applicant countries. We have successfully addressed the environmental issues with four applicant countries. We have also successfully addressed free movement of people with a couple of applicant countries and free movement of capital with a couple of applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me particularly comment on free movement of people, as this has been a very sensitive issue. In this area, we have sought a flexible solution which entails our providing the opportunity for transposition periods for those countries which are absolutely sure that they need them, while allowing flexibility for others. The Swedish and Dutch governments have recently declared that they will open themselves up to the labour force of new Member States right from the start, so that the labour force from new Member States will have the opportunity to work with us on the same terms as the labour force of current Member States. I hope that many other countries will follow suit and give equivalent declarations as soon as possible. In this respect, I also believe that you European parliamentarians can help bring pressure to bear on your national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have also mentioned sustainable development and the environmental issues. I can guarantee that we will stand by the Kyoto Protocol. We will be addressing climate issues at the summit and discussing them with President Bush. We will do our best in Gothenburg to ensure that we take important steps forward on environmental issues. At the same time, I think it is important to take up social issues, as Mr Barón Crespo and some others have suggested, and establish that we have made progress on these issues and the situation of the labour force.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to foreign policy, we will continue to work with the Western Balkans and the Middle East. We have seen the way the EU <span class="italic">can </span>play an important role. Naturally, this work must continue.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that we are unable to meet Mr Trajkovski today in Parliament but, on the other hand, I believe that he has made the right choice in these difficult times of ensuring that he takes the negotiations in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia forward towards a peaceful solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we have good instruments, and will have good instruments, from the Union for future work through the European programme for conflict prevention which Mr Sakellariou brought up. This is also something which we in Sweden are keen to do further work on, even after the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank everyone for the kind words on the Swedish Presidency. I would like to reply with my own thanks for excellent work and constructive cooperation with the European Parliament. Unfortunately, this is the last time I will be speaking in this capacity, but I hope to enjoy continued cooperation with Parliament as an “ordinary foreign minister”.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, a brief response to some of the points that have emerged during the debate. Firstly, I am extremely pleased to see that Parliament has taken the will expressed by the Irish people very seriously, not just because it is representative – although the turnout was not very high – of the wishes of an entire people but also because it represents the wishes of an entire country. Most importantly, this will encourage us all to find new ways of governing Europe. It is a lesson, and I welcome the fact that a common desire has been shown – by Parliament, the Commission and the Swedish Presidency, as well as in the statement by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs read out by Mr Napolitano – to turn the page and change the way we run summits and legislate in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the real lesson we must learn, and therefore the great, transparent Convention which we are working towards must be the new approach, the approach upon which the European peoples can express their opinions in an informed manner, with peace of mind, familiar with the matter under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">In an aside, Mrs Doyle touched on the statements made by Mr Solbes, myself and Mr Jospin, and their effect on the outcome of the Irish referendum. My answer relates to the Commission's statements. The opinion expressed on the Irish economy and on certain problems which had arisen was based on a large number of criteria to which we must adhere. It is the Commission's duty to adhere rigorously to these criteria, which were, moreover, agreed upon by the 15 countries, including Ireland. Our duty is not to make exceptions for some countries: our duty will be to apply the rules to small and large countries alike, for the Commission's duty is to be the guardian of the interests of all the European peoples and countries. This is what we have done thus far and this is what we will do in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this brief answer to make two observations. Firstly, we must not disregard – and I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency once again – the great progress made in resolving the sticking points of the social guidelines. There had been an impasse in this area for a long time and they were a genuine problem: now another step forward has been taken. In this connection, I would also like to thank Mrs Diamantopoulou for her work.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a reference has been made to the speech I made a few days ago on the need for a European tax. I would like to reiterate this concept, clear up any ambiguity and open a discussion with Parliament on this very sensitive matter. The Commission is working on it, it is analysing the possibility and feasibility of introducing such a tax, which will have to replace existing taxes and will not be an additional burden of any kind for the European citizens. We were quite clear about this from the very first time the matter was raised and we must continue to be so now. We must also, however, make it clear that this initiative is a response to an explicit request from the Council and Parliament. We must reflect on these matters, for the institutions must be democratic in matters of taxation as well, and thus the purpose of this hypothetical future tax is to replace the current – complex, obscure, non-transparent – system of contributions from national States and to make the citizens more aware that we have a democratic way of acquiring resources and a transparent way of spending the resources acquired. This is our absolute duty for, apart from anything else, we must combat as far as possible the attitude, often common in our Member States, of "I want my money back", the rather circumspect kind of accounting practised by the national States which leaves European institutions at their mercy.<span class="bold"> </span>In my opinion, this must change and, I repeat, it is a compulsory step for all democratic institutions: they must be able to count on clearly-defined resources – which can, of course, be transfers from national taxes to European taxes but must be clearly defined and specifically dedicated to the European institutions – and to answer equally transparently to the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, these are the methods that we must always use. If we use these methods, the attitude of the European peoples will become much more positive and much more sympathetic, for they will understand what we are doing with their trust and their money.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must also take the lesson of the Irish referendum and the subsequent deliberations to heart. The European peoples want and must have an incisive, ambitious project on which to express their opinion. They want to have a comprehensive project to assess; they want to know what part of their future it is they are going to share with the other European countries. They harbour no preconceived hostility, they have not suddenly become narrow-minded: they simply have the right to understand, the right to be aware of every new step that takes place, every new step that will affect their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we have to take decisions, now and in the near future, which are important for all the European citizens, we must set this course, we must move in this direction. And the convention is – or will be – the first tentative stage in this new era for the European institutions.</p>
