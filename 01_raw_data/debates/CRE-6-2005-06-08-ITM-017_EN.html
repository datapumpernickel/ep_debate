It followed the visit of President Bush to the European institutions and came after what could be termed the ‘relaunch’ of those relations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in the preparatory phase for the forthcoming Euro-Atlantic summit, due to take place at the end of this month. It is important that this summit should achieve concrete results so that the relaunch of dialogue, achieved during President Bush’s visit, can become a reality. For that reason, I should like to raise a number of points which appear of particular importance for the development of stronger transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the issue of Iran, which was an important item on the agenda during President Bush’s visit. Not only have the Americans supported the European initiative, they have also agreed to open negotiations with Iran with a view to its membership of the World Trade Organisation, and Iran’s WTO membership is today an integral part of European strategy. I therefore believe that on this extremely sensitive and delicate issue, we have been able to show that cooperation between the US and Europe can provide solutions, and above all that it can produce a consistent strategy, which is, incidentally, first and foremost, a European strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union and the US are organising, and will jointly chair, a conference on the reconstruction of Iraq, to which I referred this morning. This decision was announced during the visit of President Bush. The announcement gave us the opportunity to show that we had left our disagreements on Iraq behind us. The US and the Union have the same aims for that country, namely to help the Iraqi Government in its huge reconstruction effort and, above all, in reinforcing its security. It will be a conference at ministerial level with over 80 delegations, a large number of which will be from the region concerned. The Iraqi Government, which will be at the very heart of that conference, will therefore have an opportunity to set out its plans and discuss the economic, political and security aspects with the international community represented there.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Sudan, the European Union did not merely insist that those responsible for crimes against humanity should be punished, but also that they should be punished through the International Criminal Court. As you know, the Union is one of the leading bodies supporting that Court. For us, the case of Sudan is an important precedent. The Court was set up for precisely that type of situation. If the matter were not referred to the International Criminal Court, however, that would create an unfortunate precedent which it would be difficult to overcome in the future. After several weeks of intense negotiations, we reached a solution acceptable to everyone, enabling the situation in Sudan to be referred to the International Criminal Court – and this without a US veto. Here was yet another situation in which the European Union exercised a wholly positive influence in transatlantic relations, at the same time rendering multilateral action more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Political dialogue between the European Union and the US has also become more frequent and more strategic on economic issues. However, we must stress that major problems remain. We are all aware of the case of Boeing and Airbus, and hope that, in the context of the forthcoming summit, we can still reach a satisfactory solution, thereby avoiding this matter being referred to the WTO and thus putting a damper on future Euro-Atlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, a strategic dialogue on Asia has begun. It is true that discussions on the lifting of the embargo on arms exports to China have revealed a lack of debate on strategic changes in Asia. The start of this dialogue, therefore, must show our common interests and help the Union to strengthen its own strategic thinking on that important region, now emerging both as a political and, above all, as an economic force. In the US Congress, a European Union Caucus has recently been created. We hope you will seize this opportunity and take advantage of the increasing interest in the European Union on the part of your US counterparts. Dialogue between legislators is important and should be strengthened, particularly in view of the importance of the Senate in the sphere of foreign policy. I therefore believe that the development of relations between this Parliament and the US Congress must be a goal of particularly high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these examples show the healthy condition of transatlantic cooperation in the last few months. It is vital to work with our American partners on the challenges now facing us. These various examples show that we can overcome our differences and adopt a shared approach. Major preparatory work is therefore now underway for the forthcoming EU-US summit, due to take place in Washington on 21 June. We are counting on a substantial and strategic summit, because it will be focused on vital issues of international relations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of this month, the troika met the US Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice, for that purpose. We are working on a number of draft declarations: the Middle East, international peace and security, the promotion of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights, but also Africa, the environment and economic relations. In the same way as last year, we are hoping to use these declarations as a basis on which to work. During the summit, we shall deal with the most important strategic issues, in particular the Middle East and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Kosovo situation, but also – and we have just debated it – reform of the United Nations. We can only reform the United Nations with the support of the US, and we know that there is still a long way to go on this issue. Like us, the Americans undoubtedly support the proposal to create a peace-building commission, but it now has to be given a more concrete and, above all, operational remit. The European Union is ambitious in the field of economic relations, as I have just said.</p>
<p class="contents">The next EU Presidency – our Presidency will be over by then – will advise you of the results of this summit. I am confident that the strong revival in transatlantic relations, achieved during the visit of President Bush, can continue during this summit and that we can achieve solid results which will place the future of these transatlantic relations, a vital pillar for the European Union, on a sounder footing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Honourable Members, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address Parliament shortly before our yearly EU-US summit, which will take place in Washington on 20 June. I would like to say at the outset that we share many of the views expressed in your motion for a resolution and welcome the support of the European Parliament for the strengthening of transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Transatlantic relations are at a turning point. We are witnessing a new era of transatlantic unity. This was most recently confirmed by the Condoleezza Rice, when she said that, rather than sitting back and analysing the state of the transatlantic alliance, we are putting the alliance to work. This is a timely and welcome development. As global partners, the EU and the United States must take the lead in building a prosperous and safe world and in promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We must work together to forge a common strategy to deal with global problems wherever possible. That is the message our leaders will doubtless seek to convey at the upcoming June summit.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush’s successful visit to Brussels last February was a sign of the United States Administration’s desire to reach out to Europe and work together in partnership with the European Union. It was an important signal that we have put the problems of approach that arose over Iraq behind us and that we are ready to work together in a constructive manner as allies. The United States is increasingly adopting a more open attitude to the European Union and listening more carefully to our concerns. Even where there are differences between us, we are learning how best to talk through them. A good example is the recently launched European Union-US Strategic Dialogue on East Asia, a forum in which to discuss the security challenges in the region, including those related to the rise of China. Coordination also continues on United Nations reform, though much work still needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-US summit on 20 June will focus on three global themes: promoting democratic governance and human rights around the world, increasing economic prosperity for our citizens and championing security and development. I would like to say a few words on each.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting democracy and freedom is the essence of President Bush’s foreign policy in his second term. European Union foreign policy, which is firmly based on the principles of the United Nations and the European Security Strategy, also aims to promote democracy, together with human rights and the rule of law. The promotion of democracy remains key in the wider Middle East and in the Mediterranean region, where transatlantic cooperation has increased substantially over the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly after our summit in Washington, we and the United States will co-host an international conference in Brussels on Iraq. This is an important signal of unified international support for the government and people in their difficult task of working towards stabilisation and reconstruction. In addition we have been in daily contact over Lebanon’s election process, and together we will continue to support the Lebanese people as they consolidate democracy. In Israel and Palestine, our cooperative approach within the Quartet is also intensifying.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic prosperity, the European Union and the United States have the most integrated economies in the world and benefit from the largest trade and investment relationship. But we can do more, and we want to. To move this agenda forward, we have spent nine months consulting all stakeholders on the obstacles they encountered and distilled the result in the recently published Commission communication, ‘A stronger EU-US Partnership and a more open market for the 21st century’. The communication contains a set of pragmatic proposals for boosting EU-US trade and investment and thus promoting competitiveness, growth, and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three basic strands to our proposals. First, regulating the transatlantic market, including areas such as services, investment, procurement and competition; second, promoting knowledge and innovation; and third, instituting smarter and safer borders for swifter trade and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of regulatory cooperation, the idea is to find ways for regulators to engage with each other at an early stage to avoid unnecessary conflicts and costs, and to promote convergence.</p>
<p class="contents">The second strand, on promoting knowledge and innovation, is crucial for generating economic growth and jobs. New technologies, in particular e-commerce, Internet governance and mobile telecommunication services, generated considerable interest amongst the stakeholders consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">The third strand of our package is striking the right balance between heightened security requirements and the continuation of open trade and passenger transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Our communication also addresses the overall structure and goals of transatlantic relations. The question we address is what the political profile of our relations should be 10 years after the signature of the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda and fifteen years after the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration. In essence, we must make sure that the structure and the goals of transatlantic relations are adapted to today’s challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to see legislators – the European Parliament and United States Congress – build stronger ties. For this reason we suggest enhancing the Transatlantic Legislators’ Dialogue and making it a fully-fledged transatlantic assembly. The Commission stands ready to assist as necessary, but an initiative of this nature naturally has to come first and foremost from this House and from the United States Congress.</p>
<p class="contents">Championing security and development is the third theme of the summit. As we continue to identify measures to enhance the security of our citizens against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it is worth remembering that such phenomena have claimed many more victims beyond our borders than within them. This reinforces our determination to work with the United States to spread the benefits of security in all its facets and to help release peoples everywhere from the daily tyranny of terrorism and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the United States should combine skills and experience in the field of conflict prevention and crisis response and bring to bear the full range of civilian and military tools at our disposal. We should consult routinely on current and potential crises. We should strengthen cooperation in post-conflict assistance and reconstruction. We should prepare, through joint training and exercises, and we should work together to improve international capacities to respond to crises and to prevent future crises from erupting. The European Union is anxious to cooperate with the United States on crisis management, both civilian and military.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recognise the need to tackle poverty, disease, corruption and instability, which terrorists seek to exploit and intensify. Our common agenda should prioritise the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission welcomes the Parliament’s motion for a resolution and, as I have indicated previously, we largely agree with it. We are taking an ambitious, forward-looking approach in developing our relations with the United States and are working actively in the areas mentioned in the draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a challenging agenda in front of us. We are looking forward to your support, and the support of United States Congress, to accomplish it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What makes the summit so very significant is that it resolves certain issues at the same time as setting certain processes in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic issues, solutions must be found, and agreements reached, with greater speed, for the two great democracies on opposite sides of the Atlantic are still, economically speaking, the world’s great powers. If they are capable of stimulating growth – and it is very important that they should, from the point of view of combating unemployment and improving the global situation as a whole – then they should do so within the bounds of a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="contents">That is important not least in terms of the overall political situation. We know from the unresolved developments in the world, and from the hazards and pressures that they bring, that it is only together that democracies can find solutions to these – not only on the basis of Nato, but also on the basis of what the European Union has come to acquire by way of powers and responsibilities in foreign and security policy, in legal and internal policies, and also in the sphere of economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It now remains for us to find a suitable framework for this, one in which we can properly develop this policy in future, and the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement we have proposed can play a crucial part in creating one.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested to read in the Commission communication that there was no political support for this, apart from in the US Congress and in this House. The Commission, though, appears to regard the support for it in both these places as irrelevant.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, consideration should be given to whether we might now be able to take a bold step forwards, and, instead of seeking the solution in the detail, mandating the Summit to examine, over the next 12 months, ways in which we can make progress in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Americans have treaties with almost everyone on the face of the earth, as does the European Union, but there is no treaty between the United States and the European Union. We should give some thought to the possibility of concluding one, thereby putting things on a better footing, instead of spending 30 years in the belief that the Airbus/Boeing dispute was at the heart of all we did and said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The world has not ground to a halt and some of the issues, in respect of which it is essential that the United States and the European Union reach agreement, cannot wait until our internal problems have been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is no denying that the atmosphere between the United States and Europe has improved, that does not mean that all conflicts are in the past. The EU must ensure that it manages to put across its issues to the US. The joint resolution that we will be adopting tomorrow contains a whole list of things that we believe should be on the agenda. I should like to single out three of them.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the question of how to deal with globalisation. Although it is impossible to sum up the debate on this subject in two minutes, it is clear that the joint economic weight of the European Union and the United States has given both of us influence and great responsibility. How can we incorporate the issues surrounding fair trade, the environment and a more social dimension into our position on economic globalisation?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am deeply worried about the spread of nuclear arms technology following the failure of the conference to review the non-proliferation Treaty. In essence, despite lengthy and careful preparations, the participating countries failed to reach agreement, not least because of the line taken by the Americans. It is possible that the Treaty, the legal basis for the non-proliferation regime, and therefore a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span>, has been considerably weakened, the implications of which cannot be overlooked. I would therefore call on the EU Member States and the US to table measures that can help restore confidence in the non-proliferation Treaty as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Closely related to this is, thirdly, the UN’s reform which will be debated in the autumn. I am pleased to establish that the President of the Council is aware of the importance of this agenda item. Although the need for reforms is being felt generally, the position of the United States is as yet unclear. I consider this agenda item to be a test of American views about the multilateral system and even about the future of the UN system as a whole. I sincerely hope that the European Union will receive promises of a constructive US position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Bush’s visit to the EU and a number of Member States seems to be heralding a new era. Needless to say, we would have been keen to welcome President Bush to this Chamber, but we have not given up hope of this happening yet.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, though, we seem to be united in terms of conditions to put an end to a difficult time in EU-US relations and to lay the foundations for renewed cooperation that must be based on mutual respect, equivalence and the determination to frame our joint efforts in the multilateral perspective of the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation and NATO. It goes without saying that unilateral initiatives that could lead to trade conflicts must be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have entered a time of reflection and possible review after the referenda in France and the Netherlands must not be allowed to adversely affect the proceedings of the forthcoming Summit. Ten years after the new transatlantic dialogue was laid down, it is high time we expanded it. This expanded dialogue must also leave room for us to express our concerns about the unacceptable conditions in the prison of Guantanamo Bay or about the restriction of personal freedom and privacy that can be the result of unilateral security initiatives. Both the US and we set great store by the worldwide spread of democracy, prosperity and human rights, although our views of how that should be done can differ. That does not mean that ours are inferior.</p>
<p class="contents">Facing, as we are, enormous challenges in terms of world poverty reduction, combating fatal diseases, peace in the Middle East, a peaceful settlement to the so-called frozen conflicts, I hope that both the Americans and the Europeans will be able to join forces effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the partners on opposite sides of the Atlantic have to understand just how very much they need each other if the values they share are to be defended and caused to prevail throughout the world. This means that the transatlantic summit is very important, for it will – it is to be hoped – help us to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say how glad I am that our American friends have not, following the failure of the EU’s Constitution to gain acceptance in France and the Netherlands, shown any pleasure in our misfortune. I am sure that many of us expected a different reaction, and that this is something we have to regard as a good sign.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, nevertheless, a number of defects in the motion for a resolution as presented, and it is for that reason that my group has tabled amendments to it, which I would now – briefly – like to present. One area they touch on is that of climate change. Only today, we read in the news reports that not even Tony Blair has managed to get the United States to make concessions where climate change is concerned; our American friends are still, lamentably, blocking the way to effective protection against climate change, at a time when we are becoming aware of just how strong the connection is between combating poverty on the one hand and protecting against climate change on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me turn to human rights and international law. In the US, Senator Biden has yet again highlighted how important it is in terms of our American friends’ public image that the prisoner of war camp in Guantánamo should be closed down. Just now, we have again been reading about the mutiny of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib. Both these camps, along with other illegal camps around the world, must be closed down as a matter of urgency, for they are a disgrace that flies in the face of the United States’ values.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to combat poverty, I see it as very, very important that we should not revert to competing to see who can invest most in armaments. Rather than allowing our age to be characterised by the setting of new records in spending on rearmament, we must do everything we can to discharge our responsibility to the world at large. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am talking about respect for human rights, for instance: the Guantanamo affair is not an isolated case, as demonstrated, for example, by the Abu Ghraib situation – which absolutely no one has mentioned – and the kidnapping of free citizens, as documented by the major European newspapers, which was carried out by the US Secret Service on European Union soil. We do not see anything and we do not say anything at all on the matter. There is also no mention of condemning preventative war, which is completely at odds with international law. Building transatlantic relations is achieved, moreover, by continually paying tribute to all forms of liberalism, and even – I heard it said by the Commission representative – by proposing to put services on the market of transatlantic relations, which up to now – fortunately – have been excluded from International Trade Organisation agreements and are still considered to be services for accessing rights, and not goods for generating profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I support this position, it is too restricted because it completely overlooks the eroding military balance in the state of Taiwan as well as the general regional stability in East Asia. These are geopolitical developments which give the US cause for concern about a possible European lifting of the arms embargo against Peking.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as appears to be the case, Brussels wants to give Washington sole and short-term responsibility for peace and security in the Far East, then a fresh crisis in transatlantic relations is looming in the distance in succession to Iraq. I hope that at the EU-US Summit on 20 June, the Council will prove this sombre scenario wrong. How can it do this? It can do it by joining with the Americans in taking responsibility, in taking real responsibility for geopolitical stability in Asia.

There was a debate only last January, which was followed by a resolution, and we now have a Euro-Atlantic Summit in Washington at the end of June, to name but a few. That is all useful and interesting of course, but there is still room for improvement in those relations, primarily by way of a change of mentality. For example, we are all agreed that the fight against terrorism on the one hand, and the promotion of democracy and peace in the world on the other, can only be successful if our partnership with the United States is reinforced, based on the western values we share.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to translating the principles into practice, though, things invariably go wrong. A perfect example is the European Council’s intention to remove the arms embargo against China. The US’s opposition to those plans is entirely appropriate. There is absolutely no point in paying lip service to democratisation in the rest of the world if, in practice, we do exactly the opposite by accommodating the wishes of a Chinese regime that is still as dictatorial as in the days when it crushed the protests on Tiananmen Square. We as Europeans should therefore search our own hearts from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">In this part-session, I have heard the situation in Guantanamo Bay being discussed in various debates. Far be it from me to deny that we have a problem there, but constantly harping on about this issue does, however, reveal a certain level of hypocrisy on our part, certainly if we take the European shortcomings in fighting terrorism into consideration.</p>

<p class="contents">I should also like to raise two points. First, I should like to point out that, during the cold war, Europe was the theatre of strategic operations and that the perception of threats was the same on both sides of the Atlantic. This changed after the end of the cold war, German reunification, the collapse of the Soviet Union and 11 September. The theatres of strategic operations have changed, but the real difference is in the perception of threats on both sides of the Atlantic; and if the perception of threats has changed, then so too must the strategies and operating methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas in Europe we have developed a multilateral concept of soft power, in other words diplomacy, economic sanctions and political sanctions, the United States has become more inclined, after 11 September, towards hard power, namely the idea of unilateralism and of ‘with others if possible, by ourselves if necessary’. The two concepts and perceptions of threat on either side of the Atlantic have thus grown apart.</p>
<p class="contents">Attempts are ongoing to strike a balance whereby soft power becomes less soft and hard power less hard, and, more importantly, the perception of threats and the means of combating those threats are consistent and complementary. This is the key objective of any transatlantic summit.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second objective, which concerns the area of trade, both on a bilateral level, but also in particular with regard to its concerted attack in the area of globalisation and the World Trade Organisation. It is appalling that social dumping and environmental dumping, which jeopardise jobs in Europe and are at the heart of unfair competition, can be allowed to continue unchecked in the world and to continue to act to our detriment. Unless the EU and the United States can join forces on this issue, it will be very difficult to prevent this from happening, and the consequence will sooner or later be a form of protectionism that will itself be unbridled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is the need for the United States of America, and Europe, to use the wealth they have created to help those less well-off to achieve similar prosperity. I believe that the British Presidency is planning to do something about this shortly, and we can play our part in it, even though we may disagree about one thing or another.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need, not only to take pride in the democracy and freedom that we have established in our own countries, but also to offer them to others as instruments of development. I quite deliberately say ‘offer’ rather than ‘impose’, for offering is what we have done in Europe itself, in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans – which I mention because I have just been told that a large party of visitors from Macedonia is present – and it is surely what we intend to do in the Middle East as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard the Middle East as a very unstable region and a very important one. We, Americans and Europeans alike, agree that everyone who lives in these countries needs democracy and development – free development in particular – as a means towards peace. This makes it particularly important that Europe and the USA should cooperate with one another. Let me reiterate, though, that the approach to be adopted must be that of enabling people to establish freedom and democracy in their own countries, without feeling that these have been imposed upon them.</p>

There are many areas of work in which the shared values of both partners directly coincide. The United States of America has recently taken the lead in openly encouraging the establishment of democracy in the Arabian Peninsula. The European Union has set up the unique Euro-Mediterranean Partnership: quieter, in-depth work, helping to establish the rule of law and rights-based legislation in North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Dialogue between these two key actors is not enough. Our whole world is now riven by conflict and insecurity, from weapons of mass destruction, which sadly do exist, to the continued act of genocide in different countries. Our citizens and the world’s citizens are in danger. Full-scale cooperation between the European Union and the United States of America, as well as with other key democracies such as India, is a prerequisite for peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should therefore start work on a resolution on mutually beneficial, balanced and forward-looking relations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must beware of sensitive topics, however. Inhumane and degrading conditions in certain US prisons must be kept secret. It is essential to make loud declarations of cooperation in the war on terror and bioterrorism and to attempt to uncover the sources of funding for terrorism. What do we not mention in our resolution? The sources of modern arms for terrorist organisations, cooperation in removing nuclear weapons from the Middle East and ending support for terrorists in Central Asia, the Caucasus and Western and Central Africa. It is certainly no easy matter to tell a stronger partner one’s views openly and clearly. We may criticise Turkey and Russia, however, and perhaps even Bangladesh.</p>

At the time Europe was weak in both economic and military terms, and without such assistance it would have been unable to defeat the Nazis or to put up at least partial opposition to the Communist dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand today, the EU is incapable of ensuring its own security unless it engages in military and political cooperation with the United States. Instances in the past when we joined forces, excellent examples of which include Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s and, more recently, Afghanistan, should serve as a blueprint for our future military and political cooperation. The significance of this cooperation is plain to see in Central and Eastern Europe, and NATO enlargement is proof that this region is regarded as a credible partner.</p>
<p class="contents">A sense of security is particularly important for countries whose history has been one of great suffering, such as Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland. These countries were deprived of their sovereignty for many decades because they had no partner prepared to perform the duties of an ally without hesitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic cooperation is of course an inherent feature of harmonious political cooperation. It is in Europe’s vital interests to prevent an economic war with the United States, and after all we are currently the two largest trade partners in the world. This should be the line taken by Parliament in the run-up to the June summit, and we should send out a clear message that our policy is underpinned by credible partners who share our values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not forget that Asia is gaining ever more importance as a political and economic power in the shadow of the bizarre rivalry between America and Europe, and the conclusions we should draw from this are as follows. Instead of waging a nonsensical economic war, what is needed is close cooperation. We may well have grounds for complaint about the USA’s economic perfectionism, but we should still be more flexible on economic issues.</p>

Bush to Brussels a few months ago, but it is interesting that in the international press this is not yet recognised. It would be nice, Mr President-in-Office, if you could show, when you are in Washington with the Commission, that we can make a real step forward in EU-US relations. Clearly there are a whole range of issues of a political and security nature on this agenda to which you have referred, particularly the political challenges dealing with democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It would be nice, Mr President-in-Office, if you would listen to my contribution, because I would like to draw your attention to one particular issue on the economic side. It is through the economics that we must drive this particular relationship. That is where the businesses want the remaining barriers to trade and investment to be removed. That is where an OECD report released this week shows that if we go for growth and remove these barriers, we could be adding 2 to 3% GDP per capita in Europe as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like the summit to be able to set out an ambitious agenda, a vision of how these remaining obstacles can be reduced and removed, to have a route map, to be able to have a clear timetable so that we would be able not only to stimulate our economies, but to bring Europe and America closer together. To do that you are going to need the cooperation of this House. You have spoken about the cooperation between this House and that of the US Congress, the significant support in this House for this concept, and also for a broader partnership framework between the United States and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to you, to Mr Juncker as President-in-Office of the Council, and to Mr Barroso, to take the leadership and to make sure we do not miss out on this opportunity for a strengthened European-American relationship which will not only be good bilaterally, but will also enable us to face the multilateral global challenges, a relationship without which they will not be resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commission on its statement, for it has taken a bold step. Politically, we have had a rough ride, and it was for a long time unclear what, if anything, we could achieve in the course of preparations for this summit. Written and oral statements have been made, and these take us a step further. By these I mean particularly the proposals for cooperation in the negotiation of specific agreements, in the field of new technologies and, most especially, in research and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things are right, proper and important. I am especially glad that the Commission has ventured for the first time to use the term ‘transatlantic market’ and also to find a way of describing what it is – still rather cryptically, it has to be admitted, but it is going down the right road. This is something that this House has frequently addressed in its resolutions. We are very well-advised to acknowledge the reality of what we already have, which is an integrated market. I might add that the OECD study to which Mr Elles referred not only says that we will achieve growth if we press on with integrating the market only within Europe – from which, according to the study, Europe will derive greater benefit than the United States – it also says that we must do this throughout the world, which is an extremely important point. If we benefit from this, then the other countries will do likewise, and so we should take very careful note of what this study has to say.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to congratulate the Commission on the study it initiated. It is a good job of work and will enable us to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my last point: here, too, we see the Commission taking on board a proposal from this House; in this instance, that we should work together more closely in the sphere of inter-parliamentary exchange. Mr Jonathan Evans will be saying more about that later. It is an important point, and I propose that we should have further discussions of everything the Commission is proposing – which the Summit will, I hope, take on board – in an inter-parliamentary context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can only hope that the good news will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">There are further hurdles to overcome, however. One of the most significant obstacles we are currently facing is the restrictions on entry into the United States imposed on the citizens of certain EU Member States, or in other words visa restrictions. Many people in Europe regard practices of this kind as discriminatory, not least because they amount to unequal treatment of EU Member States. This view is particularly widespread among the public in countries such as my own, Poland, and the other Central European countries whose citizens continue to need visas to enter the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind the House that the changes we recently made to the reciprocity mechanism mean that the EU’s visa policy is coordinated at Community level. It is now the Commission, and not the Member States or the Council, which takes the decision to impose sanctions on a third country. It is therefore also the Commission’s duty to ensure that all citizens and all EU Member States enjoy equal rights. I hope that this issue will be raised during the forthcoming summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I should like to address is the need for cooperation between the European Union and the United States in support of democracy and human rights, in particular in the post-Soviet space. Europe and America must speak with one voice on this issue, as they did during the Orange Revolution or when Dr Condoleezza Rice and Mr Solana made their recent declaration on support for the Belarussian opposition. Words are not enough, however, and what is needed is joint action. It is an unfortunate fact that Europe is lagging behind America in this respect. We are less flexible than the Americans and too slow and bureaucratic in the way we take action. This is particularly true in the case of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our attention should be focused on ensuring that the European Union and America speak with one voice and take joint action on issues relating to the promotion of democracy and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resurgence of democracy we are seeing in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and Africa means that the European Union and the USA must coordinate their action to promote democratic values, to monitor free elections, to encourage the formation of political parties, trade unions and independent civil society organisations and to defend the freedom of the media.</p>

Apart from the fact that the IMF has partly failed in its role of monitoring global economic stability by failing to anticipate – or indeed by actually provoking – a number of regional and international financial crises, we need to assess with the US the negative impact of the conditions, based on the Washington consensus, which the IMF imposes on countries requesting its assistance.</p>

We also know that there are still many problems in defining better-coordinated positions. These have been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to global warming, our positions are still a long way apart and we know that, without the US, the Kyoto agreement is doomed to failure. This is therefore something to be discussed with the Americans, with the aim of finally getting them to share this multilateral approach to global warming.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the United Nations system is another thorny issue, and no true UN reform is possible without US support. In terms of development policy – as we have already heard, in part, in relation to the Bretton Woods institutions – the Americans, with the Europeans, can really change course and move towards the Millennium objectives in order to generate a new momentum. A lot of work still has to be done in all these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have made considerable progress in dealing with major crises and serious international problems such as the Middle East, Iran or Sudan. These are all areas where progress has been made through joint action by Europe and the US in searching for solutions. I also noted a remark made by many of you that we should, nonetheless, perhaps be thinking about developing the framework for transatlantic relations. It is slightly curious that two partners who, in principle, are so close to one another, do not have a framework, but rather, in practice, base their relations and cooperation on a mere declaration. Is this possibly because they <span class="italic">are</span> such close partners? That is perhaps a point worth further reflection. However, I believe that in future we must seriously consider whether it is time to provide a more precise and defined framework for transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, it is clear from your debates that the forthcoming summit is an important meeting, a meeting which must consolidate the progress made, which must continue to develop our relations in those areas where we have so far been unable to find common ground, and which must also cement the improvement in transatlantic relations which we have seen since the start of this year. The Luxembourg Presidency, in any event, attaches great importance to this summit and we are very keen for it to be a success – a success for Europe. This is important because Europe also has to prove to the Americans that it is still capable of action and that internal problems are not restricting its ability to act in the international arena. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, as I have said before, there is a reinvigorated willingness to strengthen EU-US relations. This stems from both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">In the political field we have seen cooperation on issues dealing with Iraq, Iran, Sudan, the southern Caucasus, Central Asia and Belarus, not to mention the broader Middle East and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic front, much is in place already, but clearly more can be done and we are working together to move in that direction. It is true that difficulties arise in the field of trade, but it is also true that our difficulties can hopefully be solved more frequently through dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Boeing-Airbus issue, it is unfortunate that last week the United States decided to leave the negotiating table and request a formal dispute settlement procedure in the WTO in respect of alleged subsidies provided to Airbus. In turn, we decided to resume action in the WTO on the subsidies given to Boeing. Commissioner Mandelson’s preferred solution since he took up office last November has been to settle the dispute through negotiations. A negotiated solution may still eventually be reached following the WTO rulings, but at this point in time the Commission has to protect the interests of Airbus against Boeing. Despite the regrettable escalation of this dispute, I am confident that recent developments will not affect our bilateral and multilateral cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of security measures, both the EU and the US have taken many steps to increase security. However, we must try to minimise their impact on trade and travel by developing global security standards and enhancing our customs cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Mann for her explicit support for the Commission’s communication and the study on EU-US relations which we commissioned.</p>
<p class="contents">On your repeated call for a transatlantic market to be completed by 2015, the Commission very much shares the objective of further enhancing our already flourishing bilateral EU-US economic relationship. Indeed, through the 1998 transatlantic economic partnership and the 2002 positive economic agenda, the Commission has been pursuing the same goal, i.e. identifying and possibly eliminating obstacles, particularly in the field of regulations, and ensuring the smooth functioning of this relationship. Equally, the recently published communication aims to boost EU-US trade and investment, and the creation of a regulatory cooperation forum foreseen by the communication would address regulatory obstacles. A transatlantic market is already an economic reality, while the elimination of obstacles to trade and investment is an incremental process and we are taking steps in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">On globalisation, we intend to commit ourselves to concluding the Doha Development Round Agenda within the next 12 months at the EU-US summit.</p>
<p class="contents">On visas for the citizens of the ten Member States not benefiting from the US visa-waiver programme, I can assure you that we are continuing to urge the US at all levels to recognise the new economic, social and political realities in the ten Member States which acceded to the European Union last year and which should be treated the same as the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome in this context the new US visa roadmap for Poland and the planned extension to the other Member States which joined at the last enlargement. This is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">On climate change, we are negotiating with the US on an environment declaration. We would like to see a substantial commitment to working towards a long-term international regime on climate change post-2012. We will, therefore, be working to relaunch a high-level EU-US dialogue on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your call for an EU-US partnership agreement, I acknowledge that we maintain Treaty relations with the majority of third countries around the globe, yet have no such treaty with our most important partner. Because we already have solid cooperation, we do not see a need for a transatlantic agreement that would involve long formal negotiations without changing much in substance. It needs also to be stressed that the transatlantic difficulties of the past were political and not institutional in nature. The elaboration and defence of consistent EU positions vis-à-vis the US do not depend on the existence of a treaty-based structure.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, there is a strong case for reviewing our existing structures and revamping and modernising the new transatlantic agenda of 1995 to adapt it to current needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and in conclusion, I should like to underline again that you are fundamental actors in this strategic alliance and we rely on your support to implement our common agenda. The communication encourages the setting up of a transatlantic assembly. Such an assembly could be held in conjunction with the summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
