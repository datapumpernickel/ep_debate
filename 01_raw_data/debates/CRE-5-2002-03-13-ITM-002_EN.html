(ES) </span>Mr President, before turning to enlargement, which is the topic of today’s debate, I should like, if I may, to say a few words on the situation in the Middle East. Firstly, I wish to endorse the statement you just made. It is entirely appropriate and has my full support.</p>
<p class="contents">We have long been involved in intense political and diplomatic activity aimed at finding a solution to the current situation in the Middle East and to the violence spiralling out of control in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, the approach adopted by the European Union and the Council is based on the firm belief that there can be no military solution to the conflict. I feel we are all agreed on that. A peace process is therefore the only option, and that process must involve the peaceful coexistence of two states in the region. On the one hand, there is the State of Israel, with internationally recognised borders and the right to feel secure, and on the other a Palestinian State that needs to be viable in every sense, especially as regards its political, economic, social and territorial dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present circumstances, however, our main aim must be to achieve a ceasefire. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to express my support for the United Nations Security Council resolution, as is right and proper. On behalf of the European Council I would like to add our voice to those calling for an immediate ceasefire. It would then be possible for us to work together on security issues. The political dimension could be brought back into the process. This is essential to reaching a solution. Economic issues must also come into play, given the terrible living conditions and dreadful situation currently prevailing in the Palestinian Territories.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great deal to be done. A number of initiatives and ideas have been put forward. I should like to endorse the initiative launched by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. I believe it represents a good basis for further progress. It would be helpful if it received the support of the Arab League at its summit in Beirut at the end of this month. It is essential to get the peace process back on track. I should emphasise once again how important it is for the international community to work together to that end, as stated in that Security Council resolution and by a number of speakers in the House today.</p>
<p class="contents">We all realise that the United States has to be involved in any solution to the conflict. Nonetheless, we are also convinced that it does not have to be the prime mover in finding that solution. The European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations must work together. In addition, the whole Arab world as represented by the Arab League, and certain states in particular, must also be involved in this concerted approach. It should then at last be possible to convince both sides of the need to put an end to this fruitless cycle of actions and reactions. We are all aware of what the outcome has to be, and this makes the suffering and deaths even more senseless, if that were possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe we must persevere with this approach. I am very grateful for what you have said and for the support of the House. We shall persevere along these lines. We are working on a declaration for the European Council to be held in Barcelona the day after tomorrow. The declaration is being drafted in the clearest, most categorical and specific form possible. I trust that this declaration will be endorsed by other international players present and also that it will be a step towards attaining that longed-for peace which often still seems to be light years away.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should now like to move on to the subject of this first speech, namely the enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is abundantly clear that the impending enlargement represents one of the greatest strategic challenges the European Union has faced since its creation. As you are aware, it is one of the key priorities for the Spanish Presidency. The overriding political importance of this venture was made quite clear at Nice, when a road map setting out our objectives for the half year was devised.</p>
<p class="contents">A clear timeframe was then drawn up at Gothenburg. It was stated that negotiations with all those countries sufficiently prepared should be completed by the end of 2002. The next step was taken at Laeken, when the terms of this final stage of negotiations were confirmed. It was also stated that if the present rate of progress was maintained, up to 10 countries could be ready. In addition, specific terms were laid down for the conduct of negotiations. These terms must and will be adhered to, to ensure a successful outcome. On the one hand, there must be compliance with the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, and on the other, with the Berlin financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth emphasising the magnitude of this challenge. It involves bringing into the Union countries that were military dictatorships with planned economies barely fifteen years ago. I am referring to the countries of Eastern Europe, most of which belonged to a military alliance opposed to the North Atlantic Alliance. I would remind you again that I am only casting my mind back fifteen years at most.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the fundamental changes that happened so quickly, this enlargement has taken on its own specific characteristics. It differs significantly from previous enlargements, and therefore has its own particular nature.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the programme, my country’s main aim whilst it holds the Presidency-in-Office of the Council in the coming six months is to achieve common positions on the chapters which have fallen to us by virtue of the timetable. It will be for our Presidency to close these outstanding chapters. I am referring to the budgetary and financial aspects of the common agricultural policy, and regional policy, notably the Structural and Cohesion Funds, in addition to financial and budgetary provisions. Finally, there is the chapter on institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we are dealing with very difficult and complex chapters. They represent approximately 80% of the Community budget. This in itself is an indication of the size of the challenge we have before us. No effort will be spared in the pursuit of our aim. One reason is that we are aware that any delay could jeopardise the entire venture.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on these chapters was opened with the Commission’s presentation on a communication concerning the financial framework for enlargement. I imagine that further details will follow. The Commission also presented horizontal documents on regional and agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues have already been dealt with in the Council. They have been debated seriously and in depth. The Commission has now undertaken to present draft common positions during March if possible, or failing that, in early April, depending on the outcome of the discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is favourably inclined towards these documents. We believe that they provide a fair and sound basis for negotiations. Their content is reasonable, balanced, and in line with the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and the Berlin financial ceilings, as agreed at the Laeken Council. We are now at a critical juncture. Consequently, we shall try to ensure that the possible attempts to reform common policies do not interfere or overlap with the enlargement negotiations, because if they do, enlargement will inevitably be delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is fully committed to discharging this responsibility successfully. Nonetheless, as I mentioned earlier, we are aware that these are the most complex and sensitive chapters of the negotiations. We do not envisage opposition to reforming the main policies on expenditure. Rather, it is a case of stressing the importance of keeping to the agreed timetable, and therefore following a different course from that set for the enlargement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In discharging its responsibility, the Presidency knows it can count on the good will of the Member States. They are all aware of the significance of the task in hand. We also trust we can rely on the Commission’s support. The Commission has presented the horizontal documents on regional policy, agriculture and the financial framework for enlargement. It has also canvassed the opinions of the Member States. As I mentioned earlier, the next stage will come within a few days when the Commission presents to the Council draft common positions acceptable to the Member States and negotiable with the candidate countries. I have to say that the Commission is doing an excellent job. The Commissioner responsible deserves particular recognition. He is present here today and I should like to take this opportunity to thank him for all he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency also hopes it can rely on support from the candidate countries. They are making a great effort to adopt the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and implement it effectively, but they will also be called upon to make an effort to be realistic at the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">A preliminary debate has already taken place in the Council in its various configurations: the General Affairs Council, the Agriculture Council and Ecofin, for instance. It has become clear that Member States have different points of view and sensitivities. That is only to be expected. Nonetheless, I am convinced that in the course of these discussions we shall arrive at consistent positions we all agree on. They should also be acceptable to the candidate countries because, ultimately, we need to come up with a solution amounting to a fair compromise between a whole range of demands. In the first place, there is the political priority of enlargement. Secondly, compliance with the rationale underpinning the negotiations, namely the transposition and effective implementation of the entire <span class="italic">acquis</span>. This applies to everyone, and there is no scope for differentiated systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as I mentioned previously, it is essential to comply with the budgetary ceilings set in Berlin. Lastly, it is important to take on board the reasonable expectations of the candidate countries and respond positively.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident we will all work together to reach such agreement, overcoming the difficulties we are currently experiencing as a result of the sensitive nature of these chapters in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to adopt common positions on these chapters with financial implications and try to provisionally close the chapters that could not be closed earlier because of the specific difficulties involved. In addition, we propose to set in train a range of measures designed to facilitate the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the committee charged with drafting the Act of Accession and related instruments will begin work. The committee is to start operations at once, cooperating closely with the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, during these six months, the Commission will submit the action plan on compliance with the third criterion for enlargement. This is the so-called Madrid criterion regarding effective implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>by each of the candidate countries, a crucially important issue at this stage in the negotiations. This issue is on the agenda for the Seville European Council in June of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">During our Presidency we also aim to open all outstanding chapters with Bulgaria and if possible, with Romania too. Obviously this will only happen if the Commission and the two countries concerned supply the Council with the necessary information and comply with other requirements. Bulgaria and Romania have certainly made a great effort to move forward. This was recognised at Laeken, and I am pleased to be able to commend them for it in the House as well. It is important to continue sending out positive signals to these two countries regarding our commitment to their participation in the enlargement process. Hopefully this will come about very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to deal with Cyprus separately. Reunification is not a precondition for accession, though clearly a solution to the current situation would make things very much easier. Throughout its Presidency, Spain will fully support the United Nations’ efforts to resolve the situation. It is to be hoped that the prospect of enlargement will be an incentive to put an end to the division of the island.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, further to the Laeken conclusions, the Spanish Presidency will press ahead with the pre-accession strategy for Turkey. The aim is to move to a new stage in Turkey’s preparation for approximation to the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, taking into account the extent to which the country has complied with the Copenhagen political criteria, and with a view to setting new objectives in the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have many important commitments and tasks to deal with during these six months in order to maintain the momentum of the negotiating process. The ultimate aim is to ensure that we are in a position to conclude negotiations with those candidate countries that are genuinely ready by the Copenhagen European Council at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced of the importance of bringing the enlargement process to a successful conclusion. It is morally necessary for Madrid, Barcelona, Berlin or Rome to be deemed as European as Prague, Budapest or Ljubljana. Furthermore, non-enlargement would have very serious implications both for the present Member States of the Union and for those prevented from joining it. As Spain’s Foreign Minister, I am delighted to inform you that eurobarometer’s readings put my country at the top of the list of countries whose citizens are most in favour of enlargement. The Government of Spain is certainly fully behind the people on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The political situation in Member States where elections are due to take place shortly must not be allowed to affect the enlargement process. The latter must not be affected either by the tragic events of 11 September. Our joint determination to attain the goals we set ourselves at Nice, Gothenburg and Laeken has to prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the present time requires us to demonstrate that all the political institutions of the European Union share common ground and a determination that the violence in the Middle East should come to an end and that common sense<span class="italic"> </span>must be given a chance.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me now turn to the subject of our debate. In terms of enlargement, 2002 will indeed be a most decisive year. The European Councils in Gothenburg and Laeken, and Parliament's decisions on the subject, have given rise to such political momentum and created such a level of response that this process can now be delayed no longer. Any delaying tactic would now have unmanageable and perilous consequences and could lead to the political and economic stability now achieved across the whole region between the Baltic and the Black Sea being jeopardised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still, then, our objective to welcome all those candidate countries that are sufficiently prepared as new members before the 2004 European elections, and prospects for this are good. Negotiations are progressing according to plan, and we are adhering fully to the timetable. The Spanish Presidency's excellent cooperation gives me confidence that, under it, negotiations will be successfully completed on all the chapters – with the exception of the financial package and the ‘institutions’ chapter – with the ten countries that, at Laeken, were named as potential candidates for membership in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As envisaged in the road map, the Commission will, in the coming weeks, be submitting drafts of the common positions on the chapters on agriculture, regional policy, budgets and institutions. Apart from that, we intend this year to open all the outstanding negotiating chapters with Bulgaria and Romania and to present a more developed and enhanced strategy to prepare these countries for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to deal with a number of political issues which have, in recent weeks, and to some extent in recent days, shown themselves to be potentially problematic or possible obstacles. I will start by referring to the discussions on the Beneš Decrees. It is the Commission's view that this is not just a legal problem, but primarily a political and moral issue, a solution to which has for some years been sought by the Commission and by many others in many, many confidential discussions. The Commission takes the view that those Beneš Decrees that refer to the expropriation of property conflict both with present-day Czech and European legislation, and are therefore obsolete and of no further effect. It should therefore be our common endeavour to get back to objective reality on this issue and not have the process of enlargement laden down with issues that belong to the past.</p>
<p class="contents">An understanding has to be reached which will allow all the parties concerned to maintain stable and lasting relations with each other in a spirit of good neighbourliness and to shape Europe's future together. The question that is significant in terms of coexistence within the European Union is whether Czech legal practice on the reconveyance of property results in discriminatory effects. I have noted with satisfaction that the Czech government, for its part, is examining this question, and I also welcome Parliament's request for an independent opinion on the matter. The Commission, too, is at present re-examining all the legal aspects of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am already able, though, to tell you today that the Czech government has declared to the Commission its readiness to act and ask the Czech legislature to change the legal position if it should transpire that present legal practice cannot be reconciled with European law.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue to which we have had to give closer attention this year has been that of the future of the Kaliningrad region. On completion of Poland and Lithuania’s accession processes, Kaliningrad will become a Russian enclave within the European Union. The Russian government has raised a range of issues on the problems of access, cross-border travel and energy supply. It is my belief that we have to consider these topics in the overall context of the development of the Baltic region as a whole. Substantially more than just agreement on a transit order is at stake, and a great deal more than a solution to the question of visas. As regards transit arrangements and the visa issue, we are seeking an arrangement within the framework of the existing Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already, over the past year, set out its thinking on the issues to be dealt with and emphasised its willingness to enter into dialogue. Such discussions need now to be continued in a purposeful way within the framework of the existing EU/Russian bodies. I would, though, like to make it clear that separate negotiations with Russia on the Kaliningrad issue cannot be carried on within the framework of the enlargement process. We are unable to engage in negotiations on the rights of third parties and, above all, cannot come to any agreements to their detriment.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisive question will be how the Kaliningrad region can successfully be included in the dynamic of the Baltic region's development. The real problem will be the growing socio-economic gulf between Poland and Lithuania on the one hand and the Kaliningrad region on the other, which will ensue if a way cannot be found to make possible Kaliningrad's involvement in the region's increasing economic dynamism. We must reduce this gap if the spurt of growth that will result from enlargement is not to give rise to social and political tensions in this part of the Baltic region, for the real danger is of the development gap leading to potentially explosive social and political tensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add to what has been said on the subject of Cyprus. Last week, I had the opportunity to hold a series of political discussions in Cyprus, notably with the leaders of the two communities, Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash. I came home from Cyprus thoroughly encouraged, with the impression that both leaders of the negotiating teams in the ongoing face-to-face discussions on a possible resolution of the Cyprus question are striving in earnest and with determination and commitment towards a lasting political solution. No breakthrough has as yet been achieved, and there are as yet no definite agreements, but I could see that convergence has been achieved to an extent that would have been considered impossible even only a short time ago. So I want again to encourage both sides to pursue these discussions in a constructive fashion and make use of this window of opportunity to come to a sustainable and durable peace settlement in good time for the accession negotiations to be completed.</p>
<p class="contents">I derive particular satisfaction from the fact that both Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash assured me that it is still their objective to reach political agreement by June of this year. The Commission remains in close contact with the United Nations in order to ensure that any political solution is compatible with the provisions of European law in force. It is from our point of view crucial that Cyprus, being subject to international law, should be able to act at an international level, speaking with one voice in the institutions of the European Union and should be able to implement and enforce within its own territory the international undertakings that it enters into.</p>
<p class="contents">On 30 January, the Commission presented its proposals for a common financial framework for enlargement, our objective being to guarantee the coherence of the negotiations on agricultural policy, structural policy, and on the budget chapter. Over and above that, we want enlargement to come about under conditions acceptable to all sides. There must not be second-class membership, nor will there be. Enlargement must, though, be on a sound financial footing and also manageable in the long term. In preparing the common negotiating position in the coming weeks, the Commission will be guided by the following principles: Firstly, that the ground rules have been clear ever since the 1999 Berlin decision on Agenda 2000. The Berlin global upper limits will not be exceeded even if we now accept up to ten new Member States, whereas the decisions taken in Berlin assumed six.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the new Member States are, in principle, to participate in all common policy areas, in certain cases only after agreed transitional periods, although it should be noted that such transitional periods may be requested both by the candidate countries and also, in individual cases, by us.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new Member States are not to be financially worse off after joining than they were before it. It goes without saying that we cannot tolerate a situation in which those who will be our poorest members will, in the early years of their membership, be paying for their richer counterparts. It is, then, absolutely unacceptable that the new members should be in a net position from the very start.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, our proposals are not under any circumstances to prejudice the form that Community policies may take in the future. That also applies to agricultural policy. The Commission's proposals do not, therefore, in any way prejudge the next financial perspective for the post-2006 period. You will be aware that our package is, above all, one of structural aid, as it is in this area that there is the greatest need. Perhaps I should just quote some figures. Of the overall package alone, 76% is allocated to structural and cohesion measures and to measures in the rural development area. Of the financial package as a whole, 76% will take the form of direct investments in the development of these countries. It is only in the cohesion fund, but not in the structural fund, that we are proposing to increase resources, thus putting the emphasis on projects in the areas of the environment and transport infrastructure, where the need is greatest and in respect of which the candidate countries have, in the course of negotiations, entered into commitments which we must help them to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers it particularly necessary to emphasise the development of rural areas in order to actively promote structural measures in rural areas and make use of the opportunity for restructuring. It is true that, in Berlin, no exact calculations were made as regards direct income aid for farmers in the period up to 2006, but I must point out that the Commission remarked at three points in the memoranda that accompanied Agenda 2000 that the <span class="italic">acquis</span> is a unity, that there cannot, in the long term, be two agricultural policy systems alongside each other and that direct aid forms part of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. We must, then deal with this issue at the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">After accession, the new Member States will pay full contributions to the budget, whilst some of the structural and agricultural policy measures will become effective in budget terms only after a certain time delay. As in previous enlargement rounds, the Commission will therefore provide for the facilitation in principle of lump-sum compensation in the budget. Practical details of this can, of course, be decided only at the very end of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission's point of view, the package now on the table is balanced both in terms of policy and content. The plan is still in place. Negotiations are progressing at a brisk pace. The next stage is clearly mapped out. Up until the European Council in Seville, the task in hand will be to work out a common EU negotiating position on agricultural policy, structural policy, on the budget chapter and on the institutional chapter, and the course taken so far by discussions in the Council leaves me confident that that will also be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission will be presenting a report to the European Council in Seville on the realisation of the action plans to build up administrative capacity in the candidate countries. At the end of October this year, the European Council, under the Danish Presidency, will consider the progress reports for 2002 and the Commission's actual recommendations, which will relate to the question of with which candidate countries negotiations may be formally concluded at the European Council in Copenhagen at the end of this year. This can, at the same time, introduce the concluding phase of negotiations. Continued close cooperation and Parliament's political support will be indispensable to reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group, that of the European People's Party/European Democrats, supports the general directions taken both by the President-in-Office of the Council and by Commissioner Verheugen. In saying, at the end of his speech, that Parliament's support is indispensable, the Commissioner was expressing a truth. We, too, hope that the whole process in which we find ourselves will lead to an outcome that will enable the Council, the Commission, and Parliament to declare themselves satisfied with it and to adopt what the negotiations have produced.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Commissioner Verheugen, the President-in-Office of the Council again put the emphasis on timing. It was indeed our Group that proposed that the negotiations should be conducted in such a way that the first countries to join the EU should be able to take part in the 2004 European elections. This makes it necessary that we should complete negotiations by the end of this year and by the beginning of 2003 at the latest. I hope that this will be possible under the Danish Presidency, for the completion of the negotiations would complete the cycle that began when the Copenhagen criteria were laid down ten years ago. It is also beautifully symbolic in a particular way that the Presidency at this important stage is held by Spain, a country of the South, thus focusing attention on the significance of the centre of Europe and expressing our common political intention that EU enlargement – which of course involves Cyprus and Malta, but mainly the central European states – should not be about the interests of a few Member States of the European Union, but about our common interest, that of all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is of course still much work to be done, as we all know. We should not now give any country a guarantee and tell them that they are in whatever happens; rather, every country must make the effort so that we can achieve satisfactory outcomes at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that many chapters still have to be negotiated on. Whilst hoping for results on them, we also say – and, whilst not being an expert on agriculture myself, I do say this for my own part also – that our farmers have, in the European Union, Agenda 2000 to protect their legitimate expectations, and we see the mid-term review, to be presented by Commissioner Fischler, not as being about various things that actually have nothing to do with enlargement, but we want to safeguard our farmers' confidence as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, Kaliningrad has been mentioned, and, Mr Verheugen, I emphatically support what you said. I recently spoke with the Mayor of Pillau, which is in the Western part of the Kaliningrad region, where there is very great interest in the possibility of direct contact with the Commission in Brussels and a concern that not everything should be done via Moscow, which is a long way away. Perhaps, in our discussions with Russia, we might also ensure that there are immediate and direct links between Kaliningrad, formerly Königsberg, and the European Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to mention the Ukraine, the western part of which, as we know, was formerly eastern Poland. However much we, naturally, have to guarantee border security – and we must make every effort to ensure that the Mafia, drug trafficking and serious crime cannot get into the European Union across Poland's eastern border – we should, at the same time, be flexible in order that the people there who have ties across the border, who live in Western Ukraine and are of Polish origin, may also have flexible solutions in their dealings with Poland, so that no new Iron Curtain may descend there to separate people from each other. I believe that this will be of immense significance as regards our relations with the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we – Council, Commission and Parliament – have a common task, in that we need to work much harder at persuading people, not only in the candidate countries but also in the European Union, that the membership of the central European countries and also Malta and Cyprus is a massive opportunity for the European Union – and particularly for the countries of central Europe – to establish stability on our continent. It is, though, also an economic opportunity, as trade between the European Union and the central European states has in the meantime almost equalled in scale our trade with the United States of America. This unleashes a dynamic that is to the benefit of all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">If, when considering enlargement, we cast our eyes eastwards in particular, it is very important that we, especially in days like these – so we thank you again, Mr President, for your initiative on the Middle East – also look southwards, to the Mediterranean region. Eastward enlargement enjoys equal priority with our relations with the Mediterranean countries and with the Arab and Islamic world. If, as a European Union, we act with determination, courage and an eye to the future, then, I believe, we will also be able to accomplish a great work for peace and contribute to stability in our environment, both to the East and South of the European Union. I believe this to be the common task of the Council, the Commission and Parliament. If we, together, bring that to pass, you, in the Commission and in the Council, will of course have our unqualified support.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen was entirely right to say that we are in the final phase of an irreversible process. Enlargement can be delayed no longer, and to seek to delay it is to contemplate making a grave error and taking an unhistorical step. Nobody in this House, I believe, wants to hold enlargement up.</p>
<p class="contents">In this irreversible process, though, demands are made of both sides. We have discussed the candidates, and the tasks that the candidate countries must carry out. Many true things have been said about this, but we must take a critical look at ourselves and ask ourselves where we stand in this final phase. Even on the eve of its enlargement, does not the European Union itself still show deficits, and are there not tasks that it has not completed? On that point, I want to address two aspects of the debate over the past eighteen months, and a period of time that lies ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Following Nice, we were told by everyone in the then Presidency of the Council and by the Commission, that Nice made the EU capable of enlargement; indeed, there were even Members of this House who said so equally emphatically. In Parliament, the overwhelming majority of Members took the view that this was not the case. Parliament took the initiative in introducing what was then termed the post-Nice process, which has, thank God, culminated in the convocation of a Convention, which is henceforth charged with eliminating the deficits, particularly of an institutional nature, that we still have as enlargement progresses.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice saw the adoption of an agreement that did not go far enough, especially in the areas simplifying decision-making mechanisms, reform of the Council, and reform of the Commission's structures and democratisation. Much more is it the case that what was adopted at Nice was a mechanism for reaching majority decisions, one that complicated matters more than it simplified them. If we proceed with enlargement on the basis of such structures, it will be incapable of being delayed – on which point, Mr Verheugen, you are right – and will, furthermore, be necessary and historically right. It would, though, lead to a dangerous paralysis in the European Union and, furthermore, such a paralysis that there would an even greater threat of people turning away from the European Union. There is therefore a link between the Convention's task and enlargement. It is the Convention, in fact, that must make the European Union capable of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to the need for Parliament to give its support in this. Parliament is indeed an important partner, and that in two respects. We are an important partner because we, in this House, will see to it that the democratic reforms needed at the heart of the European Union are actually carried out before the new Member States join, in other words before the European elections. We will equally see to it that we will, being part of the budgetary authority, join in dealing with the financial requirements, and do so to a creditable extent.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Verheugen rightly said, the upper limits are clear, but there continue to be within them serious problems in need of a solution. These problems are, incidentally, not only of the sort that arise from enlargement and the financial arrangements associated with it; they result also from the decisions by which, within the framework of the foreign and security policy, additional financial functions are transferred to the European Union, functions that must also be funded from the Budget and will result in staff being redeployed.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that Parliament, over the next two years, has to make it abundantly clear that we are the Council's and the Commission's partner in enlargement policy. Being a partner, we give support, but we will also critically monitor what the Commission and the Council will do about democracy, reform and the funding of the enlargement process.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Commissioner has very helpfully outlined the major challenges that enlargement will bring – challenges such as the problems of Kaliningrad, of the Beneš Decrees, of Cyprus; and he has talked a lot about the cost of enlargement. I am, however, very pleased that the President-in-Office drew attention to the cost of non-enlargement, which is by far the greater. It may well be true, as the President-in-Office said, that for us these countries will have waited a "mere" 15 years to join the Union. To them, however, those 15 years will seem more than half as long again as the decade that Spain waited to come into our Union. I believe it is incumbent upon us to do all we can to speed up the process of enlargement. The first step in that process is in the hands of the Presidency this week as the Council meets in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">President, you have emphasised that we have a responsibility for reuniting our divided continent. We must welcome those who wish to join us as soon as they are ready. But it is not primarily a budgetary question: there are tremendous economic benefits to be gained, and that is where Barcelona comes in; for we need to have the courage to undertake ourselves the difficult economic reforms which we rightly expect of the applicant states. This means, in Barcelona, agreeing important economic reforms, finding the way towards reform of the common agricultural policy, and moving towards reforms of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government must not fudge the opportunity of real economic reform in Barcelona. We must open up the markets for gas and electricity, both wholesale and domestic, by 2005 at the latest. We must recommit ourselves to the package of legislative measures in the financial services action plan, unblocking discussions in the Council. We must also see progress on public procurement and a European patent.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to fulfil our objective of staying within the financial perspectives, enlargement must also mean reform of the common agricultural policy. The over-production and waste which characterise the CAP and the worrying consequences for public health of intensive farming methods must be dealt with as we move towards a modern rural development policy, breaking the link with production and creating an environmentally sustainable policy providing aid to our farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The prospect of enlargement also requires us to make a success of the Convention. Our institutions and our decision-making procedures are like a Trabant, when what we need is a Mercedes. We need to design a constitutional settlement for the Union of the 21st century which goes beyond Nice, which is based on common rights and values, which addresses the legitimate concerns of our citizens, combining accountability, democracy and efficiency. Here, above all, what is called for is a responsible approach from our Member States. It is not helpful for financial discipline if the Italian Finance Minister questions the finances of enlargement. It is damaging, when a Community of 25 or 27 will need a strong Executive in the Commission, if the Head of Government of one of our large Member States accuses the Commission of a bias against his country, of wanting to smash the culture of one of his industrial producers, and of singling out his country.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to insist on a responsible approach from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, then we need a more responsible approach ourselves. I hope that as we move towards the Danish Presidency later this year and the historic decisions on enlargement, we will see a responsible, united and purposeful Western Europe welcoming these new democracies into the democratic fold.</p>

Whereas we have, over and over again, invented new and grand names for the enlargement of the European Union –‘Europe's achievement of the century’ and ‘peace project for the continent’ spring to mind – recent weeks have seen the addition of a new name for it: the ‘enlargement savings bank’.</p>
<p class="contents">This ‘achievement of the century’ is saving the fifteen EU finance ministers a cool EUR 18 billion over against the financial decisions reached in Berlin! This is not to say that the financial decisions reached in Berlin were set rather too high through being wrongly estimated. On the contrary, criticisms were voiced at the time that it would probably not be enough for enlargement. It was said, though, out of fear of the net contributors, that we still had the reserves, and that we could call on them if it came to that. The opposite, though, is the case; the Commission has for weeks been repeating the slogan that enlargement must not cost anything. This strikes me as playing at a topsy-turvy world, as a peace project costs a fair bit. There cannot be a two-class Europe, as that would produce social tensions, migration and under-development.</p>
<p class="contents">We Greens therefore call for the financial<span class="italic"> </span>forecasts to be re-examined. It is not true that rural areas and the Structural Fund are getting more. It is precisely at these points that conspicuous cuts are being made over against what was estimated in Berlin. It would, basically, be necessary to use for enlargement the EUR 15 billion that are to be given straight back to the finance ministers of the fifteen EU States in 2002 and 2003. I also believe that transitional periods are possible until 2007 at the latest. The attempt to delay phasing-in even further, until 2007, is a pusillanimous proposal and evidence of the Commission's incapacity, as it would mean that the agricultural policy would not be reformed, and that they want to adjourn the mid-term review that makes the European Union do its homework. We are not going along with that. We need an agricultural policy under which aid is linked in with ecological and social criteria and projects are funded only if they are compatible with the reform. The candidate countries, though, must participate in this reform on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to reject one important proposal by Parliament, namely that the agricultural reform should be introduced now in the candidate countries in order to strengthen rural areas, and that this should be done with the citizens who live there. The Commission, I believe, must stop acting in a feeble manner, and must have the courage to reform, and the courage to tell us that enlargement will cost money if it is to be a success.</p>

As a democrat and internationalist, I rather doubt, however, whether we shall make as much progress as that. I think there are still many obstacles. Some of these have been mentioned, but I think there are others that are also worth mentioning.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard about developments from the fall of the Berlin Wall until the present time. Eastern and Southern European countries, emerging from planned economies and militarisation, were mentioned. All right, but what is to become of these countries if there are no planned economies or militarisation. The other day, we had a debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy about transatlantic links, and all the participants thought that European countries should prepare to get the defence budgets up to between 3 and 5% of GDP, simply in order to comply with general expectations of the EU’s military capacity. What does that mean for the candidate countries and their economies?</p>
<p class="contents">I fear that, when it dawns upon them what conditions we are offering them, the people of Eastern and Central Europe will vote ‘no’ in the final referendums, and that would in my view be a catastrophe. I am dissatisfied, then, with the economic package prepared in connection with enlargement. I am dissatisfied with the statement that it must not cost anything. I am dissatisfied with the fact that the candidate countries must go through a transitional phase of ten years before they feel they are participating fully in the economic area, when it is also ourselves who are laying down transitional conditions and not allowing the principle of freedom of movement for the labour force to apply to the candidate countries on the same footing as it applies to other countries. When considerations of this kind become apparent to those people who, in due course, must vote on whether or not the candidate countries are to become members of the EU, then I fear we shall have problems. I would therefore call for an extra effort to be made in the last phase to alter all this about its not having to cost anything. I agree completely with Mrs Schroedter from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance when she said that we are probably talking about the biggest peace project of our lifetime. Must it really rest upon its not having to cost anything? Are those of us in this cooperative venture really so small-minded that we believe that the greatest peace project of our lifetime must not cost anything? I should very much like to be involved in campaigning for the rich Member States to be required to pay for the project, and that also applies to my own country. Denmark must naturally be willing to pay. Saying that it must not cost anything is tantamount to not wishing wholeheartedly to get this mammoth project under way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, the EU Convention comes at a very important moment in the life of the European Union. The Laeken Declaration made clear both the extent of the achievements of the European Union over the past 45 years and the scale of the challenges which it now faces.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate we are holding here today relates to the enlargement of the European Union. The enthusiasm and determination of the candidate countries seeking to join the EU provide the clearest proof that the European Union is an enormous success story. I very much welcome the participation of representatives from the parliaments of the applicant countries in the Convention and look forward to the fresh insight they will bring to its workings.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutional reform goes hand-in-hand with the enlargement of the European Union. The regulations and directives enacted through the three decision-making procedures in Europe must be streamlined and simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Göteborg European Council decided that those applicant countries which are ready to join the European Union may complete accession negotiations by the end of this year. The goal of admitting new members into the European Union by 2004 is still a very ambitious one, but it is not a pipe dream. The enlargement of the Union is the number one policy priority of all key European Union legislators.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolve and courage at these enlargement negotiations must match those which the candidate countries themselves are showing in enacting wide-ranging new laws as they prepare to join the European Union as full members.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency is now dealing with the most difficult enlargement negotiations, notably agriculture, the structural funds and budgetary matters. I am confident that both sides can reach agreement on these chapters of the talks and reach a conclusion that is – and must be – fair and balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The applicant countries have made substantial progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria, with regard both to the transposition of legislation and to the implementation of new European regulations and directives covering a wide range of economic and social sectors. The significant advances made by the applicant countries in terms of enacting new EU legislation have certainly ensured that the enlargement negotiations can proceed at a stronger pace.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, substantial progress has been made in increasing the independence, transparency and efficiency of public administrations in the applicant countries, as well as in improving the operation of their legal systems. Efficient public administrations are necessary not only to enact new EU laws completely, but also to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">This year will undoubtedly be a decisive one for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe. This institution will work very closely with the Spanish and Danish presidencies of the Union to ensure that enlargement negotiations are a success. We will have to show the same determination as in the past in order to find constructive answers. I believe that this House has the goodwill and determination to do just that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Convention, the national parliaments met and appointed their two representatives in the Bureau, without the representatives from the candidate countries being called at all. On 25 February, I submitted a proposal to the effect that the candidate countries should themselves be able to elect two representatives to the Bureau. The proposal was neither circulated nor debated. The Bureau has held its first meetings without the new countries being represented. The latter must naturally have completely equal rights and also be entitled to have material interpreted in their own languages.</p>
<p class="contents">This weekend, the prime ministers are meeting in Barcelona. The large countries are attacking the equal rights enshrined in the rotating presidencies. There is the risk of a situation in which the EU is run on an intergovernmental basis by representatives of large countries who, in that way, act together supranationally in relation to the smaller countries. That is how I interpret Mr Solana’s discussion paper for the Summit. It is a variant which the EU’s critics should not be alone in criticising. The proposals are also a sign to the candidate countries that they can certainly join us but not on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal on agriculture also operates with two classes of Member State. It would be cheaper and more sensible to phase out price support in the EU before enlargement and to provide the candidate countries and our own farmers with compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Signalling different treatment is wrong and deeply damaging. It is also the Nice Summit’s decision to give the Czech Republic and Hungary two fewer places in the European Parliament than are allocated to EU countries with fewer inhabitants. I wish once again to call upon the Commission to publish the so-called screening reports concerning how far the candidate countries have got with introducing our legislation. That is information which belongs to the people, both in our own and the candidate countries. In this case, it is everyone who is being discriminated against. Debates concerning legislation should be fully open, as they are in all the parliaments, and the people of the candidate countries must also be able to monitor the phasing out of their own laws. Mr Solana’s new discussion paper should have been submitted directly to ourselves, as I requested. Instead, I now hear about it through leaks. Let us put an end to this secretiveness and take the Commission to the Court of Justice if it does not hand over the screening reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we have to keep an impartial view of all applicant countries, this must not mean that the various decisions they made prior to accession negotiations or their special circumstances arising from their natural resources or history should be completely ignored. I am mainly alluding to the situation regarding Estonia, which is close to Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unreasonable that the Union is demanding that the country’s bituminous shale-based production of electric energy, which is unable to compete in a freely competitive market, should swiftly become the object of free competition, while, at the same time, France, and to some extent Germany also, are still, after fifty years, obstructing the liberalisation of their own energy markets. Fortunately for it, Estonia is still not even part of the European electrical network. The other special feature of Estonia concerns its milk quotas, which the Union wishes to fix at a basic level equal to that of the start of the last decade, when Estonia – rightly or wrongly – decreased its production. Thus, present volumes of production – very important for Estonia’s countryside, which is still dependent on agriculture – will not fit within the framework of the quota. It is these sorts of decisions that will, however, determine the attitude of the farming population and the people of East Estonia to EU membership in the referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Kaliningrad always comes up as a key issue in any talk about enlargement, the northern dimension and our relationship with Russia. I am a very strong supporter of Russian cooperation, but I am very pleased to hear Commissioner Verheugen remind us that Kaliningrad is a part of Russia, and that there can be no special negotiations on it with regard to enlargement. Russia is also mainly responsible for proposals on cooperation and participation in financing. Neither is Kaliningrad – and this is something I want to stress – a crucial element in the problems and opportunities of the northern dimension, which lie elsewhere. They are in Murmansk, in the St Petersburg region: close to the Finnish border. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to talk about the statements which are made from time to time – and too often for my liking – by the leaders of candidate countries, political declarations which emphasise the bilateral conflicts between neighbouring countries in Central Europe, countries which today aspire to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I am thinking of a subject which you yourself addressed, Commissioner: the recent virulent comments made by the Hungarian Prime Minister on the Bene Decrees, which were followed by the sharp riposte of the Slovak Prime Minister, his Czech counterpart and the President of the Czech Parliament. The result of this controversy was the postponement of the Višegrad summit, during which four countries – Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak Republics – had intended to coordinate their positions for the final phase of the negotiations, which would have been extremely useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to express an opinion here on the Beneš issue itself. In any case, you have already done so, Commissioner, and very well too. For my part, however, I deeply regret the climate of mutual mistrust of which this controversy is symptomatic. Similarly, the persistence of the excessively nationalist leanings of certain leaders and the general public in the candidate countries is something which we can only contemplate with fear. Of course we can understand their terrific thirst for freedom and independence after so many years of oppression. Having become well acquainted with these countries myself just after the fall of communism and the break-up of the Soviet Union, I think that I am quite well placed to know and understand how the people there are feeling and why they are reacting in this way. But, for pity's sake, accession to the European Union does not require them to forget the past, but to be able to transcend it. I have often regretted the fact that the accession negotiations are based solely on the Copenhagen criteria, that is, on criteria which are objective, admittedly, but which are essentially materialist. Psychological political criteria – states of mind, attitudes, private reservations – which are obviously difficult to measure, hardly play any part at all, as you have often reminded us, Commissioner. However – and I say this in a spirit of friendship and out of the high regard that I have for the candidate countries – their accession to the Union, which we are hoping, preparing and waiting for, has to take place in a climate of confidence, with the very strong desire to live together, and not in a climate of distrust and even suspicion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We then come, however, to the next phase, namely the people’s support of the project by means of referendums and, in that connection, I should like to address one aspect which covers half of the population, namely women. There is no doubt – and the Commissioners have also assured us of this – that the Community acquis must be implemented. However, there is a difference between theory and practice, and the reality is of course that the situation of women in the candidate countries has not been improved following the fall of the Berlin Wall. I must therefore ask whether, in the Commission’s and the Council’s work, there is anything at all that ensures that there are opportunities for strengthening the position of women in the countries concerned. If there is not, we may have a problem with the referendums; we may have a problem with female representation at the elections to Parliament; and we may have a problem with female representation in the public administration. I would therefore ask the Commission and the Council to answer the question of whether special initiatives are being taken with regard to women in the countries concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a historical basis for that view, but we should not forget that a commitment on our part is called for too. We have just heard a reference to Kaliningrad. At present it is part of Russia, but it was the birthplace of no less a figure than Kant, one of the thinkers who laid the foundations for modern Europe. We should also remember that the Ukraine is as European as Poland. There is a region known as Galicia in Spain, but there is another Galicia in Central Europe with Krakow as its capital. That region boasts a long history and is at present partitioned between Poland and the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be borne in mind that if Turkey joins, Europe will spill over into Asia. All the problems and political uncertainties related to this process must be taken into account. We are contemplating a Union with a population of 500 million and 28 Member States at the last count, if the Balkan countries do not join. Such a Union will need European institutions that are both more tolerant of diversity and stronger. The issue of the type of constitution we should seek also arises.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding economic uncertainties, it has been claimed that after 2006 the European budget could be maintained with 1.27% of European GDP. That is impossible in my view, if we wish to maintain the Structural Funds and European policies, notably the employment policy. We only have to recall the German experience. Differences between East and West still exist, despite the tremendous effort made.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to respond to concerns regarding the environment, transport, and even the impact on this House. It is not clear whether the Treaty of Nice will have been superseded by the time the new Members join, but it provides for 732 Members of the European Parliament. What kind of enlargement will it be? Will ten countries be joining or not? I think these questions deserve careful consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe the issue of eastwards enlargement should lead us to reflect on the kind of Europe we are aiming for. A more diverse Europe should in the future be a world power working for peace and solidarity. By its very nature, it cannot be a militaristic power like the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">All these thoughts should be aired in the House. We must avoid focusing on minor difficulties arising, because we have many major problems to deal with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The acceptance of new members is not actually taking place on the consistent basis of equality and solidarity. I find the debate on the Czech Republic intolerable. Anyone who wants to examine the so-called Beneš decrees and raises issues of property cannot leave out of consideration the character in international law of the two-plus-four process involved in the union of the two German states. Anyone who wants Russia on their side, wherever they may be, had better not make any false moves over Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="contents">As seen from Brussels, the accession process is more than a one-way street; that is something that Mr Schulz addressed. Accession is meant to cost as little as possible even though the candidates are bound to the unconditional acceptance of obligations and payments in advance. The opening-up of markets is already turning out to mean good business for business groups, banks and insurers. Demonstrably better support was given when other countries joined – Spain being one of them. The candidates from Central and Eastern Europe have, on average, reached not even half the gross domestic product of the European Union, and the three Baltic States have only managed one-third. The level of production in some of these States is lower today than it was in 1990, which indicates that the preparatory payments have not been much use.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required is the reshaping of the structural and cohesion policies to ensure that, in both present and future Member States, the less developed regions in general, and the border regions in particular, will receive appropriate support. We therefore need concepts that really will convince citizens of the candidate states that entering the EU is the right step for them to take, and one that will be to their benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the matter of the protection of human health, which has always been a primary objective in all the development policies of the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam, in fact, lays down that a high level of health protection is guaranteed in the drawing-up and implementation of all Community policies and activities. To this end, we are making every effort to ensure that the citizens’ health is protected by means of a common, efficient, high-quality health system, as proposed by the Community Action Plan for Public Health 2001-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that to achieve such objectives we need to develop specific policies aimed at ensuring the ongoing improvement of professionalism and scientific research in the health structures of the European Union Member States, and given that the current status of the health structures – and health policies – in the candidate countries for enlargement is clearly backward compared with the situation in the European Union, I believe we should urgently take steps, by means of studies or simulations within the Member States, to identify the possible consequences of the enlargement of the Union on public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should verify that the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> on health has been effectively adopted in the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and we must take into consideration control measures to prevent the entry of the candidate countries from leading to a fall in standards of health care in the countries of the Union, in view also of the recognised shortage of medical and nursing staff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then there are the set of problems concerning the budget and the fear that the candidate countries will be treated as second class Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the crucial and fundamental problems are not of course of a political and economic nature. The crucial problems arise from the fact that the process in relation to the candidate countries from Eastern Europe entails a huge transformation. It is about producing the legal framework for a transformation process of historic dimensions. Moreover, these legal problems, which may be difficult enough, of course conceal the democratic problems. The basis for the latest Copenhagen criterion is that a public administration should be brought about which effectively and correctly administers, applies and implements Community legislation. There is no information in the existing reports concerning this huge problem. And even if an effective legal administration, able to implement the transformation, is obtained, it will be democratically compromising, for how are the people to be involved in this process? The moment of truth is approaching. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, European peace can ensue in States that know their responsibilities. A ‘European-style’ peace. I also have a great deal of faith in the policy of the Commissioner during the negotiations. I support his underlying principles. I also welcome the fact that he keeps the pressure on until the last minute, until October, and that it is not a foregone conclusion that ten countries will be joining. Their accession remains conditional.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask a specific question concerning the costs that enlargement entails. A few other MEPs have already mentioned this topic, and we have also discussed it with the Commissioner within the framework of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy. Regarding the costs of enlargement, I believe the Commissioner completely when he states in this respect that these will, in fact, not exceed our set budget. We have cut costs to ensure that enlargement becomes possible within the budget. Despite this, we hear all kinds of conflicting stories in the various Member States, depending on whether it is in their interest to turn this into an issue. A moment ago, I heard Italy being mentioned. I also have to include my own country, my own government, which states that the additional costs could be enormous. The Secretary of State for European Affairs made a cryptic statement that this could well cost the Netherlands anything between 0 to 1 billion. This proves that a) he has a conscience and b) he is also a campaign leader. Commissioner, I think it would be extremely useful if another authoritative analysis were issued of these calculations which are being drafted in the Member States and which give a completely different picture from that of the Commission. Surely this can be done independently, and I also think it is important for our people to be able to distinguish between the truth and accuracy on the one hand and unfounded nightmares on the other. Added to this, of course, is the fact that we have created our own problems by not reforming our own agricultural policy in time. We have simply not done our homework, but have saddled those other countries with these tasks instead – which they are implementing – and we complain in the meantime. Mr President, I have to say that I am also delighted with the statements made by the Commissioner with regard to the Beneš Decrees. We are all very busy working on them, and I have also noticed that in the Netherlands, associations, for example, are reporting claims in connection with Poland, among others. I would very much appreciate it if the Commission and the Council were to clarify which claims, with a reference to Copenhagen, would be viable and which would not be. In my view, clarity in this connection is crucial in order to keep our population in the positive frame of mind with regard to enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are still a number of stumbling blocks that we have to remove, and not all the forces in the Member States, or in the candidate countries – to whom reference has already been made – have been very helpful in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion of the Beneš decrees is certainly one of the stumbling blocks. Historians certainly judge these decrees in different ways, but I am obliged to the Commissioner for pointing out that the only issue of relevance to accession is that of whether they still to this day have discriminatory effects, that is, whether the legal systems contain provisions that go against the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and are still of relevance to negotiations today. Provisions of this nature must be removed along with their effects; I am very glad that this is something on which the Czech and Slovak governments now agree. We will not be helped to build a new Europe either by revising the Beneš decrees or by cementing them into the EU's treaties. Rather than getting bogged down in nationalistic squabbles, we should not lose sight of the vision of a great Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2004-2005 enlargement round will be the cause of much satisfaction in many of the candidate countries, but there will be disappointment in those that remain outside. It is worth considering whether we ought to give these countries not only greater financial help with the implementation of their reforms, but also a realistic – and I emphasise realistic – provisional date for their accession, subject to their making progress in the relevant areas. There is great fear, particularly on the part of Romania and Bulgaria, of being put on the shelf. Consideration will have to be given at the same time to adding new countries to the list of candidates, and I am at present thinking only of Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">With Turkey, on the other hand, we have to consider how to grant what it has asked for, describing this as a compensation for its help with the Cyprus issue, help that has, though, not yet made itself clearly visible. Here, too, it must be clear that a date for the beginning of negotiations with Turkey cannot be named in isolation from fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria. In light of the fact that the borders of a future Europe will become ever more visible, we must also, I believe, even now slowly start thinking about how even closer political and organisational ties can be forged with those states that I believe will remain outside the European Union – Russia, for example, or many of the Mediterranean states. For Europe does not consist of the European Union alone; there are other states with which we want to build up new and strong cooperation, with potential for the future, in order to maintain a strong European Union.</p>

The very same night saw the beginning of the enlargement process, or the reunification of Europe, as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party prefers to call it.</p>
<p class="contents">We now stand on the threshold of creating a unified Europe, an EU for the whole continent. It is, of course, nothing less than an historic sensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, however, we must move on a stage from merely engaging in rhetoric, whereupon it becomes a question of hard facts: money, agriculture and ancient border conflicts. Who said that it would be simple? Who believed that it would not cost anything? Who believed that we should not have to make sacrifices? Certainly, enlargement has a price, but it is worth it.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, there are still a lot of problems to be solved, but we must not drown in details. 2002 is an incredibly important year for enlargement, but it is also a year with elections in six Member States and three candidate countries. The European issues will become important, but there is a very great risk of domestic political considerations overshadowing enlargement and the European issues. That is why vigorous European leadership and action by the Commission is required to force the pace during these crucial months. 2002 must not be a lost year. Enlargement must not be delayed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many initiatives, Commissioner, saw these issues as bilateral in nature and not to be put in the context of negotiations on European enlargement; I expressly welcome the way you have now abandoned this manifestly untenable position and I praise you for it. You obviously did this influenced by the public debate sparked by Mr Zeman, who, this House should note, has presumed to advise the Israelis to do with the Palestinians what the Czechs did with the Hungarians and Sudeten Germans after the last World War – which I consider to be the most monstrous<span class="italic"> </span>thing he has said. Such an attitude of mind has, though, no place in the European Union, and so, Mr Verheugen, I expressly welcome the way you have put discussion of these decrees into the context of the European legal order, recognising the political and moral issues involved, which go against the EU's legal order, and which are indeed obsolete, being incapable of having any future legal effect within the EU, and that what matters now is to make it our concern, in a spirit of good neighbourliness, that they do not constitute obstacles on the road to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions therefore arise and demand to be answered. If the decrees have indeed lapsed, as the Czech government maintains, why were they not unambiguously annulled? If, though, they have not lapsed, and can still be employed in practice, indications of which are unfortunately numerous, how, then, can they be reconciled with the European legal order? And the pre-eminent fundamental question is that of what line the Czech government takes, not only on excesses but with the expulsion of entire ethnic groups as such, that is, on what we have unfortunately learned to call ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p class="contents">That the Foreign Affairs Committee intends henceforth to set in motion investigations by experts is therefore to be welcomed to an extraordinary degree, as these issues affect not only the EU's conception of itself as a community based on law, but also the foundations on which the EU enterprise rests. These issues must be clarified before we can actually complete enlargement successfully.</p>

In contrast to what you have said, Mr Verheugen, it is not an effort that we have to make now and which we can no longer get out of, but an endeavour that we want to engage in because we want to create a future Europe that will be a community of solidarity in that future generations can work in peace with one another and with economic success on sound social foundations and under optimum conditions from the point of view of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an endeavour must be worth something to us – not only in terms of what we ourselves, or politicians, put into it, not only in terms of drumming up people's support, but also in terms of figures in black and white, by which the project must be backed up; it means that we also, of course, have to give thought to how we can set out, including in financial terms, the individual steps that must be taken. That is not just a fear on the part of the public, but an important issue. As a householder myself, I, naturally, pay a great deal of attention to that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard that we will be able to cope with all that within the framework of the Perspective that was adopted in Berlin in 1999. All of what the Commission has presented will indeed last us until 2006. There are though, a few things in all these columns of figures that we need to discuss. Mr Verheugen referred to one of them himself. It is expecting too much of the new countries who will be added that they should be net contributors from the very outset. You cannot demand that countries whose gross domestic product is certified as being only 50% of that of the existing Member States, that they should start out as net contributors, for the precise reason that payments have to be effected directly, whilst repayments would be made only after a period of time had elapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this financial perspective, we have described pre-accession aid packages that, in the first instance at any rate, worked on the assumption that new countries would be added with immediate effect from 2002. However, they have not been, but, spread over the years, the EUR 3 billion remain the same. If ten countries actually are added in 2004, the EUR 3 billion left over would be for two countries, Bulgaria and Romania. We will have to discuss what is actually meant by this and how it has to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must think about how things are to go on after 2006, for you cannot simply say that this will be enough until 2006, and that we will just carry on after that date. You mentioned that the Structural Fund and the Agricultural Policy are in the ratio of 75:25. In our current Budget, the ration is 45:35, in favour, let it be noted, of the Agricultural Policy. We cannot make such massive changes to it that it will be as you have just said by that date. What this means is that we must discuss in precise terms how we go on from here. We will monitor that during the Budget very constructively, but with a highly critical eye.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, this morning you introduced this topic for us. With all respect for you and your office, I have a request to make. In the whole of your speech, you did not once mention Parliament as being a fellow-player in connection with these enlargement negotiations. We are legislators on the Budget every bit as much as the Council. It would be good if the way you conduct business were to take us into account.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all we need to ensure that the public understands what is at stake. Here it seems to me that there is a lack of information in our countries. Secondly, we need to rethink cohesion policy, taking into account the points mentioned by the Commission in its second report.

Perhaps you are taking a step forward, but I fail to understand how and I totally fail to understand what our longer-term objectives are for the rest of the Balkans, where the decisions which we have taken so far are creating a black hole at the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question, Mr President-in-Office, is this: I am an optimist and I believe that the first accession agreements will soon be signed. Have we considered the fact that the candidate countries, which by then will be members, will need to learn to work within the European Parliament and, as in the past, their parliaments will need to send representatives to Parliament in Strasbourg and Brussels until such time as European elections are held? Have we made the necessary financial and technical arrangements?

This greatly gladdens my heart. I see them as not only a bilateral problem; they continue to be applicable in law, and the question therefore arises of whether they are compatible with Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Previous progress reports have, unfortunately, had not a word to say about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen has given it as his opinion that the Beneš Decrees are not merely a legal problem but a political and moral one. The ethnic cleansings and expulsions in the most recent wars in the Balkans have without doubt revealed a European dimension. What is at the heart of the Beneš Decrees is no different. The international jurist Felix Ermacora came to the conclusion, in a legal opinion on the Beneš Decrees, as recently as 1992 that they were incompatible with current international law, thus indicating that they cannot be reconciled with EU law either. It is with real excitement that I await the outcome of this opinion and the reaction of the Commission and the Council to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to emphasise that it is essential to arrive at financial consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, the European Union has operated by means of a multiannual agreement as expressed in the so-called financial perspective. This consensual system has resulted in two key achievements. The first is interinstitutional peace, crucial to the preparation of an annual budget. The second is multiannual financial programming, a very useful instrument for budgetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The memory of the difficulties experienced in reaching agreement on the most recent financial perspective in Berlin in 1999 must still be fresh for all Members of the House. This perspective will remain in force until 2006. Members must also be aware of the major difficulties anticipated in connection with drawing up a new financial perspective valid until 2013. By that time, the House will have welcomed new honourable Members and the new Member States will be present in the Council. Consequently the nature of these two budgetary authorities will be very different.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of a reformed agricultural policy is one of the variables the new financial consensus will need to take into account. Others will be actual convergence in the areas classed as Objective 1 at the time, and the statistical effect will have an impact on that. Then there is the absorption capacity as far as new Member States are concerned. It will even be necessary to come to a new decision on own resources and the maximum ceiling, currently 1.24%. This will have to be ratified by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It might therefore be wise to delay negotiation of a new financial perspective until it is possible to ensure complete consensus between the parties. If the present financial framework can cope with enlargement, it should perhaps be retained until an overall assessment of the new financial situation is available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to preface my remarks by saying that there may not be, and there will not be, a link between reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and these countries joining, nor a composite measure to that effect, even though there are those who would like to see such things. The one must be dealt with separately from the other, although that does not mean that there is not a whole range of requirements and rules to be complied with by both sides. First of all, there is the need to guarantee the full transposition of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, especially with regard to the veterinary and plant-health sectors, quality standards for food safety and adherence to the regulations on the protection of animals. There is no dispute that there will, in some sectors, be transitional rules with time limits, but they will be few and far between. Furthermore, the Sapard programme, conceived as pre-accession aid, must at last be fully implemented, as what has been done hitherto has been unsatisfactory. We also support the Commission proposals for direct payments to the new Member States to start by being made gradually and in a form related to area rather than to production following their accession and for rural development programmes independent of production to be markedly topped up with resources, in order to avoid social dumping, among other things, in countries such as Poland. Agriculture and rural development still play a central role in these countries and will continue to do so for a long time to come. Not only there, either, might I add! Support, across the whole of the EU, must be given on the basis of multifunctional agriculture in all its many facets, thus further strengthening the second pillar, not only with regard to the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like again to make it clear that the idea of solidarity, by which our Community is governed and characterised, must be neither eroded nor done away with. This does not mean, though, that the Common Agricultural Policy was not in need of reform, both in our own states and in the candidate countries, whether enlargement took place or not. Any of the farmers' representatives who believes that no reform of the CAP is needed is, by his attitude, doing nothing more than accelerating the downfall of rural agriculture, the maintenance of which he constantly and stridently demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the Presidency of the Council and say that it is perhaps dawning on some of us that, in the 1999 negotiations on Agenda 2000, it might sometimes have made more sense to think along slightly less national and rather more European lines. Is it not so, Mr President-in-Office, that there can and will be no more inherited farms? As a Parliament, we want Europe to be enlarged and hence reunited, and I am certain that Commissioners Fischler and Verheugen will see to it that this does not fall at the hurdle of the agriculture chapter.</p>

<p class="contents">So what are we doing now? For a start, toiling through the mid-term review, as decided on in Berlin under the German Presidency of the Council. Secondly, setting in motion a further development of Community policies for the post-2006 period, ever bearing in mind that eastward enlargement and the world trade round are running in parallel. Let me say loud and clear that over-ambition will endanger the timetable for enlargement. I would also like to make it clear that I consider the current Commission proposals, for example in the area of agricultural policy, to represent a responsible approach to budgeting.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly also have to discuss, in the area of structural policies, how we can develop plans for adapting the Structural Funds. I will go on record as agreeing with Mr Walter. We will also have to discuss this if we have special provisions for the Cohesion Fund. Would these apply up to 2006 or would they be laid down for a further period from 2006 onwards? The devil is trying to hide in the detail here. Let us not deceive ourselves; we will also have to ask whether the deficient implementation of pre-accession aid to date is the litmus test for the candidates' ability to transpose regulations and their suitability for accession, or whether we have ourselves complicated matters to such an extent that nobody can cope any more.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope that the Convention comes up with the conclusive results that we will need on the institutions' capacity for action, and on the concentration of competences. Let me add that I personally have doubts as to whether what we are currently discussing in relation to capacity for action and the rules governing languages will really be the final solution. Above all, there is one thing we must pay attention to: We need solutions that are capable of gaining a majority, that will not only be adopted in parliamentary bodies, but will meet with public approval in both the old and the new Member States of the EU. With that in mind, let us go to work together!</p>

We must recognise the efforts of these countries but, at the same time, we must also ask ourselves some questions about the more sensitive aspects of this process. As has already been said, Bulgaria and Romania are countries that have been left behind and form part of an area – the Balkans – that in itself is a critical area historically, let us remember, an area that sparked off disasters during the last century. What do you intend to do, Mr Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to speed up the process of integration and approximation of the Balkans to the Union?</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to make concerns relations with the Mediterranean countries. There is a kind of double vision in this House: on the one hand, two hours ago we all applauded the initiative that our President proposed, seeking to adopt a different, more participatory approach to the Palestine peace process; on the other hand, after Barcelona, our Mediterranean policies are practically dead. How can one think of holding an effective dialogue if one is unable to understand that it is also possible to further peace through practical forms of aid?</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the matter of public opinion. I was pleased to hear that we will be getting a coherent package as regards agricultural policies and Structural Fund policies. Public opinion is distrustful of the enlargement process, especially inside the countries of the Union. Of course, some people are more sensitive and others less, but all in all there is distrust in all the Member States. I believe that, from this perspective, answers need to be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point: languages. Here I support everything Mr Böge has just said. I believe we must retain the principle of multilingualism. With continued enlargement, on the one hand we are taking up an historical challenge that we do not, of course, want to miss, but on the other we must also do what we can so that the identity of our cultures and our peoples is not lost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, you were right to observe that problems of a legal, but also political and moral, nature have arisen and are certainly of relevance to the process of integration. I will now also expressly welcome and support the encouragement you have given in this House to the Czech Government and the Czech public to do everything possible to put a stop to such discriminatory effects in the legal field as may still result from these Beneš Decrees, and thus remove potential obstacles on the path to enlargement. I greatly regret the remarks by some Members to the effect that enlargement is inevitable. As if we were now to have to do everything in our power to move this process further forward, because it would otherwise be unstoppable! This process is not only unstoppable, it is also explicitly desirable, and to be desired, moreover, with the utmost ardour!</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, enlargement incorporating the countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and those to the North, overcomes the historic burdens laid upon us by Yalta, at last overcoming the division of Europe, and benefiting us all, especially countries such as Austria and Germany, who will profit directly from the growing markets at their front door!</p>

The workers of the European Union have seen their rights eroded or even abolished, especially over the last ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies to industrial relations, insurance rights, democratic liberties and wages. Unemployment, poverty and suppression are spreading. Small and medium-sized enterprises in town and country are being wiped out. Measures are being taken which bolster the increasingly autocratic powers of major economic interests. A Union is being constructed which, instead of opposing the barbarity of the United States, goes along or competes with it on a dangerous and absurd path, which may lead to the destruction of our very planet.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of the candidate countries therefore have nothing positive to expect as regards their vital interests. Pre-accession relations have given them a bitter foretaste of what happens when companies are restructured, nationalised industries are snapped up by foreign capital, their important social rights are abolished and support is given to their local exploiters, often the Mafia, who are proving to be privileged partners of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Communist Party of Greece, in a spirit of solidarity with the people of the candidate countries, urges them to oppose this process. As far as Palestine is concerned, I should like to call on the European Union, here and now, to cut all funding to the regime of criminals in power in Israel and any supply lines to that regime, in order to put an end to the crime being perpetrated against the Palestinian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I listened carefully to what they had to say. Unfortunately, time does not allow me to reply to each of them individually, as I would have liked. I believe this has been a very useful exchange of views and ideas for all concerned. It demonstrates the cooperation that exists between the various European institutions, notable the Council, Parliament and the Commission. I would however like to make some observations and I hope they will be relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, there is clear and overwhelming support for this great historical enterprise of enlargement. We have all but achieved a common front on this issue. In addition, there is universal awareness of the need to abide by the timetable we set ourselves to ensure that many of today’s candidate countries can participate in the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004 and be represented in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The historical dimension of enlargement was mentioned, and rightly so. Enlargement is a political venture but also one with a historical dimension. It aims to reunite Europe for good, following the divisions that arose during the cold war and the balance of terror, when Europe was split into rival blocs. Nonetheless, it is true that this enlargement will probably not allow us to claim that we are topping off the building of Europe in a geographical sense.</p>
<p class="contents">At present we are all thinking in terms of a maximum of 10 countries, and of concluding negotiations by the end of 2002. I shall come back to the question of the number of countries in a moment. We are working hard, but many difficulties and obstacles remain to be overcome. Several honourable Members referred earlier to the situation of Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, the Balkans and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that when strong criticism of the present process of building Europe is voiced, there is a tendency to overlook the fact that the building of Europe and the whole political enterprise of creating the Union are an obvious success story. The Union began with six Member States. There are now 15. Very soon we could be 25, then 27, 28 and perhaps many more in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody wants to be associated with failure or to join a poorly-run club. On the other hand, people generally queue up to join a well-run venture with proven success.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the Balkans as an example. I shall refer to both the Eastern and the Western Balkans including Bulgaria and Romania. I said earlier, and Commissioner Verheugen endorsed my comments, that it is essential to send out very clear, strong and positive messages to Bulgaria and Romania. The aim is to open all the chapters with these countries in the coming few months, and to speed up negotiations for their future accession as much as possible. The European dimension has special significance for these countries, as indeed it did for Spain in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Where freedom, the consolidation of democracy, social justice, modernisation and economic progress were concerned, Europe always was a lodestar for Spain. The same is true for these countries. They have exactly the same right to integrate into the European Union as we had at the time. In due course the same will also be true of the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we offering these countries? We are spreading a prospect out before them and offering them the opportunity of integration. We are enabling them to pursue the consolidation of democracy and internal reforms, because there is no feasible alternative to integration into Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be the best way of ensuring that conflicts do not arise. It should prevent a repeat of the war situation these countries experienced in the recent past. It is for this reason that the European Union is setting up Association and Stability Agreements with several of these countries within the framework of the Stability Pact. The time-scales vary from country to country, but it is our declared aim to ensure that all of them will in due course be in a position to apply for membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This therefore is the venture we are currently engaged in. You will appreciate the importance of getting things right at this stage. We must be serious, rigorous, disciplined and realistic. I listened carefully to the honourable Members who spoke of reconsidering the financial perspective and of how enlargement would not be achieved for free. It certainly will not. On the contrary, it will be provided for within the framework of the financial perspective we agreed. That is something quite different.</p>
<p class="contents">Other speakers referred to the need to begin considering the reform of the common policies. They are quite right, of course. I would like to make the following quite clear, however. At this juncture, anyone who maintains that the debates on the financial perspective and on the reform of common policies should be interwoven with the accession negotiations has to realise that doing so would make it impossible to keep to the timetable for enlargement. Anyone in favour of enlargement and meeting the deadlines set must be aware that either we continue in the present vein or we shall fail. I believe there is full agreement between the Council and the Commission. I trust the same is true of Parliament. A broad consensus of this nature is essential if we are to meet the citizens’ expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one last observation which I think is also relevant. The European Union has demonstrated a clear political will concerning enlargement. That political will does not, however, imply that a political decision has been taken to close negotiations with ten candidates before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Political will is essential but it is not sufficient. The pace of negotiations must be maintained, and the candidate countries need to demonstrate their administrative and judicial capability. In essence, they must demonstrate their political capability regarding the transposition of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> into their legislation. Further, they must satisfy us that they are capable of complying with it. Things will go badly both for them and for the present Members if that is not the case. We are all committed to ensuring success.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the same kind of clear political will shown by the European Union will also be shown by the candidate countries, and that they will therefore take the action required. Then, when the time is right, it will indeed be possible for us to take the political decision to close negotiations with ten countries in the first instance and with more in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A couple of very short observations: Firstly, it seems to me that I again need to point out very clearly that we may not impose new conditions for enlargement, no matter how desirable it may be to push forward certain reforms within the policies and also within the structure of the European Union. Much as I understand the use people make of enlargement as an argument in favour of pressing on with these, I must equally warn against any form of composite measure, as that could be taken in the candidate countries only as a new and additional obstacle and would serve to confirm the candidates' existing suspicion that, whenever they approach the objective, we move it even further away. That is not on!</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I at all understand what is the problem with the Convention, for example. Why is it that the present candidate countries should not, as new members, already play a full part with equal rights? Those who think they would be incapable of doing so are deluding themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me deliver a forceful warning against the conception that we even now have to put our silverware and valuable porcelain in a place of safety, before the grubby kids arrive from the East. Anyone who approaches enlargement in this way does not grasp the whole historic dimension of this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation relates to finances. I am quite happy to be admonished by representatives of the budgetary authority, that the Commission should adhere to what the budgetary authority has prescribed. If you want us to spend more money, then by all means come to an agreement with the Council that more money should be made available. Until that happens, the Council will adhere strictly to the framework that we have received from the Council and from Parliament. I can tell you that that is quite sufficient. It would be quite absurd to make substantially more money available because of our being at the limit of what we can justify as allowable expenditure in the candidate countries. It is quite simply untrue that they are getting a worse deal than the present members. Measured by reference to their gross national product, those who will be our new members get substantially more aid from the European Budget than do the present cohesion Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, accurate to depict us as applying double standards only in as much as the candidate countries enjoy preferential treatment to some degree. They are not, though, neglected in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Oostlander's last remark, let me say that there are dozens of studies of this sort, some of which also come from the Netherlands, to the effect that the costs of enlargement would in fact be far higher than we have calculated. All these studies, including the Dutch ones, have one thing in common; they are based on political assumptions that are not going to become reality. They assume results from negotiations that do not exist, nor will they exist in the future. If, of course, we were to negotiate a requirement for the whole environmental acquis to be completed in the new Member States by 2005, that would cost EUR 130 billion, and that EUR 130 billion would have to be raised. We do not, though, negotiate like that. We negotiate in such a way that we remain within the bounds of what is financially possible, and we do not enter into financial commitments for the post-2006 period. I surely do not have to explain to Parliament that it is not even possible to negotiate in such a way as to produce financial commitments that Parliament and the budgetary authority have not covered. You would never adopt an enlargement treaty of that sort if it involved financial risks. Enlargement, though, puts us at no financial risk. I have my own hunches as to why, certain discussions have been launched in certain Member States and using certain documents. My position as a member of the European Commission does not, unfortunately, permit me to express my thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I might perhaps be permitted to observe that the European Union's budget permits neither tax increases nor indebtedness, so that we really cannot budget more than the Member States make available to us as contributions, and perhaps every Minister of Finance in the European Union ought to be aware that that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion on the Beneš Decrees has encouraged me to continue with the Commission's cautious way of dealing with this issue. I would ask for all those who wish to participate in this discussion to do so with the utmost sensitivity and care. Not all the strident voices of recent times have helped us to get closer to the objective. I agree with all those who say that, beyond the subjects of the negotiations themselves, there are issues and problems that should be resolved before we come to any decisions, as we do not want to have to drag burdens from the past behind us on our way into our common European future.</p>
