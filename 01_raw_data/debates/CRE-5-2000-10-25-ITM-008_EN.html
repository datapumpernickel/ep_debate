<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Hecke Johan (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the Commission communication which we are discussing was published one and a half years ago following the outbreak of war in Central Africa. In the absence of a consensus, the Council has put the communication on ice all that time. In that time, an estimated 1.2 million people have been killed in the Congo war. In my report, I made a modest attempt to formulate a number of proposals in order to help end the spiral of violence and underdevelopment in which many of our ACP partners have ended up. These proposals also aim to avoid European funds being used to finance the war machine. My report can be summarised in three Cs: conditionality, coherence and control. More so than has been the case so far, there should be a clear link between debt relief and financial assistance on the one hand, and good governance, respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I would even argue in favour of fixing a ceiling for military expenditure in the ACP countries above which assistance or debt relief is no longer provided. If these conditions are not met, the European Union needs to be prepared to take appropriate measures, ranging from diplomatic pressure and suspending aid, through to sanctions with a preference for arms and diamond embargoes or so-called ‘smart’ sanctions, which target the ruling elite rather than the population.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would also urge the Commission to apply unambiguous criteria for suspending aid. I believe it would be particularly useful, in the framework of Article 96 of the Cotonou Convention, to compile a list of all possible infringements of this Convention. At present, I cannot shake off the impression that the Commission is applying an ad hoc approach too often, which can make it vulnerable to the accusation of applying double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to conditionality, the emphasis is on more coherence, i.e. more coherence between the Lomé track and the CFSP track and between the policies of the Union and of the Member States. Situations such as those in Ethiopia, where the European Commission and a number of Member States froze aid, while other Member States started up new programmes, must be avoided at all costs. Moreover, stricter control on Community spending is required as a matter of urgency. ACP states involved in armed conflict should allow the World Bank and the IMF full access to their accounts. Misuse of European development aid for the purchase of weapons should immediately lead to the suspension of structural aid. In that respect, Europe cannot be strict enough.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this should not detract from one of the European Union’s key roles, namely conflict prevention. As Rwanda and Ethiopia have shown, the alarm signals are usually in place, but the reaction to these is often inadequate and late. This is why it is important to tackle the cause of the problems in good time. Conflict prevention also involves the fight against poverty, the reinforcement of democracy and civil society, better control of the illegal arms trade, the setting up of an African peace-keeping force, as well as an international regulation on the use of mercenary armies and better control of the worldwide ban on child soldiers. In my report, I also call for greater involvement of the European Parliament. It seems essential to me that we have more of a say in the freezing or unfreezing of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council will not once again shelve this important communication, inspired by former Commissioner Deus Pinheiro. If we are serious about contributing to a peace deal in Central Africa, we must take firm and coherent action, aid must be made subject to conditions and a general arms embargo will need to apply in the Great Lakes region. Development aid should under no circumstance be used to fund wars. That is unacceptable, both to the people affected and to the European taxpayer.</p>

I, and the rest of my Committee in fact, can concur with him in every respect, and I also want to thank him for the constructive cooperation which resulted in all amendments tabled by my Committee being incorporated in the text. This will please the President as he will not have to sit through many votes.</p>
<p class="contents">The considerations which I would like to bring to you today for consideration, Commissioner, are mainly of a practical nature. As recently as today, we read in our newspapers that the situation in the Ivory Coast has taken a turn for the worse once again, and that our own people who are there to report on the elections are running the risk of being involved in a new armed internal conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We question the coherence of the policy of the Commission and the Council, whose absence in this Chamber I once again regret. Although in September 1998, it was agreed not to provide any budgetary aid to countries at war, in March 2000 the Commission provided Rwanda with EUR 110 million, while this country is occupying considerable parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in defiance of the peace agreements. I know that many who are involved in this conflict are themselves open to criticism. But do we then not apply stricter rules to Kabila’s DRC than to Uganda? Are we not stricter with Zimbabwe than with Rwanda? I have the impression that that is clearly the case because, in practice, countries which are even involved in one and the same armed conflict are being treated differently. Some are supported almost unconditionally by the European Union, the IMF and others. Other countries are given aid under strict conditions. This sometimes directly affects the power relations between countries involved in one and the same conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make myself abundantly clear: I am against any form of budgetary aid given to warring countries, for this aid is invariably used to buy weapons, directly or indirectly. This is another weak area in our European policy. Arms exports deserve a mention as they are without a doubt implicated in the various conflicts. Not only is the illegal arms trade flourishing, but the controlled arms trade is also more interested in “fair competition” among arms traders than in the peace we are promoting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is Europe's duty, as a rich continent, but I am convinced that it is also in its interest. In his very comprehensive report, our rapporteur Johan Van Hecke rightly condemns the prevailing anarchy, the result of armed conflicts that cause endless bloodshed in some of these regions, as one of the causes of this poverty. He has rightly included the establishment of a peace force in his list of remedies to this situation, without this interfering in the internal affairs of all these countries, which are jealous of their independence. Given my experience in this field, allow me to go into this point a little further.</p>
<p class="contents">We have moved beyond the age of military intervention by European contingents, not so much because this smacked of neo-colonialism as because the recent interventions by the international community, whether under the UN mandate or as a result of multilateral agreements, have shown the need to take a more regional approach to crises. If we want to make a really useful contribution to keeping or restoring peace, we need a deeper knowledge of the history, culture and even language of the country in which we are to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why regional conflict-management mechanisms have been set up and must continue to be examined and developed, with the help of the European Union. They must gradually take on responsibility for measures in the field, as part of a common strategy, coordinated between the Member States and the ACP countries themselves, and it is up to our Parliament to continue to define these measures and to play a more active part in monitoring their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, our rapporteur also deserves credit for proposing a very exhaustive list of the approaches and measures that can and must be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Along the lines of what was said by the rapporteurs, we think the European Union will have to revise its programmes of aid to countries at war, amongst other reasons to prevent the funds allocated from being diverted to military activities. Also as a matter of principle, it should reconsider support to countries or regimes responsible for armed invasions of neighbouring countries or that spend a disproportionate amount of their resources on arms, if not on operations to repress the rights of the individual or minorities within their own population.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind Article 11 of the new Treaty which states the European commitment to policies of building peace and preventing and resolving armed conflict. The dialogue between the opposing parties and the dialogue of the European Union with these same parties must be the key mechanism of these actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Maes, we are perplexed at the paradoxical behaviour, in which we see how, since the creation of the European Union, millions of euros of aid have been approved for countries that are clearly involved in the military occupation of one or other of their neighbours. In this respect, the double standards with which aid policy is sometimes applied are unacceptable, and we are also concerned by the contradictions that can arise in the conduct of Member States, or some States, and the European Union itself. I think Parliament would benefit from greater transparency, coherence, information and control over these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must understand that the reduction or freezing of our development aid for a specific country at war would often need to be accompanied by additional efforts in humanitarian aid to the people of the country, who are the main victims of such conflicts. Here again, the intervention of trustworthy NGOs is essential, enabling such programmes to be carried out with guarantees of success and effectiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is always the case, but especially so in extremely poor countries, where the population suffers twice as much; development grinds to a halt and years of external effort and aid are nullified. And what is it about: gaining or refusing to relinquish power? Accumulating minerals, massacring other ethnic groups, establishing independence or occupying part of the desert?</p>
<p class="contents">Africa, in particular, is an unusually belligerent part of the world. One in five Africans live in a country which is embroiled in serious conflict and, to make matters worse, the conflicts are increasing, both in number and in intensity. The big question is: why is this? It is the European Union’s political and moral duty to do everything in its power to prevent or stop conflicts in ACP countries. The report by Mr Van Hecke is very close to my heart. We need to be much stricter vis-à-vis irresponsible ACP regimes; criteria for suspending aid must be clear, and sanctions need to be tailored to each country individually. We must target the rulers and not the population, however difficult this is, and our Parliament must be directly involved in the decision to suspend aid.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a complete outrage if European development aid were used to fund arms deals. EU Member States which provide weapons to warring parties are partly to blame for the profound human suffering and the obliteration of their own development aid. The Cotonou Convention is right in laying the foundation for further development, participation in world trade and political dialogue, but ACP countries which slip into violence destroy this cooperation and tear the Treaty to shreds.</p>

There is only one area of serious concern, and that is where the rapporteur extends the principle of conditionality to the area of debt relief. In almost every other area I would support conditionality. I strongly believe that we have a responsibility to use the tools available to us to promote good governance, democracy and the rule of law in our international relations. But while these should indeed guide our aid policies, there is an important distinction to be made when it comes to debt relief. That is because history demonstrates that responsibility for the debt lies with the lenders as well as the borrowers. Moreover, since the original loans were made the debt stock has continued to grow way beyond the original loans. Many countries are repaying their debts several times over. Some countries still spend more on debt repayment than on health and education combined, and yet the people suffering from this diversion of resources are certainly not those who had any benefit from the original loans that were given.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a valid argument that says, what is the point of cancelling debt if undemocratic governments simply misuse the funds for their own ends? That remains a possibility. But there is perhaps a stronger possibility that once populations know that debt has been cancelled, they can exert more pressure themselves on their governments to achieve much needed social spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke's report says that applying conditionality requires consistency and courage. I agree. But in the context of debt relief it also requires justice and a recognition that in many cases, the original debt has already been repaid many times over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Out of the 34 poorest countries in the world, 20 are involved in a conflict. This situation is giving rise to instability in entire regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Morillon is right to highlight the question of poverty, the eradication of which is one of the objectives we set when we met with the ACP countries. I think that today we cannot afford not to think about debt cancellation and the structural adjustment policies which push these countries off course. I think that we must stop fixing the prices of raw materials ourselves and that we must sell triple-drug therapies and medicines at cost price. I am convinced that this is where a certain number of solidarity measures must be put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I am talking to you I feel I must spare a thought for all democrats and for the people of the Ivory Coast and, in the name of democracy, to ask for the departure of the military junta and General Gueï. We know that, if he stays, this will mean the balkanisation of Africa. His power is based on ethnic divides which we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that, to go in the direction outlined by the rapporteur, we must have extremely clear things to say to the European taxpayer and to the ACP countries. We must make a commitment to tell the military junta in the Ivory Coast, and all dictatorships, that we will never issue them with visas or give them protection. We will also freeze their assets and, in addition, we will give our full backing to all democrats.</p>

In connection with one of the poorest and most unfortunate areas in the world, I should like to give two examples of the pernicious role played by unconditional international aid. I am referring to one country which has been constantly at war since the 1960s and to another now enjoying a shaky peace, which, perversely, may be threatened by international aid: they are Angola and Mozambique, respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In Angola, the government and UNITA are waging one of the cruellest civil wars in Africa, and unfortunately it is clear that international aid to the Luanda government in particular has played a part in perpetuating this conflict. Unfortunately, I am afraid that my own government, the Portuguese Government, is involved in this military effort.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Mozambique, where there is a shaky peace that was only achieved with great difficulty, the ruling party’s use of international aid to favour certain provinces to the detriment of others according to their election results may in itself be a major factor in destroying the peace that was achieved through such efforts a number of years ago, thus reopening the civil conflict in Mozambique.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue that should be of fundamental concern to the European Union and the donor countries: whether in certain countries like Mozambique international aid is being used as an instrument of power to legitimise a government at the edges of democracy, and is thus helping to destroy a very shaky peace.</p>
<p class="contents">These are issues raised by the report that warrant considerable reflection on our part.</p>

One key message in all this is the need for consistency. The European Union has a number of activities under its umbrella: trade, Lomé agreements, CFSP, external policies and far too often one part is not necessarily consistent with another. Consistency must be our primary objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, conflict prevention must be a priority of the European Union. We are now getting the measures in place. We have the High Representative, we have the planning and early warning unit in the Council. They must now emphasise that it is conflict prevention we need to focus on rather than intervening militarily after a conflict has got out of control. In particular, we must give due emphasis to things such as scarcity of water resources as a cause of conflict. Commission policy should be aimed at ensuring that we enhance water supplies, not diminish them as has sometimes been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned before, we need to stress the importance of good governance and democracy. That should be a part of conditionality and we should demand of Member States that they do not support politicians for short-term requirements if they do not meet the essential requirements of good governance and democracy. Far too often, we are prepared to support one against another group to the long-term detriment of peace in a particular region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what we must do of course, is to stem the flow of arms into these regions, not just by actions against small arms. I would like to see, as I outlined in my report last month, action taken against arms brokers throughout the European Union. In many countries, there are no controls over the activities of arms brokers. They are able to trade as they will, and in almost every conflict you will find arms brokers behind the proliferation of arms. It is crucial as part of the EU code of conduct that we license arms brokers and start to control their activities. It is no good governments tidying up exports if we allow private individuals to act in they way they are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we should also look at licensed manufacturing. It is no good having rules on manufacturing within the EU if EU companies are able to license production outside as a way of getting round the controls.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report, but would stress that we will not get anywhere unless we are prepared to stem the flow of arms into regions of conflict. That requires much tougher action than we have been prepared to indulge in up to now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, this compassionate language is also a way of covering up the direct or indirect but nonetheless overwhelming responsibility of the major European powers themselves in the majority of these conflicts, from Rwanda to Sierra Leone.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in the Ivory Coast, even though, faced with the reaction of the population of Abidjan against the recently attempted coup d’état, both Lionel Jospin and Jacques Chirac have taken a stand against the putsch, how is it possible not to condemn the policy of French imperialism? The links between General Gueï and the French administration are notorious, as are his links with a certain number of major French industrial conglomerates which control entire economic sectors in the Ivory Coast.</p>
<p class="contents">Paris noted the first coup d’état by General Gueï with a benevolent neutrality. What is more, it exhibited shameful discretion towards the despicable ethnic, xenophobic demagogery which has been developed over a number of years by the rulers of the Ivory Coast. The French authorities also remained silent on the fact that ethnicity was used in the selection of candidates for the presidential elections, which ran the catastrophic risk of transforming rivalries for power into all-out ethnic war.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European institutions really want to tackle the causes of the evil that is striking Africa, they must start by opposing the policy of the major European powers themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A good proposal such as this is actually crying out for implementation in practice, and we should commit our policies to it wholeheartedly for our own sake. The report states quite rightly our own importance as the largest donor of aid to many ACP countries, a fact which is not yet sufficiently reflected at political level in the resolution of conflicts. This must be the starting point for any action we take. For that reason, I welcome the fact that the report speaks about the importance of positive conditionality with a high level of self-confidence. There are good grounds for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The profile that crises have assumed in the last few decades has decidedly changed. The UN, which was originally established to respond to conflicts between states, is seeking once again to get a grip on managing the increasingly common crises taking place internally in countries. For this reason the EU, as an economic and political partner, now has an enormous responsibility and, furthermore, plenty of scope for influencing situations.</p>
<p class="contents">The trend worldwide would appear to be that more and more conflicts have a religious dimension: Kosovo, Chechnya, southern Sudan, Northern Ireland, East Timor, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Kashmir and, one of the worst in recent times, the Moluccas, in Indonesia. In the West this is not completely understood. We are easily led to believe that when religion plays a part we are dealing with a private matter. But in these countries religious tensions have been used for political purposes. Mr President, we need the right tools to solve this delicate problem. One important aim would be, in my opinion, to create the post of human rights observer, or representative, who would report to the EU, particularly on the issue of religious tensions. The EU would also have to put pressure on governments, determinedly and systematically, to allow international human rights observers access to countries at war to conduct an impartial, neutral study of conflicts. We must also use all the means available to us to demand that governments should always commit to ensuring the safe passage of those taking humanitarian aid to various regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My colleague, Mr Patten, proposed in March this year that the General Affairs Council should consider this communication in the context of its debate on conflicts in Africa. The General Affairs Council concluded in May that the relevant bodies of the Council should continue their reflection upon the issue of development aid to countries involved in armed conflicts, on the basis of the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that the Member States have not taken up the Commission's communication more actively. Events in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbours in Angola and Burundi, the Horn of Africa and now, again, in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone, have shown that we cannot escape facing these difficult questions. The Commission is considering its response and in particular the use of Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement wherever this is appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">A comprehensive framework would help us to respond on a case-by-case basis to each conflict. If the Council is willing to follow up the communication, for instance by formulating Council conclusions, the Commission will assist in ensuring they reflect the many advances since mid-1999 in the EU's policy on crisis management and in the CFSP, as well as developments in the international community's response to conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also take account of the innovations of the Cotonou agreement, particularly regarding political dialogue, which should help us to find appropriate measures and proportionate and coherent responses. But it is clear that there are no easy solutions to these problems, as the contributions in the debate here this afternoon clearly demonstrate. The bottom line will, in any case, be defined by the real political will of Member States to stick to a common line. The Commission cannot promise Parliament miracles in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">We are prepared to broaden deliberations to other countries involved in armed conflicts. Violent conflict is not a phenomenon limited to ACP countries. The European Union must be prepared to react to violence in an efficient and coherent manner in other regions of the globe too.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication is an invitation to engage in a debate about EU relations with countries for which the traditional form of development cooperation has become questionable or obsolete. This is a difficult debate. We would prefer to devote all our efforts to assisting the ACP countries in the difficult task of overcoming poverty and of integrating into a rapidly changing global economy. However, for a considerable number of our ACP partners, the major challenge is the restoration of peace, or the containment of regional destabilisation. Peace is an indispensable precondition to development, and countries that remain entangled in violent conflict exclude themselves from the potential benefits of the new cooperation relationship the EU is offering them. They are also depriving themselves of the opportunities of the ongoing transformation of the global economy. They contaminate the prospect of foreign investment, not only in these countries, but also in their regions. In less unstable countries, our efforts to fight poverty and provide debt relief are contributing to conflict prevention in the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not been idle since submitting the communication. It has already taken numerous initiatives aimed at strengthening its capacities for effectively addressing the problem of violent conflicts in ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Support is given to the OAU and sub-regional organisations such as ECOWAS and IGADD in the areas of conflict prevention and management. It is remarkable how much funding is committed for the management of crises or for post-conflict reconstruction. We are committed to stepping up our efforts for effectively preventing violence and for resolving crises peacefully.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has a great number of instruments available for conflict prevention and resolution, ranging from trade and cooperation agreements to support for institutional capacity building, for strengthening respect for human and minority rights or for demobilisation and rehabilitation. We are committed to making even more effective and targeted use of these instruments. In this context we are aiming in particular to introduce conflict prevention objectives into the programming of economic and development assistance programmes. The problem is, however, that the rigid character of these instruments is in itself a limitation to what we can do and how we can use them.</p>
<p class="contents">Budget line limitations and comitology-based decision-making procedures limit our options for flexible and quick reaction. All this looks very different from the toolbox concept, which is what I think of when we talk about the numerous instruments that are available. The toolbox concept provides a good image of the ideal situation and a satisfactory way of making use of the diversity of instruments. However, we find ourselves in a different situation even though we are making determined reform efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the basic value of development cooperation in relation to the issue of conflicts is the preventive effect. Our hands are not so strong once conflict has actually broken out; we can make more meaningful efforts beforehand. There is no doubt whatsoever that the HIPC initiative, funded by the EU but not yet funded by the US, is making the biggest contribution to conflict prevention in the world right now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is little doubt that the very poor, highly indebted countries will plunge into instability and conflict if the rich world does not deliver on HIPC. Also the creation of regional economic cooperation, as provided for in the Cotonou Agreement makes a basic contribution to stability in Africa. In the next few years we will give top priority to the creation of regional stability and cooperation structures as a major contribution to the promotion of peace and progress in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I should say a few words on the situation in the Ivory Coast, in view of what has been said in this debate. Unfortunately there has been a rapid deterioration in the situation since the elections on Sunday. It is changing almost from hour to hour, but we are of course following events very closely. We anticipate that we will have to reopen the Article 96 consultations if a situation of stability and clarity is not established following the election. This is really a situation that is highly regrettable and we fear there will be even more violence if things are not brought under control quite rapidly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
