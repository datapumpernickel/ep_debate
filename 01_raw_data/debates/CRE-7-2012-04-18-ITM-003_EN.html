<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Milan Cabrnoch, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(CS)</span> Mr President, we have an opportunity to debate the proposed amendment to the regulation on the coordination of social security systems in individual Member States. I would first like to thank all of the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and others who collaborated on a change to the regulation which we can now approve – and with a large majority, I hope.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic aim of the regulation is to ensure that workers migrating within the EU, in other words, citizens of any Member State, as well as stateless persons or refugees, and including both employees and the self-employed, are covered by a social security system in all circumstances, with all of the rights and obligations arising from this, and are also not obliged to pay contributions in two or more countries at the same time. The need to modernise this regulation is connected with changes both to national legislation and to the case-law of the European Court of Justice. It is a need for simplification, easier interpretation and a limitation on the scope for conflicts of opinion. In principle, there are three main areas, which include defining and clarifying the concept of a ‘substantial portion of activities’, and specifying the criteria for possible situations where a person has residence in a state other than the one in which they perform a substantial portion of their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important topic is the introduction of the concept of a ‘home base’ to address the problem of air crew members, adopting the solution that the home base will be deemed to be the airport from which they most frequently fly and where they most frequently land, which will determine the legislation or the given national legislation that will apply to air crew in a given case.</p>
<p class="contents">The final important area is unemployment benefits for self-employed frontier workers, where these people are not insured against unemployment. Some Member States have insurance systems for self-employed people who are out of work, whilst others do not. This issue is also taken into account and resolved in the submitted draft. Under the regulation, a self-employed person would be insured against unemployment in the Member State where they last worked, even if they return to the Member State where they previously resided. The uncertainty over cover for air crew was resolved through the concept of the home base, which is the place where the air crew member usually performs his work.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation we are discussing today – and which we will approve, I hope – is a practical instrument for the smooth functioning of the common market, as it introduces greater protection and certainty for a greater number of mobile workers. Self-employed people can also now work throughout the common market with the knowledge that social security will also apply to them if they lose their livelihood.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I am looking forward to the debate, and I would like to thank you for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The free mobility of the labour force and the right of the citizen of a country to seek work in another Member State are essentially positive things for the internal market. However, it also poses challenges for the Member States, to ensure, on the one hand, that people do not fall between the social security systems of the countries in which they live and work, and, on the other, to prevent abuse of social security and unemployment benefit systems. This regulation will not, therefore, be a way to harmonise social security systems, but will mainly update the rules on coordination, so that they reflect the changes to the law in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation will clarify the legislation to be applied in cases where someone works for several employers in different Member States. The applicable legislation would be determined with reference to the main job, because it is in no one’s interest constantly to amend the applicable legislation on the basis of the periods of work that they are involved in.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the most controversial issue of all in the amending regulation relates to the export of the unemployment benefit of self-employed persons, in other words, to the notion that unemployed entrepreneurs can collect unemployment benefit in the country in which they work, even if no such unemployment benefit system exists in their country of residence. Fortunately, that original proposal by the Commission was improved in deliberations by the Council and Parliament, with the result that unemployment benefit only applies to genuine frontier workers who, in the main, go back to the country of residence from the country in which they work every day, or at least once a week, and who are at the disposal of the labour market in the country in which they work. In the same way too, the country in which they work is to determine the conditions for unemployment benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we return to this subject in two years’ time and re-examine whether this is causing problems between Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They make practical arrangements to protect the social security benefits of EU citizens who move across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">These practical arrangements can only be effective if they reflect changes in the legal and social situation. Since the modernised social security coordination regulations were applied in 2010, we have discovered that changes in national legislation and in working practices create a need for clarification of the text and for some small gaps to be closed.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal which the Parliament is discussing today takes account of recent developments and concepts which were not developed in detail in the regulations. Even though the proposal is technical in nature, it has a direct, practical impact on people who rely on the measures adopted at European level when they make use of the right to free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">As this House’s recent resolution on the 2010 European Citizens’ Report made clear, the right to freedom of movement and residence needs to be accompanied by specific measures to give substance to this fundamental freedom. This holds true, in particular, for the two most sensitive issues in the proposal: the introduction of the home base principle for air crew members, and the provision for unemployment benefits for unemployed self-employed persons who return to their state of residence in which no insurance system exists. I can assure you that the compromise reached on these technical issues is in line with the spirit of the regulation, which coordinates and seeks to protect workers’ rights. It clarifies the rights of citizens and it assists institutions when they apply these legal texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cabrnoch’s report makes the importance of adopting the file at first reading and approving the outcome of last year’s negotiations very clear, and I am grateful to him for keeping the compromise in mind when the amendments were drafted. The Commission fully supports the amendments and wishes to thank the rapporteur for helping to foster sound cooperation between our institutions on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As others have already done, I would like to mention that although this is an annual exercise, on this occasion, there are two significant differences. Firstly, the new Article 65, which grants unemployment benefits to frontier workers, who did not previously receive them; this will be reviewed within two years to make further improvements. Secondly, and above all, the new mention made in Article 11 of the ‘home base’ criterion, which gives legal certainty to aircrew members and clearly determines the applicable legislation, with the notion of ‘home base’ as a criterion, which already exists in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use the last few seconds to remind my colleagues and public opinion that, with Europe so often in the firing line now, today is a clear example of the way in which Europe can benefit and improve the lives of millions of workers who, thanks to this coordination of social security systems, will reach retirement age or find themselves unemployed but fully covered thanks to the cooperation between EU Member States. This is possible because of the European Union and the European social model which, unlike what someone from the Council said, is very much alive and should improve day by day, because that is what the people call for and that is what Parliament has today shown to be possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that the free movement of workers is one of the key EU measures for achieving a functioning labour market, it is very important to have precise and unambiguous rules for the coordination of social insurance – rules that permit our people to move freely without, at the same time, having to worry about unemployment, pensions, health insurance and other elements of social insurance. The standards established by the regulation now in force were hammered out 10 years ago. In the meantime, our labour market has undergone serious changes. The movement of workers has taken new forms. Changes have also taken place in the Member States’ legislation. Therefore, the intention of bringing the regulation up to date can only be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our parliamentary obligation to ensure legal certainty for stakeholders. Without the coordination of social insurance, the right of freedom of movement enshrined in Article 48 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is not guaranteed. New rules introduced in the regulation – for instance, standards covering the social insurance rights of self-employed people, or the addition of the definition of ‘home base’ for people employed by airlines – do not obligate Member States to change already existing systems. These guarantee citizens equal access to a Member State’s social insurance system if they are citizens of or insured in that country. Changes in the regulation, including those that simplify the wording of legal provisions, are in the interests of the citizens of our 27 Member States and others, as they also apply in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">By coordinating national systems, replacing several bilateral systems and speeding up the exchange of information, the payment of social insurance benefits will certainly become more reliable and faster. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the adoption of the amendments to the regulation at first reading. As shadow rapporteur, I would like to thank Milan Cabrnoch and the other shadow rapporteurs for their very productive, prompt and sympathetic cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been said, it is a highly technical document, but it is an extremely important one for individuals within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As people have said, this is the latest update of what is – in many ways – one of the earliest pieces of legislation put in place by the European Union. It has been extensively revised – a job that we finished in 2009 – and this is now the update. Very soon, we will be seeing how the new electronic system that underpins this is coming into effect, and hopefully it will be able to deal with citizens’ concerns more rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">This concerns the maintenance of rights for people who move across borders for whatever reason or who work in border areas. It deals with the areas of core social security, health care, unemployment, pensions, family benefits, etc. It is extremely important that those rights are upheld. I think we have got quite a citizen-friendly outcome from this first reading agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have been saying, it is designed to uphold the rights of individuals who are covered by social security systems. It was not put in place to provide an opportunity for businesses – particularly those with mobile workers – to cut costs by providing them with an opportunity to choose the cheapest place to register their workers for social security purposes. I am very pleased that we have actually managed to close that particular loophole within this revision, because to find yourself registered in a country where you feel you have no connection and to seek health care treatment, for example, in the country where you are resident, is bound to lead to confusion and a lot of difficulties for the individual. Even though the company concerned may feel that it is doing a good deal for itself and its shareholders, it is not playing fair by its workers.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are very pleased to have got the ‘home base’ definition in there, bringing it into line with other legislation to make it very clear to individuals exactly where it is that they are registered and therefore what rights they can expect. I think we have achieved a very good outcome, and we are very pleased to see it going through at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a former businesswoman, I know it is natural for companies and firms to want to cut their costs. However, it is also important that companies do not dodge their obligation to pay social security.</p>
<p class="contents">My constituency of London is the top destination for international investment in the European Union. Furthermore, foreign direct investment is a key driver to London’s success. When companies like Microsoft or Sony invest in London, it stands to reason that these companies should pay into the British social security system. The same is true of their employees who live and work in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, a loophole has allowed airlines and their employees to avoid making social security payments in their country of operation. Some pilots and crew working in Belgium, France, Spain and other EU countries have actually been paying social security in Ireland, where the companies’ aircraft are registered.</p>
<p class="contents">This report puts an end to so-called ‘social dumping’ by obliging employers and employees to pay social security in their home base.

We are in favour of measures which guarantee that people are treated on an equal basis, including in the labour market. Accordingly, changes to legislation should be directed towards enabling workers and unemployed people to be more mobile. They should not be tied artificially to the place of their last employment just to allow them to obtain social security benefits. Therefore, the measures proposed in the Cabrnoch report are worthy of our support. Moves towards better coordination of social security systems will also allow application of the principles of adequacy. In this work, it is very important to ensure a balance is maintained between the need to be competitive and the need to protect workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject we are discussing is also related to the European Commission’s proposal put forward in March on increasing the protection of workers temporarily posted abroad. This is a similar subject, one we are going to discuss in the future, and it concerns as many as around a million European Union citizens who work on postings in other countries. Achieving a balance between competition and protection for workers is, I think, a most difficult but most necessary objective today, during a crisis, when Europe is having to face competition on a global scale.

We believe this measure is worthwhile in that it seeks to apply the more advanced of two countries’ social security legislations. Nonetheless, this measure should not legitimise the existence of the so-called false self-employed; in other words, workers who hold permanent jobs. Such illegal situations should definitely not be legitimised but, instead, eradicated by creating job contracts with rights. Inspections are extremely important for achieving that.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the second amendment, aircrew workers register with the social security system of their home base. We believe, however, that there should be some control over where businesses are registered, so that companies cannot register themselves in countries where social security payments are lower so as to cut costs.</p>

<p class="contents">At a time when we are witnessing a pension freeze in Portugal, as well as wholesale cuts in holiday allowances and Christmas bonuses and a reduction in benefits, we wish to reaffirm that we will not accept the social security privatisation route and will defend a public social security system based on the principles of solidarity and universality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first of all like to thank Mr Cabrnoch for his excellent work, and what I would essentially like to point out is that as MEPs, we are often asked by citizens what it is we are actually working on here in Parliament. Well, if there is a good way to demonstrate that the Commission and Parliament can accomplish something useful together, then this seemingly technical issue we are debating right now is a very good demonstration that through sensible, useful cooperation, we are capable of assisting our fellow citizens who are making use of the freedom of movement and entrepreneurship in an expanded Europe in retaining the rights they acquired and in enjoying the benefits of those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">A particular merit of the current debate, consultation and joint work is that they are based on the proposals of the Commission’s expert committee, that they take into account relevant Member State experience, and that Parliament and the MEPs, too, are seeking to resolve these seemingly technical issues at first reading. It is as it has been mentioned multiple times. New forms of entrepreneurship, new types of contracts, and new, far more mobile employment opportunities have emerged in the EU. We are struggling in several fields to create a legal framework and legal rules to regulate and clearly address them. I believe that this matter stands as a truly good example that if we are willing, we are able to find appropriate solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the new rules concerning self-employed people and aircrew members to be particularly positive. I, too, believe that the formulation of the concept of home base gives rise to new and creative opportunities. Once again, let me thank both the Commission and Mr Cabrnoch for their work; I hope that it will indeed prove to be useful. Coordination, by the way, is an issue that we will be discussing on many more occasions, as it is a matter that needs to be re-examined year after year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe’s internal market provides benefits for the workers, too, but sadly, in the past, loopholes in the law have been exploited in relation to cross-border mobility. One example of this – and this has been mentioned by a few of the previous speakers – concerns the airline business. Flight routes were often consciously chosen in such a way that airline staff were often socially insured in the Member State where social security was cheapest for the airline. This distorted competition, and it is an example of wage and social dumping, which takes place time and again at the expense of the workers. That is why we, as European Social Democrats, fought hard to ensure that airline staff are socially insured and have to pay their taxes where they are stationed. In a social Europe, there is no room for businesses that exploit the advantages of Europe’s single market while shirking the social responsibility that is the other side of the same coin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Administrative Commission for the Coordination of Social Security Systems proposes that the currently applicable coordination rules stemming from Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 987/2009 be updated, taking into account changes in social reality and legal changes to regulations in some Member States. The most significant benefit of the proposed changes for our citizens will probably be the further specification of the application of the conditions for the carrying out of substantial activities under Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, which will be applied in cases where people work in two or more Member States, and will also apply to citizens working for different employers. Likewise, the addition of a new provision to this regulation that ensures the protection of self-employed people if they lose their work represents a greater degree of protection against labour market turbulence. There is a certain risk that this provision could be abused, so it will need to be closely monitored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking, in particular, of aviation, where enterprises offer their services in various EU countries from what is known as their home base. Where this is the case, we must not allow air crews to run the risk, in the worst case scenario, of falling through the social security net simply because they operate in various countries. However, it is essential that we do not give foreigners a basic right to receive social security – such as emergency welfare payments – without making contributions. That happened in one case in Austria, where the Austrian State was forced by the European Court of Human Rights to grant emergency welfare payments to a French citizen in Austria. The Court subsumed the entitlement to emergency welfare payments and welfare benefits under property law, something that I find incomprehensible. This represents an invitation to a new kind of social tourism within Europe in which people travel to wherever they could expect to receive higher social security payments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore good for the rules to be updated and coordinated on an ongoing basis. After all, it must not be problematic for workers to work and move between two different countries. These new rules mean that people will not need to turn down a job because they are not entirely sure of their social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules are also changing for frontier workers to the effect that they will be covered by the social security system in the country that forms their primary place of work, but with the option, if they do 25% of their work in the country in which they live, of choosing to be covered by the social security system there instead.</p>

I am delighted that issues have been clarified that relate not only to workers living in border areas who work in a neighbouring country, but also to those working in a completely different country, not necessarily across the border – the job can even be in a distant country. The payment of social security benefits for air crews and pilots has also been clarified by specifying their home airport as the base where their social benefits will be paid.

We are increasingly having to deal with labour-related migration to other countries, cross-border employment, people working in several jobs at the same time in different firms which operate throughout the Union and other people carrying on a business in two or more Member States. It should, however, be stressed that these changes are not just the consequence of the economic crisis, but also of the greater changes taking place in the labour market. Therefore, it is essential to bring existing legislation up to date to take account of the new circumstances and make it easier for our citizens to be mobile and engage in business. We need, however, to be aware that the situation is extremely dynamic. We are not currently in a position to be able to anticipate the evolution which will take place in the EU labour market over the next few years. The changes made to Member States’ legislation in relation to the crisis, the transformations in businesses, the emergence of new occupations and the ever-increasing mobility of the EU’s citizens are certain to force further change in the near future. Therefore, we should think about how to achieve overall regulation of matters related to the coordination of social security systems, so that our approach to these matters will be relatively stable and not need to be changed too often. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation where self-employed workers work in a country where they have the right to unemployment benefit, but lose that right simply because they go to live in another country whose legislation does not provide for such benefits, is unacceptable in a European Union that promotes the free movement of workers. In its case-law, the European Court of Justice has also confirmed that people who have become unemployed in one Member State have the right to go and live in another Member State to seek work there and to continue to receive the unemployment benefit to which they are entitled.

Romanian and Bulgarian workers are affected more than the rest of Europe’s citizens due to an additional requirement which is imposed on them in what is already an excessively competitive labour market. The regulations need to be simplified, especially when it comes to the relevant unemployment benefits in order to protect citizens’ rights. On this point, I should stress the importance of the amendment to Article 65. The proposed amendments will help update and improve existing regulations in light of the changing social circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What this means is that many social security claimants will gravitate to those states with the most generous systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In Britain, nearly five million people are on the council house waiting list, with little prospect of getting a home, but in some London boroughs, almost 50% of social housing is given to people not born in the UK. Many of these people will never have paid a penny in tax and will be living on state benefits. Of course there is no point in homeless Londoners emigrating to other EU Member States to seek homes and income on their social security systems because the benefits will not be as reciprocal. No one should gain public housing or benefits in Britain until they have paid tax for a considerable period of time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in order to react to these changes that improvements are proposed in the area of the determination of the applicable legal regulations and unemployment benefits. I would like it to be clarified that, in the case of work in two or more Member States, the condition of engaging in a substantial part of activities also relates to persons who work for different companies or employers. The diversity and evolution of the conditions under which professional activities are pursued make it necessary to take into account the situation of highly mobile workers in particular. I also consider it important to ensure that self-employed persons receive benefits in accordance with the laws of the competent Member State, and that they are offered the best prospects for reintegrating into the labour market when they return to their Member State of residence.

If work could not be found, or if one’s job disappeared, people would come home.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now moving towards freedom of movement of claimants. This coordination is portrayed as a safety net for hard-working, enterprising, self-employed people who fall on hard times. In fact, its motivation is to support not people but a political objective: the maximisation of the movement of people to undermine national identities. In the words of the rapporteur, without such coordination, there would be a risk that freedom of movement would be inoperable. In this field, as in all others, the measures are not designed to satisfy an autonomous demand or the desire of self-employed people to work abroad.

It supports the legitimate completion of a genuinely functioning common market and it supports basic freedoms, as well as the movement of goods, services, workers and capital. It supports the mobility of workers, and not only employees, but also the self-employed, by introducing clearer, more comprehensible and simpler rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task is to create an environment and a legislative framework for business, and not to burden Member States, businesses and workers with ever increasing amounts of unnecessary legislation. I would like to emphasise that the regulation under debate preserves full Member State sovereignty in matters of social policy, places no additional demands on Member State budgets that are already under strain, and avoids creating false, unreasonable or unfounded expectations. It also avoids creating any imbalance between the rights and obligations of workers and their employers. The regulation therefore entirely supports the basic principles of the European Union as we think it ought to operate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some low-cost airlines are experts in this kind of practice, and in its clear reference to home bases, the report that will be adopted today covers one of the legal vacuums they have been exploiting.

Mr Cabrnoch has mastered the art of bringing people together: even in the Council, there is broad support. Cross-border mobility is increasing in the internal market, and national legislation is still not keeping pace. The national social security systems need to be better coordinated. The report achieved clarification in respect of the law governing posted workers and in respect of unemployment insurance. A breakthrough has been achieved for flight attendants, something that is of particular importance for me as an MEP representing Frankfurt. My amendments have been adopted. This means that the home base will become the legal basis and thus the sole criterion for the application of social security law. An airline whose flight attendants are stationed in Germany must apply local social security law and cannot either change social security contributions or circumvent requirements for the establishment of works councils. Loopholes allowing the avoidance of higher social security standards are thus being closed. Time and practical experience will tell whether this warning shot from Strasbourg has been understood. A social market economy includes reasonable social standards. Competition on prices cannot be at the expense of the crews, who bear the hefty responsibility for the quality and safety of flights. The Cabrnoch report is thus also in the interests of passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new regulation on the coordination of social security systems aims to close current loopholes and take account of the changes in national legislation. The new rules are crucial, above all, for flight attendants and self-employed frontier workers. The social security system is, and remains, self-evidently the responsibility of individual Member States. However, we are ensuring that these systems can also be made use of by, and are fair to, those people who work in multiple EU countries as a result of the greater mobility that now exists. It should not be of decisive importance where the registered office of a company is. The decisive factor for social security is the home base, which is to say, the place where someone has the main focus of their life, from which they usually make their journeys. Low-cost airlines were responsible for wage and social dumping in the past, when, for example, Belgian stewardesses were registered with the less beneficial Irish social security system. We are now putting paid to such practices. This is a new regulation of Europe’s internal market that does not permit any dumping in relation to social security systems and ensures greater legal certainty. It takes us one step closer to a more social Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
