<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Keyser (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, my report deals with four topics which I shall summarise briefly. First topic: the legislature’s record where human rights are concerned. This is a mixed picture. Of course, the report welcomes the cooperation established with the Council and emphasises the influence Parliament has been able to exert in the struggle against all forms of discrimination and against the death penalty and in favour of women’s rights and of freedom of religion and conscience. It regrets, however, that too many of these resolutions are yet to be followed up and that the dialogue on human rights is, in some countries, without substance and of no effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one example: the tragic case of Leyla Zana, the Sakharov prize-winner, whose conviction was confirmed today by the Turkish courts in an iniquitous ruling. It may perhaps in the future be necessary to build proper control over human rights in partnership with the country in question, a partnership which respects the country’s culture but which has specific objectives and timescales, as recently initiated in Bangladesh and as may be possible in the future in Morocco and Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">Second topic: terrorism. The report unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism. It stresses the need to organise the fight against this curse. It also states, however, that this struggle must remain within the bounds of international and humanitarian law. The report refers to infringements of this law which could, owing to the feelings of injustice and despair they engender, produce an even more fertile breeding ground for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Third topic: reproductive health. This is a little known area of health. In the last century, of course, the talk was of shameful diseases and, in anatomy, the term shameful nerve was used to describe the nerve which passes through the genital areas. What is shameful today is not that nerve, but the fact that, in the twenty-first century, men and women throughout the world are still deprived of sex education, access to information and effective means of contraception enabling them to choose and schedule the number of children they have according to their own wishes and to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the terrifying spread of AIDS in Africa, in Asia, Eastern Europe and even, as you are aware, some of the candidate countries at the very gates of the Union, the urgent need for a response is clear. Anyone who sees up close, as I myself have done, the sexual devastation in the camps for refugees and displaced persons – remember that there are now 37 million displaced persons throughout the world, 65% of whom are women and young girls, that these women and girls are frequently raped, infected with AIDS and compelled to sell their bodies for food and that many of them lose their lives undergoing back-street abortions – will appreciate – and, in this regard, I appeal to Mr Gahler, representing the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – that contraception is a vital instrument for survival.</p>
<p class="contents">In fighting for reproductive health, I am not fighting against any spiritual leaders, whose right to lead their faithful I quite accept. I am fighting against certain blinkered policies, such as that of President Bush, which, by slashing funds for the reproductive health programme, including contraception by means of condoms, is going to kill thousands and thousands of people. I am in fact fighting for the right to life and human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth topic: the rights of disabled people. These people are trying to live full lives and their rights, as we know, are still being flouted in the countries of the Union. What, however, is to be said, then, about the exclusion of disabled people beyond the frontiers of the Union, their marginalisation and, sometimes, even their confinement in institutions under inhumane conditions?</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group, represented by Mr Gahler, has accused me of doing too much on this subject and of going into too much detail. Is the fact that handicapped people represent 10% of the world’s population and that this proportion is increasing alarmingly in the developing countries under the cumulative effect of destitution and armed conflicts a detail, Mr Gahler? A detail, when the PPE-DE Group wishes to delete paragraphs 71, 72, 73, 77, 78, 79 and 80? Are the rights to education, mobility and accessibility and the right quite simply to establish a family mere details? Is it a detail, supporting programmes for the care of children suffering from mental problems during conflicts? Is the fact that paragraph 78 is to be crossed out with a stroke of the pen a detail? These are details which will doubtless be fully understood by disabled people and the people defending them.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is characterised by conviction and is not designed to provoke. It presents a broad view, I accept, of human rights throughout the world. It is, however, a view bringing hope in a world torn apart. I should not like to finish without thanking all the groups which, apart from the PPE-DE Group, have supported me in putting forward this vision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for allowing me to chip in before them and I would like to apologise to the honourable Member and to the House for the fact that I have to slip away leaving the Commission seat in the capable presence of my colleague, Commissioner Reding. I have to go to Moscow for meetings with President Putin and Mr Lavrov and others. I hope the House will excuse me of any discourtesy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by thanking Mrs De Keyser for her report, which illustrates yet again how the engagement of the European Parliament on human rights issues serves in my judgement as a critical stimulus to EU policy. The Commission will, as usual, respond in writing to all the recommendations addressed to us in this report. I should like, for my part, to reflect on some of the important themes which have been revised.</p>
<p class="contents">This subject of human rights and terrorism will unfortunately remain at the top of the international agenda for some time to come. My position on the fight against terrorism is clear. It has been set out several times. I referred to it again a couple of times last night and again this morning. I will reiterate it here. The fight against terrorism must be predicated on respect for human rights, and not the other way around. It is also my deep conviction that this alone is not enough. Fostering human rights should be an integral part of the fight against terrorism. The Commission will continue its efforts to promote and protect human rights in cooperation with our partners with all the means at our disposal: political dialogue, development cooperation and work with civil society in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Two human rights issues which have received much less attention are covered in this admirable report: the right to health – in this case reproductive health – and the pervasive discrimination which, despite their efforts, people with disabilities still face all over the world, and which is compounded in situations of conflict or poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The ability of all people, especially women, to achieve reproductive health is an integral part of their reproductive rights. The rapporteur is quite right in her account of the dire consequences if the right to reproductive health is denied and also in stating that reproductive health is not a 'women's issue' alone. However, it is important to note that the social consequences of reproductive ill health can be most severely felt by girls. For example, in many parts of Africa, female adolescents are more likely than males to be stigmatised for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, and they are also more likely to suffer disproportionately from such problems as unsafe abortion and infertility.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1994, the Commission has become a major partner in addressing reproductive health needs in developing countries, in the framework of the goals agreed at the UN International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo ten years ago. Between then and 2001, we committed over EUR 655 million in external assistance that was explicitly targeted at family planning, reproductive health, safe motherhood, HIV/AIDS and population policy and management.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in July last year, the Council adopted a regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries. Under this regulation, Community financial support is given to specific operations targeting the poorest and most vulnerable populations in both rural and urban areas, designed to combat practices harmful to the sexual and reproductive health of women, adolescents and children, such as female genital mutilation, sexual violence, child marriages and early marriages.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has demonstrated its commitment to advancing respect for the human rights of people with disabilities through Community legislation which has been introduced on the basis of Article 13 of the EC Treaty to combat discrimination in the field of employment, initiatives pursued as part of follow-up to last year's European Year of Disabled People and through its active engagement on a new UN Convention in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has further undertaken a number of initiatives as part of our wider efforts to mainstream human rights in all aspects of our development cooperation, including the distribution of specific policy guidance on development and disability for the use of our delegations. But there is still some way to go. We think the best way of addressing this is through the provision of training for our staff and facilitating exchanges between representatives of disabled people's organisations and policy-makers, by raising awareness of disability issues in our dialogue with developing countries, and by including organisations for people with disabilities in the dialogue at country level.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, this excellent report highlights the anguish caused by one of the most pernicious causes of unnecessary disability in many countries, that is the use of anti-personnel landmines. Here the Commission is committed to pursuing a vigorous policy to eliminate the threat posed by anti-personnel landmines and increasing its efforts to reduce the humanitarian, social and economic costs to mine-affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy for mine action in the period 2002-2004 relates EU action to the goals set by the international community in the context of the Ottawa Convention. Assistance for mine clearance and capacity building under the EC budget has been channelled to 33 countries and regions and in 2002 European Union assistance as a whole reached EUR 145 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been privileged to see the work we are doing in this sector from Sri Lanka to the Balkans. It is enormously important and it is valuable, as are the other points made in this report, that the honourable Member has drawn this matter to the attention of the Parliament and to European public opinion as a whole. We are extremely grateful for the report. I apologise for having to dash to Moscow more rapidly that Napoleon managed and I am grateful to the presidency for making my dash possible.</p>

It is an important debate. As I mentioned before, it is an issue of particular concern and interest to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and the Council on human rights issues is very important. It is an important focus of the Irish presidency. It is very important that we should be close on this issue. I want to thank Ms De Keyser for her very valuable report on human rights in the world in 2003 and the EU's policy on the matter. The report will be part of a very important discourse. We might disagree on some elements within it, but the reality is that this is a very good report.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection and promotion of human rights should be a constant yardstick of our international actions. We adhere to the basic principle that human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and inter-related. As Commissioner Patten just said, they are so closely related to the troubles we have in a troubled world.</p>
<p class="contents">I need not emphasise the close relationship between peace, security and stability on one hand and the respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The present debate in Parliament is timely, including for the reason that it coincides with the current sixth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is ongoing in Geneva. I should like to say a few words about our relationship with the Commission. The annual report of Parliament rightly makes reference to the large degree of congruence between the European Parliament's priorities as expressed in its resolutions and the EU action taken at sessions in the Human Rights Commission. This is a concrete example of the implementation of the Council and the European Parliament working together more closely to achieve openness and transparency and the European Union's human rights policy. Indeed this is one of the recommendations of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in their conclusions on 10 December 2002, concerning human rights and the democratisation of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has played a positive role at this year's commission in Geneva. To date, on individual country situations the Union has successfully tabled resolutions on human rights situations in Belarus, Turkmenistan and in North Korea. A resolution on Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories was also adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The thematic resolutions tabled by the European Union have also been successfully steered to adoption. The Union's resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance, for example, has been adopted by consensus. The resolution on the rights of the child was adopted by mere unanimity following a call for a vote by the United States. I expect that the Commission will also adopt the European Union's resolution on the death penalty later this week. All of that is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a number of important United Nations-EU initiatives have fallen. This is due, in significant part, to the composition of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. It also reflects the unwillingness of some regional groups to accept any condemnation of their members. This has always struck me as one of the fatal flaws within the UN system. An initiative from the EU on Chechnya was defeated and our resolution on Zimbabwe fell to a 'No Action' motion. It is noteworthy that the number of votes that were cast against the draft resolution on Chechnya was, this year, significantly higher than those recorded on the same issue last year. We will have to analyse this outcome and learn why this has happened. We will also need to address the number of critical, country-specific resolutions that we table at the Commission. Not least, we need to decide on whether our priority is to make Union declarations so that the world knows where we stand, or to see our texts in fact adopted by a majority of members of the Commission. If I could lapse into less diplomatic language, it may be time that the European Union learned to 'box a little more cleverly' in its dealings on the Human Rights Commission. If we want to be effective, as opposed to simply making declarations, we have to be strategic in our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to deal with three priority areas that are mentioned in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report, Ms De Keyser focuses on three main themes: first, trends in the international war on terrorism; second, the impact of the international situation on reproductive health; and third, the rights of disabled people, particularly in conflict situations or in extremely poor or developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to disability, I was struck when reading the report by the reference to the fact that three-quarters of disabled people live in developing countries. The incidence and intensity of disability in the developing world is aggravated by poverty and, as Commissioner Patten has said, by conflict. It is a horrific fact that a huge amount of mutilation and disability flows from the use of landmines produced in so-called developed, civilised nations and then exported to the third world.</p>
<p class="contents">In recognition of the rights of persons with a disability, during the Irish presidency we will further progress work within the Union and at the UN-level to lead to an elaboration of a UN convention on the human rights of persons with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of reproductive health, the annual report highlights the worrying increase in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in eastern Europe and in central Asia, and the relationship between poverty and reproductive health issues. The Irish presidency has recognised the importance of addressing the AIDS issue and it is way beyond the capacity of any one government to solve. In February the presidency hosted a major conference in Dublin on the problem of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region under the title 'Breaking the barriers: the fight against HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia'.</p>
<p class="contents">On reproductive health in general, I want to state that the European Union will unstintingly work to ensure that the rights to reproductive health care and services accepted in all basic documents of the major UN conferences would be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its Member States are committed to the specific reproductive health goal that was agreed at the Cairo International Conference. That is to make primary health care – reproductive health care – accessible to all individuals of appropriate age as soon as possible and no later than 2015. This commitment is demonstrated by the regulation, adopted by the European Council in July 2003, on aid for policies and actions on reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">As for terrorism, Mrs De Keyser is quite right to emphasise that the danger of emotional reactions, such as fear, anger and a desire for vengeance, can lead to calls for repressive measures in the fight against this phenomenon. This is a common theme that has run through so many of the debates in this House: we all are interested in a common fight against terrorism but we must also make sure that the fight is balanced with respect for human rights for democratic principles and for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">In the period since September 2001, the fight against terrorism has become a global priority. At the same time, that fight has posed new challenges for the promotion and protection of human rights. Acts of terrorism can never be justified by any cause or ideology, and must unreservedly be condemned. The indiscriminate slaughter of unsuspecting human beings, which is the hallmark of terrorism, constitutes first and foremost a flagrant denial of the most fundamental right of all: the right to life.</p>
<p class="contents">All states have a duty to protect their citizens from terrorist attack and to combat terrorism in all its forms. Yet, in order to receive the widest possible support and to be successful in the long term, the fight against terrorism must be conducted in full respect of human rights and in full respect of fundamental freedoms. Fostering human rights should indeed become an integral part of any fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also address the causes of terrorism. To seek to understand the causes of terrorism should not be understood as being in any way soft on terrorism or on the terrorists. On the contrary, it is an essential step in the elimination of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President of the European Council, Mr Ahern stated here in Parliament last month that any good physician will tell us that in treating a disease it is first necessary to tackle its causes as well as its symptoms. All too often the simplistic response to terrorism is equivalent to addressing only the symptoms, not the disease. In the context of combating terrorism, Mrs De Keyser also rightly notes the need not to use this objective as an excuse to suppress the freedom of the press and specifically not as a justification for attacks on individuals or individual journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has traditionally attached great importance to the work performed by all human rights defenders, including those in the media. Human rights defenders have become increasingly effective in ensuring greater protection to victims of human rights violations. However, this progress has frequently been achieved at a high price and at high individual cost. The defenders themselves have increasingly become the targets of attacks and their rights have been violated in too many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While the European Union has attached importance to the protection of human rights defenders this has been largely done on an ad hoc basis to date. The Irish presidency is working to produce specific policy guidelines in order to strengthen the European Union’s support for human rights defenders. These guidelines will shortly be brought before the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me again congratulate the rapporteur on her report. On behalf of the Council, the presidency welcomes this collaboration with Parliament in further advancing our common cause of democracy and human rights. The European Union is founded on respect for human rights, and this is true both of the internal affairs policy within the Union and it is equally true of our policy in foreign affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gahler (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, protection of human rights is, traditionally, one of the core issues for the European Parliament, and there is in fact political consensus on how to handle it. The standards to be applied are to be found in the international agreements protecting human rights. Those breaching these standards or negligently allowing them to be breached must come in for criticism from this House.</p>
<p class="contents">This year’s report, however – in contrast to all its predecessors during this legislative period – has not been born under an auspicious star. Our main point of criticism is that the rapporteur has laden down what is meant to be an annual report on human rights with an unacceptable amount of ideological ballast, and made her own hobbyhorses, not to say obsessions, its central point. That, for a start, is why it lacks a general and uncontentious component, which has been introduced into the text only by dint of 70 amendments. Let me reiterate, for the sake of absolute clarity, that such a report has to be about the big issues, that is to say, about questions like: where do we demand democracy, free elections, freedom of opinion, freedom of the press, freedom of faith and conscience, the removal of legal and practical discrimination against women, the protection of physical integrity and so on? For what do we criticise the Council, particularly when, in its dealings with large countries, it pays only lip service to human rights?</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that reference in such a report to the rights of – for example – the disabled is only right and proper. Of course, their rights as citizens of the State with equal status must be enforced, and demeaning treatment in public facilities must be denounced. Within the limits of what individual States can do, the human right to life also includes the right of access to health facilities, but you must stop dressing up detailed demands in health and social policy – desirable though they may be – as a catalogue of human rights and immortalise them in this report. The fact is that those things that are guaranteed as human rights can be claimed as legal entitlements, and those who fail to provide them are violating human rights, but no single constitution, not one international convention – European or otherwise – declares the detailed demands you make here to be actionable human rights. If they were to do so, the Mayor of Rabat or his counterpart in Lagos would be violating human rights by failing to comply with your demand that the city’s buses should be equipped with doors that disabled people can use. Failure to do so may well make him a bad mayor, but he is not violating human rights. This shows just how false your approach is. There is no human right to the distribution of free condoms either, but, in this case, it is a goal to be achieved. The President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, may well have the wrong idea about how to combat Aids, but that does not make him a violator of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has before it Mr Mantovani’s outstanding report on the situation of disabled people, and it is the proper place for all the things you enumerate, but then you would be able only to table amendments and the report would not carry your name. Let me tell you, Mr Mantovani’s report puts it all so much better; that is why we will be voting for his report and not for yours.</p>
<p class="contents">As for your other hobbyhorse, reproductive health, that belongs in the Committee on Development and Cooperation or in the Junker report on 10 years after Cairo – in fact, it is already in there – but not, in this form, in the category of guaranteed and actionable human rights. From whom, then, do you intend demanding it? This is where you and I are often not that far removed from each other; I too am against this Mexico City policy. I am also the first to want Catholic mission stations to hand out condoms rather than anathematise them, but when you demand that we in the EU make up for the loss of funds from the USA, that, I think, is when others will get the idea of saving their money; after all, the EU will take over, will it not? The consensus on human rights in this House has lasted for many years, but, as I see it, your report does nothing to help maintain it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He pleaded guilty to culpable homicide and the judge set him free. In a residential institution in Belgium, disabled people have been abused by carers and health workers, physically beaten and their money taken and used by staff. In a residential home in the Netherlands, five elderly people with dementia were hit, spat at, kicked and called names by three nurses. In Spain, a 44-year-old disabled woman was confined by her parents to a cellar six feet deep from the age of four. Social workers knew about this for 25 years. In Bulgaria, children in a home for intellectually disabled people were tethered to their beds in winter and left to freeze at night when the heating was turned off to save money. Fifteen children - a quarter of the residents - died. A man from Venice in Italy with mental health problems was habitually locked in his home when his mother went out, leaving him alone. When fire broke out he found the front door locked and died of suffocation from smoke inhalation. In Germany a 55-year-old man with learning difficulties and impaired sight was attacked on his way to work by two skinheads and beaten and trampled to death. The youths told the police that 'he was unworthy of life'.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Gahler has just stated, the members of the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament voted against Mrs De Keyser's admirable report in committee and some threatened to oppose it in plenary, because they say that these examples of abuse against disabled people do not constitute a breach of human rights.

The most important reason for such violations is often the retention or indeed, conquest, of power at all costs. Similarly, barbaric practices of sowing hatred for purely religious or ethnic reasons have by no means been stamped out; on the contrary, ever more innocent people are being killed on a random basis. This week, we are commemorating the massacre in Rwanda. The world community is collectively hanging its head in shame for its own passiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this genuine? Have we really drawn the correct conclusions? For Europe, do human rights really weigh as heavily in practice as the solemn declarations would suggest? Are we really prepared to give precedence to human rights over economic and strategic interests? Unfortunately, this is still not the case. Extensive violence, torture, structural violations, such as abuse of women, the caste system, are still a daily occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">Luckily, Mrs De Keyser supports the appeals I made in my report last year to make the human rights dialogue with partner countries less non-committal and structure it more effectively. The question is to what extent this has had an effect in practice. Since my report, cooperation with the Council has considerably improved on a number of levels. I expect that the Dutch Presidency will further improve relations with this House where these matters are concerned. We on our part would do well to ensure that the human rights report is published on a set date every year, so that it is possible to include a verdict about the Council report and also about the solutions brought by the UN human rights committee. In addition, our Parliament should follow up human rights violations where we have identified them more systematically. It is unfortunate how the De Keyser report came about. Despite this, my group supports the content, even where the rights of the disabled and reproductive health are concerned. After all, it goes against any fundamental sense of justice that someone should die due to a lack of medical care. Our Christian Democrat friends should agree on this, even if it involves non-enforceable rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should once again like to highlight the increasing abuse of religions for political ends and radicalism. Given the seriousness of the threat and the reality of Madrid, I would repeat last year's appeal that the European Union will need to map out the problem in all its dimensions and should draft a strategy to prevent this religious extremism. It is also high time, in my view, that the EuroMed Foundation, which was decided on in Valencia in 2002, finally got off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union prides itself on being a community of values. That means that our human rights policy should become less non-committal; it also entails an obligation to work to propagate a level of civilisation at which large-scale human rights violations are a thing of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The law of the jungle and the option of repression and military intervention are supplanting the principles and values of international law. The war on terrorism is seen as justifying all-out aggression, in many regions of the world, against individual and collective freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The list is a long one, and includes Turkey, where Leyla Zana and her companions have just been unjustly condemned, once again, for speaking out on behalf of the Kurdish people; Tunisia, where harassment and repression of any democrat are increasing, a phenomenon to which the European Union is indifferent; Morocco, where violations of the rights of the Sahrawi people are increasing in occupied Western Sahara; Iraq, where US occupying forces are causing real human tragedies, buying up the country’s natural resources at low prices and taking upon themselves the right to behave like masters, and Palestine where, in the words of Avraham Burg, the former Speaker of the Knesset, the situation is so explosive that, ‘crying out is a moral imperative’.</p>
<p class="contents">One could also mention the intolerable harassment of those who defend human rights all over the world. According to the 2003 Annual Report of the International Federation for Human Rights Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, ‘The present climate that focuses on security first and the implementation of arbitrary measures restricting individual freedoms undermines the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In this context, it has become more and more difficult to denounce the adoption of restrictive laws, to defend the right to a fair trial, to fight against the death penalty and to condemn torture.’ In some countries, journalists, lawyers, political opponents and trade unionists have become real targets to be shot down. However, now more than ever, support and encouragement for these men and women in their struggle for democracy, justice and peace are proving to be vital to our common future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, respect and guarantees for fundamental rights such as the right to sovereignty, the right to food self-sufficiency, the right to health, and the right to live in dignity and not in misery, are also playing their part in the building of a better world. In that sense I support the rapporteur’s action, particularly as regards reproductive health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, I want more generally to draw attention to the methods that have been used, which this time have been scandalous. Human rights must not be allowed to become hostage to short-sighted and often media-led day-to-day politics. Thus, their implementation requires political choices to be made and it will also have a political impact. They have intrinsic value.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights work calls for an overall view of the situation and the systematic, sustained and consistent prioritisation of problems, both in thematic and geographical terms, that is based on its own system of logistics. We welcome this report’s overview of human rights work at the present time. At the same time, however, we need to look to the future. Unless we can improve the way we coordinate the EU’s internal and external human rights monitoring processes and put them on a par with one another, unless we are able to engage in more vigorous post-monitoring activity and disregard irrelevant political motives and hidden agendas, we will be leaving a sad legacy to the next Parliament. Only if we can put our own house in order can we in any credible way demand that Member States and the Council give up their attitude to trade policy and other narrow views on what they might gain from a situation, and create a consistent and lasting policy. In this sense human rights begins at home and that is mainly what the issue is now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We too would have preferred a report that addressed the common core of the human rights culture stemming from the United Nations Universal declaration of Human Rights. This is the direction we should be taking rather than using these reports for any other purpose. I acknowledge that the report is better than the original version that was rejected in the parliamentary committee, but nevertheless, I wish to make some observations on my own behalf and on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a few words on the Sakharov Prize and the three winners of this prize, who continue to be persecuted. The resolution lacks balance, with the explanatory statement citing three cases in Turkey, Burma and Cuba whereas paragraph 23 of the final resolution ignores the situation of Osvaldo Payá in Cuba. This must be corrected, otherwise we could be accused of memory loss and of bias.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, where terrorism is concerned, we have still not achieved a properly balanced approach. Above all, however, I wish to express my reservations as to the way in which the issue of reproductive health has been brought into this matter and especially as regards the link that is made between abortion and reproductive health – something with which I wholeheartedly disagree.</p>
<p class="contents">To quote only a few figures from the report, its explanatory statement claims that 100 abortions take place every minute and that 70 000 women die each year from unsafe abortions. I have done some calculations and this means that 52 560 children die in non-leap years and 52 700 in leap years, in addition to these 70 000 women. These are certainly worrying figures, but our slant on them is entirely different: we see them as confirming the right to life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the ICPD the international community placed reproductive health firmly in the context of human rights, and for a very good reason. When human rights treaties are interpreted, the biological differences between men and women are not taken into account and this has drastic consequences, especially with regard to the AIDS pandemic, 60% of those affected being women. Only 11% of women in a country like Zambia think that they have the right to ask their husbands to use a condom. Up to half the young women and girls in developing countries say that they were forced into their first sexual experience. They do not have abstinence as a choice. They may be faithful but their husbands are not, and they do not use a condom either.</p>

This remark was made repeatedly during the discussion of the report in committee. It was emphatically denied, but the final version of the report has in any event not been able to take away this feeling.</p>
<p class="contents">Formally, terrorism is condemned – just as well – whereupon the report spends many paragraphs on the human rights of terrorists or those accused of terrorist acts. Similarly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lacks any sense of nuance: Palestinian terror attacks and the construction of the security wall, for example, are bracketed together. We in this European Parliament should seriously consider whether reports such as this one are useful. Moreover, this is a report on human rights in the world, which means the world outside of the European Union, while we would perhaps do well to look closer to home.</p>
<p class="contents">Today of all days, the court in Belgium is passing judgment in a court case against the most important Flemish opposition party, the <span class="italic">Vlaams Blok</span>, a case instituted by a government body in which all the traditional parties have a seat, including that to which the rapporteur belongs. What we are now witnessing in Belgium is the instrumentalisation of the fight against racism, or what should pass as such, in order to curb the right to the free expression of opinion. With the elections only a few weeks away, attempts are being made to rob a democratic opposition party of its funding and even to have a court impose a <span class="italic">de facto</span> ban on it. You will appreciate that I have my reservations when someone who condones practices such as these is rapporteur today of a report on human rights in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This approach is unhelpful from many standpoints, not least from the point of view of those who suffer genuine human rights abuse and whose cry is muffled by all the other competing demands.</p>
<p class="contents">I have another concern: at a time when international terrorism ranks among our greatest anxieties, we all too often see terrorists and their front organisations and political apologists abuse the human rights label for their own purposes as a political weapon and as a means of reducing the effectiveness of the security forces operating against them.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us contains all of these faults. It is a great improvement on the first draft, but still lacks sufficient focus on the real human rights concerns around the world. Whilst swiping at the current targets of the left - the United States and Israel - it misses the opportunity to expose those corrupt regimes on many continents that keep their people in misery, and offers very little support to the victims of terrorism or those engaged in fighting terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to the Israel-Palestine question, paragraph 46 of the report infers that settlement activity outside Israel's borders is somehow comparable to indiscriminate terrorist attacks on innocent civilians inside Israel. Such comparisons are nothing short of abhorrent and it is most irresponsible for politicians to make such suggestions, particularly when all our peoples are faced with the threat of terrorism. In regard to the issue of Guantanamo Bay, the report offers excessive comfort to those detained in Camp Delta, while ignoring the difficulties faced by our democracies in dealing with fanatics who are intent on menacing and murdering innocent civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see a call for tough action by the EU and the rest of the international community to bring about real change in the countries that are the real human rights abusers, like Zimbabwe.

I shall concentrate upon two parts of the report: those relating to Israel/Palestine and to women’s right to determine their own lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first say, regarding the Pakistan debate, that, on this issue too, human rights, and not the economic aspects, must be central. Legitimising a regime that, through a military coup, has seized power and does not respect human rights should be quite alien to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, those of us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy were able to listen to the Geneva Initiative and representatives from both Israel and Palestine, confirming what is described in, for example, items 46 and 47 of this report but which the group on the Right now wishes to vote away. Closing one’s eyes to reality has never led to genuine solutions to problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a word about reproductive health. Women’s rights are human rights. Women must, of course, have the right to make decisions concerning their own bodies and so have the right to reproductive health. Proposals 28–40 are important additions to support. Every minute, a woman dies for reasons connected with childbirth. Every minute, 100 abortions are carried out, half of them by people with no medical training. Every year, 70 000 women die following unsafe abortions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the developing countries, reproductive problems are the most important cause of death and disablement. In this situation, refusing to support organisations that provide advice on contraception and consciously helping bring about a situation in which hundreds of thousands of women undergo unsafe abortions and die prematurely and in which hundreds of thousands of women are infected with HIV each year constitute a profound violation of human rights and a serious risk to women’s reproductive health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rogue states, which we condemn in our reports, despatch their ambassadors with a view to having references to their countries removed at any price. Conversely, a resolution by Parliament sometimes gives hope and renewed courage to those throughout the world who are imprisoned, tortured and oppressed or who are engaged in struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">Committed people look to the EU to play an active role in working for a better world. They are sometimes disappointed when we choose to close our eyes to serious crimes because trade policy or strategic interests come before such gross violations. We must therefore never flinch from emphasising human rights in contacts with countries such as China, Iran, Cuba, Syria, Zimbabwe, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost five years ago, I myself wrote a report on the annual report on human rights in which I drew attention to the subject of violence against women. I think it logical that we continue down this road in the last report of this term of office. The fact that, in 2004, we are having a debate about sexual violence, genital mutilation, the sex trade, the rape of young girls and the lack of AIDS medication not belonging in a report on human rights shows that we have quite a long way to go in this House too.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with Mrs De Keyser regarding all the details of her report, but it is important and only right to highlight these issues. It is very odd that there should be protests from the right wing about these issues not belonging in a report on human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet exactly the opposite has happened. There has never been so much violence in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in this climate of fear and interrogation that the Bush administration launched its anti-terrorist crusade, the sole aim of which was actually to ensure the economic, and therefore military, supremacy of his empire in a globalised liberal economy. A new concept has been born, a concept full of tragic consequences, the concept of preventive war. It is in the name of the fight against the private terrorism of his former agent Bin Laden that Bush is now legalising state terrorism, the first victims of which are the Palestinian or Iraqi people and the first accomplices of which are Sharon, Blair or Aznar. It is always in the name of the fight against terrorism that a new arsenal of repression is being stockpiled throughout the world, which calls into question fundamental liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">What values could we possibly have in common with a government which has organised that camp of the living dead in Guantanamo Bay? Far from weakening private terrorism, this arsenal actually tends to criminalise any opposition to the establishment of this new order, such as trade-union, associative or anti-globalisation movements. Unfortunately, the European Union has participated in this undertaking, with a definition of terrorism which is fatal to liberty, by adopting the European arrest warrant or the many laws against immigrants, not to mention those governments which still, in Europe, dare to prohibit abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">The campaign to eradicate war and violence cannot be confined to pious hopes, which is something which Parliament has a habit of doing. We must attack the root of the evil, a social system dominated solely by profit, which transforms people into commodities, a regime which destroys the environment and excludes billions of human beings from employment, from health or education systems, from housing, or even from the basic ability to feed themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Capitalist globalisation generates the globalisation of violence. Even now, however, we can take practical steps, for example by regularising the situation of illegal immigrants, prohibiting collective deportations on charter flights, insisting that the Council freezes the association agreements with Israel, reorganising the distribution of wealth, in particular by imposing a Tobin tax on movements of capital, or, finally, cancelling third world debt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have decided to devote my speech to Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure you will be aware of the fact that, in that country, the defenders of human rights and democratic freedoms are suffering constant pressure and harassment. Several reports by NGOs condemn flagrant violations: people in prison because of their opinions, political exiles, repeated interrogations, interruption of speakers, arrests, torture, and sometimes disappearances. Aktham Naissé, Chairman of the Committees for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria, was arrested on 13 April by the military security forces. He is being held in detention at a secret location. He is not allowed to have his medical treatment, despite the fact that his state of health is giving grave cause for concern. It even seems that he will shortly have to appear before the State Security Court. Is there any threat to public order or act of terrorism in defending human rights? Ahmad Khazen and Hassan Watfa were arrested on 15 and 16 March 2004 by the military security forces and sentenced to prison for having taken part in a deputation to the parliament, calling for democratic reforms and the lifting of the state of emergency. To date, Syrian civil society has still not heard or seen any reaction from the European Commission. Yet the Commission’s delegation to Damascus has already witnessed several of these violations. It is not a matter of interference, but rather of defending universal values for which we have a responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to remind you that we are currently in the process of negotiating an association agreement with Syria. Agreements of this type are based on the rule of law, and Article 2 of such agreements clearly stipulates an undertaking, on the part of both parties, to respect human rights. In Syria, a state of emergency has been in existence for 41 years, thus enabling martial law to be applied by means of military courts. This is contrary to the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms as guaranteed by international law and the Barcelona Declaration. Exactly one month ago, on 22 March in Athens, we created the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, of which Syria is a member. Such a partnership can only be constructed on the basis of certain requirements such as respect for human rights and democratic freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to ask you to intervene as a matter of urgency with the Syrian authorities, and ask them to guarantee the integrity of the people I have just referred to, to order their immediate and unconditional release, to put an end to the constant pressure and harassment, to respect international law and to comply with the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the international instruments which have been ratified by Syria. Our democracies have ways of exerting pressure. If we do not use them to ensure that our universal values are respected we shall lose our souls. There are many of us, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, who are waiting for a response from you, because no indulgence can be allowed when human rights are being violated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like other Members, we Italian radicals actually pay a lot of attention to anything to do with reproductive health, to the whole dimension, this new dimension which our society increasingly has to take into account in the way in which it perceives the issue of human rights, including, for example, the right to health, which now means the new technologies, genetic research, and all kinds of possibilities which are now available to mankind but which are still a problem, a stumbling block, in many of our societies. We shall therefore be voting in favour of all amendments along these lines tomorrow, in the hope of enhancing Mrs De Keyser’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like, in the context of this debate, to launch an appeal to Members, to our rapporteur, and to the coordinators of the various groups, in the hope that my message will be heard. After the vote in committee had taken place, a dreadful massacre took place, and appalling violence was used against the indigenous mountain people of Vietnam. These people form an aboriginal population, the oldest in Vietnam, which is suffering oppression at the hands of the regime in Hanoi. That oppression became manifest, a few days ago, in the brutal police action taken in order to disperse demonstrators, as also happened in another country, as we have just heard. Dozens of people were no doubt killed, and many others arrested and imprisoned. We have no news of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that time has run out, but since we talk about indigenous peoples in this report, I should like, tomorrow, with the agreement of my fellow Members, to table an oral amendment with a view to inserting the briefest reference to the mountain people of Vietnam, so as to remind the authorities in Hanoi that the European Parliament has taken their situation to heart. Mr Patten has often taken action on this matter, and some European countries have intervened too. I believe that it would be to our credit to mention, when we vote tomorrow, the oppression being suffered by the mountain people of Vietnam. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are some chapters which are interesting and which open up new prospects, in particular regarding reproductive health and the rights of disabled persons. However, with regard to the central issue, to which Mrs De Keyser had wanted, in a way, to give preference, I think that she has dealt with it rather poorly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about the issue of the relationship between human rights and the war on terrorism and, to be more specific, the challenge which the war on terrorism poses to democracy. In the twentieth century, democracies were faced with the challenge of war. Could we go to war and still remain democracies? It was necessary to find solutions that struck a balance between the ideal and the constraints of reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have to demonstrate our creative abilities again in trying to strike a balance on current issues. We cannot place the rights of terrorists and the rights of the victims of terrorism on an equal footing. We cannot allow the war on terrorism to take second place to the war on those who are combating terrorism. Yet this, particularly with regard to the Middle East, is the unpleasant feeling produced by Mrs De Keyser, in seeking to put everything on an equal footing, whereas what we have to do is to invent a right of legitimate democratic defence against terrorism. This is the central issue, and unfortunately she has failed to address it, a fact which I find regrettable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At its meeting last week, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights failed to publicly criticise Russia and China for their human rights abuses. It rejected resolutions on Chechnya, China and Zimbabwe, but adopted measures on North Korea, Cuba, Belarus and Turkmenistan. This showed that powerful countries can still get away with murder, torture and the silencing of critics just days before news emerged about the discovery in Chechnya of the bodies of nine men who had been extra-judicially executed. Torture and arbitrary detention remain rampant in Chechnya despite Russian Government claims that the situation is normalising.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States has sponsored a mildly-worded resolution on China that encourages the Chinese Government to make substantive progress in systematic reforms to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, China was victorious in a procedural initiative at the UN with a no-action motion to prevent the resolution from coming to a vote. Over the last ten years, about 8 900 Chinese Christians have been arrested and detained, and religious activity that is not state-controlled is illegal. China is increasingly branding harmless religious groups as dangerous cults.</p>
<p class="contents">In Zimbabwe, there is a chronic situation of human rights abuses, yet the United Nations is not taking any action. It simply cannot be that countries with poor human rights records use a no-action motion to block discussion of their own human rights practices. The UN Commission's purpose is to publicly air the human rights situation in any country, especially in the case of egregious violators. It is time to put an end to the misuse of procedural mechanisms to keep violations off the table. If the UN continues to be a puppet, we should cease funding its human rights activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sad thing is that we have to have it at all. If only we lived in a world where we did not perpetually have to stand up and condemn the human rights abuses that occur throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention what is happening in Zanzibar, with its criminalisation and arrests of homosexuals, and where the EU has a mechanism through which it can act - the Cotonou Agreement - but does not seem to have the political will to do so. Similarly, when there have been breakdowns of the human rights clauses in our EU Association agreements and we have called for action, those calls have been ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also mention Egypt, where there is continuing arrest, entrapment and imprisonment of homosexuals. I praise the Irish Presidency for its work at the UN in supporting the Brazilian motion on human rights and sexual orientation. Sadly, this motion has once again been suspended, due primarily to lobbying by Egypt and Pakistan, the Vatican and the Conference of Islamic States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking here about human beings, about the destruction of individual freedom, individual hope and individual lives. The dignity of any society is based on respect for the dignity of those individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this report sends out a powerful message that what happens in another part of the world is as important to this House and the Member States as if it were happening in Europe. Human rights abuses against another individual are human rights abuses against us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A free, independent and diverse mass media is a fundamental right. That is even more important in the information society, in which information is the major factor in production. It is good to remind ourselves of the situation in China, but we have problems right here amongst ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Information is a major industry that guides governments and nations. It helps to fill the human consciousness, which could not contain anything more important. The uncontrolled political influence that the big proprietors of the media have is something that is familiar to us all. Italy now has nothing less than a system of perpetual motion: a huge economic power has bought the power of the media, which in turn legitimises political power. There is also a new danger here. Big companies in France are buying up the media to protect themselves, with the result that they are outside the scope of criticism. Why do we not intervene in this, the way we do with regard to human rights violations? This after all is a violation of the right to access to information, which is a fundamental right in the human information society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To sum up, this debate underlines the value of our focus on enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and Council in the area of human rights. It also illustrates once again just how broad this canvas is, and just how extraordinarily diverse the focal points have to be in terms of human rights and human rights defenders. The contributions covered a remarkably wide range of topics and this is obviously an area where Members have not only a particular interest, but also very considerable expertise. I hope that those people who criticise this Parliament will read today's proceedings and just for once come to the conclusion that this is a House worthy of their support. I know the presidency and the Council will benefit greatly from exchanges that we have had here.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the Commission on Human Rights is continuing in Geneva as we speak. I mentioned earlier some of the resolutions that we have adopted in relation to the human rights situations in Belarus, Turkmenistan, North Korea and the Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Arab Territories. Work on other resolutions goes on but we can be proud of the role the European Union is playing via the Commission and of the work of the Commission to date. I have some good news for the House, which I will keep for the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Members are obviously very concerned at the human rights aspects of the progress of the war on terror. Ms De Keyser’s report reflects these concerns and I want to assure the House that they have been noted by the Council. I also want to thank Mr Crowley, who recently said at an interparliamentary meeting with US Congress that, in our actions against terrorists, we must be bound by the rules that terrorists flout. That was a very valuable point made by a Member of this House and is a view shared by the Council – i.e. that respect for human rights must underpin our whole approach in the war on terror and it must underpin the whole approach of our allies in the war on terror. Human rights are not divisible. Human rights cannot be set aside for the convenience of the moment. I believe it was President Chirac who said that it is in this way we uncover and analyse the roots of terror in order to sever them. We must be conscious of all the issues touched on in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very touched by Lord Stockton's farewell speech. I wish him well. Indeed, yesterday and today a number of speakers touched on the point that this was their valedictory part-session. I wish them all well. It is always a sad moment in the life of a politician when you see a parliamentarian moving on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Deva made a very interesting observation highlighting the serious problems that exist in the intergovernmental nature of the UN Human Rights Commission. Those of us who are UN defenders - which means most Members of this House and certainly myself - may rightly praise the UN for the role it plays, but should also ponder the point that he made.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dell'Alba raised the issue of the Montagnards, the mountain people of Vietnam. I want to assure him and the House that the situation of these people is an active concern of the Council and will remain part of the Union's dialogue with the government of Vietnam. The representatives of the Union in Hanoi have received guidance in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to finish on a positive note. I received some good news as I was making my contribution earlier, and am very pleased to be able to share this good news with the House. Earlier today, the Commission on Human Rights adopted the European Union's resolution on the death penalty by 28 votes to 20, with 5 abstentions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would point out to the House that this is the best ever margin of victory in the history of this EU initiative. That margin of victory is an indication of the effectiveness of the Union's policy of opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances. It is also a sign of the growing trend towards the international abolition of the death penalty. It also underlines the point I made earlier that if the Union sometimes has to come from the back of the field on issues of concern to it, then we should perhaps learn to box a little more clever and to be a little more strategic. However, this is good news and I am pleased to share it with the House.</p>
