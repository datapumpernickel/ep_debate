<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Waddington </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, I should like to congratulate, in her absence, the rapporteur, Mrs Bennasar Tous, on her report. I wish to extend those congratulations to all the members of the Committee on Women's Rights and all Members who have contributed to the formulation of the programme and the plan of action to combat violence against women and children. I warmly thank the two Commissioners, Mrs Gradin and Mr Flynn, for their support and persistence.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have a legal base for the programme, a budget and a plan for a European awareness campaign against violence against women. After all the struggles, delays and financial and legal barriers placed in our way by those who did not see the significance of this issue, we are now on a fairly firm footing and I hope we can begin to address this very serious issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The new legal base, which was not really what we wanted, relies on the European Union's competence on health and it must not restrict the scope of the Daphne programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women and children occurs in many different public and private situations and has many causes and effects. Trafficking, domestic violence, sexual abuse and mutilation, rape, sexual harassment at work: all are forms of gender‐based violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne programme is designed to give added value to the work of NGOs dealing with prevention, supporting the victims, reintegrating the survivors and dealing with the perpetrators. All these fields of work will benefit from better research and dissemination, which the Daphne programme can fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the Daphne report contains information about the European campaign to raise awareness of the issue of violence against women, and this was launched in Cologne under the German presidency last month. That conference attracted a large number of non‐governmental organisations and stimulated a great deal of creative thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bennasar's amendments, which were supported by the Committee on Women's Rights, give more weight to the involvement of NGOs in the execution of the Daphne programme. The Commission should welcome this, and I look forward to hearing its response to those proposals. The Commission should also welcome the great involvement of Members of this Parliament, which she proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have examined very closely the current guidelines for the applicants for Daphne funding. I can see a real need for improvement: they are complex and confusing. The NGOs and MEPs could, indeed would, suggest a far clearer approach – a more user‐friendly set of guidelines – which would therefore be far more relevant and effective in meeting the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a small programme and a small campaign in budgetary terms. However, the violence it aims to combat is a major problem in Europe and beyond. Our research has already indicated that one woman in four experiences violence during her lifetime and 90 % of the perpetrators are men. At least 50 % of these acts of violence are carried out by the victim's husband or partner. There is a real need to challenge this culture and to make violence against women unacceptable. Such violence cannot be seen as an act of love: it is an act of dominance and intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working towards equality between men and women and respect for human rights, both within Europe and beyond it. The level of violence the research has already illustrated demonstrates that we still have a very long way to go. We believe that the Daphne programme is very badly needed and trust that it will shortly be provided with more resources and a more open and democratic system for decision‐making.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ryynänen </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, the Daphne programme, which is designed to combat violence against children, young people and women, addresses an urgent problem, and it therefore deserves all our support and the proper scope for action. It is difficult to understand why some Member States want to limit the scope of the programme, making it hard to take proper account of its multi‐dimensional nature. Violence in all its forms, but especially violence against children, is a gross infringement of human rights, and not just a matter of public health. The aim of the programme must therefore remain the prevention of all kinds of violence and the protection of the victims of violence, which includes cases of sexual abuse and abandonment.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the most important thing would be to get to a position where we can to take preventive action and work as effectively as possible. We need training, education and advice facilities, as well as broad networks of support to cope with risk situations. Advertising campaigns, information exchange programmes, and, obviously, research into violence will be important tools in reducing the incidence of violence. We must have derived benefit from the Daphne initiative, as a new year five‐year programme is being put together which will promote cooperation among voluntary organisations and the local authorities. The organisations need support to set up various networks, to improve the dissemination of information, to forge partnerships, and to promote reciprocal information exchange. I would especially like to stress the importance of the Daphne programme for defending the rights of children and protecting them from sexual exploitation in particular. For this we need the simultaneous efforts of parents, teachers and the whole immediate community to work towards preventive child protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is also very important to extend this programme gradually to other countries, especially the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as violence in its various forms has a transnational dimension, for example in the sex trade and child pornography on the Internet. Cooperation to safeguard fundamental human rights, and thus also the rights of children, is vital, and has to work effectively between the applicant countries and the current Member States. The law in these applicant countries also has to ensure that basic rights are safeguarded in a way that is clear to all and which makes it possible to deal effectively with infringements of human rights in the form of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I would hope that issues of children"s rights will be one of the priorities on the EU agenda, as only then will we be able to protect our future and status as a community of civilised states.</p>

Chiefly, however, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this extremely important contribution to the Commission proposal on the Daphne programme, and on the way she has handled such an important issue. As has already been said, we have discussed it at some length in the Committee on Women"s Rights and there has been general agreement on its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur welcomes the proposal put forward by the Commission, but she has tabled major amendments, with which – and I would like to stress this – my group concurs. In particular, we agree with the reservations she has expressed on the change of the legal base of the action programme. The use of Article 235 of the Treaty instead of Article 129 may lead to the exclusion from the Daphne programme of all issues relating to violence, sexual exploitation and the trade in women and children, on the grounds that these issues do not have a bearing on public health. We are glad that there is some form of legal base but we have some problems with this particular legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the rapporteur asking the Commission to place the plans that are adopted into some order of priority, with a view to using the available resources in the most effective way possible. Here we are talking about plans of prevention, programmes for the rehabilitation of children, young people and women who are in danger, and provisions relating to the perpetrators of these criminal acts, especially the young. Attention must also be focused on legitimate practices and on the means of protecting the interests of children, young people and women who have fallen victim to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the request for the presence, on the advisory committee, of a representative of the European Parliament and a representative of the NGOs. We also support the request for the submission of an annual rather than a triennial report on the progress that has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that we must call on the applicant countries to take part in the programme, and that there must be better dissemination of information, especially to the media and to the public at whom the programme is directed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that we too are asking for a new report to be submitted to take into account the above amendments, and also that all forms of violence and sexual exploitation perpetrated against women and children continue to be covered, including trafficking in slaves.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Maes </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I am delighted that there is going to be this Daphne programme and I hope that we will be able to put it to good use, because violence against women and children is one of the unacceptable sides of our society and it is constantly on the increase. My arrival at the European Parliament coincided with a conference which Parliament organised on violence against children and child abuse, and I resolved to investigate this issue in depth here in the House. In particular, I would urge you to consider ways of supporting those trying to combat paedophile and prostitution networks on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, we are dealing here with a problem that is going from bad to worse. This week in Parliament, we voted on what I thought was a very good report on Internet crime. But let me tell you how things are in reality. In reality, there is an awful lot to think about. In each case, the children concerned have been the victims of a real crime. The number of victims is increasing, as is the number of potential criminals, because unfortunately victims themselves sometimes go on to commit crimes if they are unable to find ways of dealing with their trauma.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main problems – and one which the police also share – is that the NGOs working on combating the pornography and paedophile networks on the Internet often have to search among thousands and thousands of pieces of data. The report therefore rightly calls for help to be given to projects that are designed to track down victims, such as those who have been abducted and forced into prostitution, and who may be identified from the photographs offered for sale on the Internet by certain criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I would urge that considerable scope should be offered to the NGOs working in these areas, but we must also not forget the scant resources that our judicial authorities often have to work with, not to mention the lack of European‐level coordination. I therefore think that the report is right to ask whether Europol should be given the resources to play an effective role in combating this sort of violence. What I said about children also applies to combating violence against women, because young refugees are also often forced into prostitution and become the victims of the same kind of violence.</p>

I find it striking that her words have found little support here in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commissioner meant that men are responsible for a considerable proportion of the violence against women, I have to agree. Saying that the two sexes are like chalk and cheese, however, is a distortion of reality. I certainly do not mean to deny that the problem exists. My main objection to the proposal is the level at which it is tackled. Violence is a problem that occurs in small groups, so a national or local approach is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that the Bible has a great deal to teach us about interpersonal relationships, and feel I have to point out that mankind, both men and women, is made in God"s image. This belief can do much to help harmonious human relations, and anyone who is violent to those around him is simply denying this biblical truth.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blot </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the idea of adopting a programme designed to prevent violence against children, adolescents and women is a generous and noble idea which everyone can of course support. This programme, which takes its name from the Greek myth of Daphne, provides for a number of administrative actions and procedures that we approve of. But the rapporteur does not really seem to have investigated the causes and the sources of violence in European societies today. That violence is growing steadily. In France, for example, the number of crimes and offences rose from 200 000 in 1948 to 4 200 000 in 1998. Of course, not all these crimes and offences are against women and children, but there is undeniably a general upward trend in violence in that area too. That trend coincides with the collapse of the traditional framework in which people"s lives were once rooted.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, for 50 years, society has become more urban, the family framework has been crumbling, and moral and religious landmarks have very often collapsed. Emancipated from such civilising frameworks, the individual who thinks he is free may be tempted to use violence against others with complete impunity. An administrative and financial programme like the one presented to us here, while not without merit, is not going to resolve this problem, which is in fact the challenge of a new barbarism. That is all the more true because, by always insisting on rights and never on duties, the ideology of human rights produces the opposite of its intentions – justification for excesses of all kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">Ancient wisdom recognised that man was always tempted by excesses resulting in violence. For example, Plato demonstrated that the human spirit has three components: the rational, the emotional and the instinctive. If education fails to achieve an alliance between reason and emotion to keep instincts in check, they are unleashed and the door is opened to all kinds of violence. That ancient teaching is still valid. That is why mere palliatives cannot be enough. We must also combat the deep‐rooted causes of the rise in violence in general, and in violence towards women and children in particular. This presupposes that the media will cease to cultivate violence systematically and that moral education will once again become a major requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Third Republic in France, there was a consensus about this civic and moral education. This was broken down by the incursion of lax ideas on education. Man is not naturally good, he needs to feel the weight of civilising disciplines. As illustrated by the great Greek dramatist, Aeschylus, in the tragedy ‘The Eumenides", a society which fails to punish crime will open the door to growing criminality.</p>
<p class="contents">We need better teaching of ethics and more repressive courts, but people also need to be able to put down roots in small communities rather than in sprawling cities. Modern techniques mean that planning can allow people to live in human‐sized districts and villages where everyone knows each other. There would then be spontaneous social control, which is more effective than repression through the courts or administrative support to victims. We should be aiming towards such a policy of re‐rooting people in human‐sized communities. Some of the sources of violence could then be eradicated.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Lancker </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, when I presented the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on behalf of my colleague Mrs Zimmermann, I said that Parliament was delighted with this initiative by the Commission, and I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to pass on our thanks to his two colleagues. However, I also made it clear that we are extremely concerned about the change in the legal basis, which as I said at the time is certainly going to make things difficult and has considerably dampened our enthusiasm, because violence against women and children, Commissioner, is not just a health risk. It is a fundamental attack on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating violence is a very complex problem. It is not just about helping the victims, but also about preventing and combating violence among those who inflict it. It also requires cooperation between the judicial authorities and the police. It is therefore by definition multidisciplinary. What I am trying to say is that it would be completely unacceptable if the change in the legal basis meant that we only ended up with some new health programme for women and children rather than structural measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wholeheartedly support the attempts by the Committees on Women"s Rights and Internal Affairs to make various adjustments to the Commission"s amended proposal. I would like to draw attention to a number of points which I think are important here.</p>
<p class="contents">First there is the World Health Organisation"s definition of health, which is very important in that it goes further than just risk prevention. It refers to people"s quality of life, making the challenge even broader: equal opportunities for different people and different groups in society, and above all the right to life, the right to dignity, the right to freedom and integrity that everyone should enjoy. This is a clear reference to human rights, which is an area where this programme could be a little broader and where it should reinstate some of its original proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to appeal to the Commission and to my fellow Members to continue to urge the Council representatives to adopt a broad interpretation and a broad scope for the Daphne programme. I would like to hear what the Commissioner thinks about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the signals coming out of the Council still show that it is obstinately refusing to take this message on board. In particular, its plan to allocate Daphne only a mini‐budget, even less than Parliament had proposed and the Commission had agreed to, makes me very anxious about what the Council really intends for this programme. I suspect that the Council is really planning to use it only for micro‐projects – a bit of awareness‐raising and a few information campaigns – which stands in stark contrast to the very clearly stated ambitions that we have for it. If we do not broaden the scope and provide Daphne with the money it needs, it will remain a white elephant. Yet the public has enormous expectations here. So the European Parliament, as the co‐legislator in a codecision procedure, cannot accept this, and I hope the Council will listen to what we are saying.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Amadeo </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Madam President, violence is a dominant feature of contemporary society and an enigma of our open society, a society that has lost its values and is taking on new idols and new symbols, confounding those traditional values which have always formed the basis of our civil life. And so we should not be surprised when television and other means of communication transmit to us images of violence and when our children feed on these images and base their world and ideals on them.</p>
<p class="contents">We who are responsible for their education and, as politicians, have to be the most reliable interpreters of what it is that our people want, are under an obligation to condemn the sources of this violence and identify the most effective ways of combating it. In point of fact, this Community of ours is committed to combating violence, by stressing the principle of the right to life, to security, to freedom and to physical and mental integrity through a whole array of programmes, not least those which we are today trying to bring to completion. The Daphne programme combats violence against women, minors and children; it is a programme which has combated violence within the family, through ill‐treatment and sexual abuse of children and partners, and the kind of violence we see in daily life, in the form of rape, sexual violence and molestation, harassment at the workplace and so on, a true battle of values and civilisation. This programme does not shy away from the truth, does not provide simple solutions, but incorporates a number of interacting factors: education, custom, issues of economic independence and employment, legal and jurisdictional issues, services to help victims, and health matters.</p>
<p class="contents">But the regulation, the legal definition of the means of redress, as defined in Article 52 of the Treaty of Amsterdam – which is the legal basis of the programme – is restricted to combating violence. Therefore, an area to which we believe it would have been more consistent to have applied Article 235 of the Treaty has been encompassed under the heading of ‘public health", even though in the final analysis Article 235 allows for powers of action that are not specifically provided for, where Community action proves necessary to achieve one of the Community's objectives.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Junker </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sadly true that many aspects of the world in which we live are far from perfect; one of its sordid aspects is that of violence against women, children and young people, and this is a problem we have to tackle relentlessly. For that reason, the German Presidency has made the problem one of its priority issues. A meeting on the subject has already taken place. The <span class="italic">Bundesrat</span> , the chamber of the German Parliament in which the federal states are represented, has expressed its regret that 1999 was not declared to be an official year of action on violence against women, which would have been an important means of reinforcing this message.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence‐prevention strategies must incorporate different approaches, depending on whether the violence in question is domestic or non‐domestic. That distinction is not adequately covered in the Commission proposal, and so it is essential to add amendments that refer explicitly to sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and traffic in human beings and to support all the other amendments on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">These additions are necessary for two reasons: firstly, it must be made clear that the definition of violence goes beyond the use of physical force. Sexual abuse, for instance, does not always entail the use of physical force, especially when the victims are young children, but can involve all sorts of intimidation and threats which leave no physical trace. This does not make its effects any less drastic; on the contrary, they are often far, far worse.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most humiliating experiences of sexually abused women and children is not to be believed unless they can furnish proof in the form of physical injuries. Sexual exploitation is one of the most despicable manifestations of the sex industry, about which a word should be said at this point. More money is now made from trafficking in women than from drug trafficking. Traffickers in women run a far lower risk of prosecution than dealers in drugs or weapons, because there is often a lack of evidence that would stand up in court. Traffic in women is a ‘growth industry', not least because of the more open borders with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, from where most of the victims in our Member States are drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">The desperate economic situation in their own countries forces many women to clutch at any straw, which makes them easy prey for the traffickers. The fact that the enormity of this affront to humanity is no longer a taboo subject, but is being discussed more and more openly and has even been the subject of official action programmes is to be warmly welcomed. These efforts have our unreserved support, and in that context we surely owe a debt of gratitude to Commissioner Anita Gradin as well. I need only remind you of the conference which was held in Vienna and attracted widespread public attention.</p>
<p class="contents">We need comprehensive measures to prevent trafficking, to educate the public and to protect the victims, as well as cooperation and coordination with the judiciary, the police, the competent authorities and, last but not least, with the non‐governmental organisations that operate in this field; this cooperation and coordination must take place within each Member State, between the Member States and with the relevant countries outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The suitability of the chosen legal basis, which has rightly attracted severe criticism here, is open to question. But there is no disputing the fact that violence against women, children and young people ultimately damages their health and – very importantly – their psychological constitution. Reducing the problem to a mere health issue would amount to an intolerable trivialisation. Let it be clearly understood that violence against women, children and young people must be outlawed and punished as serious violations of human rights, with no ifs or buts.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Madam President, The Commission would like to thank Mrs Bennasar Tous and the Committee on Women's Rights for the report. It gives strong support to the Commission's initiative and underlines in an admirable way the need and urgency for the Daphne programme to be adopted well before the end of the year. The Commission also appreciates the important role the European Parliament plays in putting the fight against violence on the agenda of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of the proposed five‐year Daphne programme is to support and encourage NGOs and voluntary organisations to work together to protect children, young persons and women from all kinds of violence. This is to be achieved through the setting up of networks, exchange of information and best practices and the raising of public awareness. Preventive action, including how to prevent violent behaviour by men towards women, will be among the priorities. The programme is building on the experiences of the Daphne initiative which has been running since 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the report's assessment of the programme. It is an important tool in the fight against violence. The multiannual character of the programme will allow for the planning of initiatives on a longer‐term basis. The progressive extension to the acceding countries, as has been mentioned by a number of parliamentarians, and the EFTA countries, is vital, given the trans‐national dimension of many forms of violence. The programme will also help to develop the NGOs' potential in a number of fields.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bennasar Tous proposes a number of constructive amendments and additions to the Commission's proposal. The Commission is happy to accept most of them. The Commission also agrees on the need for a careful choice of projects. One objective should be to ensure a balance between different areas and target groups. The proposed advisory committee will play an important role in assisting the Commission in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and a number of honourable Members deplore the fact that the Commission decided to change the legal base for the proposal from Article 235 to Article 129. It was a difficult decision for the Commission. Nobody should doubt that the Commission would have preferred to stick to the original proposal but there was a considerable risk of blockage in the Council. Several Member States were openly opposed to the use of Article 235 and we have to bear in mind that there is no value in an unacceptable Daphne programme.</p>
<p class="contents">A question was also raised about the extension of the programme. The Commission assumes that a change to Article 129, public health, will not limit the scope of the programme. The context in which we work to combat violence and in which women and children suffer is indeed in the whole context of human rights. However, the impact of violence amounts to injury, or risk of injury, to the victim's physical, mental and psychological health. Furthermore, the Daphne programme is, as the rapporteur underlines, victim‐based. Its aim is to prevent all forms of violence and to protect all victims and potential victims of violence, irrespective of whether the violence takes the form of trafficking, sexual abuse, the abandonment of children or any other form.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Daphne programme is adopted it will provide a new impetus for the fight against violence. It is now important to have it adopted swiftly and, at any rate, well before the end of the year. The Commission appreciates the European Parliament's strong support for this objective.</p>
