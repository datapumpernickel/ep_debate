In an interview the Russian parliamentarian Boris Nemtsov describes a meeting with a young Chechen woman in a refugee camp in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia. I quote: ‘She said to me: You Russians are busy exterminating us. You are committing genocide. But you won’t succeed. Because we shall simply outstrip you in population growth.’</p>
<p class="contents">In order to support her assertion Nemtsov’s interviewee told him that a large number of children had been born last year in the refugee camps in Ingushetia. The majority of them were boys, claimed the Chechen woman. ‘And they will all join the partisans later,’ she concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Who except God alone will be able to fully plumb the depths of the suffering of the Chechen civilian population? After a terrible war in the period 1994-1996, for the last eighteen months it has again been the victim of Russian-Chechen hostilities. The fierce, belligerent indictment of these Chechen refugees, can be put in an historical and political context. Remember the horrors that Stalin inflicted on the Chechen people in the 1940s. Such a destructive cry of despair demands a serious political answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Gratifyingly, Boris Nemtsov promises to devote his energies to this. This very month he will present an all-embracing plan of action for the reconstruction of Chechnya. His aims are clear: to offer a real opportunity for the host of Chechen refugees to return home and to prevent Chechen youth from joining the ranks of the ‘partisans’.</p>
<p class="contents">This different, sensible political note from the Russian Federation deserves the moral support of the European Parliament. I therefore respectfully request the Council and the Commission in the forthcoming meetings with President Putin and his government to adopt this peaceful Russian solution to the Russo-Chechen tragedy. Then Chechen and Russian blood will no longer have to flow on such a huge scale in the Northern Caucasus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is also a doctor and a surgeon. I would also like to thank my friend, Mr Bernd Posselt, in particular, for his efforts to ensure that Parliament is at long last adopting a resolution on Chechnya. We should have done so a long time ago, but we have finally got round to it today. I believe that it is a good text and I would also like to stress to my friends and fellow Members in the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the collaboration between all the groups has been valuable. It is not the text that I had hoped for, but I believe that it is a good resolution nonetheless.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kandief could tell us and has told us, and all the Members who have met him over the last few days, a great deal about cluster bombs and needle bombs, the hospitals that he managed and which were systematically destroyed by the Russian authorities, about the acts of torture committed on the injured and the amputees that he had to look after and about the torture he was subjected to in order to prevent him from caring for the other injured people. I urge you to invite him to your own country to appear on television and speak to newspapers. I believe that his eyewitness account is particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Chechnya is a source of shame to us and to Europe. The events taking place in Chechnya go beyond anything we may have seen in recent years and we have witnessed many tragic events. I believe that the European Union and the Commission have an important role to play. Mr Poul Nielson’s behaviour is unacceptable, appalling even. Not once since war broke out in Chechnya, 18 months ago, has Poul Nielson found time to visit the country to take stock of the tragedy that is unfolding there. in my opinion, this does the Commission little credit. I am not sure if we should have a collection to pay for his plane ticket, but I believe that, unless the Commission changes its policy, Parliament shall soon be calling for his resignation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me make it clear that I want our resolution today to be understood on the one hand as an urgent appeal to the Russian Government to stop violating human rights in Chechnya and to play its part in the initiation of long-overdue measures of de-escalation and on the other hand – and let me emphasise this quite clearly – as an encouragement for those on both sides – Russians and Chechens – who are trying to bring about a peaceful end to this conflict at long last.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, our counterparts in the Council of Europe have recognised the efforts of the Russian representatives – and there certainly have been such efforts – to improve the human rights situation in Chechnya by restoring their voting rights in the Strasbourg assembly. This, however, was done in spite of exhortations to the contrary by human rights organisations. I really do think this was rather an ambivalent signal to send, and I presume that the Troika and Commissioner Patten, who are in Moscow at the moment, will raise this issue with the Russian Government and will call on the Russian side to resolve this distressing situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis delivered by the Human Rights Watch on the situation in Chechnya is very alarming. Nevertheless, I assume that those on the Russian side who are genuinely committed to finding a non-military solution to the Chechen conflict will win the day. The facts of the situation have to be faced; the population of Chechnya has already shrunk to half its previous size, and it is time to pave the way for them to live in peace.</p>

Nor shall we permit the Commission and the Council, when they travel to Moscow as the Troika, to make do with a passing reference, between the main course and the dessert, to the murders and torture that are still being perpetrated in the camps and police stations of the Northern Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten is there now, so let me ask the Commission what sanctions he has threatened to apply if the Russian Government continues to do nothing to resolve the conflict peacefully, if it is not prepared to engage in talks and to arraign those who are responsible for the violations of human rights. We have ample ground to stand on: we have the partnership and cooperation agreement, we have our strategy, and we are unanimous in our view that cooperation must be conditional on respect for human rights. The carrot-and-stick method is the right approach for us, which is why investments in the oil business can only be made on the basis of a peace settlement in Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many Members of this Parliament, among them Michael Gahler, played a part in the effort to secure the freedom of the Baltic States. I was in the Baltic States at that time too. It was a Chechen, the Soviet general Dzhokhar Dudayev, later to become the first President of Chechnya, who refused to crush the independence movement in the Baltic States. He took this stance in Estonia and Latvia in particular. Thereafter, as we know, the secession of Lithuania was unfortunately a far less peaceful process, thanks to the brutal excesses of the OMON militias.</p>
<p class="contents">And so a Chechen played his part in ensuring that European countries, which will soon be members of the European Union, did not have to undergo the baptism of blood that one or two people had in mind for them. As this example – along with the fact that Chechnya lies within the ambit of the Council of Europe and its Human Rights Convention – shows us quite clearly, Chechnya is not one of those problems on the opposite side of the globe but an essentially European problem. That is why it is such a disgrace that an unholy alliance of deceit and self-deception has been forged. The deceit is partly the product of official government propaganda in Moscow. The self-deception is happening here. It consists in a refusal to register what is actually happening in Chechnya. It is not a matter of the occasional atrocity but of systematic genocide. Mrs Schroedter was perfectly correct when she stated that half of the Chechen population has been murdered or driven out of Chechnya. This is systematic genocide of the Chechen people for the sake of energy resources and geostrategic interests. That is why we must exert intense pressure and say quite clearly to the Russians that the partnership agreement is rooted in human rights. If human rights are not respected, the partnership cannot function. We must tell our Russian partners quite clearly that this is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> in our eyes and that it is high time they started negotiating with the elected representatives of the Chechen people.</p>

It has proved impossible to solve any of the problems by military means, and all parties have been the losers. It is tragic that each side should resort to unacceptable methods in response to the other side’s resistance instead of finally sitting down at the negotiating table and beginning the process of reconstruction. I welcome the commitment of Parliament to respect for human rights in the refugee and prison camps. In a situation where violence is used on a routine basis, our delegations, observer missions and resolutions may be able to ease the problem, but I am convinced that they will not solve it. This is why I believe that one of our priorities will be to help this region to shape a new vision for the future. The first requirement is intensive dialogue. To this end, we should continue to use all the means available to us through our links with the Russian Duma.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweeping condemnations, however, are unhelpful. We shall only be able to make progress in negotiations with the Russians if we take their concerns seriously too. Terrorist attacks in southern Russia and military operations by guerrillas in Chechnya, I am sorry to say, are still taking place. A short time ago, we adopted the Oostlander report, in which we explicitly welcomed the European Union’s twin-track strategy in relation to Russia. The human rights violations in Chechnya must be condemned, but at the same time we must continue to develop cooperation and dialogue. In my opinion, both components of this strategy offer scope for further development.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Chechnya is concerned, however, I am worried. It seems to me that the criticism of conditions in the refugee and prison camps which is voiced by the Council and the Commission, as well as by the governments of the Member States, whenever they meet with the Russians, has become something of a mechanical routine which has absolutely no effect. For that reason I should like to ask the Commission to specify the measures it proposes to take in the immediate future in order to make progress towards a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The medieval warfare against civilians violates everything in which we believe in the European Union and cannot be justified in terms of the terrorist actions perpetrated by certain groups of Chechens. What the Russians are doing infringes a long list of international obligations to which they themselves have signed up. It may well be that we cannot do anything about it. It may well be that it is no use threatening Russia with sanctions and isolation, but here in Parliament, in the stronghold of freedom of expression, it must be said loudly and clearly that we condemn the abuses, the executions, the disappearances, the concentration camps and the systematic oppression of a whole people. We condemn the brutalisation which we are seeing and which offers unpleasant reminders of the past. We urge that the way should now be opened for missions from the UN High Commission, the OSCE and the Red Cross to be permitted to evaluate the atrocities and come to the rescue of the population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We ought to take account, however, of a number of recent developments. The decisions taken recently by President Putin and the Russian Government with a view to normalising the situation in that republic in the Northern Caucasus are certainly worth mentioning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kadirov’s former provisional Chechen administration has become permanent. Control of the security forces is now in civilian hands. A substantial reduction in the troops stationed in Chechnya is planned. It is also worth mentioning that the Federal Government has announced a substantial increase in the resources to be devoted to rebuilding Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these hoped-for improvements, the present situation is indeed still causing great concern. Reports are still being received stating that members of the security forces have violated human rights. The Russian administration is certainly not following up these reports properly, despite the efforts made by the office of Mr Kalamanov, presidential representative for human rights. To give you an indication of the inadequacy of the response, the number of cases taken to the courts can be counted on the fingers of one hand and, as far as we are aware, not a single sentence has yet been handed down.</p>
<p class="contents">Some essential steps have been taken in the judicial area. A number of district and central courts have been set up, and over twenty judges have been trained and appointed in Chechnya. However, for the practical benefit of these measures to be felt by the citizens, greater cooperation on the part of certain authorities is called for, especially the military prosecutors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made repeated representations to this effect to the Russian authorities and my colleague Commissioner Patten is raising the matter again in Moscow today. I am sure that on his return he will be very well placed to update you on this matter which is of particular concern to you as indeed it is to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that the Commission is continuing to provide political and material support for Mr Kalamanov through the TACIS programme. It must, however, be noted that no agreement has been reached concerning the technical conditions to allow the immediate return of the OSCE support group to Chechnya. We are working with the Romanian Presidency on this matter. We still aim to have the support group back in the field as soon as possible, but in reasonable conditions of safety and with unrestricted freedom of movement within the Chechen Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">I could also mention the need to improve the conditions relating to the provision of humanitarian aid. This involves travel permits and the possibilities for communication. However, we are all very familiar with these issues and I do not think it is worth dwelling on them.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to say that the situation seems to be improving, although a very great deal remains to be done. We have yet to see the extent to which and how soon the Russian authorities implement the measures they have announced. In this regard, it has already been stated that troop reductions will be effected as the military situation allows. This is worrying, because the reduction may be slower that we hope for. Nonetheless, these measures are essentially positive and it is to be hoped that they will enable a permanent political solution to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian Government recognised the need for a political solution in the joint declaration made after the last summit with the European Union held in Paris last October. Pending such a solution, the Commission will continue to seize the opportunities offered by the many regular political contacts with the Russian authorities to convince them of the need to investigate violations of human rights in Chechnya more thoroughly and efficiently. We shall also urge them to prevent such violations and, if appropriate, to punish those responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
