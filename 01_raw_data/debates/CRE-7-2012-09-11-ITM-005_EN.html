<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Claude Turmes, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– Mr President, as the rapporteur, I can proudly announce that today, this House will discuss and, even more importantly, adopt, by a very large and broad majority, the Energy Efficiency Directive. This was a huge collective effort by us as Members of this Parliament and, of course, by all the staff involved. I am proud that once again, it was the directly-elected European Parliament, which, after having brought Europe on to the right track on the internal market and on renewable energies, has again been the most progressive institution in making this compromise possible at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this legislation also important for citizens and businesses in Europe? This is an anti-economic crisis and anti-job crisis directive. Our economies in Europe are also weak because, in 2011 alone, we lost the astronomic sum of EUR 488 billion in having to buy oil, gas and other energy supplies. This is the single biggest wealth transfer out of the European economy to oligarchs in Russia and elsewhere in the world. It is six times bigger than at the beginning of the century and constitutes almost 4% of our GDP. I am proud that with this directive, certain oligarchs in the oil and gas market will earn less money.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, many people will be happy about this directive. Firstly, all the people in Europe who are complaining about energy costs being too high. We do not control the oil price, but we can help citizens to invest in reducing their energy consumption. With this directive, we are creating businesses opportunities, above all for small and medium-sized enterprises in the construction sector. It is also good news for jobs in Europe. What I also want as a priority in transposition is for these investments to be linked to training, especially for young people in Europe. It will be so much better, bring so much more hope, if, with this directive, we can deliver not only organisation of energy in the future, but also guarantee the professional future of many young Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one more minute in which to outline two or three priorities for where we go from now on. First, of course, is financing. It is very important that, in the context of the discussions on the EU budget, we now make energy efficiency a priority for the Structural Funds; we need project bonds for efficiency; the European Investment Bank has to step in; and all this requires follow-up action.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is also the issue of legal implementation. I have three questions on that for the Commissioner, whom I want to thank for his personal, positive commitment to making this deal possible. I should also like to thank his staff. Commissioner, there will be a need for a lot of implementation notes and guidance. I think we should make the most of the range of stakeholders involved and constitute a forum, as was the case for the legislation on ecodesign. Within this forum, stakeholders can bring their expertise to the discussions on the details of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, going back to ecodesign, a decision on boilers is pending. Maybe in your speech, Commissioner, you can give us some details as to where we are now.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point is something that is very confusing. At this very moment, the Commission is forcing the UK Government to have VAT rates for energy efficiency products that are four times higher than the rates for gas and oil. This is very disturbing and annoying, so Commissioner, can you explain to us the rationale behind this push by the Commission? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Günther Oettinger, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>–<span class="italic"> (DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, to start with, I would like to say that of all our energy policy and environmental policy objectives, energy efficiency is the most under appreciated and, perhaps, even the most important issue. That is why, alongside our subsidy policy for renewable energy and alongside the general goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it was necessary for us to look at setting binding targets for energy efficiency – for us as the Commission to do so, but with substantial involvement from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the last two-and-a-half to three years, I note that the impetus to make energy efficiency a binding area of work for European energy policy did not come from the Council. It did indeed come from the European Council in 2007, but not since then. The national ministers tended to be reticent, some of them even unwilling, and were not prepared to have binding targets set. Parliament has pushed this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you personally, Mr Turmes, along with those from the other groups who have been fighting for this. You have not just lobbied hard; you have also been skilful negotiators. After all, this whole issue is not just a matter of facts, dates and statistics. It is also a matter of diplomacy. It was on a knife edge, but it succeeded. You and the minister from Copenhagen, who is not here today and whom I would expressly like to thank, were mainly the ones responsible for a pragmatic, but, in fact, quite credible, success.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it all about? Firstly, we hope to bring about a reduction in imports of primary energy through energy efficiency – that means using energy well, reducing the amount of energy that is wasted, improving the use of energy and saving energy. Oil, gas, coal, biomass, uranium – the amount we import must not increase further as a result, but be limited instead.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the long term, we want to reduce our costs; in other words, the amount our citizens and our businesses have to spend on energy. Thirdly, we hope thereby to reduce emissions and make a contribution to stopping climate change. Fourthly, we also want to utilise the skills that our citizens have – engineering skills and trade skills – and thereby also secure and enhance jobs. Those are the four goals that make binding energy efficiency a sensible course of action at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the Commission proposal, it did not go as far as many in Parliament had expected: that is to say, at the moment, we have not introduced a binding target. We have proposed binding measures and binding targets for some areas, public buildings and others. However, the proposal does not go as far as some Members of Parliament had expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it was watered down somewhat in the course of the negotiations. Nonetheless, what we have on the table now that is to be debated and passed by you – and in the Council in parallel – is by no means mere empty words. It has substance that will be effective. With what we are currently proposing, we will essentially meet our 20% efficiency target. I am counting on the Member States to implement it on a one-to-one basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only that, however. We are also counting on there being Member States that do more. In other words, I would expressly like to mention today the idea of a competition. I think it would be terrific if, in two, three or four years’ time, we were able to note that the Member States were not just complying with binding European laws, but were exceeding them – were doing more. I would like to see a competition to find the best Member State that does more in respect of energy efficiency than is necessary under European law. Our work does not end here.</p>
<p class="contents">I see three tasks for the Commission. The first is checking implementation – implementation in the Member States and the progress reports, in other words, looking year by year to see whether we are making progress in reducing energy consumption. If so, where? If not, why not? We will then submit a progress report still under the current Barroso II Commission – in other words, before the end of our period of office in 2014 – to tell the next Commission, the next Parliament, either that things are proceeding successfully or that more needs to be done at European level by binding means. Then we will approach other sectors with other products by means of ecodesign and eco-labelling in order to be able to make further specific progress in this area, as announced previously.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, this is a good day. Bearing in mind that at European level – and that applies both to you and to us – we are still focusing almost entirely on the state debt crisis and the concerns regarding the euro, today’s draft legislation and your compromise result demonstrates that Europe can still shape things, can still act. There is nowhere else in the world that has made such binding progress on energy efficiency as we have in the European Union. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Per euro spent, we can achieve substantially more by means of energy efficiency than if we invest only in renewable energy. Moreover, electricity that is never used to start with does not generate a requirement for new grids or expensive reserve power stations. I would therefore like to thank everyone who helped bring about this result.</p>
<p class="contents">We are focusing primarily on incentives. The core of the directive – Article 6 – obliges the Member States to introduce incentives for medium-sized enterprises and for citizens. Anyone who renovates their house or installs new, efficient heating or who buys an efficient washer-drier should be subsidised by the state or, alternatively, by the energy suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, it was very important that the problems involving emissions trading be resolved. The linchpin of European climate policy is not working. I am therefore grateful that the Commission has tabled initial proposals. We need incentives for industry and we also need income for the state to provide these incentives. The Commission needs to make its proposals more specific, however. The Commission has not yet done everything that is in the statement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These measures should be designed with a gender perspective in mind, since women run a greater risk of poverty than men in almost all EU Member States.

Where CO<span class="sub">2</span> reductions are concerned, we will exceed our target. As regards the share of renewable energy, we will exceed our target. As for energy efficiency, we are going down the right route here, at least as regards energy usage in relation to economic output. Unfortunately, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) was not able to get this definition agreed in the procedure. In the directive, we now equate energy efficiency with saving energy. They are not the same, however. If I save, that does not automatically make me more efficient. The compulsion to make savings could even jeopardise the expected economic growth in many countries. In this respect, the rapporteur’s actions were unfortunate. What he refers to as strip poker sometimes meant provoking the other groups. Sometimes nothing was offered to the Council. There were clips around the ear. A diplomatic process could have achieved more for this directive and for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the fact that, in the end, we were able to achieve some compromises. The savings targets are flexible and can be implemented by each Member State according to their own particular requirements. Early actions, flexibility in the Emissions Trading System (ETS) sector and also the recognition of subsidy programmes and tax reliefs have been taken into account. Finally, we have also saved the local authorities from being forced to renovate 3% of their stock annually. It is a good thing that the Commission and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have had to adjust their wishful thinking, which is out of touch with the real world, to the reality of public finances and high energy prices. In short, there is less of the European planned economy and red tape, and greater flexibility and responsibility for the Member States themselves – all of which will benefit the environment. That is a great result.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing remains unclear, and that is what influence this directive will have on the ETS system. We did not call for a reduction in the allowances. A revision, yes. We need to be very careful that having more and more European environmental targets – such as in this directive – does not undermine the market economy-based system of emissions trading. If we decide on changes to the ETS system, then the emphasis is on ‘we’. The Commission is not permitted to push through decisions of such consequence in the comitology procedure. In this respect, we call for the comprehensive participation of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each time, my answer has been, ‘Yes, if we save energy, that could make a great contribution to pulling Europe out of the crisis’. The EU is expected to spend around EUR 400 billion on imports of oil in 2012 – money that could be spent much better. We have already come a long way towards our targets for renewable energy and for reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, but we are not good enough at saving energy. Before we can save, however, we have to invest, and energy savings are a really good investment. Investments in energy efficiency do not just mean that we save on our electricity bills. Investments in renovating buildings and in more energy-efficient technology will also stimulate the European economies and create new green jobs – and these will be local jobs in the Member States, because you cannot transfer jobs such as cavity wall insulation of buildings or energy audits abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">As we come to vote on the Energy Efficiency Directive today, it is a bittersweet feeling. The directive, as has already been said here, is nowhere near as ambitious as Parliament had intended. On the other hand, I am pleased that, despite everything, we managed to reach agreement with the Council on the fact that we can and must do better. Without the directive, the EU’s energy saving would only be 9% in 2020. With the new directive, we will save 15% and perhaps even more, and it is a sensible step in the right direction. What we lack, however, is a fundamental recognition of the fact that it is not a question of what we can afford to do, but rather that we cannot afford not to do it. I would therefore urge you to vote in favour of the Energy Efficiency Directive, but not to forget that we are still a long way from our goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The gloom-mongers said we would never reach agreement on this directive, but, thanks to his great skill and determination, we did. That was in June. Now we must move on and look ahead at what steps are necessary to make sure the Energy Efficiency Directive is properly implemented and achieves its goal.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there is the gap. According to the Commission, the text of the EED will achieve about 15% of the 20%. On top of that, the proposed measures on boilers and on cars and fans will take us to 17%. But, as we have heard, the boilers measure is still under discussion in the Council, and the cars and vans legislation has not yet come to Parliament yet. So there is important work to do, and do ambitiously. I am anxiously awaiting the promised additional measures to close the remaining gap of 3%. Commissioner, can we have them this autumn please?</p>
<p class="contents">Second, there is implementation. The directive calls for all requirements to be implemented by 2014. That is only six years before 2020. I hope that lessons have been learned from the Energy Services Directive. The Commission will need to monitor Member States closely and provide a guiding hand if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding the 2050 national road maps, this could be the most effective measure in the directive if it is carried out seriously. To reach 2050 greenhouse gas reduction targets, the existing building stock needs to use 80% less energy than today. The national road maps must not be vague. They must set out a clear path for that reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy efficiency is a key part of economic efficiency and, in terms of the economy, we are all in this together. We cannot afford slackers. Every country’s business is everybody’s business. I hope the Commissioner will now commit to the task of making sure that the directive is 100% implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has said that it supports energy savings, but now another part of the Commission has announced that the UK cannot keep its low VAT levels for energy efficiency installations.

<p class="contents">One of the previous speakers mentioned a very large figure – 4 billion on energy costs in the European Union. This really is big money. If the European Union fails on energy efficiency, then it will also fail on climate change, energy security and social security. We therefore have to improve our energy security and efficiency and control spending because otherwise, the price per unit will continue to rise. Targeted policies and specific measures must be used to achieve an absolute reduction in energy consumption, which will thus reduce consumers’ spending on energy. Increasing energy prices have a negative impact on low-income households, particularly during the economic crisis. In Lithuania today, prices for centralised heating have become an intolerable burden for residents. It is also essential to reduce the bureaucratic burden in all Member States. I am not speaking about the renovation of buildings. Consumer organisations should also have a greater role in developing a national strategy to protect consumers from unjustifiable price increases. All information regarding energy price increases should also be made public and be publicly accessible. Finally, perhaps the European Union financing percentage for establishing smart energy facilities should be reviewed, so not 50% but more, and I have cogeneration in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, a personal comment. I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere among the entire group of shadow rapporteurs and, despite the reputation of Mr Turmes, I must say that he is an agreeable, tolerant and open partner in discussion, when he wants to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that there is a persistent problem here, which is that energy efficiency and savings are too close in this project. Savings are not the same thing as energy efficiency, and what Mr Pieper said, of course, is true.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that some of us had the impression that a way would be found, and that the Commission and the Council would agree on the binding nature of the aims and the flexibility of resources. That would be far better than a result which rather favours binding resources and aims that are not binding but are, on the contrary, flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, implementation will not happen, even when the resulting compromise is quite good, without the involvement of the municipalities and the regions. That is where the problem lies. The same applies to the clarification of terms, many of which – even key ones – have remained rather vague. All of the shortcomings are trumped in my eyes, however, by the fact that the result may be positive for European employment. Two million jobs add up to an argument for giving this measure a try. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ultimately, there will be few other things that will have the same significance as this Energy Efficiency Directive, and this is as a result of tenacity and hard work. It is as a result of the work done by the rapporteur, but also by shadow rapporteurs who have done truly admirable work, and I therefore congratulate them all.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive basically has three objectives: it will help to make the European Union less of an energy island, it will help to make climate change targets a reality, and it will also help to develop an energy efficiency market that will make it possible to have greater economic growth through the right technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to highlight one thing which I think is the major contribution that Parliament is making to this directive, which is flexibility: flexibility in the 1.5% savings target for energy distributors and sellers, or the target of renovating 3% of buildings; and the flexibility that Member States have to apply alternative measures. This is the key, because there is a great deal of diversity within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were quite a few hurdles to overcome, but we succeeded.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Danish Presidency did very well. It managed to balance ambitions between goals and flexibility and recognised when to close a deal in the Council, which was absolutely crucial for further negotiations. Having been in close contact with Minister Lidegaard during and after the negotiations, I know that the Presidency was extremely grateful to this House: to the Committee on Industry, Trade and Energy as a whole and to the rapporteur and the shadows in particular. There were lots of obstacles along the way. Without the impressive strong political will of the European Parliament to get a result, the Danish Presidency would have been sent home with empty hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, ambitions were drastically cut, but we have a sound compromise where ambitions and the need for flexibility meet. This is, in particular, thanks to very efficient and professional codecision work between all the European institutions, which is something to learn from in the future. Congratulations to Europe, congratulations to us. Mr Turmes, you did a fine job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these unsolved problems is the question of public procurement. I think the criterion of energy efficiency in public procurement must be clearly balanced by that of price. It must not be the case that we exchange the high electricity bills we pay today for very high bills for services and goods related to energy efficiency when these services and goods do not produce overall cost savings and are incapable of doing so. I do not think our citizens are particularly interested in whether they pay too much for electricity or too much in the form of taxes levied to pay for energy efficiency. A very harmful role is being played by the linking of energy efficiency with climate policy. Manipulation and administrative correction of the carbon market – only because this market produces unexpected results – is very bad news for businesses, because it compromises the profitability of business done in the European Union and undermines confidence in legal transactions conducted here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that energy efficiency is, undoubtedly, one of the most powerful anti-crisis measures that we in the EU could currently have. We have had enough of punitive austerity policies without a cent of investment in Europe’s economies and energy efficiency can be one of these areas for investment. We see the waste that we have in terms of consumption; we see the throttling of many European companies, particularly because they cannot pay their energy bills; and we also see that we are extremely dependent on fossil fuels and the oligarchies that produce those fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore obvious that this investment has to be taken seriously and we cannot continue treating energy efficiency as some sort of garnish for governments to use however they choose or to abandon if they feel like it.

The Swedish Parliament has officially protested against this directive but Brussels is, as ever, ignoring the interests and sovereignty of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU explicitly sets limits on the EU’s powers in the field of energy. This article states that Brussels is not allowed to interfere with the operation, choice or structure of energy supply in a Member State, whether it is efficient or not. The current proposal on the efficient use of resources is therefore not only contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, it does not even have a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we voting on this? What Brussels is actually concerned with is the organisation of the European Union itself. And there we can definitely achieve efficiency gains. We have huge numbers of officials, we are getting one new agency after another. We have an incredibly costly and an utterly failed euro policy and all those things are not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, we could use our energy more efficiently from now on by talking about the things that we actually have control over. If not, we might as well abolish this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Energy efficiency is really something to get on our soapbox about. We are all in favour of it, but we all have great difficulties when it comes to doing something concrete about it. It is clear that if we want to bring about a change in the use of energy, and we have all undertaken to do so, then we have to do things not just on the supply side – in other words, investing in renewables – but also on the demand side. Energy efficiency is undoubtedly the most cost-effective way to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">To be frank, I am a little disappointed with the Member States for being so reluctant to accept a fixed target for energy efficiency as we agreed in 2008. That would have been the simplest way. Each Member State establishes how much it wants to save, and then decides the measures itself. That would have saved us all the red tape on energy that we have created with this proposal and this report. That is actually my main criticism. Mr Turmes was a very tough negotiator. In the end, we decided to accept this compromise. The problem will be that we now have a set of rules that are extremely complicated and laborious to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">The simple variant – targets, with everyone doing it the way they want to, as has already been mentioned by a number of Members – would undoubtedly have been the most elegant solution. The Member States must be openly criticised for not having been prepared to do this. Please could we also not forget the social problems that are naturally associated with the Energy Efficiency Directive. Buying these new products costs money. We need to watch out that we do not overdo things here. Fundamentally, then, I am in favour. However, we need to see how this is implemented in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is obviously not possible, but there are some points I can make. I would like to thank and applaud the rapporteur and all colleagues who worked on the directive. Parliament has done an excellent piece of work here. The Danish Presidency deserves recognition. With strong opposition and powerful enemies, it was no simple matter. The result can be regarded as a success, because we do have at least something on the table. Without a directive, we would not have achieved even half of the intended objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all of the enthusiasm and joy over what we have achieved, the current version of the directive is, above all, a missed opportunity. All of the main objectives, all of the binding objectives, were removed from the proposal by Member State governments, and instead ways were proposed of achieving the objectives contrary to the logic of the issue, despite the fact that Member States have varying heterogeneous conditions. This is what they wanted and what they pushed for here.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak with people a great deal, ladies and gentlemen, and I would like to take this opportunity to pass on to you one message from them. People are getting poorer, energy poverty is affecting increasing numbers, and they have had enough of this. We must do something to stop the anger boiling over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effort to boost energy efficiency in Europe may lead to positive effects on the European economy, but also on the environment, as long as sensible steps and measures are taken in the area of energy savings which do not interfere in the basic market principles that Western Europe has so long profited from. The Energy Efficiency Directive should bring about these sensible steps.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the submitted text is a balanced compromise. I primarily support the view that states should have some flexibility in the choice of instruments through which they will help to boost energy saving, because conditions often vary between individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures introduced by this directive should motivate and make possible real savings. The directive should not introduce restrictive and unachievable targets and greater bureaucracy, which would harm businesses and end consumers. This proposal must not lead to reduced primary energy consumption in the EU at any cost, and it should take account of other EU objectives, such as competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The advantage was that in this House, there is unanimous agreement on the benefits of promoting energy efficiency as the most effective, most direct and cheapest method of ensuring security of supply and competitiveness and of combating climate change. The disadvantage is the current economic and financial situation of many Member States, which are struggling under a terrible recession, which means that both their governments and their businesses, which are fighting for survival, are resistant to anything that involves taking on additional obligations requiring them to make investments.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in view of the advantage and the disadvantage, we had to find a balance between these two factors, which we have achieved. This balance has been achieved thanks to the way that we work and the excellent quality of the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Turmes, and by the shadow rapporteurs and all Members, and to the very positive role played by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Without any doubt, there are occasions when our work takes on all of its European meaning. This has been one of those occasions, and therefore we must congratulate Mr Turmes and all those who have contributed to achieving this great result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would have meant fewer rules, fewer regulations, fewer reasons for people to get up in arms about European policy and perhaps, at the end of the day, we would even have achieved a better result if we had concentrated on incentives rather than rules. That did not succeed, however, because in the end, we had to reach a compromise and because there was much opposition and many difficulties. Sometimes, Claude, I also thought that perhaps a slightly more flexible approach, less of the all-or-nothing attitude, might have achieved such a result.

If we can save up to 20% of the EUR 400 billion that we spend on imports of oil and gas, then that is money that can be spent on other things. It is money that can be used for new energy renovation measures. It puts local workers to work. We are creating jobs in Europe. I would have liked to see a more ambitious agreement, but where the energy saving scheme is concerned, for example, I think it is a fantastically good result, and we have got this part on track. We have tried the energy saving scheme in Denmark and it now emerges that we can save even more through voluntary agreements. However, we will have to look at whether we can do something more in the future. I believe that ecodesign can also be expanded into industry, which would benefit the competitiveness of European enterprises on the world market, so there is no doubt that there are still a great many opportunities. There are still low-hanging fruit that can be picked. All in all, however, it is an excellent agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The directive being debated today introduces new obligations for Member States, such as renewing every year 3% of the floor space of buildings owned by public institutions to increase energy efficiency. Although it is less ambitious than the initial position adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the compromise that has been presented offers national, regional and local authorities flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I should point out that we are imposing ambitious obligations on Member States without, however, ensuring the appropriate funding. I call for energy efficiency measures to receive adequate sources of funding in the forthcoming multiannual financial framework, especially via the Structural Funds.

Over a period of four years, the country’s former socialist-liberal government facilitated the renovation of 280 000 panel buildings, largely from EU funds with contributions from the Hungarian State and the local governments, while citizens needed to contribute only 25-30% to these energy efficiency improvements for panel buildings. This specific example is another indication that energy efficiency is the best way to go. I agree with both Commissioner Oettinger and the rapporteur. It is unfortunate that Hungary’s current government chose not to continue this programme. I ask Commissioner Oettinger and Parliament that we put aside separate funds for this purpose, that is, for energy efficiency improvement, for the period between 2014 and 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It will only be possible if we provide an impetus to innovation and investment, both in product development and services. Therefore, we need efficiency, not energy conservation, if we are to create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is, of course, that investments are needed first, and only later with the passage of time come savings. Another problem is that those who invest do not always conserve energy. In a time of financial crisis, it is also difficult to find investors in many Member States. For that reason, this directive is very flexible in terms of the measures that should apply to certain countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, this directive will bring a lot of added value as this is the first comprehensive EU regulatory framework for more efficient energy use.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw your attention to one particular aspect: the fact that it is now time that economies comparable to our own economies started implementing comparable measures and that we should, as a result, be much more assertive in international negotiations on climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, persisting with a neoliberal model has, in practice, simply been contributing to increasing the prices of these goods for the end consumer, thereby also increasing the huge profits of companies that cooperate in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy should be considered a basic good of the utmost necessity and many types of consumer behaviour can only be analysed from this point of view. In other words, many people only consume what they need and that is not dependent on the lack of information for consumers. What happens is that many of the companies providing this type of service have a monopoly and charge very high prices. The concept of market liberalisation – the idea that the consumer can freely choose their supplier – is far from proving that it contributes to reducing prices; quite the contrary. As such, rather than rewarding the companies with the lowest energy costs with State aid, it is essential to regulate the energy prices charged by the companies that provide these services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot pass this important directive on efficiency this afternoon and then, on the same day, the Commission completely interferes with its implementation by one of the largest Member States. How can it be that people have to pay four times as much value-added tax for efficiency products than they do for oil and gas?

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Günther Oettinger, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment on the interesting and constructive contributions in five points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it was asked why we are enacting legislation at European level at all. Firstly, we have common climate change objectives, and energy efficiency is an important instrument for better climate change policy. Secondly, we have an internal market. That is why energy targets at European level make sense. Moreover, a 20% improvement in energy efficiency is a target that was developed and adopted jointly by Parliament – by you – as well as by the Council and the Commission. Since this decision was made in 2007, we have not really made much progress. That means it is now necessary to arrive at binding European measures if the objective on which you decided, which is greater energy efficiency by 2020, is to be achievable at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the subject of buildings and efficiency is of great significance, not only as regards industrial buildings, but also public buildings, infrastructure and private buildings. We have a problem here. If you take a normal building and renovate it so as to be energy efficient from basement to roof – using state-of-the-art materials and windows, using ICT, using the most efficient modern condensing boilers with the highest energy efficiency, then you will only get a return on your investments – in other words, you will only recoup the costs – in at least 15 or maybe 25 years’ time, as a result of lower energy bills for heating and electricity. In other words, it is an investment for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Now imagine a mayor. He is up for re-election in two years’ time. Why should he invest now in renovating nurseries and schools and the town hall when it is not even the next mayor, but the one after that who will reap the benefit? He will probably consider visible renovation of the market place, of old buildings and the pavements, or providing more staff in child care and provision for the elderly, as being more important. We are talking here, then, about an altruistic investment for the benefit of the next generation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think it important and necessary to make billions available in our European structural programmes each year for cofinancing in our proposed budget that you will be debating in the coming weeks for the budget years 2014-2020, and to encourage our Member States and our regions and local authorities, which call in the funds, to attach great importance to the subject of energy efficiency. I believe that here, we must provide a carrot, an incentive in the best sense of the word, in order to steer national and municipal budgets more towards energy efficiency in the building stock.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr Turmes, we will be tabling a binding proposal on condensing boilers in a few weeks’ time. The final hearing was a few days ago. I am also prepared to engage in bilateral talks, but we will be consulting on our proposal in the Commission during the autumn and will then reach a decision by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, value-added tax is naturally a sensitive subject. Like you, I can see that it would be desirable if a lower rate of tax were to create an incentive for energy-efficient appliances and for buying such appliances. However, this is not a matter of policy, but rather a matter of the interpretation of applicable law. I will therefore take up this matter again, but when I made enquiries a few days ago, I found that there was no room for discretion by the Commission and that rather account could only be taken of the objective that the government in London is pursuing by an amendment. I will be happy to provide you with a letter in the coming days, Mr Turmes, showing that there is no room for discretion and why this is the case. It there were, we would be using it. It there is not, then we cannot use it. The only possibility, then, is to amend the appropriate European law.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the Emissions Trading System (ETS), which was mentioned by Mr Liese and others. When the ETS was introduced – that was you, I was not even here yet then – there were certain expectations, such as the expectation of creating an incentive in the market for reductions in CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. There was also an expectation that it would trigger investments in the energy sector, in industry and also in the private sphere in new technologies that would prevent CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. Finally, there was an expectation that was not shared by all, but which was assumed in many budgets, that new sources of income would be created to finance sensible new work and expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, ETS revenues in the years 2006 to 2011 averaged EUR 16, 17 or 18; at its peak, it was up to EUR 30, and it is currently EUR 6 to 8.50. A price of EUR 6 to 8.50 is not enough to send a price signal. That means that there is really no longer any incentive for investing in reducing and avoiding CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as the Commission, have now tabled a proposal, in July, and decided to postpone the release of certain CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions allowances that were to be made available each year over the course of the period up to 2020; in other words, not to make them available next year or the year after, but rather at the end of the decade, in order to achieve a certain change in supply and demand and thus also to send a price signal. Counter-argument number 1 is that all this is harmful to planning certainty and undermines the confidence of all players. Counter-argument number 2 is that the target of a 20% reduction in emissions will be achieved by 2020 even with a price of EUR 6. In other words, even without changing our current ETS system, the allowances are sufficient to achieve a 20% reduction in emissions – whatever the price at which they are made available.</p>
<p class="contents">This autumn, we will have to decide – Ms Hedegaard is leading on this, we are helping – what allowances will not be placed on the market in 2013 and 2014; in other words, what allowances we will hold back. In truth, however, it is not a matter of whether we postpone the release of certain CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions allowances onto the market, as is our current proposal which is based on the applicable law, but rather it is a matter of whether we decide not to release allowances onto the market at all over the period up to 2020; in other words, in practical terms, creating a shortage of emissions rights overall and not simply postponing their release onto the market. This is a matter that will be discussed in the Commission and we would also like to discuss it with you in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">That is our own problem that is internal to the EU. Let us not be under any illusions, however. There is also an external problem. At the time the ETS was created as a market instrument for reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions in Europe, we also had an external expectation. We, the European Union, were pioneering this, and our partners in other regions of the world would follow. So far, it seems we were largely mistaken. Australia is following in our footsteps, but with unimaginably low volumes. Have you, like me, been following the election campaign in the US, in Washington? The subject of CO<span class="sub">2</span> and climate change is playing no part in the American election campaign. Consequently, we must assume – whoever wins the election – that there will not be a majority in the next Congress for binding CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions reduction targets, for binding worldwide climate change. I have no hope of this.</p>
<p class="contents">China – likewise. Russia – likewise. India – likewise. We have the problem that we, the European Union with its 500 million inhabitants, are responsible for just about 11% of worldwide CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. Since we have no partners, the question of where we go from here is one that must be asked not just internally, but also externally, and it must be about how we get others on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the key points. I believe that the legislation that we have before us today puts Europe on an innovative yet pragmatic course that will, in the end, benefit our citizens, that will not harm our economy, and that can be checked by us and implemented by the Member States without a great deal of red tape. We will be happy to report – whenever you would like us to, but within the next two years – in a progress report whether the Member States have kept their word when it comes to implementation and what progress we are making. If necessary, we may yet have a binding general target during the period of office of the Barroso II Commission, as was mentioned by Mr Reul, and which was generally considered a priority in Parliament, but which it was not possible to get the Council to accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Laws were then passed on renewable energy and the climate, making them binding. What we are doing here now is actually putting Chancellor Merkel’s promise into concrete legislation and creating a new architecture for energy efficiency in Europe, with a maximum primary energy consumption in Europe in 2020 of 1 474 million tonnes oil equivalent. The Member States must send national efficiency targets to Brussels as early as April 2013. I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for having made it clear that if the Member States do not submit a national efficiency target, the debate on binding targets will be reopened.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank you for being prepared to discuss the issue of UK VAT once more, so that we do not get a bad press in the United Kingdom. What I am still waiting to hear about is the implementation, and the issue of how you are organising yourselves in the Commission. Experience shows that apart from Denmark, Belgium and Ireland, and eventually, to some extent, Poland, Italy and then the new French Government, the others have done nothing but negotiate downwards. If you now go and discuss the whole guidance only with the Member States, then there is a risk that the whole thing will be watered down. I believe that the Ecodesign Forum is the appropriate place, where stakeholders and Member States sit down together at particular times to simply discuss facts only and to ask ourselves what is going on here. It is clear that the decisions between the Commission and the Member States are subsequently agreed decisions. However, we should create such a forum.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank you for having mentioned the Structural Funds. I would then like to move on to the Emissions Trading System (ETS). In the case of the Structural Funds, we are talking about EUR 20 billion by 2020 – if it goes through. If we get the ETS back on track, then we are talking about revenues for the Member States in the order of EUR 120 billion to EUR 200 billion. In other words, the question of how we reinvest in Europe is also related to us getting this ETS market back up and running. However, that is also important for the major energy concerns and the captains of industry. How are they supposed to develop a vision? How are they supposed to elaborate an investment strategy when ETS prices are falling so much?</p>
<p class="contents">I have one very final word to add. Last week, something happened that I find mind-blowing. Last week, I was informed that Germany’s Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology had attempted to more or less water down or moderate two fundamental definitions in the German translation. I must say that as a Member of Parliament who is negotiating an English text, I consider it institutionally impossible if I can no longer be sure that once the negotiations are complete, governments will not go in and exert extreme pressure on the translators. I would like this to become known externally so that it does not happen again. It cannot be the case, and we cannot allow it to happen, that governments attempt to rein in a fully negotiated text; it makes them look like bad losers.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation by you all, and I would particularly like to mention the chair of our Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. We have enjoyed positive cooperation with the secretariat, with my staff. We have once again written a little bit of energy history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new directive will be able to bring about a reduction in energy consumption, restrict imports, create new jobs and provide social protection. We must bear in mind that achieving energy efficiency does not only mean investing in renewable energy sources or new energy projects but also, primarily, improving existing energy sources and wasting less energy, which is at a very high level at the moment, incurring unjustifiable costs for ordinary citizens, especially for those who are socially vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that new investments in energy efficiency are economically sustainable and do not give rise to undesirable spin-offs, such as increasing energy costs for end consumers. In addition, I think that these investments must also cover the private housing sector as in many Member States, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, this causes huge energy losses. The same also applies to the production infrastructure and the transportation of energy, which need to be modernised to restrict collateral losses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed regulatory framework is an important step towards achieving the goals set within the energy and climate package, as well as promoting green growth and employment. With the addition of the European sectoral measures on energy efficiency and the provisions taken at national level by Member States, the European Union should therefore be in a position to meet its indicative target for energy efficiency, set at 20% by 2020. It is essential to fight against waste, control energy use and drive innovation, without reducing our production and economic activity. At a time when the issue of energy costs is on everyone’s mind, let us not forget that the best energy is that which we do not consume. Finally, I am particularly pleased with the provisions of the directive which aim to promote heating and cooling efficiency. However, I do regret that the final compromise does not incorporate my amendment aimed at creating a category of cogeneration units between 1 and 20 MW in remote areas that are disadvantaged and have insufficient electricity, in particular where resources are available nearby. This could have helped stimulate decentralised energy production in rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is obviously wrong. The efficient use of primary energy depends on the efficiency and number of conversion processes involved, activation energy and the dynamics of the combustion processes employed (that is, making use of processes which involve lower ignition temperatures), the efficiency of transmission and resistive losses. The 20-20-20 targets require a real improvement in efficiency, not a reduction in consumption. What is needed is to stimulate innovation as a step towards achieving this goal, and not reductions, exclusions and price barriers. The greatest reserves of real efficiency lie in thermal refurbishment, cogeneration and reducing energy intensity. The Member States should measure their efficiency as primary energy consumption per capita in 2020 in relation to a baseline year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many initiatives are already pointing in the right direction, but the results are still dwarfed by the untapped possibilities. Europe has recognised its backlog, and has realised that in the middle of an economic crisis, it cannot afford the luxury of taking the development of energy efficiency lightly. These investments not only cut down our energy bills but give immediate boosts to the economy. However, as long as issues regarding financing remain unresolved, our energy efficiency goals laid down in the directive remain nothing but grandiose targets. Often, the problem does not lie in the lack of determination but in obtaining the subsidies necessary for renovation and raising the required own contribution. I therefore find it a major step forward that upon a Hungarian initiative, an innovative financing instrument has been included in the directive. According to the proposal, the state can sell excess quotas from non-industrial emitters and can use the resulting income for the achievement of energy efficiency goals. The Hungarian proposal allows the own contribution required in energy efficiency programmes to be replaced by the income from quota sales. This allows a large number of investments generating notable energy savings to be implemented despite the economic crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In crisis-stricken times such as these, the promotion of energy efficiency is a vital interest for Europe, because by reducing our dependence on external energy, we could save billions of euro on energy imports, not to mention the resulting improvement in energy security, which has always been among the primary goals of the sector. In addition to the 20% efficiency improvement target for 2020, the present agreement requires Member States to implement the energy-related renovation of 3% of their central government buildings each year, and sets an EU-wide minimum target of 1.5% per year for the energy savings of energy companies. The advantage of the agreement is that it approaches the issue of energy efficiency from many aspects, and can therefore have a simultaneous effect on both the public and the private sector. As a Socialist MEP, I find it particularly important to note that the implementation of the draft would promote job creation, and would encourage invoicing based on actual consumption, thereby promoting the interests of disadvantaged groups. Bearing Hungary’s interests in mind, I wholeheartedly support the objective of the draft that Member States should pay increased attention to the operation of the heating and air conditioning systems in buildings, as one-fifth of Hungary’s population still lives in panel flats, which are especially exposed to this issue. I am of the opinion that if we manage to make actual progress in energy efficiency in the near future, Europe’s recovery from the crisis can be accelerated substantially. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The energy efficiency ratio in the industrial sector went down by 58% between 1995 and 2009, whereas the ratio for the EU as a whole fell by 20%. This reflects a significant improvement in energy efficiency in industry, where it is clearly above the EU average.</p>
<p class="contents">An example of the compromise directive’s flexibility are the provisions concerning the shift to high-efficiency cogeneration technology. All newly built or renovated industrial installations must be equipped with a cogeneration system, as long as the cost-benefit analysis of such projects shows a surplus. In addition, where important reasons exist, Member States can decide to set aside this requirement for industrial installations. Further improvements to efficiency will require enormous investment in the short and medium term, because almost half of today’s electricity generating capacity and cogeneration systems are over 30 years old. The need to save energy has existed for a long time. However, both in industry and in domestic situations, current expenses are always more important than investments in increasing energy efficiency.</p>

It even included this goal among the five headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy. Based on the results so far, however, it seems that we will be able to achieve only half of that target. It has become certain that we need to make further strategic decisions in order to increase energy efficiency. We are importing increasing quantities of energy at increasing prices, and there have been disruptions in access to energy sources. Energy efficiency is one of the simplest ways to cut back greenhouse gas emissions, ensure that our energy consumption is sustainable, and increase supply security. The largest energy savings can be achieved by reducing the energy demand of buildings. Energy-related aspects must be given more weight when designing buildings, as the energy demand of buildings currently constitutes 40% of the EU’s total energy requirements. Several Member States, including Slovakia, should be encouraged to include among their short- and long-term plans a support scheme for the modernisation of obsolete buildings and for the construction of new houses, with particular focus on passive houses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
