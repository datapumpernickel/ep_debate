Immediately after the voting on Monday, I thought that perhaps the report had come to resemble a Christmas tree when a newly-married couple combine their Christmas traditions for the first time. After more careful study, however, I can clearly see that the tree is not only decorated but also maintains a consistent theme.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it has now been established that Natura 2000 is to be funded. The amount is not up for negotiation. We have international commitments, and nature will need help for the foreseeable future. The European Environment Agency in Copenhagen has, time after time, drawn attention to the alarming situation, and we need to reverse the trend. Consequently, to include the Commission’s own minimum amount of EUR 21.35 billion for 2007-2013 in the report is merely stating facts, because this amount is not up for discussion. We only know that if we do not get moving right away, matters will simply become more and more expensive day by day. I have seen in Poland how huge Danish and American pig farms are spreading out over a fine and vulnerable landscape with no regard for biodiversity. In Denmark, many farmers are bagging pollution permits in Natura 2000 areas. As a result, they will be able to earn a pretty penny when the government wants to buy them back. This type of behaviour must be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">What is actually up for negotiation is how the money is to be obtained. In this respect, it is pleasing that the Committee is united in believing that Natura 2000 should be incorporated not just into rural development policy, but also in a broader framework. Just as the Commission has stated, Natura 2000 must be incorporated into all EU policies. The committee has, however, been even more realistic than the Commission. We mention environmental considerations generally and not just Natura 2000, and we know that the goal cannot be achieved unless amounts are earmarked in these funds and conditions introduced. To date, we have seen little sign of environmental considerations, despite the fact it is already possible to incorporate them into the funds. On the contrary, the funds often work against the countryside. If, however, consideration for the countryside is integral to the way the funds are used, farmers will then have an interest in the environment and in environment-friendly farming and other production in the areas concerned, earning twice as much in the process. I am convinced that this will heighten their sense of the wealth that biodiversity represents – including in economic terms, as the Commission has, moreover, so rightly pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">There are small areas that cannot be helped via the funds. For these, we must use the ‘LIFE+’ dedicated fund, which is also designed to ensure that management and other organisational tasks are carried out. More than once we emphasise the need for the rural development fund in particular – in other words, the second pillar of the common agricultural policy – to be significantly increased, if the task is to be achieved in a justifiable way and in harmony with those who are to implement it. Naturally, we can call for more money in the budget for this purpose, but it is more relevant and realistic to obtain a considerable part of the money from the first pillar of the common agricultural policy, where the really large amounts of EU funding are committed. We must not forget, however, that a substantial part of the amount must come from the Member States. It is their commitment, and I believe it is important that we emphasise that the Member States have an obligation themselves and that this is not something to be funded solely by the EU. After all, it would be appalling if we expanded the idea of the eternal existence of subsidies – as we know all too well from agricultural policy, where the Member States are now of the opinion that practically the whole thing should be paid for by the Community. No, they must pay for this themselves. Cofinancing by the EU is above all an important helping hand, and we expect that, in any event, half of it will be covered via the EU’s budgets and thus, primarily, via the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must now have confidence that both the Commission and the Member States will comply with their responsibilities, listen to Parliament and incorporate Natura 2000 into all the relevant policies. The heads of government made a commitment to do so in Gothenburg and on various occasions subsequently, and this is something they owe both to the citizens of the EU and to our descendants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, I do not know the exact nature of his commitments, but I willingly agreed to replace him. In any case, I believe the speech I am going to make in this Chamber was drafted by his office and his Directorate-General, and Commissioner Dimas himself fully agrees with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitment made by heads of state and government in Göteborg to halt the decline in the use of biodiversity by 2010 is recognised as a key element of the EU’s sustainable development strategy. Nature and biodiversity are included in the main priorities for action. The successful implementation of the Natura 2000 network will be the cornerstone of the EU’s effort. Ensuring that Natura 2000 is adequately financed is therefore one of the top priorities. It is in that context that, on 15 July 2004, the Commission adopted its communication on the financing of Natura 2000. The communication looked at all possible options, including the establishment of a separate fund, and concluded that the most effective approach would be to integrate the funding of Natura 2000 into existing Community financial instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The new structural fund regulations now under discussion in the Council provide for the financing of Natura 2000 and also include mechanisms for guidance and control by the Commission of the programmes the Member States submit. The Commission is aware that there is concern in Parliament about the priority Member States will give to Natura 2000 when faced with competing demands on limited budgets. It is argued that firmer guarantees and ring-fencing of funds are needed. The Commission cannot support such a rigid approach. It is not possible at this stage to give a precise indication of the amounts likely to be spent annually on cofinancing Natura sites from 2007 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The needs of Member States will probably be very different. Therefore, on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, it will be up to each Member State to decide on the requirements of its Natura 2000 network in drawing up national programmes for different funding regulations. Nevertheless, the Commission has proposed an element of ring-fencing that will assist the second axis of Natura 2000 in land management or rural development regulations. That requires Member States to allocate a minimum of 25% of the total for this fund to this axis, which means that at least EUR 22.75 billion will be available for land management during the 2007-2013 period. Support from the European Parliament in safeguarding that amount will be crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing their structural and rural development fund programmes, the Member States will need to take note of the priorities to be identified in the strategic guidelines, which will be issued by the Commission following approval of the funding regulation. As Natura 2000 has been clearly identified in a structural and rural development fund proposal, Natura 2000 will be identified as a Community priority in a strategic guideline for the relevant fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that the main points of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development have been taken on board in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The structural funds must be part of the funding mechanism for Natura 2000, but there must also be a clear commitment that the money will be spent on specific, authorised objectives; in other words, that the money <span class="italic">is</span> earmarked and that the release of that money is conditional on national Natura 2000 financing plans being in place in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mainstreaming environmental considerations into all EU policy work is the way forward. I welcome the integrated approach of the Commission. One of the most important features of Natura 2000 is that it reflects that integrated approach; it puts people at the heart of the process and, in particular, people who live and work in our rural areas. As well as aiming to stop the decline in biodiversity in Europe, Natura 2000 creates and sustains jobs, supports agriculture, forestry and rural development and provides tourism and educational opportunities. But the truth is that support from the structural funds or the rural development budget will not be enough on its own to fund Natura 2000. That is why it must go hand-in-hand with Life+ and a dedicated fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main concern is that we have effective funding options to ensure that this ambitious scheme to safeguard and support Europe’s natural heritage actually succeeds in its aim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament owes it to the citizens of the Union that we stop the decline of biodiversity in Europe. To reach this goal, however – as with any other large-scale enterprise – money is needed. All the Member States, the Council, and the Commission were in agreement when they created the bird and habitat protection Directive. Equally unanimous was our decision to build up a European network for nature protection. Therefore let us now undertake to carry out our decision, and with our joint resources create the material conditions for it too!</p>
<p class="contents">In the People’s Party and the Environmental Protection Committee we heartily welcomed the European Commission’s Recommendation for financial support for the ’Natura 2000’ network. The integrated approach in this case would be financed by the Regional Development Fund, the Structural Funds, and also the supplemented LIFE+ fund, however it is workable. This could be workable, insofar as [1] the funds just named would handle nature protection goals as a real priority, [2] appropriate guarantees would be built into the provisions of the various financial instruments, [3] due to the greater number of tasks, these funds would be supplied with extra money. Therefore we take it as given that the individual Member States will take part appropriately in financing this, and that the danger of their being knocked out by other, more economically competitive, projects will not threaten programmes targeted at safeguarding biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s answers to our questions, however, have strengthened our misgivings in connection with the effectiveness of the integrated approach. Because of this, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes we must review this financial solution and consider a financial instrument created specially for this purpose. I would like to thank Mrs. Margaret Auken for her work, compiling an in-depth and expert report and for giving us her fullest cooperation. Our recommendations for compromise amendments bear witness that with common interests every party group and specialist committee moves in the same direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sculpture reminds us once again that Europe is not just a continent, or a political and economic unit, but also an imaginary person. Europe not only needs competition, development and infrastructure, but, like any woman, she also needs care in order to preserve her beauty and natural assets. Many natural assets such as lakes, rivers, forests and fields have already been destroyed by industry, urban planning and intensive agriculture. Now it is really our last chance to save the remaining natural sites in our Member States. That is why the Socialist Group welcomes the Commission’s Natura 2000 initiative without any hesitation. We also welcome every further step to strengthen the programme. We have consulted many environmental NGOs in Brussels and at home and have built their suggestions into our amendments. Natura 2000 can work only with the active support of local communities, NGOs, and rank and file people – men and women, young and old, who just like the beauties of nature without any political statement. The Socialist Group is committed to providing a clean natural environment for every European citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s original communication envisaged EUR 6.1 billion per year for the project. We considered it a brave and encouraging step. Later, we heard that, due to co-financing, the Member States would have to cover half of that sum. For new Member States like my country, Hungary, it is not easy to secure money, but we are committed to doing our best to save our unique and untouched natural sites. However, at least half of the sum should be guaranteed by the EU, which is why I have tabled an amendment to ensure that at least the minimum sum of EUR 3.05 billion per year, or EUR 25.35 billion between 2006 and 2013, is guaranteed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday evening, the amendment was carried unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It is very sad to see that the PPE-DE Group has changed its mind once more and wants to delete the reference to a concrete sum in the report. I am very disappointed by that approach. Without money, we can tell fairy tales for 1001 nights, but not a single tree or one square metre of a lake will be spared from destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group keeps to a straight path and we do not change our standpoint from one day to the next. We support the report as it has already been accepted by the Environment Committee, and ask other Groups to also say ‘no’ to those who try to start cutting the budget for nature and the future of Europe’s environmental assets. The voting list for tomorrow will speak for itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, our rapporteur, Mrs Auken, most sincerely on the quality of her report and also, I would like to say, for her tenacity in defending our common objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow's vote, as I am sure we all appreciate, is crucial. Natura 2000 is the main tool for protecting biodiversity and endangered species in the EU. Despite the slow pace taken by certain Member States, the local administrations and players have set to work. Today, Natura 2000 covers more than 18 000 sites, 64 million hectares and nearly 15% of the landmass of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of financing, yes, we must guarantee the viability of the financing, of the co-financing, of Natura 2000 by turning, as the Commission proposes, to existing sector financing instruments: the CAP Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds. The integrated approach is certainly the most logical one in this regard, and we must now follow this logical path to its end and ensure that it is made compulsory to include Natura 2000 in the funds in question. This is also the main criticism being levelled at you, Commissioner, by the players on the ground and which is supported by no fewer than 15 Member States and the European Parliament: as Natura 2000 is by definition a concrete example of local governance, it is clear that, if local councillors and officials are not compelled to clearly promote the conservation of habitats and species in special areas, the money will be used for completely different things, for example road construction or the implementation of social or economic development projects. This is what is said in the important point 8 of our resolution, which our group strongly supports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are also in favour of point 5, which calls on the Commission to make a commitment to amend the new financial instrument LIFE + to include a specific item on 'nature conservation' and also to guarantee a minimum amount for Natura 2000 in the next financial perspectives, an amount which, as for other European policies, must match up to our ambitions. Those ambitions are clear: for all of us to endeavour to protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have a point of order that relates to the French translation and is important for tomorrow's vote in plenary. If I am not mistaken, and I do not think I am, the French translation is incomplete. I am referring to point 5, which is a crucial point, as I have just said, since it relates to financing and to the level of that financing. I think that the English translation, which is the other text that I have here, must refer to this matter, because it is seven lines longer than the French translation and those seven lines make specific reference to what I have just mentioned, in particular the proposed minimum amount of EUR 21.35 billion. I therefore think that we will need to point out tomorrow that seven lines are missing at the end of the French text. We also need to be told which language version is authentic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are not fantasy figures, produced by NGOs that may have taken certain liberties. No, the figure comes from the Commission, which has estimated the costs of managing Natura 2000 as at least EUR 6.1 billion per year. I really do not understand why you cannot assure the European Parliament that the Commission will fully guarantee three billion per year of EU funding. The proposal you are putting forward does not guarantee that. Thus, we are no further forward today than we were two weeks ago, and we would like to have a response from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was very little time to consider. We were told there would be an enormous outlay of EUR 6 billion, and now the Commissioner says that a minimum of EUR 22.75 billion will be made available for the 2006-2013 period. To compound matters, there was only one translation available, in English. I was disappointed to see the Committee on Regional Development voting in favour, although it did not do so unanimously, as Mr Hegyi stated, as I and several others voted against.</p>
<p class="contents">This episode is a perfect illustration of the cavalier way in which this Parliament too often goes about its business, and that is no laughing matter given the profound effect the EU has on people’s daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Natura 2000 is a case in point. Although we all appreciate that the environment is very important, the livelihood of human beings has to be the priority. Natura 2000 has had a negative effect in this regard. Let me give a good example from the Czech Republic, where an area has been designated to create feeding habitats favourable to partridges and quails and to reduce the erosion of soil and nutrients. My Czech colleagues tell me that this has been very good for the quails, but disastrous for the human beings who live and work there! In the United Kingdom too, chalk downland, dry bog and hedgerows have been destroyed in the name of EU standardisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Habitats Directive, from which Natura 2000 derives, seeks to establish a common framework for nature protection as though wildlife were subject to academic theory. Nature, by definition, cannot be standardised, nor can real human lives, which is why UKIP opposes the dead hand of the EU wherever its grip extends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that the Natura 2000 programme is a cornerstone of the European Union’s efforts to protect biodiversity. The debate initiated by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in this House on the impact of the programme and how it should be financed is therefore extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The benefits derived by the public from this programme are indisputable. The most significant come under the heading of public health, yet it should not be forgotten that tourism has also been boosted and job opportunities created. It is estimated that 125 000 jobs have been created in the 15 old Member States alone. For a number of years, however, it has been apparent that developments in the Natura 2000 network in Europe have not been backed up by appropriate funding for the creation and maintenance of this network.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, the European Commission has announced that it will adopt a strategic approach to financing the programme. What worries me, however, is that the proposal to cofinance the Natura 2000 network from various sources, for example the Rural Development Fund, the Structural Funds and LIFE+, the financial instrument for the environment, will make it impossible for the network to be implemented in a comprehensive, coherent and timely fashion. The fact that potential beneficiaries will need to apply for money from various funds will undoubtedly make it harder to obtain funding for specific protection measures. It will also become more difficult to monitor the implementation of the network at national level. According to the criteria currently used, certain areas do not qualify for funding under the various structural instruments. The latter have a number of different aims, which frequently relate to various types of land use, and sometimes even to specific regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Separate funding is therefore needed to ensure that the Natura 2000 network can be established. If this money is not safeguarded, there may be gaps in the network’s funding during the next Financial Perspective, which covers the period from 2007 to 2013, and this could mean that a large number of protective measures are not implemented. As an example, in my country, Poland, most of the land that is covered by the Natura 2000 programme does not qualify for the above-mentioned funds, either because the land is part of the national forests, or because it is not used for agriculture. It is for this reason that I hope that appropriate funding will be earmarked to support the establishment of the Natura 2000 network during work on the next Financial Perspective. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say this because I have never seen an initiative like Natura 2000 which has been backed by all MEPs and political groups and yet generated so much confusion, and in many cases, conflicting positions. Why is this? Because the document itself is poor.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a document born of good intentions, but technically speaking it is incomplete and muddled. Firstly, because it fails to distinguish between the different categories covered by Natura 2000: for example, between forests and agricultural land – the vast majority – where the land is farmed or a protected natural environment, as opposed to rivers, the sea and the sea bed. It would be folly to envisage applying rural development to the sea bed. How would it be funded? The same problem arises in the case of rivers and wetlands.</p>
<p class="contents">The different categories are not clearly defined, nor is the subject of funding dealt with clearly. For example, we see that the Structural Funds rules would need to be changed in order to finance Natura 2000, but the Structural Funds are based on statistics rather than qualitative terms, as is the case with Natura 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, when funding rural development, there should be an initial awareness-raising campaign because, in reality, environmental concerns and agriculture are relatively incompatible, and because the policy underlying Natura 2000 caused many landowners to lose land or have their activities curtailed. In addition, there has been no work to assess the extent to which rural development contains environmental elements that could be used to get farmers enthused about future landscape conservation and environmental projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as a result, this document has not been returned to the Committee, despite the importance of the subject to this Parliament and the good faith currently being demonstrated by its actions. In my view, both Parliament and biodiversity deserve a better document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Socialist Group is therefore supporting the compromise solution agreed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It is an agreement which still allows for cofinancing or the creation of a separate fund whilst also leaving an extremely attractive option open within the new LIFE+ programme for all those activities that cannot be classified under rural development in their own right.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, I would like to make an appeal for tomorrow's vote. My Group does not understand the last-minute amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group. We do not understand because we do not feel it is worth creating division at the eleventh hour and throwing away the huge efforts made on all sides within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We need to ratify the position.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are also very pleased that the text to be voted on tomorrow includes a reference to the principle of proportionality when allocating funding, whereby, given that the network benefits the Union as a whole, countries such as my own, which have much greater biological diversity and more extensive protected areas, will not be required to shoulder greater costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to remind the Commission of this principle, although it is already enshrined in the Habitat Directive. The Natura 2000 network is one of the best moves made since the Union's inception. For this very reason we must continue to support the programme at Community level, working closely with the Member States. We are not opposed to cofinancing, but we are extremely concerned about the future of the network, particularly as many parts of the network are still unprotected at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the House to endorse the work done made by the Environment Committee, and in particular paragraph 5. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Natura 2000 is a compulsory policy within the framework of preservation of biodiversity, and we are obliged to implement it. The European Commission proposes to finance Natura 2000 by integrating it in the ERDF fund and in the rural development fund. In my opinion, this constitutes a twofold error, because, even if the concept of transversality is a good one, in practice it is completely unrealistic. The European Union's priority is, quite rightly, growth and employment, and one could wonder what the weighting of matters relating to biodiversity will be in comparison with economic development projects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore unrealistic to integrate this financing into the Structural Funds or the rural development fund. How can we guarantee that Natura 2000 will get the funds it needs? The members of the Committee on Agriculture, and those of the Committee on Regional Development, consider that there is a risk that this will also have a detrimental effect on the financing guarantees for those funds. We have thus all reached the same position: we consider that, under those conditions, Natura 2000 will not be financed correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, some Natura 2000 areas are neither agricultural nor forested, and are not covered by either the Structural Funds or the rural development fund. In this case, these classified areas will not get any Community funding. How will we explain to the owners of this land, on which Natura 2000 classification has been imposed, that they will not benefit from the financial instruments?</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, only the creation of a specific fund will make it possible to guarantee that all land classified under Natura 2000 can obtain Community co-financing. We call for this fund to be implemented as part of the new LIFE + instrument, because we cannot talk constantly about biodiversity within the framework of sustainable development and at the same time dangerously compromise those few financial instruments that make it possible to act to promote biodiversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are concerned about the funding for Natura 2000. We agree with the strategic approach, but we also want to ensure adequate funding for Natura 2000, and we fear that if environmental projects have to compete for funding against other projects of greater socio-economic interest, they may well come off badly, especially when – as you yourself have said – the budget available is limited.</p>
<p class="contents">We are definitely in favour of paragraph 5, because this opens the way for providing appropriate funding for Natura 2000 using a specific instrument within LIFE+, or of course, by increasing the Structural Funds and rural development funding to include a separate section for Natura 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask the Commission to take this report into consideration since it covers all the factors which provide stability and genuinely guarantee appropriate levels of funding for Natura 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does a great deal to protect nature and the environment, and is also highly regarded by the public. The land we value so highly was developed and cultivated and is now maintained by European farmers, forestry workers and landowners, and safeguarding this land is also a key goal of Natura 2000. Appropriate funding must be guaranteed if we are to achieve these ambitious goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Natura 2000 has been in existence for a number of years, and even though landowners have had to tolerate certain restrictions for a great many years, this is the first time that thought has been given to appropriate financing at European level. The Commission is proposing that the Natura 2000 network be cofinanced under the Rural Development Fund and the Structural Funds. As rapporteur for rural development, I must stress the need for a guarantee that Natura 2000 really will be financed under both funds, which will mean that we will need a larger budget for rural development. The property rights of our farmers and landowners must not be encroached upon without a guarantee of full financial compensation. Unless we safeguard funding in the long term, levels of uncertainty will continue to rise.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as a result of the decisions taken at Brussels, which included a cap on the agriculture budget until 2013, and following CAP reform, which moved funding for modulation from the first to the second pillar – or in other words to cofinancing for rural development – the priority must be to ensure that landowners and farmers in particular get compensation for their efforts. We farmers have declared our support for sustainable agriculture. More Europe cannot be achieved with less money, especially not now there are 25 Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you have already heard, we have no problem as such with the integrated approach, as long as the Commission provides firm guarantees or guidelines, which are currently lacking, and, if I have understood the Commissioner correctly, will be lacking for some time. Funding, though, is a very important matter; this House has done its level best and has made every effort to convince the Commission that playing Pontius Pilate is all too easy an option.</p>
<p class="contents">Putting things into practice is a different matter altogether, though. When we return home on Friday and a local government, farmer, environmental association or, indeed, our neighbour asks what we have agreed on, what it means to them in concrete terms and how things should progress from here on, we will be unable to give a reply. Yet, it is important to create a solid social support base to set up the Natura 2000 network. Since the procedure for the implementation of the Bird and Habitat Directives was carried out without input from the public, we are still – in my country at least – waiting for its publication, because it is a very sensitive issue politically speaking.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to give Natura 2000 a fighting chance and not again give people the impression that the matter is being decided from the top down, it is important to inform them as soon, and as accurately, as possible about the implications of this decision. To the public, it really makes no difference whether the funds are sourced from a special fund, a structural fund or a rural development fund. What they do want to know is whether, and by whom, they will be compensated if certain things are no longer allowed or if their land has been reduced in value. Questions such as ‘Am I allowed to build a house?’ and, in the case of agricultural land, ‘what about the fertiliser issue?’ will most certainly surface. It therefore follows that the Commission must communicate in plain terms as quickly as possible. There is too much uncertainty, which certainly does not benefit the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is obvious that the need for adequate funding for the Natura 2000 programme is something that the Commission accepts. It is also obvious that, as the rapporteur said, Natura 2000 falls within the scope of European Union cofinancing.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have to see how to guarantee this funding. On behalf of the Commission, I can assure you that financing Natura 2000 from existing funds will be made even more effective. That will be possible because the priority of financing Natura 2000 will be included in the strategic guidelines relating to the various funds designed to finance the initiatives which are soon to be presented by the Commission and which will help the Member States in presenting their programmes. We believe that, by placing this priority right among the strategic guidelines, we shall be able to adequately guarantee its financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to see how the Commission can contribute to the appropriate use of the available funds. I can tell you that by the end of this year the Commission will publish a guidance manual designed to explain the funding procedures for Natura 2000, while in 2006 workshops will be organised in every Member State to explain the funding opportunities. The Commission is committed to launching these initiatives, which are intended to encourage the submission of programmes that can be effective and will thus meet the requirements for obtaining finance.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers underlined the possibility of using the Life+ programme. That programme does not exclude the funding of specific initiatives included within the Natura 2000 network. In that respect I can mention just a few examples. There are certain actions that the Commission considers can be financed through Life+, for instance initiatives in the field of communication, support for setting up local partnerships for the specific promotion of areas and sites that are part of the Natura 2000 network, the development of initiatives relating to the marine environment, which is an extremely important aspect, and innovative schemes for protecting animal or plant species. These are just a few examples that show how, in the Commission’s view, even Life+ can be used to finance Natura 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would recall the possibility of financially supporting marine sites. You are aware that the Commission’s proposal on the European Fisheries Fund does not specifically mention the Natura 2000 sites. The Commission understands, however, that this proposal allows for the possibility of supporting activities designed to develop the marine environment. In that spirit, therefore, the possibility of financing activities that promote the marine environment will be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the points I have mentioned provide at least some further reassurance that the Commission certainly does not intend to call the priority of Natura 2000 funding into question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have simply heard someone reel off the options that exist within the existing sources of funding – something with which we were already very familiar. That was already established at the outset. What we drew attention to is the fact that if no commitments are introduced, matters will not work. All our previous experience shows that such opportunities are not utilised. It is rather disappointing that the Commission stands here giving us a lecture on the options that currently exist instead of answering the questions put in the course of the debate. I am well aware that Mr Frattini is not in a position to do that, but to send a Commissioner who is not responsible for this area and who can therefore only make general comments is not the right way to treat Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
