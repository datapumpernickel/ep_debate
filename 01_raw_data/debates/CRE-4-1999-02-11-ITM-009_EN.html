<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Aelvoet </span> <span class="bold">(V), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, about two years ago the Council consulted the European Parliament about the procedure for implementing Article 366a of the Fourth ACP‐EC Convention, which deals with how the European Union reacts to serious human rights abuses or the total failure of democratisation processes and so on, as a result of which the Union may suspend cooperation with the country concerned. The whole issue has been dragging on for two years now because of a fundamental disagreement between Parliament and the Council about the role that Parliament should be allowed to play in this process. Originally it was the view of the vast majority, in fact nearly all Members of this House, that we wanted the assent procedure to be applied, but this was rejected out of hand. We then decided to go for the consultation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, I had informal contacts – not really enough to merit the term negotiations – with the UK Presidency on behalf of the Council, but these proved fruitless. The issue was raised again during the Austrian Presidency, which then ensured that the Council was formally consulted to see whether it would agree to the consultation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The result was that only two of the fifteen Member States were prepared to agree to Parliament"s request. So once again we came back empty‐handed. Since then the Council has made a small change to the text of the proposal, which had originally called for a qualified majority for any decision to be taken in this context. The qualified majority still stands, but unanimity is now required in the case of full suspension of the application of the Convention. It is important to note that up to now this has never actually happened, even in very difficult situations such as with Nigeria a few years ago. It was always the case that a number of articles were suspended, but never the entire Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation today is as follows. If Parliament decides to refuse to give its assent, then in any event as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force – and that is not so far off now – all that is required under the provisions of the Treaty is that we should be informed. That is the only right we have in this context. So there is little point in obstinately refusing to give our assent here in Parliament, given that this will only result in the unanimity rule applying for the remaining months if cooperation is to be suspended. This is certainly not likely to promote rapid and appropriate action by the Union in cases of serious human rights violations. So because we would much prefer rapid action to be taken where possible by a qualified majority, I did not think I would be justified in calling for us to stick to our guns and refuse to give assent to the Council"s draft decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Against my will, therefore, but in consideration of the practical consequences, I therefore recommend that we accept the decision as it stands, knowing that we have one small consolation, which is that whenever such a measure is to be taken, the Commission will inform Parliament at the same time as the Council, so that Parliament can react in good time. I have to say that it is thanks to our particularly close cooperation with the Commission on this document that we are able to relinquish the genuine consultation that we should have had with rather less distress than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

It lays down the procedure for suspending cooperation with countries in violation of the essential provisions of Article 5.</p>
<p class="contents">This was one of the principal innovations of the Fourth Lomé Convention, and it makes cooperation dependent on respect for human rights, democracy and the principles of good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to thank Mrs Aelvoet on behalf of the Socialist Group. Under her wise guidance as rapporteur the European Parliament tried to democratise the procedures the Commission proposed, by making Parliament"s opinion compulsory through the assent procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Council"s intransigence, plus the objective legal restrictions of the Lomé Convention, made it necessary to move towards a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur says, all things considered, the result is better than nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision in the Council is no longer required to be unanimous but is to be by a qualified majority, and the Commission undertakes to inform Parliament in good time of any major change in the implementation of the suspension procedure. Parliament will obviously be extremely vigilant and insistent about this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, effectively, better than nothing, so our group will vote in favour of the draft decision, as recommended by the rapporteur.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Corrie </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Madam President, as always Mrs Aelvoet has produced an excellent report on a very delicate subject. However, it is a sad indictment of the world we live in that Article 366a has to be written into the fourth ACP‐EU Convention at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Having just returned from Africa yesterday and hearing of the latest events in Zimbabwe, it is vital the Commission has the power of suspension and is able to act quickly. Of course it would be good practice if Parliament – and by that I assume the Committee on Development and Cooperation – could be consulted before suspension took place. But I have to be honest and say that we live in the real world. There will be occasions when the Commission has to act quickly to convey the message to any nation abusing human rights before it has the opportunity to ask Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to the report is the sentence that the Commission, wherever possible, will inform Parliament in advance of any suspension or indeed resumption of cooperation. I believe that is a fair compromise between the Commission and Parliament and therefore support the proposal that Parliament give its assent to the draft Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is an interesting situation which will arise after the year 2000, under the new Lomé Agreement, whatever that may be. As the Commission will know, the proposals for any new ACP‐EU agreement could be based on regional cooperation and integration, with funding being distributed via the regional organisations rather than through individual nations and national indicative programmes. I wonder how Article 366a can operate in such circumstances, as the Commission will have lost the ability to sanction an individual nation within a region. It would be unfair to sanction the entire region. Perhaps Commissioner Brittan could pass on that particular question to the appropriate Commission service for an answer at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">As there are a number of difficult situations building up in various African states I hope the Commission will use Article 366a in its widest form. Human rights, to me, should include pluralism, good governance, an independent judiciary, a free press, as well as free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will be supporting this report. Once again, I congratulate Mrs Aelvoet on the work she has done on behalf of this Parliament.</p>

Procedures must be clear. Article 5 of the Lomé Convention makes human rights policy an essential element of cooperation, and Article 366a which we are discussing now deals with the procedures surrounding the suspension of cooperation with the Lomé countries. The fact that such an operational article exists is an advantage, but the procedures themselves should have been better. The rapporteur has done her best to ensure that Parliament has a say and that majority decisions apply in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberals have always taken the view that Parliament"s assent should be needed for Lomé cooperation to be suspended. After all, Parliament"s assent was needed for the Lomé Convention to come into force. The fact that we are now simply to be informed by the Commission if cooperation is to be suspended is not enough, but as a pragmatist, I realise that we could not have obtained more. After all the interinstitutional discussions since the Commission proposal of February 1996, the procedure finally needs to be wound up, and we must put this new instrument to good use in our human rights policy as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Aelvoet for this recommendation, but she does not need to be told that.</p>

I would like to reiterate what we stressed when the interim report was discussed here last June, namely, that we intend to keep Parliament fully informed of any initiative which we might take or any proposal which we might submit to the Council with regard to the implementation of Article 366a of the Fourth Lomé Convention which sadly, as has been said, is not something that can be regarded as a purely theoretical possibility. I would add that in the only case so far in which Article 366a was invoked, against Togo, the Commission immediately informed Parliament of its intentions, as the rapporteur has acknowledged in her report, for which I thank her.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue, as ever, to take very seriously any opinions or resolutions adopted by Parliament which might affect implementation of the consultation and suspension procedure laid down in Article 366a.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Corrie's query about how it would work in a situation where the regional element is to the fore, I will certainly convey that query to those who are handling this matter on a day‐to‐day basis. The Commission is pleased that with Parliament's assent the framework decision will take effect, giving us a proper and transparent procedure for taking appropriate measures if essential provisions of the revised Fourth Lomé Convention are violated.</p>
