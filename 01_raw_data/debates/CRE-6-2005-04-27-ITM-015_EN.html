<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Avril Doyle (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Deputising for the author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, with your permission I will also be representing Mr Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. He should have been leading on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but cannot join us this evening so he has ceded his time to me in addition to my own time, so thank you for your patience on that.</p>
<p class="contents">The oral question before us was tabled by my colleague Mr Florenz and we also have a motion for resolution further to that oral question on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the EU strategy for the Punta del Este Conference on Persistent Organic Pollutants. For the record, next week the first Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention on POPs or Persistent Organic Pollutants, takes place in Punta del Este in Uruguay. POPs are organic chemicals that break down very slowly in the environment and accumulate in our bodies; indeed they are in the tissues of every human being on the planet. They are spread through the air and through the food chain very far from their sources, even to regions where they have never been used or produced.</p>
<p class="contents">They include insecticides such as DDT – perhaps the best-known POP – industrial chemicals such as PCBs and indeed the unintentional by-products of industrial processes such as dioxins and furans. Once POPs are released into the environment it is almost impossible to predict where they will end up, so we have to apply the precautionary principle, but most importantly take steps to restrict their use and their placing on the market generally.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, however, that the needs of developing countries are taken into account and that our response is proportionate and that we allow controlled exemptions. I am thinking primarily of the use of DDT against malaria because, despite the best efforts of scientists and their redoubled efforts to find an effective vaccine, this is still many years away. So our approach must be proportionate, particularly when we realise that every minute two children in Africa die of malaria. Every day over 3 000 children in Africa die of malaria. The mosquito responsible for transmitting malaria has proved extremely resilient to the various methods of dealing with it down the years. To date the only effective method of killing the mosquito is by the use of DDT. Although it is a very toxic substance, the benefit still outweighs the risk when your child is less likely to die of persistent organic pollution poisoning than of malaria. So if we can save a child’s life, until we have some other way of doing it and killing the mosquito in question, we will have to allow controlled use. However, we must double our efforts to find an alternative to DDT because huge damage is being done to humans – it is biocumulative – and to our environment by our need to look after the children who are here today. We have nothing else to replace DDT to eliminate malaria and the mosquito involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to put a few specific questions to the Commissioner. Commissioner, you will probably be familiar with the resolution that is before you. I should like to draw your attention to paragraph 9, which says that Parliament ‘believes that the Members of the European Parliament who are part of the EC delegation have an essential contribution to make and expects, therefore, that they will have access to EU coordination meetings in Punta del Este on the basis at least of observer status’. The motion goes on to say ‘with or without speaking rights’. I should be quite happy with observer status without speaking rights. Commissioner, I say this regardless of precedent or quoting interinstitutional agreements, because I would like to say yet again on the record that, just a few weeks after you were appointed, Commissioner, at the conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires in relation to climate change, COP 10, you made great strides in including the Members of the European Parliament, both before and after various meetings, in terms of full briefings. You even went so far as to ask us for our opinion on different issues. That was very much appreciated by all of us across the Groups in this House. I know you cannot join us in Punta del Este, but I would ask that you make it very clear to those honourable people who will be representing you there that you would like the precedent you created last December to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is one step less than we would like, because we want observer status and we request that. There is little point in sending Members of Parliament half way across the globe, to be part of a Commission/Council/Parliament delegation, a Community delegation, if one third are kept outside the door albeit with briefings when the business is done. Let us take it one step at a time, let us at least have observer status at the coordination meetings and at the meetings where the real work is done and of course be part of any press conference and press briefing that may wind up the week. It is the first COP – I accept that – and perhaps we will not have as much to report as we would like because we are only developing structures and strategies to deal with this most important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are my points. At this hour of the night there is no point in underlining yet again how important a job the Stockholm Convention has to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like in conclusion to ask you, Commissioner, about the goals and the timetable for the addition of extra organic chemicals to the list of POPs as set out under the Convention, which were discussed last August. The Commission suggested that seven new substances should be added to the list for eventual exclusion. Somehow over the autumn and over Christmas and the New Year, by the time of the Council conclusions on 10 March, the seven had dropped to up to three additional substances. We had gone from a worthy ambition of seven last August to up to three, plus of course Penta BDE, the Norwegian proposal, which might be a fourth one. But up to three could be none, one or two as well as three. I would just like to know where the Commission stands on this. The European Community and the Member States wanted to forward an extensive list to be considered if possible before the first COP next week, but in any case in time for examination by the first meeting of the POPs review committee. Are we going to have it before next week? Why has it not happened? What has happened to the goals and the timetables that were clearly set out? Maybe you could tell us, Commissioner, what has happened between 10 March and today? It is rather disappointing that our ambitions of seven to be added last summer have been reduced to up to three at this stage. To me it sounds as though the urgency and the ambition that were initially there have evaporated. It is almost as if air is being let out of the tyre of enthusiasm in relation to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, if this Convention is to come up to our expectations, it must be applied correctly and must gather momentum by including new substances as time goes by. Numerous important issues will be discussed and decided at the first conference of the parties, which will also lay the foundations for the future development of the Convention. The general objective is to ensure that the decisions taken by the first conference will allow for the effective application and further development of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, if we are to succeed, the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee must first be set up, so that it can start examining new proposals for the addition of other organic pollutants to the list. The Commission has already determined other substances; as Mrs Doyle said, they were confined to three and, as far as I know, this has not changed since. In all events, the debate is continuing on the timetable and <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> for submitting proposals and I believe and hope that the European Union will table good proposals during the first conference of the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and most importantly, greater progress is needed with the gradual abolition of the use and release into the environment of the twelve persistent organic pollutants on the current list, especially DDT, which you quite rightly said is still needed to combat malaria in certain developing countries. However, the first conference must find ways to help limit the reliance on DDT, such as by promoting research into alternative means and providing technical and financial support. Similarly, the first conference must set further measures in motion in a bid to restrict the risks from the use and availability of PCBs, on the one hand, and to reduce and prevent the release into the environment of derivative organic pollutants, especially chlorinated dioxins and furans, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The third basic objective of decisive importance for the first conference is to complete the institutional framework needed so that the Convention can be applied in practice. In particular, substantial progress needs to be made in developing suitable compliance mechanisms and procedures. With regard to point 9 of the resolution, I think that it is the Commission's duty to include Members of the European Parliament in this sort of delegation and may I say that, from my own personal experience, we have cooperated excellently in two instances, once in Buenos Aires and once at the conference on sustainable development in New York last week which was also attended by Members of the European Parliament, where we managed through exchanges not only of views, but also of advice, opinions and, in particular, political judgments on certain issues, to promote the issues to which these conferences were devoted. At the same time, we succeeded, with the three institutions, in projecting a very good and united image of the European Union to the outside world, mainly by using press conferences at which we appeared together and seemed united and unified in our opinions, thereby improving the image of the European Union. In other words, we had both positive material results and results from the point of view of communications. That is why I consider, therefore, that the participation of Members of the European Parliament is essential; I always think that it is absolutely crucial and I also recommend it to my other colleagues in the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Environmental quality is not a luxury item; as a prerequisite for sustainable development, it should be a political priority. Governments are, to a greater or lesser extent, coming to realise that the world has changed and that policy must change with it. They are all coming to the realisation that attacks on the environment jeopardise the future of this generation and generations to come and do irreversible damage to people’s quality of life. Environmental problems and health concerns must be addressed as a matter of urgency. The ignorance of the past and the negligence of the present have come at a high price – environmental costs, financial costs and costs in terms of human lives. Remedying the current situation is necessary, but taking preventative action is an even more pressing priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The chemical industry currently produces more than 1 000 compounds, some of which are very persistent, that is, highly resistant to environmental degradation. Some of them are biocumulative, which means that they accumulate in the tissue of living organisms; they are also toxic. The most prevalent of these toxic compounds are the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which have been linked to various health problems such as cancer, endometriosis, cognitive disorders and learning difficulties. POPs are also responsible for reproductive disorders and hormonal dysfunctions. Being resistant, POPs are passed down from generation to generation and contaminate the food that we eat, the air that we breathe and the water that we drink. Being biocumulative, POPs accumulate in the environment and in the organisms of living beings. With these characteristics, POPs can travel long distances and can be found in places as far apart as the Antarctic, in penguins, and in the Arctic, in polar bears. There is therefore no point in Brazil stopping mirex production if Argentina does not follow suit; similarly, there is no reason for the EU to ban DDT if China continues to produce it and use it. Accordingly – and I wish to stress this point – efforts must be coordinated worldwide. It is also important to note that many of these substances did not exist 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1995, negotiations began to control the use, production and release of POPs. 12 pollutants were identified. The Stockholm Convention, held in 2001, set out a range of targets and measures aimed not only at better management of POPs, but also at eliminating them and at promoting clean technologies. Against the background of the decisions taken by the Stockholm Convention, which, as I said, took place in 2001, and of the aims and agenda of the first Conference of the Parties to that Convention taking place in Uruguay on 2 to 6 May, we should like to ask the Commission what its objectives are for that conference. I should also like to ask what it hopes to accomplish and how much progress it feels can be made. Furthermore, given that everything has its cost, I should also like to know, Commissioner, what financial resources will be available to help those countries that most need to ban POPs.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not be going to Punta del Este to take part in the conference, but I should like to say that I share the concerns expressed by Mrs Doyle and that I agree with everything she said as regards Parliament’s delegation, which should be there on the basis of observer status. It does not make sense if elected Members of the European Parliament are not able to take part in all initiatives, all conferences and all meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On POPs, the Commission’s proposal was ambitious, but so far the Council has not agreed to it. We wanted a Council decision under Article 300 of the Treaty, i.e. by qualified majority. The poorer result of the Council conclusions of 10 March is due to the fact that these were adopted differently, through unanimity. The Commission regrets this approach. However, the process will be a long one. There are political, economic and social considerations to be taken into account, but we shall pursue our line of argument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
