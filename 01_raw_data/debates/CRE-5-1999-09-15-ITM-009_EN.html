As is often the case in the European institutions, the Italian version of the speech has got lost in the hyperspace between Brussels and Strasbourg. I was waiting for it because I have here the speech in a foreign language which I was using to make notes. I have been here since 9 a.m. but I realise that I will have to make this address in Italian, but by translating from the foreign language. So please excuse me if occasionally the translation is not perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now at the decisive moment of what has been, in my opinion, a good exercise in democracy. I have been given many occasions to stand before you recently and present both my policy ideas and the key guiding issues of our future relations. You have questioned the Commissioners in writing and orally. We are pledged to transparency, efficiency and to accounting in an absolute and clear way for all our actions.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles of transparency, accountability and efficiency are echoed in the resolution you have just adopted. The centrepiece of your resolution is the commitments I gave to the Conference of Presidents last week. I am pleased to repeat my full commitment to these five points this morning on this formal occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">They represent the basis of a new start in relations between our two institutions, a new culture of openness and above all, mutual co-operation. A key element in those points concerns the question of the individual accountability of Commissioners. I have already repeated, clearly and honestly, my position on this matter. I believe that the recent observations we have made together will enable me to deal effectively with any problems which may arise. Let me be clear: our firm commitment to the principle of collegiality – which is the cornerstone of the Commission’s role – will not become a shield for the individual accountability which all of us have to assume as politicians, before this House and before the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these principles are essential for a strong Commission. Even if a strong Commission will sometimes disagree with you – we will often say no – I think that it is better for all of us to have a strong partner rather than a weak one.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the content of your Resolution. I am in full agreement that organising relations between us can only be one element of European construction. We have to engage the citizen, and this is a fundamental challenge for all the institutions. And one of my first major tasks is to present, in January, my policy guidelines for the five years of the Commission’s mandate. Together we must give a high political profile to the consultation in January.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat what I said in this House yesterday, that I have made a meaningful commitment to sustainable development, to responding to environmental concerns and I believe that the issue of quickly restoring consumer confidence in the safety of the food we eat and safeguarding our health is our first priority.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I recognise the fundamental importance of the preparation behind the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to the European Parliament. I reiterate the commitments I have made to you, for a strong and decisive Conference. I also want to be sure that there are no misunderstandings on the nature of the report I have commissioned from Mr De Haene, Mr von Weiszäcker and Lord Simon. This is not a Commission report and you will receive it at the same time as I do. In the light of the report we will receive, I understand the need to organise a discussion which will start in Parliament and move on to the Commission on the preparation of an effective Intergovernmental Conference for the Helsinki Summit. In view of this, the dialogue that has started between us is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">You have asked for an Interinstitutional Agreement as a framework for the Code of Conduct to govern our relations. I totally agree. We should now sit down and see how we can put our principles into practice. I also accept the commitments you have requested regarding the five points referred to in the preamble to your resolution. They have of course to be worked out in detail in the future Code of Conduct. I would, however, remind you that as President of the Commission, I will exercise my responsibilities to the full. There are two points regarding your resolution which must be changed in some way. Firstly, you are asking for a Member of the Commission to be suspended from office where a serious charge is brought against him or her. I do not have the power to implement this. I have already said that should such charges be formally laid against a Member of the Commission, I would have to examine the implications of this very seriously. And I can imagine circumstances in which a Member of the Commission would want to take leave from office while awaiting judgement. I can even imagine circumstances in which resignation could be an issue. But this would have to be a matter of political judgement for the Member of the Commission concerned, and, ultimately, for me as President. But the rule of law has to prevail and we must respect the presumption of innocence. The fundamental freedoms apply to us all, but I assure you I would take firm action. Let me add a further comment on this. As far as the crucial element of accountability and responsibility is concerned, I will never accept that any Member of the Commission knowingly misleads, or lies to, Parliament. Our relations have to be founded on mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you want to give your views on the Codes of Conduct for Commissioners and for high level appointments before they are implemented by the new Commission. As President, I have to say that I need these rules in place on day one of the new Commission. I do not want any ambiguity on the immediate commitment to the reform process that these codes signal inside the Commission. This does not mean, however, that they are set in stone. You have received these codes and I will listen attentively to your observations. These codes are not unchangeable.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of the points you wish to see included in the new Framework Agreement relate to transparency. I have told you that the new Commission will be open to your suggestions. It is committed to attendance at Committee or plenary part-sessions to deal with all important policy issues. It has also made strong commitments, within its sphere of competence, to see how we can improve the involvement of Parliament in all policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise the importance you attach in particular to international agreements. You will nevertheless agree that our commitment to consultation has to be worked out in a way which will be consistent with the efficient conduct of negotiations. I can assure you that I will undertake to see this is done.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mention foreign and security policy and the Third Pillar. The Commission will work with you to see how we can best ensure that information reaches you quickly. I am ready to announce important Commission decisions directly to a plenary sitting when necessary and when you think it appropriate. We have to see how practical it is, for you as well as us, to organise this information on a weekly basis when Parliament is not in session.</p>
<p class="contents">The availability of documents is important to you. This is partly a question of transmission. It is also a question, as you say, of establishing firm rules where access may need to be restricted. I agree that we should make special arrangements for the transmission of sensitive documents regarding fraud to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I have to issue one caveat in relation to internal documents on fraud. Great care has been taken to establish an independent OLAF. I cannot therefore speak for their documents. I believe there will certainly be a need for transparency but we will have to ask OLAF, if not I would contradict the view I have of this body.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, however, confirm that it is essential, particularly in public administrations, that members of staff have a duty to report alleged fraud, impropriety or irregularity. It is equally essential that they can fulfil that duty through a coherent system which firmly guarantees their rights and the rights of those against whom accusations may be made.</p>
<p class="contents">The new, independent OLAF is duty-bound to resolve each case. I also agree that the duties of officials in this regard and their protection should be enshrined in proper regulations. Mr Kinnock has already given you a commitment in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very encouraged by the experience of working with you and the setting-up of the new Commission. I feel that we are working steadily towards a good political atmosphere of mutual understanding and to setting the foundations for a strong relationship. With good will on both sides, we will work together well and constructively.</p>
<p class="contents">I have prepared this reply in an attempt to really get into the operating contents that you asked for. I know that today’s vote does not concern only these aspects of our work together, but also what we must do together for Europe. We have made commitments, and I can assure you that they go right to the heart of three important areas that concern both Parliament and the Commission. We have pledged to give Europe a new institutional order and prepare us for this Intergovernmental Conference which is of fundamental importance for our future. It is fundamentally important because we have been preparing for a second goal, a goal which in some way really will change our policies: the goal of enlargement. This means we will increase from 362 million citizens to almost half a billion by the time the process has finished. Enlargement will encompass countries with history, customs and income that are completely different. This choice has been made to guarantee the Pillars of Europe – peace and freedom. We cannot guarantee these Pillars unless enlargement occurs in a strong, open and constructive way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have made commitments on a third goal – to support the new economic upturn and put it to the service of the European citizens. This also means using it to boost employment, to improve social justice, to reform but also preserve the great cornerstones of the welfare system that Europe invented and which has suffered many reform problems over recent years but which must not be abandoned, leaving citizens unprotected. These are the three important tasks we have taken on together.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that this vote will allow us to make progress in what – rhetoric aside – truly is a great historic task. It will be an overhaul of the institutions that the world has never before seen. Nevertheless, when we have to tackle together those tasks which are groundbreaking and mark a break with the past, we must proceed as the united Parliament and Executive which all modern democracies need. The future of this, our Europe, is grounded in our brilliant dialectic but also in our spirit of co-operation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The previous President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, made a remarkable and impressive contribution to this debate. I would like to begin this short statement by giving a heart-felt word of thanks, respect and acknowledgement to our colleague and friend, Jacques Santer, for his wonderful contribution to Europe as Prime Minister of Luxembourg and as President of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In this debate among our group, questions were also put and doubts expressed, both of which remain. This fact cannot be concealed and because of this we also have respect for the stance adopted by those who vote differently to the majority of our group. The overwhelming majority of our group will say “yes” to the Commission of Romano Prodi. But this is neither a blank cheque nor carte blanche. We will take you at your word, Mr Prodi, in other words, we will follow very closely whether, following your confirmation of appointment before the European Parliament, you fulfil the obligations you entered into prior to that confirmation.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect you to discuss your programme up to the year 2005 with Parliament and that it will be a politically balanced programme. You have committed yourself in this regard and, above all, you have once again committed yourself to the five points. I would like to express my sincere thanks to my colleagues across all the groups, Mr Hänsch, Mr Costa, Mrs Hautala, Messrs Collins and Bonde, for the fact that we succeeded, after yesterday’s two-hour debate between our group’s chairmen, in today passing a resolution with such a large majority. It is our duty, as the European Parliament, to speak with one voice when talking about the key questions surrounding the future of Europe. The resolution would have been approved with an even greater majority if the translation had been available in a certain language for one of the groups. Because it was not, this group did not give its assent. You can see that the problems faced by Parliament are similar to those of the Commission, but that also gives a human side to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me one final observation. In recent weeks, we have made great strides in co-operation. It is now our task to continue along this path towards democracy and parliamentarianism and, above all, to satisfy the hopes of the countries in central Europe of being able to join our community of law, peace and freedom. In this sense, we say “yes” to the Commission-designate.</p>

<p class="contents">As well as the five points, there is also that commitment, which seems important to us, to embark on a new stage in the construction of Europe which, I believe, we should reaffirm today. That is to say, to end this period of crisis and stagnation and go forward with confidence and a vision of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The President has restated today a commitment which seems to us decisive, which is to carefully prepare, announce and debate his programme of political action for the whole of the legislature. He has also announced the programme of reform of the Commission and, therefore, we believe that, if we jointly embark on this new stage, we will be able to build together, like bricklayers and architects, the Europe of the future.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, Mr President, that you have a special interest in the development of information technologies in Europe, which I believe to be an absolute priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which the President has mentioned, and which seems to me important to specify, is our approach towards the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has very much appreciated the fact that three experts have been given the task of clearing the way, but I believe that it would be very positive if the Commission were to make use of that capacity for initiative which is conferred on it by the Treaties – and Parliament – and if we could agree on how to go forward together on all fronts, with a view to the new millennium and above all, and firstly, for the sake of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We require a new contract with the peoples who form the European Union to resolve questions such as employment, prosperity, the defence and adaptation of our social model, the preservation of our environment and consumer protection, in order to achieve a foreign and security policy which will allow us to integrate those countries which wish to form part of our common adventure, which will allow us to stabilise our continent, in the East, and also in the South, in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">We require a contract which will allow us, above all, to pursue something about which I am in absolute agreement with President Prodi: this fascinating historic adventure which the Europeans have embarked upon, which is changing the face of our continent and which, let us hope, will decisively help to change the future of the history of humanity.</p>

<p class="contents">From the outset of the recent period of crisis the ELDR Group has played a central role, leading from the front and insisting on greater parliamentary accountability on the part of the Commission as executive. All the trauma we have gone through will have been worthwhile if the correct lessons are learned and applied. We believe that the Commission, now to be voted, wishes to be more open, transparent, rigorous, reformist and accountable than any of its predecessors. We believe that the message is understood that such parliamentary accountability is both collegial and individual in nature. We believe the past nine months in and through the European Parliament represent a milestone in the democratisation of the politics of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we vote in two parts: a political resolution and on the Commission. The political resolution supported by more than 500 deputies foresees a new accord between Parliament and the Commission for the new millenium. We have promoted and support this idea. We have insisted on emphasising greater transparency, greater access to documentation and the necessity for individual responsibility and accountability of Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">We are conscious of the delicate sensitivities and prerogatives surrounding these questions, but our bottom line is clear. In demanding these reforms we believe that they strengthen both our institutions in our common European vocation. The message should go loud and clear from this House today to the capital cities of the Union in particular, that the rules of engagement have changed utterly. Never again can the diktat or presumption of capitals with regard to preserving individual Commissioners be allowed to bring an entire Commission to its knees.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Collegiality cannot be a shield to cover all behaviour, including unacceptable behaviour. Reinvigorated by the crisis we have passed through I believe there is a new energy and that there shall be a new synergy between our institutions to put the Union to work. My group – the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Group – should vote unanimously for the Commission and its President. We are pledged to making a fresh start for Europe. Let the work begin.</p>

<p class="contents">We voted unanimously on the joint resolution which has just been adopted by this Parliament. Our concerns were met, and I was pleased with Mr Prodi’s speech and his commitment regarding the content of this resolution. I therefore believe that I can say, on behalf of my group, that we are satisfied on this aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, although the way the institutions are run is one of the most important issues at stake, the political future of the European Union and its role in the world is just as important. The European Commission is the driving force of the Union and in this capacity has the power to steer the general policy of the European Union. We cannot be content with a vision of the Commission as a clerk’s office, making it a mere executor of orders from elsewhere. We must establish the vision of an ambitious European Union. Our group defends the idea that the Union must offer added value to the quality of life of our fellow citizens and that is why I welcome Mr Prodi’s proposals on food safety, even if these proposals do not seem sufficient to me. Indeed, quality of life also covers, in my view, security of employment, working conditions, public liberties and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, at the present time, the majority of citizens do not actually receive this added value. Furthermore, the Union must implement fundamental action on a world-wide scale to ensure that the differences in living standards between North and South stop increasing and that globalisation is not synonymous, as unfortunately it is today, with ecological and social damage throughout the world, including within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Appealing for growth and greater liberalisation with a hint of sustainable development is not an adequate response. But it is, unfortunately, the one which emerged, Mr Prodi, from your speech yesterday. Within our group we were unanimous in deploring it. It would, admittedly, have been ridiculous to expect that the incoming team would have a political plan which reflected our own, but we did think we were entitled to expect some indication of an ambitious vision of the role of Europe. Unfortunately this was not the case. In spite of your speech today, we are all disappointed by your pronouncements and by your vision.</p>
<p class="contents">This observation which is positive towards all matters of institutional reform and negative regarding the political plan is not shared unanimously within our group. We have, therefore, in all transparency according to the current trend, allowed everyone a free vote. We shall vote according to our own consciences. Some are betting that, thanks to some of its members and thanks to the changes in the attitude of the Commission to Parliament, the incoming team is capable of instigating significant political reorientation. Others think, on the other hand, that a vote in favour would be tantamount to giving a political sign that would be contrary to public opinion since it would give prior sanction to the lack of clear plans.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the message which I have been entrusted to give you, Mr President of the Commission. I hope that you will accept it as constructive criticism, and that our unanimous desire for dialogue will not be in question.</p>

<p class="contents">While highlighting the interesting “shift” in the relationship between this institution and Parliament, as well as our desire to work towards the success of the administrative reform announced, I expressed the conviction that in order to respond to the urgent expectations of our fellow citizens it would have been necessary to take the initiative on significant changes affecting not only the operation of the Commission but also on its political orientations. Unfortunately, I have heard nothing of this ilk in the various hearings of the Commissioners-designate or in the speeches of Mr Prodi himself.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the Commission is just emerging from the most serious crisis in its history and the European Union as a whole has food for thought, given the unprecedented alarm signal which millions of voters, male and female, have just given it, the time seemed ripe for strong action likely to open up new perspectives, action likely to regenerate hope. Experience has shown that the European Union cannot be built simply by the market and by directives. It is forged above all by means of living relationships between people who are carrying out projects which motivate and unite them.</p>
<p class="contents">My conviction is that Europe will win back credibility in the eyes of many of the peoples of the world, and their sympathy, by clearly stating, in the face of the advancing tide of neo-liberalism, its own values and plan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this ambition, Madam President, which, in our view, is lacking today. This is the reason why my group cannot affirm its confidence in the Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, Commission President, 1999 has been a difficult year for the mainstream EU institutions in that problems which surfaced over issues such as the accountability about the administration of various EU initiatives had strained relations between the European Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to impress upon the new college of the Commission and all Members of the European Parliament that the events of this year must be put behind us as a matter of urgency. We must all reflect on the difficulties of the last twelve months in particular and learn from the mistakes that were clearly made. We must ensure that decision-making structures are put in place at EU level which will guarantee that all decisions are accounted for.</p>
<p class="contents">In the resolution tabled today by my political group, we stress that there must be sound management in the administration of all EU programmes and initiatives. Because the Commission is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operation of so many EU-sponsored policies, it should take particular note of its Treaty obligations in this regard. The challenges facing the European Union are too great for institutional deadlock to hamper the Commission and the European Parliament in dealing with their legislative programme. The European Union cannot operate effectively unless there is cooperation and understanding between the Commission, Parliament and the Council. I am not interested in promoting European Union decision-making founded on institutional stalemate. I believe that the Commission too must recognise that the expanded remit of the codecision procedure means that Parliament has an equal say in the enactment of EU directives and regulations encompassing 38 different economic and social sectors. The codecision procedure covers a wide range of activities including those in the transport sector, regional affairs, social matters, employment initiatives, structural funding, consumer protection, public health and environmental concerns. If the codecision procedure is not operated in an effective manner, then inefficiency will take root in the internal decision-making procedures of the Union. That is the last thing we need at this challenging time.</p>
<p class="contents">The single greatest challenge facing the European Union is to prepare for the enlargement process with the accession of six new countries to the Union by the year 2004-2005. There are currently 37 different chapters of negotiation to be discussed between the Union and the new applicant countries. These are going to be difficult discussions and internal institutional reform is needed in the EU if the enlargement process is to be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission and Parliament must ensure that tough decisions are worked through in a spirit of understanding and common purpose. I hope that all of us have learned this lesson from the events of the last year. Our Group does have a group position. Each national delegation will vote as it thinks fit. The Irish delegation will vote for President Prodi and the Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a product of the fifteen Prime Ministers, but it has now come into its own, freed from supervision by the Member States, removed from national parliaments, light years from ordinary voters and tax payers, but still not subject to supervision by the EU Parliament. The voters and the national parliaments are forfeiting power to Mr Prodi, but this power is not being picked up here in this House. Voter influence is being limited again. The executive is again being strengthened at the expense of the legislature. Mr Prodi promises he will listen and despatch a Commissioner every time we ask for one. He will seriously consider firing Commissioners if Parliament expresses its lack of confidence in them. But it is Mr Prodi and the Commission itself who decide. It is they who decide whether they have confidence in us, in the electorate and in the national parliaments, and they are still the only twenty people in the EU who can propose a new law or propose that an existing law be removed. In the Commission itself, the directors-general have again taken power. While Mr Prodi promises openness, answers concerning this are emptied of content by the directors-general. A lot of answers at the hearings were prepared by the old officials. In the draft version of Mr Kinnock’s response the officials had even written that the problem was that the Dutch official, Van Buitenen, had given too many documents to the group chairmen. The problem was not that the Commission had covered up the misappropriations. Clearly, there are still officials with things to learn.</p>
<p class="contents">The Experts’ Group is therefore proposing a prosecuting authority and more supranational supervision in the Member States. The Commission and the majority here will have Brussels impose more rules and manage more projects. The result will be more centralism and more fiddling and, in five years’ time, a new Committee of Wise Men will be preparing a new report on increasing fraud within the EU, for it is secretiveness and centralism which give rise to fraud. Supervision can uncover a small amount, but the solution is a radical curtailment of assignments and projects in Brussels so that, instead, the focus is upon those things that extend beyond national frontiers and can no longer be solved on a national or regional basis. We must move in the direction of a slimmed down, open and democratic EU.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, cannot offer the Commission political support but, instead, hard-working, critical and constructive opposition. The democratic dream is that people’s conditions of life should be equal. This must not be confused with treating everyone the same, for we are different in our diversity, and that is our strength.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, we seven Radicals stated yesterday what our position is but neither have we taken part in the previous vote nor will we take part in the forthcoming votes until, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament settles the issues of Members’ dignity, rights and duties.</p>
<p class="contents">With the unprecedented decision you took yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, you decided that there are some Members who belong to the First Division – your Members, the respectable ones, the ones from your bureaucracies, the ones who love divisions and sharing-out power. Then there are those Members who are not respectable, that is me and those of us who are simply independent of your bureaucracies and party politics.</p>
<p class="contents">This is hardly dignified. It is not dignified for the elected Members and, dear Mr Barón Crespo, it is not dignified for the voters. You have decided that there are First Division voters and Second Division voters. We cannot accept this. Today the battle commences. It is such hypocrisy, such conformism, ladies and gentlemen! You Italians live in a country whose Parliament has a mixed group, the second group, where Members from the extreme Right, extreme Left and the Greens all happily co-exist. But when you come here to vote, you vote as you did! </p>
<p class="contents">You Members of national parliaments have no problems in sharing out money from public funds among yourselves. It is such hypocrisy then to prevent us, but from doing what? Prevent us from doing our parliamentary duties. We cannot – because we are inconvenient Members whom you do not like – table resolutions or amendments. Basically, all we are allowed to do now is press a button. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will not obey. We seven Radical Members will not comply with this empty posturing. Look at your groups! A group is a work tool. Look at them, they do not have a political position. Three groups said they did not have a common political position. So, groups are only there to assist the sharing out of funding and staff, my dear colleagues. Parliament must stop being like this!</p>
<p class="contents">Starting today, we are beginning a crusade for dignity, legality, the Rule of Law and the rights and duties of a Member of Parliament elected by the citizens, who voted for us as they voted for you and who have the same rights and duties as you and the same dignity. I hope that very many of you, ladies and gentlemen, will defend the dignity of Parliament and its Members against bureaucracy and party politics.

Many of us believe that we are creating a new relationship with the Commission, and that really does mean that Parliament and the Commission will, in future, work in very close co-operation with one another. Some of us therefore decided to grant the Commission a vote of confidence, as we consider that we have made a remarkable start in this relationship. We also value the broad co-operation among the political groups in the adoption of the resolution calling for the Commission to take seriously the responsibility of individual Members of the Commission. We are most satisfied that Parliament as a whole stresses the importance of public access to documents and information. We have also emphasised that Parliament and Europe’s civil society must in future be more seriously involved in amendment procedures relating to the Treaties and Intergovernmental Conferences. Some of us, however, have said that they do not expect very much in the way of green policies from the new Commission, and our whole group will, in future, also see to it that the Commission gives sufficient weight to the principles of the creation of a social Europe and sustainable development, so that they have a serious part to play in all decision-making. Nevertheless, we are sure that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has listened to Parliament, and we are now embarking on a process of co-operation with the new Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament, for its part, seems happy to play along since the text on which we are voting is entitled “Draft Decision on the Election of the Commission-designate.” Whereas, obviously, there is no election involved either at the level of our House, where in legal terms it is a matter of the approval of the appointment of the Commissioners, or, to an even greater extent, at the level of the voters who, in France at least and no doubt in many other countries, have never even heard of Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would also like to take advantage of this explanation of vote to mention the parallel resolution combining a number of the undertakings made by the Prodi Commission in areas that were often technical, but important, relating to the Code of Conduct, ethics and transparency. We can do no other than to approve most of them, especially concerning the proper distribution of information. I hope that, thanks to this, the Members of Parliament will, for example, be better informed regarding the negotiations of the Millennium Round than they were for the Uruguay Round, although this Europe has to date been obedient to the powerful forces which want free trade to prevail absolutely, but which prefer to act in secret.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this resolution is contaminated by a number of irregular conditions, for example, the one which stipulates that the Prodi Commission undertakes to include on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference, in addition to the three points already determined, an important programme of institutional reforms. Of course, the Commission has no power, until further notice, to itself decide the agenda for the forthcoming IGC. This phrase at least has the merit of showing that the European Parliament and the Commission are going to back each other up in order to increase their respective powers and trample on the decisions of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">But really, in this matter as in that of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the foolishness of the Council prevents us having any compassion for them. In any case, we are voting against the resolution which includes this condition.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These objections relate in particular to the Dutch candidate Mr Bolkestein, for he is the most outspoken proponent of policies for effecting cutbacks, privatisation, deregulation and the lowering of taxation. A few months back, during the election campaign for this Parliament, the people heading the list of candidates of almost all the Dutch parties were quite vocal in saying that Mr Bolkestein should not be permitted to become a Member of the Commission. His attitudes were often provocative, which led to him being labelled a euro-sceptic.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not actually think that he has ever been one. It is true that he is keen for the Netherlands to be a tax haven for large companies and high incomes and he does not want the European Union to hinder him in this. That is why he certainly would not be the right person to take on the taxation harmonisation portfolio. But now, the vast majority of Dutch MEPs have voted for a Commission of which Mr Bolkestein is a Member, thereby completely breaking their promise to the Dutch electorate. My party, the Socialist party in the Netherlands, does not go along with this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an explanation of vote directed at Mr Prodi. I hope that somebody will take note and pass the communication on.</p>
<p class="contents">According to many historians and anthropologists, the Basque people form the oldest nation in Europe which, in spite of its limited population, has maintained its own ancestral language for centuries and millennia, as well as a distinct culture and traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">But, despite all of this, there are many other manifestations of the Basque uniqueness, not only in social, biological, civic, legal or administrative terms, but also, and above all, economically and fiscally.</p>
<p class="contents">The gradual historical absorption and integration of the Basque Country into the Spanish State, which has always been the result of military defeats in the past, as well as the mass arrival of immigrants from other parts of the Iberian Peninsula, has resulted in the blurring and dilution of our personality and of native Basque uniqueness.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Basque country maintains a political conflict with the Spanish State which has manifested itself in a violent way, a violence which the majority of us reject, but which, nevertheless, has left a trail of deaths, injuries, pain, extortion, fear and many innocent victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been snatched from us for reasons of state interest. But there is a distinguishing mark, a clear tendency towards self-government and sovereignty which has resisted all the historical upheavals and misfortunes. I am referring to the full autonomy, to the exclusive capacity and competence which the Basque Country enjoys from a fiscal point of view, from the point of view of the collection of taxes, rates and public levies, as well as with regard to budgets and public spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, today in Euskadi, as in Northern Ireland, we live in times of hope. The armed organisation ETA has declared a cease-fire and the majority of Basque political parties, unions and civil organisations have signed an agreement in Lizarra-Estella (Navarre) which aims at dealing with the Basque conflict through dialogue and negotiation. That is to say, by taking an exclusively democratic path.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, the Commission of the European Union has called into question and cast doubt upon certain fiscal measures which are designed to promote economic activity and reduce our high level of unemployment, measures which were adopted by the Basque institutions by virtue of their sovereignty and autonomy in this area. This is a right which not even the Fascist dictatorship of General Franco dared to interfere with or violate in the historic Basque territories of Navarre or Álava.</p>
<p class="contents">In these historic days when the Basques are opting for European construction as a democratic path to understanding, conciliation and peaceful co-existence with all Spaniards, as well as all the other peoples of Europe, the thing that we need least, the thing that could affect the peace which we are seeking and which we yearn for is for our remaining fiscal sovereignty, our economic harmony, not to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have liked to have voted positively, in the affirmative, for this new European Commission which you have presented to us. But the replies given by those responsible for competition and other issues relating to the European regions have caused disquiet and concern in the Basque Country, and for this reason we have not been able to put our trust in them.</p>
<p class="contents">But neither have we wanted to say no. We have not rejected your candidature or your proposal, since we prefer to seek opportunities for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, Mr President Prodi, I ask for your support for the peace process in Euskadi, in the Basque Country. To this end, there are some proposals concerning programmes and actions which will benefit the peace process, which have been presented to your Directorate-General responsible for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">But, above all, there is one thing you can do for the sake of our peace and that is to promote the respect for the historic rights of the Basques, amongst which is fiscal sovereignty, which is the right of any other Member State of the EU. This is a sovereignty which we are willing to harmonise with everybody else, as long as it is through dialogue, understanding and agreement. Not through disrespect, inconsiderateness and even less, through imposition.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that peace warrants reflection with regard to all these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, Mr Prodi, for your attention. We trust that your well-known democratic disposition will help to find a satisfactory solution for all of us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were also not in a position to grant our approval for the period following on account of the fact that several of the candidates have not unequivocally declared themselves fully and individually responsible, as required by their office.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi has therefore passed up the opportunity to usher in a new start for the Commission, which is needed. He would have had a green light to replace the members from the previous Commission and thereby give a signal of transparency and integrity to the citizens of Europe. In the end, it is the aim of this Commission to consolidate its power base in terms of a European supergovernment. We do not agree with this development, nor does it correspond to the will of the citizens of Europe. Even if the resolution required for approval is to be regarded as a task conferred upon the Prodi Commission, which we certainly reject, we cannot agree to this because in this way, the fundamental responsibilities of this Parliament are allocated to one of the EU’s administrative bodies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the case in this instance. Here, it is again a question of, if I may put it this way, cast-off national politicians.

<p class="contents">Parliament believes it has won a great victory since it has obtained the guarantee that President Prodi is going to take account of the legislative initiatives of the European Parliament. This initiative of Parliament’s will surely not fail to elicit requests for the same consideration from Member States and national bureaucracies. You will see that as soon as this happens, the pressure exerted by the capitals of Europe upon the Commission will become greater than the pressure exerted by the European Parliament. I believe we must do all in our power to defend the Commission’s right of initiative, otherwise it will be no more than a mailbox, a merely executive body.

This is intended to protect the political authority of the President. By voting in this way, what we were doing was to approve the Commission each time before actually nominating the President. With our first vote we approved the nomination of Mr Prodi, whilst the Act of 19 July had already nominated the prospective Commissioners. We then went on to the third and fourth votes on the basis of the earlier decision of 19 July. I find that Parliament has not made itself look any better in this matter. We should have been more scrupulous than the Council in respecting the very strict terms of Rule 214.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, I have to register a reservation by abstaining since, although there are good Commissioners – Mrs Schreyer and Mrs Wallström have convinced me – I must say that I found the interventions of Mr Prodi more than disappointing. I do not consider it enough that he only presented declarations of intent, when really what he should have been talking about was the direction in which the reforms in the European Union are heading. For me, there were too many fine words, too little of substance and, therefore, through my abstention, I wanted to express my feeling that this is not enough and that over the next few years, the Commission must succeed in carrying out its promises as far as possible and not stand still on its words. Hopefully, Mr Prodi will then succeed in becoming a stronger figure within this European Union. Let me make it clear that I have not voted with a “no”, I would have preferred to give my approval with an unequivocal “yes”, yet I found Mr Prodi’s statement too disappointing.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not sufficiently transparent in the way it is run. It is oriented too much towards the concerns of the market and big business and not enough towards the concerns of the population, particularly those who have to endure lack of job security, unemployment and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The hearings of the Commissioners-designate made it possible to offer an initial response on the reform of the running of the Commission and the strengthening of links with Parliament. But it is on the basis of the policies implemented that Europe will be judged and that the confidence of the citizens must be regained.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the prospects for social Europe? What protection mechanisms when confronted with economic forces increasingly dominated by the financial world? What new employment policy? What major collective projects to prepare the way for the future and to sustain growth? What will Europe’s environment and its concept of sustainable development be like? And, going on from that, what approach to negotiations with the WTO in order to defend the uniqueness of the European social model and to promote a new type of co-operation between the countries of North and South?</p>
<p class="contents">On these questions, the statement by President Prodi did not provide the expected responses. The guidelines presented are still far removed from the priorities which were at the centre of the campaign by Socialists, in France and also in many other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no doubts as to the character, the honesty and the competence of the Commissioners-designate. From this point of view, the personal attacks, with no real justification, by a party of the right and of the extreme Right upon a Socialist leader are unacceptable. The vote of no confidence which they are calling for must be rejected. I shall vote in favour of the appointment. But this approval of the membership of the Commission, which must be capable of getting down to work, is not tantamount to a vote of confidence in a political programme which has not yet been presented, which must be debated with Parliament at the earliest opportunity, and which must take into account the aspirations and expectations of the citizens of Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Eriksson, Frahm, Herman Schmid and Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), </span><span class="italic">in writing.</span><span class="bold"> </span>– <span class="italic">(SV)</span> It is not on the basis of individual Commissioners’ ability to carry out their official tasks that a position for or against the European Commission is to be adopted. For example, the Commissioners from Scandinavia, Mr Nielson and Ms Wallström, came out well from the hearings. If we had been able to vote for individual Commissioners, we should have given them our support, but the EU’s treaty does not permit this.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude we adopt towards the Commission depends mainly upon three questions:</p>
<p class="contents">Democratic procedure</p>
<p class="contents">Here, we cannot accept the threats which have come from Mr Prodi as President of the Commission. His threats include that of withdrawing the whole of the Commission if Parliament does not approve the whole College. He has also, through telephone conversations with the leader of the Conservatives/Christian Democrats, Mr Poettering, reached an agreement to the effect that no unduly indiscreet and controversial questions should be asked at the hearings. In this way, the French candidate Pascal Lamy, for example, got off all too lightly. As head of Delors’ cabinet, Lamy was responsible for ensuring that the Commission developed its own security department to the point that it became a “state within a state”, as is also maintained in the report by the Experts’ Committee. He was also responsible for the security services’ choosing to recruit leading personnel from right-wing extremist backgrounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The political content </p>
<p class="contents">This can best be discovered from Mr Prodi’s various speeches, through which his neo-liberal ideas shine clearly. The labour market is to be deregulated and social insurances and taxes should be harmonised. It is remarkable that the governments within the EU, which are to a large extent dominated by Social Democrats, have been able to agree upon a President of the Commission who so obviously does not represent the values of the labour movement. The idea that the EU should be developed as a military power is another of Mr Prodi’s hobbyhorses. It has not been possible in the course of the hearings to discern any understanding of the Swedish policy of non-alignment or of Danish exemption from military co-operation. What has also prevailed during the hearings of the Commissioners-designate is remarkable unity as to the need to abolish the right of veto almost across the board. The direction is clear: that of a European state, a federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Future aims </p>
<p class="contents">On 14 September, Mr Prodi spoke in the European Parliament about the need to introduce <span class="italic">glasnost</span>, but he said nothing about introducing a measure whereby employees of the Commission would be free to provide information. He was also rather vague when it came to concrete reforms. He did not want to comment on the report by the experts’ group but asked if he could return to it on a later occasion. Mr Prodi wants a strengthened Commission which will take on an ever-increasing number of tasks. The intention, moreover, is that it should unconditionally retain its stagnant monopoly on initiatives concerning legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken together, these are the reasons why we have chosen to vote “no” to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not simply a matter of ensuring, within the framework of economic globalisation, a degree of growth which is capable of creating lasting and sustainable employment, or proposing profound institutional reform at the next Intergovernmental Conference. Nor is it just a matter of going forward with the issue of enlargement of the Union in order to contribute to the well-being of Europe as a whole, despite the undeniable importance of these challenges. What is needed, above all, is the advancement of the process of European construction with regard to feelings and conscience. It is a matter, as Prodi said himself yesterday, of creating one soul and one heart: the European heart and soul. It is also a question of offering genuine peace and prosperity to the neighbouring populations and establishing links of co-operation on a global level in order to create a decent society for all, a world which enjoys peace and liberty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, both through his loyalty to the principles which brought about the current European Union and through his proven capacity for management, will, I am sure, lead the new Commission along the path and at the pace which current circumstances require. Therefore, in spite of individual questions which concern certain Commissioners which, in any case, belong to the past, I have given my vote of confidence to the new Commission in the knowledge, furthermore, that Parliament has the necessary mechanisms in place to withdraw that confidence in the event that it is betrayed. The restoration of the hope and confidence of the European citizens now depends on the Commission which, under the direction of President Prodi, today embarks on its course. This Commission has been granted, by this Parliament, the democratic legitimacy and transparency which the citizens demand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the whole, the fundamental political positions which have been responsible for the current problems were defended, particularly those on unemployment and social exclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">The complete lack of confidence that our citizens have in the European institutions, which was clearly demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections, requires not only “a modern and efficient administration”, but new policies which will respond positively to the socio-economic problems currently experienced by the European Union’s Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the central features of the positions held are still neo-liberal and federalist policies, although in a few cases, there were hints of social concern in the speeches, but without any concrete suggestions as to how they might be implemented. Only yesterday, Romano Prodi clarified his position when he claimed that it was necessary to “restructure the single market and to promote liberalisation”, and deliberately emphasised the need to continue the process of liberalisation in the goods and service sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">If we maintain the criteria of Maastricht and the Stability Pact, the European Employment Pact loses any credibility it might have had, and this, together with the insistence on the flexibility of working conditions makes it clear that what is at stake is an increasing deregulation of working conditions. In turn, no progress has been made on the need to assess the movement of capital, in terms of national social programmes having to adapt to current demographic trends, which proves that, in fact, their objective is not greater social justice, but quite the opposite: greater social inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of farming, there was still an insistence on the great objectives of the CAP – common agricultural policy – and on a greater liberalisation of the markets, which upholds the injustices in the distribution of aid and subsidies, with an obvious bias against family-based farming and against countries such as Portugal where small-holdings represent the most common kind of farming.</p>

<p class="contents">The European institutions, particularly the European Commission and the European Parliament, emerge with increased statures from the hearings of the Commissioners-designate, and the European citizens who followed them (in the press) may find in them, I hope, good reasons to become more interested in the building of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, taking account of the generally acknowledged competence of the Commissioners and the intention expressed by the majority of them to work in close collaboration with Parliament, I voted in favour of the appointment of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It was all the easier for me since the procedure selected for these hearings provided an opportunity to remind the Commission of its undertaking to present, by the end of 1999, a raft of proposals intended to finally give substance to Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam which establishes the specificity of the most remote regions, and their right to specific conditions of exemption, to enable them to deal with their structural problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, with regard to the OCT associated to the European Union, Commissioner Nielson acknowledged the need to present as quickly as possible a wide range of proposals intended to give these countries a status appropriate to their current situation, with a view to the forthcoming Association Agreement and, in particular, the consequent renewal of the financial instrument allocated to their development.</p>
<p class="contents">On both these subjects, which I attach particular importance to, the proposals of the competent Commissioners seemed to me to augur well for the future collaboration between Commission and Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore voting against the Prodi Commission for the period of 23 January 2000 to 22 January 2005.

<p class="contents">What we have to do today is to assess whether the Commissioners-designate are up to the task of fulfilling their assignments competently and with due seriousness. There is nothing in what we have learnt during the Commissioners’ hearings to justify, at this stage, a veto on any one of them in particular. Let us say that they can enjoy the benefit of the doubt at this early stage. The fact remains that, in his speech to the European Parliament, Romano Prodi made statements which can only disappoint and worry those who are waiting for rapid and bold responses from the European Union in order to re-align Europe to be at the service of people and humanity rather than of finance and of the great God, money, for Europe to put itself forward as an alternative to world-wide liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi’s silence on the subject of the need to defend the European Social Model, his irritating reticence, his frequent omissions on the subject of a European policy to promote employment and his tentative generalities on institutional change, give us rather more than reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why in the vote on the nomination of Mr Prodi, I voted against. In anticipation of the essential reorientation of the political paths of the Commission and of the debate on the action to be taken, a vote in favour today must be interpreted as a choice not to multiply crises, blockages, in our institutions, and as a refusal to look for individual scapegoats when it is the orientation of Europe in terms of politics and civilisation which is in question.</p>
<p class="contents">This vote is, to some extent, purely administrative. My vote is not therefore a challenge to the Commissioners-designate. Nor is it a vote of confidence. I expect the new Commission to earn this confidence. The Commission must be aware that there are many of us who will not hesitate to penalise it if its actions should prove to be as disappointing as its current political performance.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But having listened closely both to the debate here today, and to the answers we have been given from the Commissioners designate in the Parliamentary Hearings over the past few weeks, I still have a number of grave concerns and reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two aspects to these concerns: on the one side, the political side, of course we could not expect a Green Commission. But what we did expect was the demonstration of a greater awareness of how to prioritise and implement key issues of social justice and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other side, the assessment of the Commissioners’ ability to live up to the enormous expectations that now lie upon them to introduce a very different kind of behaviour and culture in the new Commission, we did expect the demonstration of an ability to introduce genuine, far-reaching, radical reform.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, in order to be able to vote in favour of this Commission, I would need to be able to say that, as a bloc, these are Commissioners whose commitment to introduce exactly such fundamental reforms I can endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">I would need to be able to say that these are all Commissioners whose integrity and good judgement are beyond reproach.</p>
<p class="contents">I would need to be able to say that these are Commissioners whom I, and the citizens of Europe, can wholeheartedly trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I greatly regret that what I have heard and read over the past few weeks and months means that, for a number of Commissioners in the proposed new Commission, I cannot yet say these things.</p>

My reason for this: in May of this year, Commission President Prodi received a convincing vote from the European Parliament to initiate a comprehensive reform programme with a new team for a Commission in need of cleaning up. Yet the Commission is already tarnished.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi did not react to the outcome of the hearings. In view of the considerable doubt expressed as to the competence of the Belgian Philippe Busquin for the research department and the plethora of accusations regarding his affairs, he should have rejected the candidates. Furthermore, he accepted without reservation the proposal from the French government to nominate Pascal Lamy as Commissioner responsible for foreign trade, even though he is the architect of the “Jacques Delors System”, and therefore responsible for the emergence of a completely confusing financial structure within the Commission. This system is the real reason behind the serious lack of organisation which led to the resignation of the Santer Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing has come of the grandiose promise of “a fair balance across the political spectrum”. The majority of the Commission is from the Left. Romano Prodi did not raise any objection to the German Chancellor when the latter nominated a Green and a Social Democrat purely on the grounds of party political affiliation. Word has now got out about Schröder’s lack of any definite line and sheer power tendencies, and Germans the length and breadth of the country are now making him pay. In contrast to his predecessor Helmut Kohl who, five years ago, accepted the opposition’s nomination for the Commission – and it was not easy for me to vote for Monika Wulf-Mathies in 1994 – Schröder was not prepared to give consideration to the views of today’s opposition, the CDU/CSU, the victors in the European elections in Germany. Elmar Brok would have been a more excellent nomination and one capable of winning a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">It is intended that Michaele Schreyer will take responsibility for budgetary issues, an area in which she can only supervise and not shape policy; she could do nothing to alleviate misgivings relating to her ability to take responsibility for budgetary issues. Günter Verheugen is being pushed into the sphere of enlargement where the decisive steps have already long since been taken. He will not even be responsible for his own Directorate-General and is, therefore, only a junior Commissioner. I cannot accept this second-class arrangement for the largest Member State in the EU, no doubt a result of Schröder’s pigheadedness.</p>
<p class="contents">The upshot of all this: I have to reject this Commission. This vote does not concern expressly the Italian Mario Monti (Trade), the Luxembourger Viviane Reding (Culture and Education) and the British national Chris Patten (External Affairs) who, and I myself am convinced of this, left behind an indelible impression of competence and an ability to communicate.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the misgivings mentioned, I did not say “no” to Romano Prodi. Instead I abstained. I recognise that he has taken on board five demands from the Group of the European People’s Party, inter alia, with regard to the legislative right of nomination of the European Parliament, the conduct of the Commissioners in the case of a vote of no-confidence and the necessary permanent dialogue concerning Commission reform. I hope that Mr Prodi will become someone who is willing and able to undertake reform and who will give Europe’s citizens new confidence in clear and efficient European institutions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Far from proposing to correct this drift in the direction of the institution, far from refocusing the Commission on the limited tasks allocated to it by the Treaties and on the organisational strictness with which it should acquit itself, Mr Prodi’s attitude conforms completely to the customary approach of perpetually exceeding the areas of competence enshrined in the Treaties to the advantage of the Commission. Worse than this, he is proposing, like Delors before him, to accentuate this divergence. This is the first reason for our refusal to vote in favour of a Commission which defines its objectives with scant regard for the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason for our vote against is related to a number of worrying statements made by the Commissioners-designate during the hearings before the European Parliament. What Mr Prodi and some others complacently presented as a model democratic exercise (Mr Prodi even spoke of an impressive exercise in democracy) was in fact a great bout of mutual congratulation on Federalist one-upmanship. A number of candidate Commissioners – and the prize in this respect surely goes to Commissioner-designate Barnier – blithely disregarded the Treaties in order to recommend, firstly the general application of co-decision (in particular, Mr Fischler), then the development of a European constitution intended to replace that of the Member States, then the replacement of national sovereignty by “European sovereignty” (sic). </p>
<p class="contents">Are we dreaming here? These calls to free ourselves from the institutional balance decided by the governments of our states, these undertakings in favour of permanent institutional instability, to the benefit of supranational European bodies and to the detriment of national democracies, are grounds for serious concern. It is not healthy for democracy for these hearings to have been twisted into massive schemes of political blackmail, with the Commission and Parliament undertaking to back each other up in their insatiable thirst for power, subverting the frameworks established by the national governments elected by the people of our states. We cannot sanction such drifts in direction.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
