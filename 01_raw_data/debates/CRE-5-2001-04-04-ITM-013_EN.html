<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Auroi (Verts/ALE)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, to ensure that the first harvest can be gathered after 15 August 2001, against the difficult background of the BSE crisis and as a matter of urgency, the Commission has been prompted to propose amendments to the Council Regulation establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops. This proposal is one of the measures in the seven-point plan being submitted to Parliament by the Commission which would enable certain land which is currently set aside to be put back into cultivation for crops such as clover.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision to amend the Regulation as a matter of urgency will be seen by producers as a sign of hope. Europe is not abandoning them and does not want them to carry the can for a situation of which they are very often the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from its urgency, this measure follows on directly from the White Paper on food safety which included in its proposals the incorporation of problems associated with the production of animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also addresses the problem of the production of vegetable protein needed to ensure suitable feedingstuffs for bovine animals. There is a deficit in such production in Europe as a result, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, of the Blair House agreements. The set-aside arrangements laid down resulted in arable land lying fallow while, at the same time, livestock were being fed on animal protein, including some from animal meal. In order to enable all livestock to be once again fed with more wholesome feedingstuffs, and in order to overcome the BSE crisis, it is essential that the set-aside arrangements be amended so as to encourage production of fodder crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Your proposal, Commissioner, admittedly constitutes a step in the right direction, although the change proposed is only marginal in relation to the Regulation as a whole. The change is of simply symbolic value but we in this House could go further and use it as the trigger for a debate leading to the eventual reform of Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the measures proposed is to move, initially, from set aside towards arrangements which are designed to increase crop rotation, but only in the organic farming sector. The effect of such arrangements would be to enhance the use of certain set-aside land by the planting of crops such as broad beans, kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, lupin, vetch, alfalfa, fenugreek, sweet clover, clover, white clover, field beans, peas and others. This would have a positive effect in terms of promoting a more natural approach to livestock rearing because it would be associated with the production of fodder. In addition, it would have a positive impact on the environment, since we now know that set aside is often harmful to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than encouraging mass production of protein and oleaginous crops and promoting rotation through payments linked to area or to volumes, this adjustment to the rules will allow the partial lifting of the set-aside requirement in order to grow fodder legumes not for human consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">It represents a step in the direction of reform of the CAP along the lines of high-quality livestock farming and extensive production which we would all like to see. The question is whether this should be limited to boosting organic farming on the basis of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 or whether it is possible to go further. In the latter case, conventional farm holdings should be allowed to benefit from the same possibilities if they are willing to restrict themselves to planting only fodder crops on their set-aside land.</p>
<p class="contents">The obligation to complement the growing of cereals with legumes and fodder crops in order to receive subsidies can thus contribute towards establishing ecological cycles and improving the soil. Such a commitment, associated with good farming practice, would permit the restoration of good rotation of crops, such as is found in organic farming.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we confine ourselves to lifting the set-aside requirement only for organic farming, we shall be making no more than cosmetic changes. The Commission made this proposal too restrictive by limiting set-aside production to organic farming, not through any admiration for organic farmers, but because it did not want to chip away at the WTO agreements by adopting a measure which would favour all EU producers. In fact, however, depending on the state of the crisis in health safety, under the WTO agreements, an amendment of the rules by Member States does not constitute a violation of its agreements, which the Economic and Social Committee also pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if the health of consumers and the survival of farmers are at stake, it will be necessary to have the courage to review these agreements. George W. Bush had no qualms when he rejected the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. The crucial thing now is to take a quick initial decision to enable farmers to sow their crops as soon as possible. The best solution would have been to allow conventional farmers to sow set-aside land with protein crops before 15 August 2001, but the Commission did not accept this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, a compromise has been put to you by the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for 2001 which, in addition to organic farming, concerns all agricultural holdings which take part in an agri-environment programme. Then, from 2002, this measure could be opened up to the conventional sector.</p>
<p class="contents">This isolated proposal should be but a first step towards a more complete reform of the common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, however, is only to be possible for holdings which, with their production, are taking part in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 and which, in effect, are organic holdings. This is where our criticism begins, and for the most part the Council also sees it the same way. I want to emphasise this at this point. We are calling for not only organic holdings to be permitted to cultivate legumes on land set aside, but, against the background of BSE and foot-and-mouth, all livestock holdings. In this way, the many livestock holdings could receive a small compensation for the sometimes truly dramatic financial losses caused by BSE and foot-and-mouth. At least, however, in addition to the organic holdings, holdings should be considered which are participating in the agri-environment programmes, that is to say holdings which, within the framework of Regulation 1257/99, are participating in national environment programmes approved by the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument put forward by the committee in this connection, that the instrument of set aside would be given up with our amendments, is surely incomprehensible. It is clear to every farmer affected by BSE and foot-and-mouth and who is participating in these support measures that the EU is giving no new cause for celebration here. Rather, he will be grateful for it as a very clever interpretation of the little room to manoeuvre which remains to us in the present miserable situation for livestock holdings.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the committee itself reports that the desired restoration of the soil’s fertility will be achieved by the cultivation of fodder legumes. It is incomprehensible why only organically farmed holdings should profit from this recycling. After the animal meal fodder ban, it just makes sense to encourage the cultivation of highly protein-rich legumes. We will need far more of them than we are at present producing. The introduction of soya may pay off. If, however, we are taking sustainable agriculture seriously, we must take a step forwards here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Whilst the majority of agricultural holdings are mixed, the Commission proposes to limit the possibility to grow fodder crops on their set-aside land, in other words, on less than 10% of the surface area designated for cereals, protein and oleaginous crops, to holdings which are 100% organic, which accounts for barely 2% of the cultivated area in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Auroi is proposing extending this possibility to conventional farm holdings, especially to livestock farms, and she is right. But even if it is revised in this way, the proposal is clearly not in line with the extent of the problem we have to solve. Our deficit in protein and oleaginous crops, which was made considerably worse by the Blair House constraints, exceeded 35 million tonnes before the ban on animal meal for monogastric animals even came into force. At least 300 000 tons of additional imports a month must be added to that.</p>
<p class="contents">So only an ambitious ‘protein’ plan will redress the balance and satisfy consumers’ demands for traceability. In this regard, I am appalled at the Commission’s spirit of renunciation, which it demonstrated in its communication of 16 March, in which short-term free trade took the place of policy. I will come back to this in tomorrow’s debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Equally, I would like to thank the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the rapid and thorough examination of the proposal on the use of land set aside for organic holdings, which I had already submitted in the plenary part-session within the framework of the seven-point plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express clearly, though, that the proposed measure is not aimed at replacing the animal meal at present banned in fodder. Tomorrow morning we will have the opportunity to discuss this aspect. Our aim – the aim of the Commission – is quite a different one, namely to create an additional encouragement of environmental agriculture, since organic farmers are dependent on the cultivation of fodder legumes like clover and lucerne to a greater degree than conventional agriculture. I am therefore of the opinion that the possibility proposed by the committee will be of great use to organic farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also not forget, however, that there are good reasons for the restriction to organic holdings. Firstly, it should be guaranteed that the land set aside remains an effective instrument for the control of production, in order to keep our aquaculture subsidies in the Blue Box. Secondly, a certain preference for organic holdings is therefore appropriate here, since otherwise it would be much harder for these to be able to fulfil their production conditions. It would be advisable to bear these arguments in mind when the relationship between supply and demand in protein-rich crops is discussed tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I must reject the amendments which are aimed at a use of land set aside for the cultivation of all types of fodder legumes and protein-rich crops and for an extension to other types of agricultural holdings besides organic holdings: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are aimed at the relationship between supply and demand in protein-rich crops. This question was examined and settled by my services, after the Council had engaged the Commission to do so in December and within the framework of the Nice Summit. Tomorrow morning, I will make a statement about this here in plenary. For this reason, I would prefer not to discuss this further today.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, one final obvious comment on the proposal discussed today: only if the Council can decide quickly will the organic farmers be able to profit from the opportunity offered, since our proposal would already also take into account the set-aside period from 15 January 2001 and apply from then on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concerns personal statements. It states that these personal statements may be made, if, in the course of the debate, remarks were made about one’s person. What I now find fault with is that absolutely no remarks were made about my person. Perhaps I may then, nevertheless, make a personal remark. Namely, I would have liked to have heard if anyone had said that what the committee has here proposed and what we have gone on to examine more thoroughly and make more detailed proposals about fills the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture with great satisfaction. No one has said that we – and I in particular – have now been occupied with this work for years, that we are very happy that Commissioner Fischler has now made this proposal and that – even if we do not adopt all the proposals – we are nevertheless embarking upon this use of land set aside and upon the environmental revaluation of crop rotation. I wanted to say that as a personal remark. Many thanks, Mr President, for giving me the opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
