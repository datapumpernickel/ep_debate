During that visit, we got the impression that whilst the European Union is present and is getting geared up for the task which, as we all know, will be vital to Kosovo's future, the energy that is being invested in it and the attention given to it leave a great deal to be desired in a number of areas. This covers a number of issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, whilst the European Union is clearly making thorough preparations in the areas of security and justice, with a view to taking over the tasks of the UN, UNMIC, we are of the opinion that it is not in the areas of security and justice, however important that they may be, that the EU will be playing an important role. What is equally important, for example, is coordinating all the efforts of the international community, continuing to help in the construction of a civil administration and, crucially, monitoring compliance with human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are crucial tasks which soon, when the UN has left, and preparations for their departure are in full swing, will be the responsibility of the EU. Our question to the Council and the European Union is the following: Are people really prepared, and able, to make thorough preparations – that is to say, in all those areas, and not just in the first two of them?</p>
<p class="contents">This preparation should, in our view, be made with the full consent and in good cooperation with the Commission. I wonder, more out of interest than out of criticism, whether the Member States and Commission are able to get a fully-equipped Commission delegation up and running in time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is, in our view, crucial in terms of the symbolism involved that the EU should do everything in its power to keep its administration separate from that of the UN, UNMIC. We cannot afford the EU coming across as a sort of EU-MIC, which is how it is sometimes perceived over there. The symbols, the buildings, the manner of presentation must demonstrate that a new start has been made with the EU, in a Kosovo that is different from what it was when the UN were there after 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the questions we would like answered by the Commission and, above all, by the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The West, and the European Union in particular, has not tolerated Milošević’s oppression, displacement and killing of some of the Albanian speaking population in particular. This also means, however, that we have fought for values in this region which we now have to uphold as well. I hope that the Council remains resolute in adhering to these values and urges that these values are observed.</p>
<p class="contents">What are these values? Do they cover human rights? The rights of minorities? It is, first and foremost, if I may say so, the right to a homeland, which all individuals who have their homeland in Kosovo also have to be able to perceive in every aspect, not just in terms of everyday life and getting by, but also, and more importantly, as far as cultural and religious life is concerned which, in this region, for the Serbian population in particular, is very deep-rooted. </p>
<p class="contents">Is an independent Kosovo needed to live like this? Yes or no? I do not believe that there is a perfect solution. Perhaps it would be perfect were we all able to live together in Europe without state borders and authorities. I doubt this is a realistic prospect. This is therefore a genuinely serious consideration which we have to face up to here. What I am saying is that even for Serbia and the Serbian population as a whole, the fact that there was national unity in Kosovo which, as has already been mentioned, fully guarantees human rights and the rights of minorities, would not present a solution or amount to anything.</p>
<p class="contents">Independence, something which is looming on the horizon as far as Kosovo is concerned, must therefore be very clearly associated with conditions and European standards. I hope that, in future, the Council will insist on this unequivocally in all deliberations. It would have been better for us if, over past months, the Albanian majority had already demonstrated that it fully respected the rights of minorities, and here, above all, we are talking about the rights of the Serbian population. This has only been the case in part. We must therefore insist on the fact that this is fulfilled in full during the independence process. In this regard, an appeal is made, first and foremost, to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For those of us who were in Kosovo not so long ago, it was actually very encouraging that many representatives of the Albanian majority spoke of limited sovereignty which, in the first phase in particular, must also be accepted by the Albanian majority. Which party can limit this sovereignty? Certainly not Serbia, perhaps in the interests of Serbia and its people as well but, first and foremost, the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I come to the point already made by my fellow Member, Mr Lagendijk. The European Union will have to play a major role in the legal system, in the sphere of security, especially that of the police, but naturally also as far as military security is concerned. Responsibility for organising how the European Union plays out this role rests with the Council and naturally, with our colleagues at the Commission, because it would be terrible if Europe was again to speak with two contrasting voices in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">No, we just need a single voice in this region which stands up for human rights, for the rights of minorities in a future, independent Kosovo, which means that a limit on sovereignty can be lifted if Kosovo and the majority there also behave accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to my final point. It is certainly difficult for Serbia to first have to cope with Montenegro’s independence and now that of Kosovo. If Serbia receives the support of the European Union, however, a new Serbia can emerge which will prove a valuable partner for all members of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to call on you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, to really make every effort, with the assistance of the Commission and the European Parliament, to help Serbia overcome this difficult phase. It cannot be surmounted by giving Kosovo a formal structure in Serbia itself. It will be surmounted by two independent states being able to live together in peace and friendship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doris Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commission President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to underline what my fellow Members, Mr Swoboda and Mr Lagendijk, have said. They have actually covered all the issues already but I would like to go into certain points in further detail.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four different representations in Kosovo. Firstly, the European Agency for Reconstruction which has done sterling work. We have the so-called fourth pillar within the UN framework where we are essentially responsible for economic matters as well as privatisation. The European Parliament has a delegation there and finally, we also have Council representation. All this in the small region that is Kosovo. The question must already be asked how all this is organised, how all these bodies are able to communicate with one another at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have this EU planning team, something we were able to establish when we were over there, which is responsible for ensuring the rule of law, but I find this all very restrictive. The tasks facing us are much more extensive. It will not do justice to the scale and importance of what we have planned for next year if we approach all of this in such a restricted manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We must endeavour to create capacities. We must help build up the civil administration. We must ensure that human rights and the rights of minorities are observed. How do we manage this when there are so many players of our calibre, including the OSCE, the European Ombudsman and others?</p>
<p class="contents">The UN, which is also represented there in all of our names, has certainly done a lot of good through UNMIK over recent years, although it has also made a lot of mistakes. It is probable that no other course of action was possible in rebuilding the civil and local administrations. Would we do any better? Do we have any men and women at all who want, and are able, to commit to working there, who are able to establish trust, who bring with them an adequate level of commitment to actually accomplish what we need on site?</p>
<p class="contents">To what extent can we, as the European Union, influence the police forces in Kosovo? We know that it is their intention to create a military organisation. To what extent are we maintaining more than just superficial contact with government bodies? What role may European troops soon play in Kosovo? I am aware that these are all questions to which we are awaiting a reply and which you are not yet in a position to answer, but I would like to say to you that I am personally afraid that we are not adequately prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">When we shift our attention to the neighbouring state of Bosnia Herzegovina, we see the difficulties facing us there and the multitude of problems that we still have to deal with. We have a single representative there who was, and actually still is, all-powerful, and who could do anything which can actually only be achieved in a democracy using democratic legislation as a basis. The problem is that we now have a situation there which is not up to the new challenges because people were not accustomed to taking responsibility themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need in Kosovo is assistance to allow the Kosovars to help themselves. By ‘Kosovars’, I do not just mean Albanians, but also Serbs who live there and who we should actually expect to engage in the institutions. The only thing lacking as far as I am concerned is pressure on the Serbian Government in Belgrade to allow Serbs in Kosovo to participate. This is the real problem. If we listen to Mr Oliver Ivanovic in Serbia, we know what he would like to do were he allowed to. I believe that all that is lacking is pressure on the Serbian Government to give Serbs there the opportunity to build towards their future. This must certainly happen at some point or other because Serbia is no longer responsible for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am underlining what my fellow Member, Mr Swoboda, said. With its neighbours, this region will become part of the European Union. We must therefore see to it that it is in a position to resolve these tasks, that it heeds human rights and the rights of minorities, that, with our help, it develops all the administrative capabilities required to also adopt and transpose our legislation, and to then find a seamless path into the European Union in conjunction with its neighbours, Serbia and Montenegro. I very much hope that we are able to offer this assistance. I venture, however, to express a degree of doubt on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that we came away from Pristina in June pretty concerned about the EU’s capacity to take on its future enhanced role in Kosovo and to see it through, because if we look at another territory where the international community took on state-building and reconstruction responsibilities – i.e. Afghanistan – we see incipient failure. We need to learn from this experience that the commitment needs to be full, well-planned and consistent and not half-hearted and under-funded. Even more so in the future, Kosovo will be an expensive commitment for the EU, but the alternative of chaos, ethnic conflict and crime is even more expensive. We must treat Kosovo as the future EU member that it is.</p>
<p class="contents">The second lesson – and we hardly need to learn it from Afghanistan or Iraq, because it is so obvious – is: ‘it’s the economy, stupid!’ The most important challenge in Kosovo is the massive unemployment. Obviously, status, constitutional issues and administrative capacity have to be sorted out and the security and policing challenges are acute. However, social and economic development is the vital key to peace and coexistence. In this context, education, agricultural development, visa facilitation or, ideally, liberalisation, must be at the top of the agenda. It is important to show Serbs and other minorities, as well as Kosovar Albanians, that they will be better off in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, I should like to mention an idea. It is not an original idea, but one borrowed from others, who have suggested creating an international university in Mitrovica along the lines of the South-East European University in Tetovo. This is an excellent idea and I hope that we can find some rich donor who might be able to take it forward in what are likely to be the two municipalities of the town. That could instigate economic development in the north of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, very briefly, is that there have been concerns in the context of extraordinary rendition. The former Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Gil-Robles, said that some time in around 2002 or 2003 he saw detainees – prisoners – in Guantánamo-type orange jumpsuits, apparently detained by KFOR, but was not able to pursue the matter. Indeed, the Council of Europe Committee on Torture has not been allowed access to prisoners in Kosovo. This is unacceptable when a territory is under the stewardship of an international community that purports to uphold human rights. I hope that in future the EU will ensure that there is no doubt about Kosovo’s compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A positive, lasting solution is in the European Union’s own interests. The status process for Kosovo is led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari. The EU is fully involved in the work via its special representative. Likewise, the Union, and the Finnish Presidency in particular, are in regular direct contact with Special Envoy Ahtisaari, who recently gave an account of the situation at the meeting of the EU’s General Affairs and External Relations Council on 17 July.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Special Envoy is still trying to persuade both Belgrade and Pristina to take an active part in negotiations on key themes, such as decentralisation of government, religious and cultural heritage, economic issues and the rights of minorities. Direct discussions and consultations with experts are continuing. The parties continue to hold different views, but the process has been useful inasmuch as it has clarified positions and has helped to explore common ground for a future solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union fully supports these objectives. It has a leading role in matters relating to economic aspects of the process via its representative and the Commission. The EU is pleased with the decision by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to move on to political discussions on Kosovo’s status and urge both parties to take part in a new round of talks in a constructive way.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union fully supports the combined efforts of the UN Secretary-General’s special representative for Kosovo and Kosovo’s temporary self-governing bodies to implement standards. There is also a need to prepare for a progressive move from the reform process according to these standards to one that is consistent with European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Following status determination, the Union’s involvement in Kosovo will cover three areas. These are the Union’s participation in any future civil presence, any possible civil crisis management operation concerning the rule of law, especially with regard to the police and the judicial system, and an EU presence with the purpose of lending support to Kosovo’s European perspective. Preparations are under way in all three areas. An EU Planning Team has been established by an EU Joint Action and has already been sent to Kosovo to prepare for a possible civil crisis management operation relating to the aspect of the rule of law which I have referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s future role in Kosovo is being planned in conjunction with the European Commission. In this way we will use all the means at our disposal to try and ensure that there is consistency in the way the European Union acts.</p>
<p class="contents">A future international presence in Kosovo will not take the form of a European Union Mission in Kosovo (EUMIK). After a solution has been found and when the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has been gradually disbanded, Kosovo’s own institutions should themselves be responsible for dealing with their affairs. Kosovo itself should assume local ownership and take responsibility. International action should help Kosovo’s own institutions to take full responsibility for Kosovo’s affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is very centrally involved in the implementation of a solution to Kosovo’s status. It will be part of a future international presence and involved in any civil crisis management operation, and it will support efforts to strengthen stability and socio-economic development in Kosovo. The EU’s future role there will also of course require a considerable amount of financing. The Union is presently looking into ways of guaranteeing its involvement, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the common objective of the EU and Kosovo to ensure that Kosovo becomes a dependable partner, developing closer relations with the European Union together with our other neighbouring regions. A key factor here will be the establishment of a democratic, multinational Kosovo, with a good basis for economic development and greater integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, Kosovo is indeed a part of Europe. It is not our back yard, but our front yard, and in the long term, a future EU territory. The European Union has a major responsibility for the future of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">In our joint paper on the EU’s future role in Kosovo, presented in July this year, Javier Solana and I made it clear that the EU will have to take the lead in international presence after the status process has been concluded. Our paper analysed the nature, size and responsibilities of a future international engagement; it also set out the EU’s role after the status settlement and practical means to realise Kosovo’s future European perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Minister Lehtomäki and those MEPs who said that UNMIK will not be replaced by any kind of EUMIK, but rather a leaner, more streamlined international presence or international civilian mission.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint paper, which was endorsed by the Council, supports the work of President Martti Ahtisaari. Achieving a negotiated solution on the Kosovo status issue cannot be taken for granted. The United Nations Status Envoy needs our full support to put forward a comprehensive package that will allow the UN Security Council to decide on the way ahead. The key issue at stake is the protection of minorities, in particular of the Kosovo Serb minority.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the status process will depend to a considerable degree on the ability and willingness of the EU to respond rapidly and concretely in support of an overall solution. The EU needs to give a clear signal that it will stay in Kosovo to play a key role in the implementation of the status settlement and to support its long-term EU perspective through the stabilisation and association process.</p>
<p class="contents">The powers of the future international presence in Kosovo should be limited to overseeing the implementation of the status settlement. All other powers currently exercised by UNMIK should, as a rule, be handed over to Kosovo’s authorities, so that they can govern with full responsibility and full accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">After the status settlement, our objective is to ensure that Kosovo becomes a reliable partner, progressing towards the EU together with the rest of the region. The EU will need to continue supporting Kosovo’s Government in setting up a modern, open, market-oriented and business-friendly environment, based on EU-compatible structural reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as members of the budgetary authority, you know that stabilising Kosovo will come at a cost. I fully agree with Minister Lehtomäki that we will have to make appropriate provisions in the future to be able to cover this cost. The Commission is working with the World Bank and the local authorities to prepare a ‘Kosovo Development Plan and Strategy’ for the medium term. After the status settlement, we will organise a donors’ conference to mobilise the international community’s support for the people of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that it is better to cover the costs of economic and social development than to send more soldiers to the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Dear friends, in that respect, the keys are in your hands, and in those of the Council. As Mr Poettering and other eminent MEPs are present here this morning, I would like to make an important point: the cuts to the Commission’s staff budget proposed by the Council would make this task in Kosovo and the Western Balkans simply impossible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s plan would lead to the disappearance of 1700 posts at the Commission, starting with 170 posts in 2007. Please do not ask the EU and the Commission to do more in ensuring external and internal security – be it in Kosovo, Lebanon or the Canary Islands. If our hands are tied we cannot do as you ask.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">EU policy and aid does not come from heaven: it needs competent staff to carry it out. It also has a cost.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a special plea for the Finnish Presidency. The current United Nations Status Envoy comes from Finland, and I have special responsibility on behalf of the Commission concerning the Western Balkans and Kosovo. I hope the Council and the Presidency do not make our task of working for peace and stability in the Western Balkans and Kosovo impossible. I call on Parliament to correct this budgetary dead-end. I also call on the Presidency to solve this dilemma soon, without unnecessary delay, using the famous Finnish common sense, and not stubbornness this time.</p>

This is the reality we must start out from, and this was also the reality when NATO intervened there. This means that we cannot shirk the fact that we are at the threshold of clarifying the status question and that this clarification will comprise Kosovo’s national independence.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we are currently witnessing a policy in Belgrade which must be a cause for alarm. Serbian politicians know precisely where the status question stands in reality, only they dare not risk admitting this to their own people. In other words, they are attempting to make themselves out to be the victims. They want the international community to basically strip Kosovo bare so as to then be able to make this out to be an act against the Serbian people.</p>
<p class="contents">If one reads the information service of the Serbian Church, it can be established that the relevant bishops there are quite openly writing about the fact that the Serbian Government does not wish to participate in any clarification of the status question, as this would ruin any chance of getting the country back at a favourable moment viewed from the point of view of world history. It is there in writing. This demonstrates the still explosive nature of the whole issue. On the other hand, it demonstrates the pressurised situation in which the minorities in Kosovo find themselves. All this serves to show that a massive presence on the part of the European Union and the international community will be required for a long time yet.</p>
<p class="contents">Two elements are therefore required. On the one hand, speedy clarification of the status question. I certainly agree with Sarah Ludford that the most important element is combating unemployment as far as this fledgling people is concerned, but nobody is willing to invest in Kosovo before the question of status is clarified. We have therefore lost too much time on this issue already. I believe speedy clarification of the status question is a prerequisite for an economic upturn and for eliminating unemployment and, hence, the most serious danger posed by radicalism.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, we need this independence to be conditioned over the medium- and long-term, first and foremost, also as far as minority issues are concerned, and I believe that for our part, our presence must be anticipated for many years to come. Given that, unfortunately, and this must be said unequivocally, UNMIK has failed to carry out its duties in many areas, a great many expectations in Kosovo rest on a European administration. I agree with the Commissioner that we should give people there as much autonomy as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk far too little of, and with, the government and the elected parties there, who often disappear behind the international appointees. On the other hand, however, our presence will be required to safeguard democracy, the rule of law and peace in a strategically important part of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too was a member of the delegation that visited Kosovo and Belgrade in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that that part of Serbia, which Kosovo formally still is, is heading for independence in some form or other. When you talk to the local people, particularly the Kosovar Albanians, it is impossible to draw any other conclusion, and I would add to express my agreement with what Mr Swoboda said on this subject: a form of independence, as they call it themselves, or limited sovereignty is inevitable, whether we like it or not. I think that the facts are plain for everyone to see, so we should get used to the idea, and the Security Council will probably issue a ruling to that effect at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone you talk to in Kosovo is convinced that the international community, NATO in the first instance, of course, will need to remain present for a good number of years. NATO is responsible for military security. It is also expected that the European Union will play an important role, and in that regard a number of key issues present themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as others have already mentioned, there is the protection and the rights of the Serbian minority in Kosovo. An important point in this connection, and I confirm in that respect what has already been said, is that we can expect cooperation and openness from both the Kosovar-Albanians and the Serbians who live in Kosovo, and Belgrade, too, of course has an important role to play. That is also obvious from talking to people. We must also ensure that we continue to bring pressure to bear on Serbia in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add that if we assume that independence as I described it is probably inevitable for Kosovo, we will still need to take the sensitivities of the Serbs and Serbia into consideration in one way or another, and we will also need to see what we can offer Serbia during the course of the year. A more flexible way of awarding visas may play a role there as well, as a token from the European Union to demonstrate that we take that country’s future in Europe seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the international mission will also play an important role in the further economic development and in creating political stability in a possibly independent Kosovo. Economic development, as is also apparent when visiting the area, is, of course, an important priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that all of this should be seen in the light of the European prospect that is actually, when one considers the statements, including those at the Thessaloniki summit a number of years ago, also being offered to Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone knows that the EU will, in future, be playing a bigger role in Kosovo. Once its status has been established, everyone expects us to take over what the UN has been doing, but I agree with what everyone has said in this connection: our role will be different and some tasks will need to be redefined. After all, it is apparent from discussions with people in Kosovo that many are critical of the UN’s role. What they no longer want in any event is an international organisation dictating how they should run their own country. They finally want to be in charge of their region, their country, and we should be prepared for this. A great deal has been said about this, because the UN has made clear its intention of leaving next year. That is a weighty responsibility for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will need to play a role in the development of the police system, but will also need to supervise the development of the judiciary, and what is more, I think it is important to invest heavily in the administrative structures as well as in the economic development to which reference has already been made. The European Union may well want to take over NATO's military role in due course, as it did in Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address my last words to the Commissioner. What struck us and what we wondered about is whether the EU is sufficiently prepared and whether we have enough human resources over there who can shoulder this important and heavy responsibility next year. I should like to add to your appeal to the Finnish Presidency and express the hope that in its pursuit to deploy as many people in a positive way, it will demonstrate Finnish obstinacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time has not provided any solutions, but further complicated the situation instead. The status of Kosovo must be resolved as soon as possible, and within this year. If the talks do not produce results, then the international community must take responsibility for a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see clearly the contours of the solution. We know what we do not want and what we do want. We do not want – because we cannot want – a restoration of the pre-1999 situation. This would simply further escalate the crisis. We do not want Kosovo to be split up, because this could launch a dangerous chain reaction in the region. We do not want Kosovo eventually to join one of the neighbouring countries, because this would not serve the interests of stability either. Kosovo can gradually regain its independence, its full statehood, depending on the degree to which it becomes viable and is able to guarantee human rights, minority rights, and the basic principles of the rule of law. We must help Kosovo in achieving these, and in creating the necessary conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commissioner that the key question is the guarantee of minority rights, especially those of the Serb but also of the Roma minorities. This is of crucial importance for the entire region. One of the starting points for the Balkan crisis was the denial of and disregard for minority rights. We have to find a solution that can ensure broad-ranging autonomy for the Kosovo Serbs and the Roma as well, a solution that is guaranteed by the constitution, and for which the international community takes responsibility and offers guarantees. But Serbia, too, must understand that its concerns about the rights of the Kosovo Serb minority are justified, but that morally they can only be accepted if Serbia in turn guarantees the same rights to minorities living within Serbia, for instance Hungarians and Slovaks living in Voivodina, and Albanians living elsewhere in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commissioner has spoken of a very important matter: the role to be played by the international community, and more specifically by the European Union. It is impossible to imagine creating a viable Kosovo without the active cooperation of the European Union. We must help shape the organs of state government and help develop the economy. Unfortunately, the 2007 budget does not make any provision for this. Once again, words and deeds point in different directions. We talk about wanting to take action, but at the same time the budgetary basis for our actions is lacking. I ask Parliament to support in the current budget debates those proposals – some of which I myself have made – which serve the purpose of providing the necessary resources for bringing about a settlement for Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly disappointed by the proposals put to us today by the Council, which are not particularly practical.</p>
<p class="contents">The litmus test for us has to do with how the European Union manages to cope with the situation in what Commissioner Rehn so aptly called ‘our front garden’. I think it would be true to say that we do not need UNMIK to be replaced by EUMIK, but I do know from personal experience that we do, in very many areas, still need a long process of monitoring by our partners; it is needed at every level of civil administration; it is needed in the police; it is needed in the performance of the justice system’s functions and not least in the building of a democratic civil society, of which hitherto, alas, only the first budding shoots have been visible.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly endorse Commissioner Rehn’s view that we are not – in financial and personnel terms – prepared for the challenge that will face us from next year onwards, and that is why I beg the Council, as a matter of urgency, to listen to us and to appeal to the Member States to make it, perhaps, possible for us to remedy the situation to some degree through bilateral treaties and the supply of specialised personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to adjust to the fact that the countries of Western Europe will, in the near future, be returning to Kosovo a very large number of people currently living within their borders; are we at all prepared for this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What matters in the discussions surrounding this topic is the question as to the conditions which independence must meet and how the Serb, Roma and other minorities will be protected. It is still, in particular, uncertain what is to happen as regards North Point, which wants to return to Serbia, and the new municipalities that may have to be created especially for Serbs.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has bad recollections of the attitude which the European Union adopted between 1989 and 1999. Nobody seemed interested in the peaceful mass opposition under the <span class="italic">aegis </span>of the later President Ibrahim Rugova, during which all Serb state institutions were boycotted and the Albanian-speaking population set up its own government and school system. The objective of the war in 1999 was not to liberate Kosovo, but to dominate Serbia in compliance with other European and American demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Kosovo's independence, which is now inevitable, is not a choice motivated by the pursuit of democracy and equal rights, but the result of an industrial accident. After seven years, it is plain for nearly everyone to see that continued occupation does not solve anything, while handing it back to Serbia would unleash a guerrilla war and enormous floods of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the questioners from four other groups that the European Union is now obliged to play a positive role in a peaceful and correct division of Serbia and the construction of democracy and economy in Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to make three points. My first is that prolonging the negotiations will not bring any change to the fundamental differences between Serbia and Kosovo. One of them is in favour of autonomy, the other is in favour of independence. Therefore I feel very strongly that we should stick to the timetable and time limits envisaged by the contact group and have the issue settled by the end of the Finnish Presidency at the end of 2006. We must stay firm on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wanted to make is that, much like Mr Posselt, I see no option other than independence, with some limitations on Kosovo’s sovereignty, of course. It is important, in order to maintain stability in the region, that there is an international presence and most certainly that the European Union is ready to maintain a significant presence for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I wanted to make is that I think the Western Balkans by and large are a painful reminder of the weaknesses of our common foreign and security policy. I do not think we should repeat the mistakes of the past, and in that sense we must stand very firm in supporting the UN Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, whom I feel is doing an excellent job. I think that the EU’s best foreign policy is usually enlargement policy, and that is why it is very important to keep the prospect of enlargement alive for Kosovo and in the Western Balkans in general.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I would like to make the observation that in 1999 the Finnish Presidency interestingly started with the then President, Martti Ahtisaari, negotiating peace in Kosovo and the Western Balkans. I certainly hope that the Finnish Presidency in 2006 will end with a final settlement on the Kosovo issue and with independence for Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, to be honest, the European Union cannot be efficient and reliable without Community resources in the Balkans and the Council's proposal to reduce Community resources in the 2007 budget is, in my view, an unacceptable proposal which cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">That being so, we surely all know that the European Union has an important role on the 'day after', in the period following the definition of the final regime in Kosovo. However, the European Union also has a very serious role to play today and it has a role in the definition of the final regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We all believe in and support a peaceful, democratic, multiethnic and European Kosovo. However, we must show equal support for Serbia within the framework of the European strategy, as defined at the Thessaloniki Council. However, we believe that we should not get carried away by restricting timetables for defining the final regime. Any thoughts of unilaterally imposing a solution on Kosovo may prove to be counter-productive. The European Union should not repeat the mistakes it made in the 1990s. It must formulate a common stand.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would like to refer to the question of Serbia, which particularly concerns me, because we have heard here from honourable Members with different views. There can be no peaceful solution for Kosovo, there can be no peace, stability and security in the Balkans unless there is democracy in Serbia within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the Council's decision to suspend negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is, I think, an important political mistake for the European Union. Negotiations must start at once and, of course, we must see as they progress the implementation of the preconditions to cooperation with the International Criminal Court. The Serbian people must not be punished for the traumatic past under the autocratic Milosevic regime. Today we must see some sort of prospects for Serbia because, otherwise, we shall strengthen extreme nationalistic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I close with the situation regarding minority rights in Kosovo. All the recent reports by the UN Secretary General, the UN Human Rights Committee and non-governmental organisations describe a drastic situation for minorities, especially the Serbian minority in Kosovo. We are talking about respecting Resolution 1244 passed in 1999. We are talking about applying standards. We must, at long last, move in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The appointment of the Special Envoy for Kosovo is the signal Belgrade and the international public need to help them recognise the only possible future for Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to see that Mr Poettering is also with us today, as a difficult task will face us during his presidency of the European Parliament. For this reason, it seems to me that our discussion should focus on what our Parliament can do to facilitate the future path of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first task should be to ensure clearer communication with the Serbian Parliament and to help Serbian politicians understand that Kosovo has already been independent for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must have direct cooperation with the body which will build democracy in Kosovo, the Kosovo Assembly. The Serbian minority has a weak presence in the Assembly and is still manipulated to a great degree by politicians in Belgrade. In addition, there are divisions in the Roma minority – it is divided into Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians and they have dissonant voices. Here in Parliament, we can make a great contribution in this respect, and the Council can make an even greater contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that at present many Member States of the European Union do not recognise UNMIK passports. The citizens of Kosovo arrive in the European Union holding UNMIK passports and we turn them away because we do not respect their documents. Commissioner Frattini and the Council should do more to minimise the number of such incidents in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The third difficulty we are facing is the disrespect shown to the different cultures in Kosovo and in this context the Serbian Orthodox Church is playing a very negative role. As long as the Serbian Orthodox Church refuses to look to the future, we will have great difficulty convincing the Serbian community in Kosovo to integrate itself into the democratic institutions of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The key question, however, is that of status. We have offered the Western Balkans a European future. But we are well aware that only states can accede to the European Union. A Kosovo that is not a state cannot take part in that process. While we fail to resolve the status of Kosovo and ensure that it becomes a state in its own right, we will be lying to ourselves and to the public as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude my speech by calling on us all, as Members of the European Parliament, to make our voices heard and ensure that the question of status is resolved now and not delayed until next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House explicitly stated, and I quote: ‘that this Agency should not be phased out according to a previously determined schedule, but that its dismantlement should depend on economic and political pre-conditions and developments.</p>

Why, then, is the Serb minority in Kosovo under threat today? That, too, has to do with this situation, and with the one-sided approach that the EU Member States took back then.</p>
<p class="contents">A second consideration is that people are being deported to Kosovo, even though many people find the situation there utterly intolerable. It is intended that there should be more deportations, and the Commission needs to make it quite clear that this is not acceptable. Joachim Rücker has been put in charge of UNMIK. I do not know whether that is a good idea in view of the fact that he was, formerly, primarily responsible for privatisations there, which did the people of Kosovo no good at all.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to know is how, in practical terms, the Commission envisages the future status of Kosovo. What I have heard so far I have found highly unsatisfactory.

<p class="contents">It is, however, conditional on our finding ways of protecting the minorities – and by that I mean all of them – in a credible manner, for it has become apparent during our numerous visits there that people are still afraid, and events over recent years have shown that those fears are still justified. That is something we have to take into account, and that is why the European Union still needs to be involved there, firstly in building up the police force – something that is very important indeed – and, secondly, in building up the legal system and the administration, for I share Commissioner Rehn’s view that this is where resources need to be made available, but Kosovo’s economic development will be dependent most of all on peace, stability and functioning institutions, and it is to these that our efforts must be particularly devoted.</p>
<p class="contents">This will also involve resolving the issue of which military forces are to perform the function of keeping Kosovo secure once it is independent, and I could well imagine a similar solution being arrived at to that found for Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the KFOR being replaced by European armed services. When we visited the country, I put this question to the Prime Minister, and it was evident from the answer he gave that nobody had given the matter any thought until then.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater involvement by the European Union in this area would also be in line with our security policy – or with the security policy of which I am an advocate. What is important is that we, at this stage in the development of our security policy, should prioritise our efforts in our geographical neighbourhood, and the stabilisation of the Balkans continues to be our most important task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issue relates to an area of Europe inhabited by numerous nationalities and ethnic groups, communities divided by country, religion, history and the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia in the nineteen-nineties. Kosovo is the Gordian knot of European policy in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations mission is now preparing for withdrawal from Kosovo. This means that the European Union must be prepared to assume its role there in 2007. The first challenge for the European Union in this new situation will be the as yet undefined status of Kosovo. The recent UN-hosted talks in Vienna on 24 July did not lead to any breakthrough. Serbia, which formally owns Kosovo, did not agree to independence for the province. The Albanian authorities of Kosovo are not prepared to accept even the broadest autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">In a peculiar form of psychological war, the Serbian authorities have, in recent days, accused the UN special envoy on the future status of Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari of lacking impartiality in the negotiations. On the other hand, the political advisor to the Albanian premier Koço Danaj stated that by 2013, all Albanians living in the Balkans should unite and integrate within a natural Albania.</p>
<p class="contents">These events of this summer, which overshadow the Middle East conflict, constitute a major problem which the institutions of the European Union need to tackle over the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Another challenge is organising the future EU mission in Kosovo. This problem relates to funding, structure, staffing and above all the EU’s political strategy in the Western Balkans. No other country or international organisation will replace the European Union in its historic role of guaranteeing democracy, peace and social welfare, based on respect for diversity, in this part of the continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A multiethnic community has not been established. During seven years of international administration, the different ethnic groups have concentrated themselves in their own areas. One main reason for why standards have not been achieved, despite the massive input that there has been, is that Kosovo is one of the main havens for organised crime in Europe. International human trafficking and the trade in territory and weapons are rampant in Kosovo. Nothing was done about this back in 1999, when the problem was noticed: we had to wait until 2005. Now the global actors involved in the programme, however, have much too little time and too few staff for their many areas of responsibility. We therefore need to make a greater effort to address this problem of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that now that the EU is also focusing its attention on Lebanon, we should think about just how aware we are of what has happened in Kosovo and whether there might be something to learn from it for the operation in Lebanon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Your pronouncements on the protection of human rights are full of hypocrisy. The objectives of this war are visible today. It was to break up Yugoslavia and share it out and you succeeded in doing this by imposing foreign occupation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo and by creating protectorates.</p>

The European Union does not have a conception in this matter, but in reality, it is simply stumbling along led by the events.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be very important to adopt, at last, a consistent concept with regard to a solution for Kosovo. The solution should be a dignified one, one that does not punish the Serbs while openly rewarding the Albanians. Such a solution would lack dignity and would destabilise the region, that is to say South Eastern Europe, which includes Greece, Hungary, and the candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania. We cannot stabilise Kosovo at the expense of destabilising the region. At the moment everyone is talking about the minority question, but there is no encouraging conception on offer. This is all the more interesting because Mr Ahtisaari and Mr Olli Rehn are both Finns – and Finland has an exemplary minority system. I cannot imagine a situation that would reassure the Kosovo Serbs as long as the northern part does not have territorial autonomy and the south does not enjoy a system of personal autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole process of decentralisation has not been thought through; self-government gives no guarantees in this regard. As regards compensation for Serbia, membership in the EU, as we know very well, is not a particularly attractive prospect given the current EU fatigue. We must take this into account as well, just as we must reflect on the fact that Milosevic had stripped Kosovo as well as Voivodina of their autonomy. Everyone is talking about Kosovo’s independence, but no one mentions the minorities in Voivodina or the situation of the Muslims of Sandjak. I fear that we are moving towards a bad settlement if we fail to work out a sound, dignified concept on behalf of the minorities.

<p class="contents">I think that you, and I am addressing the Minister when saying this, noticed that most of the questions raised, and remarks made, on this platform spring from genuine concern about the fact that the EU ... I am not doubting your sincerity or your awareness of what needs to be done, but I am nevertheless concerned – will be unable to complete all the difficult tasks it will be given within the time available, which is three to six months, not years.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, as many Members have said, that failure on the part of the EU is not an option, for that would be detrimental to both the region and the EU, and that is something we cannot afford. If you say, and the Commissioner confirms, that the EU’s task is to monitor and transfer competences, then I – together, I believe, with most Members of this House – will sanction this, but it is more difficult than it looks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a sort of new role, where we, on the one hand, need to let go of some things and, on the other hand, need to keep control in a divided society, where not all problems will turn out to have been resolved following independence. At the moment, everyone in Kosovo still thinks that independence will solve everything. That will not be case for economic problems, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards a military presence, I hope with all my heart that all due attention for Lebanon and Congo will not result in people thinking that things will work out in Kosovo and that we can handle things here with fewer troops. That will not be the case in the first few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I can do no other than support the Commissioner in his request to the Council not to ask the Commission for any more and at the same time, to make fewer funds and people available. It cannot be that you and we ask the Commission to play a crucial role in Kosovo with fewer people.</p>
<p class="contents">I really do hope that the Finnish President, the Finnish Commissioner and the Finnish negotiator reach this conclusion, and in order to promote this, I, on behalf of the whole of Parliament, am quite willing to visit, at my own expense, a place where most Fins get their valuable insights, namely the sauna. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has been mentioned so many times in this debate, an unconditional pre-requirement for a lasting solution is to be able to resolve the issue regarding minorities, and that is something of a multigenerational problem. The presence of NATO’s KFOR troops is important for the time being, but now and in the future we will need to pay special heed to the importance of the close relationship between military and civil action. Apart from anything else, the European Union is preparing for a huge civil crisis management operation in Kosovo. It will be on a scale never seen before and its main focus will be on the police and the rule of law. We will need a good number of experts from the Member States of the European Union in order to carry out this operation, and it will be our challenge to find such a large number of experts.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the Planning Team is as yet unfinished, but the intention is for their report to be in the hands of the Council’s working group at the end of the month. Preparations are thus making headway in many different ways and in many different sectors, but we can surely improve their steady flow.</p>
<p class="contents">Several times here there have also been references to the Council’s draft budget for next year, especially with respect to how it will make the use of staff resources more effective. The Presidency is very committed to finding a solution that will satisfy all parties, but it will also naturally have to listen to the views of the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, my opinion is that the situation is not as gloomy as we have been given to believe, especially in the Commissioner’s very emotive speech. In the Council’s view, enlargement is clearly a priority area and, accordingly, we are not proposing staff cuts there. In fact, this maligned budget for next year increases administrative expenditure by 3.4%. Admittedly, the cuts sought for the period 2007-2013 are very ambitious, but as the Commission is at the same time planning increases for enlargement, there will in any case be more staff in the Commission in 2013 than in 2007, even though we will be monitoring this ambitious trend. So there will be more staff in 2013 than next year anyway. We are trying to find, and we are committed to finding, solutions which will ensure that there are adequate numbers of staff to deal with important matters. This is obvious, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for some light relief and as the Finnish sauna was mentioned here, I will say that, however well the internal coordination of the Finnish Presidency proceeds, I shall not be joining Mr Ahtisaari or Mr Rehn in the sauna. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to thank you all for a very substantive and responsible debate, which clearly shows that this House fully supports the prospects for European integration of the Western Balkans and Kosovo. It is very important now – as was underlined by several speakers – to firmly support the efforts to conclude the status process within the envisaged timetable. We will not gain anything from prolonging the process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that peace and appropriate institutions lay the foundation for better economic conditions and job creation, which Kosovo desperately needs. An unemployment rate of 40% to 50% unfortunately produces a very fertile breeding ground for crime and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to give the Kosovars the tools to help themselves. Legal certainty and a well-functioning business environment are necessary preconditions for making economic progress in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is another precondition: whatever the precise outcome of the status settlement, it must include treaty-making powers for Kosovo. As Mr Kacin said, treaty-making powers are needed so that we can negotiate with Kosovo and make it part of the stabilisation and association process. Likewise, Kosovo needs treaty-making powers in order to make deals and contracts with the international financial institutions, which is another precondition for making economic progress and improving the employment situation there.</p>
<p class="contents">As to Serbia, it is certainly a – if not <span class="italic">the</span> – key country for the stability of the Western Balkans. The best service that Serbia can render the Kosovo Serbs is to participate very constructively in the talks to ensure that minorities are truly protected, once the outcome of the Kosovo status settlement emerges.</p>
<p class="contents">Serbia has firm and tangible prospects of joining Europe. For our part, we are willing to resume the negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement even on the very same day as Serbia achieves full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which should lead to the arrest and transfer of Radko Mladic. It is in Serbia’s hands and Serbia can make this European aspiration a reality and release the tremendous economic, cultural and intellectual potential that exists in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to correct one misunderstanding, which has not occurred here but often arises, namely the belief that the Council and Commission are competing in the Western Balkans. That is not the case at all. The Council and Commission are not competing, but cooperating fully and deeply for stability and democracy in the Western Balkans. We work very well in tandem with Mr Solana, as do our services. For instance, in relation to the rule of law, we need that cooperation because the rule of law – that is, the provisional training of judges and police – is a joint competence of the Council, the Member States and the Commission. Therefore, in order to use that joint competence sensibly, we need cooperation. That is what we have with Mr Solana and his people.</p>
<p class="contents">As to Mr Wiersma’s question on resources, apart from Kosovo there are other burning issues, such as Lebanon. How successfully the resource question is resolved will now be up to you, as the budgetary authority. I am very grateful to the Finnish Presidency for its readiness to play a very constructive role in this very difficult matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree that the stabilisation of the Western Balkans is the first and foremost priority of the evolving European security and defence policy. Indeed, as Mr Lagendijk said, we cannot afford to fail in this test case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
