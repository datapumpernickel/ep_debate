Before the previous agreement came to an end, I made contact with Morocco with a view to concluding a new fisheries agreement. However, that was roundly rejected by Morocco for many months. Concrete talks of a new agreement only became possible following a meeting with King Mohammed VI in Casablanca in October last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, seven political rounds of talks and thirteen technical rounds of talks have taken place. From the very beginning, the European Union was at pains to show the greatest possible flexibility so as to comply with Moroccan wishes and interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Following my visit to Rabat in February this year, I had to conclude that the gulf between the two positions could not be bridged, in particular, because of the compensation demands by Morocco for the catch facilities that were being offered. As regards fishing facilities, especially under the technical framework conditions of the fisheries sector, in other words, in which zones, at what times, and in what vessels, fishing could take place in Morocco, there were, in some cases, major differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Following my return in February, I immediately apprised the Council of the situation so as to sound out alternatives with the Fisheries Ministers. The Council requested me to make a final attempt to reach an agreement on the basis of the existing negotiation mandate. On that basis, on 26 March, I met Minister Chbaatou in Brussels. Unfortunately, however, this meeting too was a total failure.</p>
<p class="contents">During the course of the negotiations, the Commission put forward a number of proposals to promote the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector, for example, to provide resources to develop the port infrastructure and services sector in Morocco, to promote and develop coastal fisheries, to promote training and research and to develop aquaculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have accepted very extensive landing obligations in Moroccan ports, which would have meant a radical change in the traditional fishing activities of many Spanish and Portuguese fishermen, but would also have contributed to the development of the Moroccan sector. Moreover, we agreed to increase the proportion of Moroccan crewmembers on board vessels so as to improve the employment situation and the level of training in the Moroccan fishing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we would have accepted further extensive reductions in catches in order to maintain resources in Moroccan waters. For example, in the first year we would have accepted a drastic reduction in the presence of the European Union in Moroccan waters compared with under the previous agreement. The following two years would have seen a phasing out of cephalopod and shrimp fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also have accepted new technical conditions which would have been less advantageous for the Community fleet and would have reduced fishing costs. Despite this raft of concessions and despite the progress the Moroccan side has made following the negotiations, the following basic differences of opinion remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the fishing conditions proposed by Morocco would have meant that the economic benefit for our fishermen would have been lost as we would have had to fish with considerably fewer ships in fewer fishing zones, and we would have had to accept longer periods in which fishing was banned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union is of the view that financial compensation must be reasonably proportionate to the offered catch facilities. Not only is this our general political guideline, it is also stated in the negotiation mandate of October 1999. In any case, we evaluated the financial part not only in purely economic terms; we also took political considerations into account, such as the need to have good political relations with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">In return for our proposal for a fisheries agreement we offered Morocco compensation of EUR 70 million for the first year, 60 million for the second year and 40 million for the third year.</p>
<p class="contents">This offer was very advantageous to Morocco for a number of reasons. Firstly, we calculated our financial compensation package on the basis of the fishing facilities in the final year of the previous agreement and not on the basis of the average of the last agreement. That alone means a price advantage of 15% for Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in our calculation we made no distinction between types of fish, even though we would have accepted greater reductions in the case of more expensive and, for the European Union, more interesting types of fish such as cephalopods and shrimp. This also gives a price advantage for Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we did not take the landing obligations in Morocco into account in our calculation. Fourthly, in the end I increased the compensation resulting from the calculation by 20% in order to demonstrate that we understood Morocco’s concerns about the development of its own sector.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of all that, at the last meeting with the Moroccan Fisheries Minister, Mr Chbaatou, I once again made it clear that our offer, which I have described above, was a more than fair price for the catch facility. I also told him that we were once again prepared to fork out EUR 5 million a year to prove our good intention for the conclusion of an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Moroccan Minister stressed that Morocco had no room for manoeuvre. Given the stance taken by Morocco, I do not see any possibility of concluding an agreement on the basis of our mandate. That is the message I will be taking to the Fisheries Council on 25 April. But the question of what will happen to the affected ship owners and fishermen, who have now been condemned to idleness for more than a year, is becoming increasingly pressing.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, since 1 December 1999, we have made compensation payments to ship owners and fishermen out of the Fisheries Fund. We have made all our preparations in line with the conclusions of the Nice Summit. There is currently a Commission proposal with Parliament and also with the Council, whereby compensation payments will be extended to 30 June of this year. We have also proposed leaving the 4% limit out of consideration for compensation payments. We estimate that, so far, a total of approximately EUR 80 million have been paid out to affected fishermen and ship owners, 20 million of which were raised by the Member States themselves. This equates to a Community share of EUR 60 million, some 51 million of which have gone to Spain and 9 million to Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear, however, additional measures and funds are necessary to secure the future of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing sectors. In my view, we must act in three key areas. Firstly, we should try to find alternative fishing facilities in other third countries, at least to a certain extent. Secondly, we must help to develop alternative employment opportunities for the affected populations, perhaps in aquaculture, or in tourism, or in the service sector, or wherever an opportunity arises.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as we do in other cases, we must also support the breaking up of vessels for which no alternative use can be found. To this end we will exploit all the room for negotiation at the disposal of the Commission. However, we will have to approach the budgetary authority in this connection regarding the 2002 budget. The next step must be for us to report back to the Fisheries Council. Finally, I would like to stress that I very much regret the unbending stance adopted by Morocco, which has made an agreement which is advantageous to both sides impossible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Others left you a veritable time bomb preventing you from reaching another agreement: the promise and the agreement in the previous one not to renew it.</p>
<p class="contents">We all knew that it was difficult for you. Even so, after seventeen months, thirteen technical meetings, your personal involvement on seven occasions and that of the President of the Commission himself on one occasion, which is unprecedented, Morocco was persuaded to sit down and negotiate. It was little more than that, however. Morocco never wanted the agreement and showed it by imposing its intransigence and its unfair and unacceptable conditions, which the sector itself rejected as uneconomical and impossible to take on.</p>
<p class="contents">We always said that we would prefer no agreement to a bad agreement; and this is what Morocco is proposing, despite the generous, reasonable offers from the European Union, which are beneficial to both parties. Morocco is within its rights but, having got to this point, should we carry on?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that if Morocco wants an agreement with the European Union, it knows perfectly well what it has to offer. However, if it has not been reached in seventeen months, I think it unlikely that it will be reached now.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Fischler, you should take note of this and inform the College of Commissioners of Morocco’s intransigence in co-operating with the European Union. We will be watching the development of bilateral relations between the European Union and Morocco very carefully, both in political terms, as you mentioned, and in economic, financial and trade terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is Morocco rejecting more than EUR 200 million in three years, investment from European ship owners, the possible creation of joint ventures to develop its sector, the wealth that the catches could generate in its ports? Why is it rejecting a gradual reduction of the European fleet over three years, while in private it authorises private Asian companies to use its fishing grounds? This is quite legitimate, but can the European Union not guarantee better than anyone that its resources will be rationally preserved and fished responsibly? Who in Morocco is really going to benefit from the lack of an agreement? These are the key points.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress, Mr Fischler, that you should take careful note of all this but, following this upset with Morocco, I think that we must look to the future. The situation is of course difficult, serious, and unprecedented. It is not impossible to solve, however. I therefore ask everyone for generosity and solidarity, employers and fishermen, unions and political parties. And we need to ask the European Union to make a special effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nice European Council, incidentally at the request of the Spanish Government and José María Aznar, agreed – another unprecedented thing – to support the demands and, if they failed, the negotiations and, if these did not succeed either, asked the Commission for a specific action programme, as set out in No 59 of the Nice conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Mr Fischler, for your commitment and understanding. Fishing in the European Union asks for it now more than ever. I ask for your personal political commitment to get involved in the pending fishing negotiations with third countries, Senegal and Mauritania first of all, and to open up new negotiations and explore new fishing grounds. This is the future for redeploying the fleet, which is the priority aim; and at the same time, with the funds not used for Morocco, I ask you to support a broad social programme for fishermen and for the most affected areas, with alternative economic projects to restart their economies. Your experience with the CAP should be useful to us so that, for the first time, programmes of this type can be adopted in fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that Morocco dealt a hard blow to the European fisheries sector and therefore to the European Union. Now, however, we have to adopt a realistic, constructive and responsible attitude. It has the support of Parliament, which will actively defend the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Those affected in my country feel that they have been deceived by their political leaders, who have always denied the problems in the negotiations, and the fact that there were deadlines for concluding them. This is not the case for you, Mr Fischler. How are they are going to believe in relocation to other fishing grounds if we all know that increasing the fishing effort would put resources at risk or would make the activity unprofitable?</p>
<p class="contents">Why did the negotiations fail? Despite your efforts as Commissioner, which I recognise, a common strategy was lacking, not on your part, but on the part of the Commission, and above all, the Council. You reminded me of the responsibility of ministers, whom you said were informed at all times and had taken part in the most recent rounds of negotiations. Although the formal responsibility for negotiating lies with the Commission, the governments can and should prepare the way for agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that what the European Union was offering was not bad; the attitude of the Moroccan Government was not that of a loyal partner. We think, however, that the framework for negotiation was the association agreement with Morocco. Maybe eleven months ago it was not right to mix fisheries and agriculture, but we have to remember that Morocco is still benefiting from agricultural concessions obtained in parallel with the fishery negotiations in 1992 and 1995, and that the European Union is the main importer of Moroccan fisheries, agricultural and industrial products.</p>
<p class="contents">You said to me at the time that no good would come of such a mix and that it was better to trust our partners. We have trusted them and we have seen that on the same day that the negotiations broke down, Morocco was signing a fishing co-operation agreement with Japan, and while it was giving us the reasons of preserving resources, it was granting licences to Community and other vessels and fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector and the public want to know what measures the Commission is going to take following the collapse of these negotiations. In your speech you talked again about another mandate. Is another mandate possible? Do you think that we would change anything with another mandate? Do you think that the negotiations have finished for good, or is it possible to restart them with a new mandate? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are calling for fair agreements which will be of mutual benefit, in line with the whole range of economic, social, political and human relations established in 1995, defining the neighbourly relationship between our countries and the Maghreb State. They are calling for an agreement on appropriate terms, which has been repeatedly approved by this Parliament and they do not accept the negotiations undertaken without faith or conviction by the Commission over the last 16 months to be valid or fitting. Nor do they accept the failure that has been announced.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reason, I cannot accept the dismantling of the European fleet in Canary-Saharan waters and nor is it feasible to relocate or transfer them safely to other fishing banks where, furthermore, it would compete with other European boats. Nor can we leave 4400 fishermen redundant and the coastal communities that live mainly from fishing are not in a position to find new ways of earning a living overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not accept that their future lies in early retirement for the older people or in emigration for the younger ones. The communities I represent demand that the Commission returns to the negotiating table to conclude the fishing agreement with Morocco. They demand that the Member States, specifically the Spanish Government, abandon their passive or complicit attitude and bring into play the political and economic resources necessary to conclude new negotiations. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a European problem that is affecting European citizens and which is undermining the very credibility of the Union’s institutions and their ability to address a critical aspect of international relations for which they have responsibility, such as fisheries. There is no reason to consider the agreement to be in conflict with preserving Morocco’s fish stocks. I am convinced that this will benefit the collective interests of the Moroccan people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1995 my group maintained that the fisheries agreement with Morocco should be included as part of the text of the European association agreement with Morocco. The reason was obvious: between partners facilities need to be established in both directions. Morocco needs access to the Community market, and the Community fisheries sector needs access to fishing grounds that it has traditionally worked in.</p>
<p class="contents">Morocco’s reasons cannot be found in preservation of resources. Due to a lack of time, I am not going to give examples. The association agreement took an unambiguous stand on Community concessions to Morocco and today we find ourselves without a fisheries agreement. The consequences of the lack of an agreement are the loss of 4 000 direct jobs and 20 000 on land.</p>
<p class="contents">There may be a solution in seeking other fishing grounds for part of the fleet, but it is very difficult for the small-scale and inshore fleets. If Morocco is intending to act as a partner, it should open up its waters to the Community small-scale fleet immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, among your measures, you yourself talked about increasing the European Union’s room for manoeuvre. Soon the association agreement will have to be revised and Morocco will surely once again make demands for trade concessions that will even affect the same Community regions that are currently being seriously affected by the lack of a fisheries agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that the European Union finds this room for manoeuvre when the time comes to revise the association agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been, to a certain extent, surprised, after the last debate that we held in this House, in which we were informed that an agreement was possible, at the sudden news that the whole thing has collapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the complexity of the problem and I am shocked at the intransigence of Morocco’s position. Nevertheless, I wish to ask the following questions: with regard to the difference in financial compensation between the European Union’s proposal and Morocco’s and according to the information I have, it has been more than compensated for by the sum of Community aid allocated to Morocco under various headings and also by the trade compensations or advantages it has gained under other agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether the Commission is able to produce an overall strategy with Morocco. I understand a country deciding to sell its resources to the highest bidder – it has political freedom to do so – but I also consider that any country that does so will have less need for international cooperation aid. I should also like to remind you, on this subject, of what the resolution adopted in this Parliament in 1999 said: ever-closer cooperation between the European Union and Morocco cannot exclude existing relations in the field of fisheries, I should also like to know what support measures for converting the fishing fleet are being put in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand Morocco’s wishing to place a high value on its fish stocks but the lives of communities and of their economic relationships are founded on compromise. The European Union has made concessions to Morocco, by opening up its markets to many of that country’s products, including agricultural produce, and by opening up its doors to several million Moroccan citizens who have adopted the European Union as their homeland. This is why it is so difficult to understand this absence of any reciprocal attitude on the part of Morocco. I hope that the European Union will draw conclusions from this episode, both for its future cooperation with Morocco and for its own common fisheries policy. My second observation is that the effort made by the Commission and especially by Commissioner Fischler, have stood in stark contrast with the passive approach of the Council and of the various presidencies of the European Union, including that of my own country. Can this be because the agreement directly served the interests of only two countries? Or can it be that the governments of those two countries were not sufficiently forceful to protect their own interests? These are questions that require answers. My third observation is that we need to lay the ground for the future, but this cannot be done with financial compensation alone, when fisherman are standing idle and when we are compensated for ships to be scrapped. The failure of these negotiations must give the European Union food for thought with regard to the future of its common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I see three main routes here. Firstly there is the need to create new political and financial instruments for facilitating new methods of cooperation and business partnership with countries that are rich in fishing resources. Secondly, the next agreements with third countries must demonstrate serious political commitment. Thirdly, there is a need for a genuine revolution in the management of fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Morocco’s refusal is a mystery to me. Is it possible to find out the real reasons for this refusal? If we can discover the reasons, why can we then not consider a possible new negotiating mandate? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in a political assembly. We are not market traders; we are politicians. This is the viewpoint we should adopt when considering the failure of this agreement with Morocco. It seems that Morocco has behaved arrogantly towards Europe and the Union must really not forget this. I personally shall not. It is also worth asking, however, and in fact it has been asked, whether the Council may have adopted a somewhat aloof or passive attitude. This question remains to be answered. We might also ask whether the fact that this issue only affects two of the Union’s countries may have had some influence. This is undoubtedly true, and the Union has lost credibility in the eyes of the Portuguese people – and of the Spanish people too, I presume – and this is the main political concern that I wish to highlight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our position has always been that we hoped an agreement would be reached, but with one extremely important proviso, namely that the agreement had to be mutually acceptable and beneficial to both sides. It turns out that such an agreement is not possible. That is unfortunate, but we must respect the right of Morocco to determine how to exploit its resources in its own waters. It has the right to self-determination and it has the right to look for the best deal possible for itself. In its Green Paper, the Commission sets very great store by the legitimate aspirations of developing states to develop their fishing industry, and the Greens very much agree with this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue in the Green Paper is the commitment of the European Community to the precautionary principle and the conservation of stocks. The April 2000 report by the Scientific, Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries reviews the status of the stocks off Morocco, as well as other countries in west Africa. They do not paint a very optimistic picture for anchovy, cuttlefish, demersal fish, black hake and sardinella. The report says that there is no information on the status of these stocks. The report also notes that octopus and hake fisheries are over-exploited and reductions in effort are needed. It was also pointed out that there was a huge ignorance of the amount of fishing actually being conducted by EU vessels and this is a really important and very worrying point. There was also the lack of guarantee for the protection of small-scale coastal fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are pleased that compensation and funds for restructuring of fleets has been made available, but we also have to look at the overall fisheries policy within the European Union. We cannot keep searching around the world for more and more places to transfer our over-capacity to. We have to be realistic and realise that we must solve the problem from within. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The question I would like to put is whether it is still possible to begin the negotiation of a new fisheries agreement with Morocco, with acceptable conditions. The Moroccan proposals on reformulating the previous agreement were unacceptable and some people in the sector even wondered whether a bad agreement was really better than no agreement. In any event, as a result, Portugal now has around 30 boats and over 600 fishermen without any visible future. In addition to extending aid, it is becoming crucial that the European Union guarantees compensation support for the fleet, to the fishermen and the areas affected, by supporting a programme of converting the boats that fished in Moroccan waters, guaranteeing the relocation to other fishing grounds covered by Community fisheries agreements and, of course, by considering changing the common fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To begin with, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the start of a new agreement, or the start of negotiations for a new agreement, was always going to be difficult because no agreement had been reached in the previous agreement that there would be a successor agreement. That naturally meant that, for months, the Moroccan side put forward the argument that, so to speak, there was an agreement that no new agreement would be concluded at all and that the Commission and the negotiators of the previous agreement had promised this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must be clear about one thing. I do not believe we are sending out the right signal, if we say that there must be an agreement at all costs. I have drawn your attention to the fact that the Moroccan side has said that it is not prepared to grant us more or better fishing facilities than they did last time or to back away from its financial demands.</p>
<p class="contents">If we accept, however, the financial demands for the fishing facilities that are being offered, then we will be creating a precedent for all the other third country agreements that we have. We will drive up the cost for all these other agreements to an extent that would simply be irresponsible. Naturally, the Moroccan side is at liberty to send us an improved proposal. I told the Minister as much. It would be a good thing, however, if that were to happen before the Council of Fisheries Ministers is held. Given the current circumstances, I do not believe it makes any sense. You must bear one thing in mind, however. If we conclude this agreement as it stands, there will be no economic benefit for the fishermen of Spain and Portugal, which means we will have to restructure the fleet from scratch. That, however, would take place under conditions whereby very few resources would be available to us because most would be bound up for the next three years in a bad agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to stress just how important it is that we set about supporting the sector in question as well as we can. We are all called upon to do that: the Commission, the budgetary authorities, Parliament and the Council.</p>
