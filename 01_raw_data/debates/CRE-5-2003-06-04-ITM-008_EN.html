<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Madam President, we first need to question the reason why an own-initiative report was proposed, for we have noticed that this method is spreading to many areas. In Lisbon, it was recommended to apply this method to the information society, research and innovation, company policy, education and training, social inclusion, economic policy, migration policy, etc. However, we have noticed that Parliament's input and control are very restricted. There is a great lack of transparency in the decision-making process and in the reasons why some elements of the method are, or are not, being used.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has decided to carry out a thorough analysis of the way in which things are being done, which has resulted in a report containing the suggestion that, if the Commission wished to start an open method of coordination, this should require the permission not only of the Council but also of Parliament. Moreover, the Commission must indicate the components of the method it wants to use. These components are common targets, common indicators, guidelines, common indicators, a summary report, national reports and recommendations. These are the conventional components that are used either wholly or in part. Parliament must give an opinion on the guidelines, the summary report and the recommendations, and the social partners must be consulted on matters relating to social policy and labour. Finally, the Commission is also asked to draw up a study on the method's effectiveness and on the linking of money from the Structural Funds with the recommendations that have been put to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To organise this in a structured manner and to prevent the open method of coordination from being developed in one area or another without Parliament's knowledge, input or codecision, it is necessary to enshrine the general mechanism and Parliament's codecision right in the constitution. The question is, however, whether we will succeed in doing so? Judging from the texts drawn up to date by the Convention's Presidency, I notice that we have met with partial success. For example, it is stipulated that the open method of coordination is applied to economic policy and to employment policy and that – this is an improvement on the current texts – it can be applied to social policy. It is also stipulated that Parliament must be consulted or informed of the guidelines and recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, this is a step, albeit a small one, in the right direction. It is in any case more than what was deemed possible at one stage on the basis of the discussions in the Convention. However, it remains a drop in the ocean. Parliamentary powers and possibilities for control remain restricted. Those who are opposed to this method and labour under the illusion that if we do not mention it in the Convention, it will not be used, are, of course, mistaken. Nobody can stop this method from going ahead. A simple Council decision without any input from Parliament therefore leads to the method being used in one area or another.</p>
<p class="contents">I will illustrate this with migration policy. If the ministers involved in migration decide to apply the method – also because, for example, they are unable to lay down legislation in this area – the open method of coordination will be applied to migration policy. Our problem is not so much the fact that it is being applied, but the fact that Parliament has no, or very little, involvement in it. This is why we said in the committee: fine, let us then, in the Convention, adopt an article clearly stating that it is obviously not prohibited to apply the open method of coordination but if it is, that it should be done in consultation with Parliament. This was, in fact, the meaning of the article.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thus seen that some progress has been made in the Convention, that we have achieved what we wanted to some extent. However, it is imperfect and incomplete compared to what it should be. I would reiterate my two key comments: I fear that, on the one hand, the open method of coordination could result in no legislation being laid down and, on the other, that some of the national powers may possibly be removed if the open method of coordination is applied. There is, in fact, only one solution in both cases, which is: to allow Parliament the right of codecision. It is precisely the opposition to the open method of coordination that has led to this not being achieved satisfactorily. I can only say that this is regrettable. I think that we have drawn up a sound report and I would thank all the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for they have made a marvellous contribution to this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Iivari (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, an ambitious objective was set in Lisbon in spring 2000 that Europe should develop into the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy in 10 years’ time. There were a number of concrete aims associated with the conclusions reached at the summit relating to education, especially training in information technology. In addition to IT training, the Lisbon process emphasises the importance of lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">We on the European Parliament’s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are pleased that education is now higher up on the Union agenda. We need jointly set objectives and indicators and joint action. The new jobs that are being created mainly demand special skills. Mastery of IT is nowadays required in most professions. It is also one of today’s areas of civic education, which, if neglected, makes life difficult for people and exposes them to exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Education is not only a key to inclusion on the part of our citizens, but also a basic prerequisite for our societies to succeed. It is good that the EU Education Ministers have been able to agree together on concrete aims for education and training and that the Bologna and Bruges processes, aimed at the recognition of qualifications, are under way.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Committee on Culture, in addition to education and lifelong learning, open coordination is also needed in other areas that come under the job description of the Committee, that is, in policy on youth, the media, culture and sport. Increased cooperation will boost the functionality of the Internal Market as well as our citizens’ prosperity and degree of inclusion. That way we will create the right conditions for social unity, steady development and belief in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of open coordination in the field of education has, despite its worthwhile objectives, nevertheless meant problems. It has increased the power of civil servants and pushed aside both the European Parliament and national parliaments in the way it acquires information and exerts influence. This cannot continue.</p>
<p class="contents">In the resolution it is drafting, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport is calling for a clearer and greater role for the European Parliament. That is necessary for the process to have democratic authority. The committee is also stressing that the open coordination method must not be allowed to become like other legislative procedures but at the same time a closed procedure which will undermine the legislative aims laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution the committee invites the Council and the Commission to hold talks with the European Parliament in order to establish an interinstitutional agreement on the open coordination method. The agreement should contain rules on the choice of policy areas to be included in the open coordination method and a process for applying them in a way that is consistent. The European Parliament must be able to participate in decision-making fully and on equal terms. In the view of the committee thinks the interinstitutional agreement should contain rules concerning the European Parliament’s participation in drawing up aims and indicators. At the same time we must agree on access to documents, participation in meetings, monitoring progress and the dissemination of information. What is most important, however, is that open coordination should become a Community process. It should be decided on by the European Convention, now on the home straight, and at a future Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Running parallel with the aims of the Committee on Culture is the report by Mrs Smet on open coordination in the field of employment and social affairs, which is being discussed today. It is good that two of Parliament’s committees are playing an active role in the creation of a parliamentary dimension for open coordination, something we obviously need in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Smet on the exceptional analysis in her report of the open coordination procedure and on the topicality of the debate, given that, as we know, this issue is also being discussed in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two essential categories of issues. Those which concern the democratic legalisation of the procedure and those which concern its efficiency. As far as democratic legalisation of the procedure is concerned, our experience to date is that only in the field of employment is there a legal basis in the Treaty. It is therefore an open procedure, which is applied with very specific rules defined in the Treaty and Parliament plays a role in this procedure. It could be much stronger, but it has a role and its opinion is necessary and respected. However, as Mrs Smet quite rightly said, no legal basis has been used for the other applications of the open coordination procedure. They have been based on agreements by the Council of Ministers. Consequently, the role of Parliament is still reduced, even though I must say that both on the issue of combating poverty – where we have an application of the procedure – and on the application of the procedure to pensions, an important effort has been made for us to cooperate with, consult and inform Parliament. In future, this procedure will certainly play an important role. We see that it is beginning to appear in numerous individual policies. The problems of the participation of Parliament, and hence its democratic legalisation, have not only their European but also their national dimension. In the evaluation we carried out, we saw that, in numerous countries, the national parliaments not only do not participate but also are hardly even told of the targets, commitments and method of implementation of the joint action plans. I believe, therefore, that with the discussion taking place in the Convention, it is very important for there to be an article covering the open cooperation procedure, determining the role of Parliament and, as the Commission has proposed, for there to be a special reference to the application of this procedure to social protection, where there are various problems, given that many of these competences in the social sector are national.</p>
<p class="contents">Now as far as the area of efficiency is concerned, I would agree with the report that a national and European evaluation of the results plays a very important role in year-on-year improvements. Our first experience is the evaluation of the European strategy, of the application of the procedure in the area of employment carried out in 2002, while we shall have the evaluation of the application in the field of pensions in 2006. A second element relating to efficiency is if there will be financing of the application of the procedure. We must say here that, so far, there is experience concerning financing of the strategy for employment by the social fund and financing of specific guidelines, mainly those directed at human resources, and we believe that, for the area of enlargement in particular, for the new countries which will be called on to participate in the implementation of the procedure, but with reduced resources, the social fund can play a very important part.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to refer to the observation in the report that mainstreaming the gender dimension in all Community policies can also play a very important role in the application of the open coordination procedure, given that this is where individual targets which might concern equality of the two sexes are always identified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I think you are also representing Mrs Reding here. Before the report was even planned by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we had already made an enquiry to this effect, but then – for whatever reason – it was delayed for months.</p>
<p class="contents">So at last we are getting together to debate this issue, and together we should try to make the best of it. We realise that these coordination procedures exist, and as a European politician I would actually be pleased if some people – people in positions of responsibility, politicians – would coordinate their activities. These people, however, are precisely the people who are usually trying to deny us our authority. They coordinate their activities in areas where they do not want to grant us any responsibility at all: in the field of culture and education. They are suddenly coordinating in these areas without being accountable to us. This strikes us as rather suspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that we are being treated like NGOs in this area. We are not NGOs, however, but elected representatives, and we ought to know what exactly is being negotiated in our name behind the scenes. Moreover, it is not only the Council that is content with this; the Commission too, unfortunately, is very pleased about it. You see, in this way it has managed to oust an awkward player from the field. The Council and the Commission have joined forces here – which could even be a good thing, but I would like to use Machiavelli’s words here and say, ‘Not every end justifies the means’. For this reason, I believe that we have to be very cautious in this case, and that we should expect to be included.</p>
<p class="contents">It has now transpired that what has developed is an intergovernmental method. And once something like this has got under way, is it very difficult to stop it again. Although we now know that the Convention, which has little to say about coordination, declared its opposition to the open variety of it, we also know that all national presidents should coordinate with each other, where the need arises, even in instances not necessarily covered by the Treaty. We really need to be careful, however, not to let ourselves be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of culture and education, I can actually say that it is really hypocritical that we are not allowed to be active in precisely those areas where we would be happy to be involved. Then, in a roundabout fashion, in the context of this open method of coordination, we have the same things that we would be happy to do, but we are not included. This is simply unacceptable, and we must fight against it. We should recall that an intergovernmental method may not be introduced indirectly. We should see to it – including by means of today’s debate – that this existing intergovernmental method, in other words open coordination, is converted into a Community method. If heads of governments or individual ministers recognise something to be right and necessary and important, then this too should be converted to the Community method, so that we, as elected representatives of our peoples, can participate. I ask that this be taken into account and thank all those who were involved.</p>

I am here to illustrate an oral question tabled by Mr Rocard on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, who is unable to be here this evening to illustrate it himself.</p>
<p class="contents">The oral question refers to points which have already been illustrated by both Mrs Iivari and Mrs Pack, in other words the fact that we in the Committee on Culture have often realised that many of the measures debated subsequently by the Council are developed according to a coordination method from which we are excluded. We have been faced with measures which have already been adopted, on which we were only able to express an opinion after the event, despite the coordination method, which it would be extremely useful actually to apply to Parliament too.</p>
<p class="contents">With this question, we are asking the Commission, firstly, whether it can provide any guarantee that the measures the Council adopts in future using the coordination method will be notified to Parliament and the Parliamentary committees in good time for them to be able to examine them and express opinions, and secondly, to specify – despite the fact that, in this situation, everything seems to depend on the Convention now – whether it has any proposals to make regarding the wider application of the open coordination method with a view to avoiding Parliament being excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The Members who have spoken before me have already covered all these points fully. We would now like to raise them once again in this oral question as specific questions to which we await a response from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recently attended a large pensions conference where open coordination was warmly welcomed in the area of pensions. There are a number of issues, for example in the areas of pensions, employment, asylum, immigration – to which some reference has already been made – which require a solution at European level, and where, in most cases, a legal basis is lacking. The open method of coordination was a godsend.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, there are also people – including some in my group – who are opposed to the open method of coordination. They are mainly against it on account of the problem cited by Mrs Smet, namely the lack of democratic legitimacy. A number of speakers have echoed this. If we pursue the open method of coordination – of which I am in favour, as also, in fact, is my group – a number of points should be addressed. These have to do with democratic legitimacy. Both the national parliaments and the European Parliament will need to be involved. It is unacceptable for Parliament to be consulted only if it is considered opportune to do so. Parliament will need to be consulted systematically.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Smet's report also dealt with another aspect that I should like to bring to your attention. The big players in this field are, in fact, people in closed, high-level committees who work out virtually every detail and who then submit their ideas to the Council. I think that this does not benefit public involvement. Citizens feel represented by their Members of Parliament. They want to be able to talk to Members of Parliament about things that are happening or arrangements that are being made and over which, at a given time, they lose any sense of control. So, no matter how sound the system could be in itself, this democratic control will need to be in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that has already been mentioned is the issue of indicators. If we want to compare the facts in a number of areas of policy, the facts will need to be comparable. Very clear indicators will therefore need to be put in place which can be measured exactly if a comparison is to be drawn between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To cut a long story short, I welcome Mrs Smet's report being discussed at this time. In my opinion, we should ask the Commission to come to an agreement with the Member States to the effect that, if this open method of coordination is maintained in future, at least a number of basic conditions will have to be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very well disposed towards the open coordination method. I am, however, also a little concerned that it is often regarded as a sort of soft legislation and poor man’s alternative to ordinary legislation, or as something that should only be used in emergencies. I think in precisely the opposite terms. I think that legislation must be applied when there are no other options and when authority, strength and discipline are genuinely needed. A number of public tasks can, however, successfully be carried out other than by using laws, discipline, compulsion and the whip hand. The open coordination method is a modern form of project administration. It is used for the public sector when it is aiming for change, development and ongoing renewal and when it needs to be able to change its methods of working to keep pace with accumulating experience.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perhaps no coincidence that the open coordination method has grown out of those societies that are run as market economies, in which the public sector must be as flexible and efficient as the market at its best. I therefore find it pathetic to hear representatives of the right-of-centre parties say that they do not want this flexible and efficient market tool but, instead, an old-fashioned bureaucratic, controlling and law-governed form of government in the public sector. That is something I find odd.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the open coordination method should be written into the constitution so that – and I think this is important – it is generally accepted. I am, however, extremely concerned that it is to be incorporated with prescriptions as to how it is to operate, which methods it is to use and which processes it is to comprise etc. That is what happens with a traditional legal text but, in this case, it would be a question of putting strict parameters around a method that ought to be adaptable, flexible and versatile and putting a straightjacket on it. It would then be nothing like so effective. I support the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also myself tabled an amendment that, to my great surprise, went and got voted down by the committee. I am now tabling it again. It is about the fact that the open coordination method is also a cooperation, and not only a coordination, method. It cannot be based upon sanctions and penalties. In common with other free social relations, it must be based upon trust and respect. We cannot therefore make use of naming and shaming and worst practices<span class="italic">.</span> What we need are best practices<span class="italic">.</span> That is where the focus must be. Otherwise, this method and its possibilities will be spoiled. It is different from the legislation method, and it would therefore be quite wrong if, inspired by ancient legal tradition, there was considered to be a need for disciplining, penalising and singling out those who are disobedient. This method is quite different.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to see this method promoted. That is how it has come to be used in a number of European societies. It is not so widespread everywhere, but it is usual in the Scandinavian countries I myself come from, where it plays an extremely progressive role. It is also more prevalent in the Anglo-Saxon countries. It is not, however, to be found in certain other countries which have much more traditional administration systems. I believe that we must move towards this open, democratic and modern cooperation method. I particularly wish to emphasise the word ‘democratic’ – democratic being what the method in fact is, albeit in a way not involving legal and judicial control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we have heard, the open method of coordination is now being used in a wide variety of areas. At times it appears to be addictive, as that list gets longer and longer. There is an obvious need for a common approach and to edge very cautiously towards agreement, for example in the field of immigration and its close links to employment and social inclusion. However, as Members have said, this is certainly not a publicly-owned process and at times it has a very questionable democratic legitimacy, because it can appear to be almost a creeping backdoor assumption of competences by the European Union, and not sufficiently open and in the public domain.</p>
<p class="contents">There are interesting imbalances within it. I thoroughly concur with the Commissioner: when the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been on delegations to various Member States and met its partner committees or European Affairs Committees in the national parliaments and asked them about their involvement in the national action plans – on employment or social inclusion, for example – it has received blank looks, because they have never heard of it: it is not something in which their government has involved them. One British minister admitted that the trade unions and the Confederation of British Industry in the UK had more influence on the national action plans on employment than the British Parliament, which had never ever discussed them – although that situation is now changing, since the new Committee on Works and Pensions came into being – what an exciting name that is.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly need a framework for the open method of coordination which is clear, is democratically controlled by this Parliament, national parliaments and sub-national parliaments – which in some Member States are those with responsibility for particular issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We get that clarity by the process currently being established, so that people have an idea of what to expect and where the points of intervention might then be for relevant NGOs, etc. The Constitution is probably the best place for this information in terms of public access and awareness. Our group is not convinced that an interinstitutional agreement is sufficiently known to and understood by the public.</p>
<p class="contents">There are issues about the timescales of consultation which our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has certainly suffered from. Therefore, we need to build into this method time for real consultation, not just here in Parliament but also for NGOs to exercise their own internal democracy in making their contributions as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Picking up from what some of the other Members have said, each of us recognises the benefits of the open method of coordination. As we have recognised and experienced ourselves, it can lead to better opportunities for the creation of frameworks in which actions can be taken, without the strict rigidity of legislation or regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The other institutions should recognise and realise that Parliament is very responsible in arriving at its opinion when it is given time to be consulted. One of the most important issues we need to stress here tonight is that this Parliament has the ability, the innovation and indeed the skill to meet deadlines. However, merely throwing it to Parliament when there is no time available to put a reasoned and responsible viewpoint forward is a bigger insult to Parliament than not consulting it at all.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider the question of the guidelines which we discussed this week, we see the difficulties and problems that were created, simply because we were not given the information in time. We should not be seen as an enemy of the Council and the Commission, nor as a subservient body, but as a willing and equal partner to them.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the question of whether an institutional agreement or an article in a proposed treaty or Constitution is the best place for this, I personally have not made up my mind on that point. However, I am inclined to favour an interinstitutional agreement as the best way forward, probably because it offers flexibility for us to alter and change in the future. But for us to agree to that, and for our representatives in the Convention to go along that line would require some faith from our point of view that we would be given more powers and consulted on a wider basis by the Commission and the Council when they look at these issues in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, the question of consultation with national parliaments is one that we continually stress here in Parliament. That is because we recognise that parliaments, by their very nature, are the true democratic representatives of the peoples of the Member States of the European Union. Parliaments therefore have a right to be consulted and not to be bypassed over issues that impact directly on the lives of people within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that national parliaments be part of this method and, indeed, if we look at the draft Constitution which we have before us, there is a requirement with regard to legislation being transmitted to national parliaments. It is quite possible also that in an open method of coordination, the national parliaments would also have transmitted to them the proposals which are coming before this Parliament and other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I will be supporting Mrs Smet's report on the basis that the procedure does not seek to harmonise policies or converge policies, but facilitates compatibility, facilitates flexibility and encourages dissemination of best practices and exchanges of ideas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it to be important for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, based on the experience that we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have gathered, the rapporteur has drawn up a very practical assessment of what has happened in the different open methods of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is also important because she offers solutions. In her intervention a moment ago, she herself indicated the dangers which the method entails. Mrs Jensen and Mr Schmid have tabled amendments which put these dangers into extra sharp focus. If we were to follow their solutions, particularly those of Mr Schmid, it would mean we would be maintaining bureaucratic mills full of civil servants talking among themselves and organising cosy conferences, where something may occasionally get done, but where no real results will ever be achieved – and if they were, they would remain behind closed doors. The good thing about the open coordination process as we know it now is that the facts and figures will now at least be on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the process started with a decision taken by Heads of State and Government, who decided at a given time to produce honest figures on employment. This was an extremely important achievement at the time. Nobody produced honest figures with regard to employment. Those figures are important. The question is then, of course, to what extent the common targets can be further pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">There are risks. The risks are two-pronged, as Mrs Smet mentioned earlier. There are thus the bureaucratic mills, on the one hand, where nothing happens and which are, from the citizens' point of view, a waste of time. On the other hand, there is the risk that coordination will be taken to extremes. This is mainly a fear in Germany, which is understandable, if you know the situation in Germany, where certain powers are delegated to the federal states. Culture and education fall within the remit of the federal states in Germany. Member States will then start pooling this power. Then what? <span class="italic">Numerus clausi </span>will then be agreed upon as if Germany were one country. This is, of course, not federalism, but exactly the opposite. It is, therefore, understandable that German MEPs, in particular, have problems and are concerned that this method, via the backdoor, would lead to a horrible kind of harmonisation which involves neither this Parliament nor the citizens. This is very understandable.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is particularly pleasing, in my view, that this report offers a solution. The solution is that this Parliament is to give its authorisation not for applying the method but <span class="italic">whether </span>a method is put in place in a certain area. I am certain that, if we take the area of culture as an example, something like this can only achieved if Parliament plays its part in such coordination. This is of key importance and this is why this authorisation is so important. This is why I am, at present, strongly opposed to Mrs Jensen's proposal, which would prevent us from making any progress. For four years now, we have been trying to conclude an interinstitutional agreement, without success, as the Council says that it is not provided for in the Treaty. A change is therefore to be made to the Treaty. Mrs Smet has submitted a request to this effect and this is why I believe that we should all give our unqualified support to the solution presented in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The open coordination method has become the general rule on the basis of our experience of the Luxembourg process and of the possibilities opened up by Articles 126 and 128 of the Treaty; it is a timely process, because this generalisation has also allowed many issues to be raised in Parliament – in relation to insufficiencies and gaps which have repeatedly been condemned and which should be resolved – and because the Convention is about to produce a constitutional Treaty, offering Parliament a great opportunity to make its voice heard.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a timely project and a highly topical initiative, because the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference are going to offer us the opportunity to overcome these difficulties, which, as other Members have pointed out, relate to certain fundamental visible deficiencies, the lack of openness – despite being called an open method – and also the inefficient coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have an excellent opportunity and Mrs Smet’s initiative offers us an excellent reason to continue working. Secondly, Mrs Smet has done great work, a great report, into which she has incorporated the best ideas emerging from the debates we have held in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We socialist Members of course feel very comfortable with this report; although you and I, Mrs Smet, are very far apart physically and ideologically, we are in fact very close on this issue since you are truly dealing with and resolving our group's main concerns. You establish a balance between all the institutions, you spell out the role of the Commission and give Parliament a central role, thereby overcoming the significant democratic deficit we have observed. You open up channels for transparency, in order to incorporate all the players – national and regional parliaments, NGOs, social actors – which we value highly. You call for an institutionalisation of the Treaty – which we believe to be essential – you define the scope in order to prevent this method from replacing or encroaching on areas in which there are Community instruments of a legislative nature – I believe you do this very well – and, finally, you guarantee that assessment work is carried out so that the method may be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We socialist Members, Madam President, are therefore going to give this report our fullest support and we hope that it will assist in European integration and help to provide European problems with a European solution, even going somewhat further than mere intergovernmentalism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had a few problems at home, trying to explain this open coordination to the Austrian public. We do not yet have a tradition of this in the way the Scandinavian countries do, for example. The first question people asked me at home was ‘And what role does Parliament play in it?’ I had to explain to them everything I have heard here this evening, and everything we hear over and over again in the committees. ‘Of course’, the citizens said, ‘not just out of respect for you as a Member of Parliament, and not only as a right that a Member of Parliament must assert for herself and on behalf of the population: we demand democratic legitimisation of this wonderful opportunity!’</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as to whether open coordination is indeed such a wonderful opportunity, as I have said, I have no experience to date; I am not yet a fan. Neither am I sure that conversion to the Community method is really the recipe for solving matters. I believe that we must look more closely at the details, which means that the three institutions must sit down at the table. This does not mean an act of mercy towards the European Parliament, but open, fair negotiations among the three institutions. It is all about the details: how is Parliament to be involved? How are we to have access to documents? What rules should we put in place? If we really do make good progress in this regard, I may yet become a fan of open coordination. In the field of culture, media, sport, education and youth, it would also be a possible step towards a kind of European cultural policy, but please do not misunderstand: I am in no way referring to harmonisation of national cultural policy, but rather to effective coordination of common policies in order to achieve common goals together. Because, as we all know, we are simply not strong enough on our own – particularly in these sensitive areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason for my request, and I cannot repeat it often enough. I believe that Parliament came close to speaking with one voice here. This is what is expected of Europe in many areas. Let the Commission consider us a partner and coordinate with us – openly! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Best practice should be disseminated, and quantitative and qualitative indicators laid down; European directives should be implemented in national and regional policy, while of course observing the principle of subsidiarity, and put into practice in national action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, so good. But if one begins to get the impression that it is about levelling down, or if it comes to setting social policy standards without a proper legal basis for doing so, or if there is perhaps an attempt to dictate to Member States and to sideline national regulations, then the OCM is not acceptable in its present form. It is certainly possible and sensible to strengthen cooperation among the Member States in policy areas where the European Union has only limited power. It must, however, be geared towards improving the exchange of information and experience.</p>
<p class="contents">When applying the OCM, meanwhile, the competence boundaries set out in the Treaties must be taken into consideration. Many fellow Members have already voiced their criticism on a number of serious issues. This instrument can only be complementary, and by no means represents an alternative, to important legislative measures. At the same time, the European Parliament may not be ignored any more than national parliaments. On this point too, I agree with the previous speakers. We in the European Parliament often see ourselves being put under pressure of time. For example, when the European Commission consults us on the annual Guidelines on the European Employment Strategy, but sends us the reports so late – I had to go through this myself at the beginning of the year – that thorough, professional consultation suffers as a result. The OCM is formulated by national experts, who are doubtless top-notch, but they develop the content of the OCM without legitimisation by Parliament. The European Parliament is the only Community institution capable of exercising control over these political processes, including the OCM.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the demand of Mrs Smet that national parliaments too should be given due influence, and we must not forget the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Regional Policy, and the social partners, who must likewise be consulted. What is more, they must be consulted from the outset. Despite all the important points made in this report, despite the planned request to the Commission to first of all draw up a study, and despite the call for a broad-ranging debate on the effectiveness of the OCM, I still have serious reservations about a method that takes this form and is based on these principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, the reason for deciding on these areas is absolutely identical to that which applies to the two that I have just mentioned. This was also covered by the willingness expressed by the Lisbon Council to extend open coordination to other areas. Since this is the case, it would be desirable also to apply the policy of open coordination, to which the European Parliament is fully committed, to the areas of culture, youth, the media and sport. There are <span class="italic">de facto</span> practices that, incidentally, could legitimise this course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way in which Parliament will be able to deliver an opinion, on a solid basis and on time, thereby usefully contributing to finding better solutions, with greater democratic legitimacy, before the Council considers any relevant initiative, to ensure that national and regional policies can also implement European policy guidelines. Nor can we understand how Parliament can merely be a passive spectator in this and in other matters. If this procedure has already proved to be relevant and necessary in a Union of 15 Member States, it will be all the more relevant and necessary in a Union of 25. European policies that create European added value must also be discussed by the direct representatives of the European peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need an interinstitutional agreement that provides for Parliamentary intervention in order to ensure that not only rules but also policies are established coherently, based on objectives and having indicators, entailing access to documentation and participation in steering meetings and in meetings for studying the progress made, providing information on the reports and best practices, in a process that develops the open method of coordination as the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should, therefore, be able to act in a timely and relevant manner before the Council takes its decisions. The Commission should formulate proposals to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in the method adopted in Lisbon. It is in this context that the oral question tabled by Mr Rocard, Chairman of the Committee on Culture, becomes most relevant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, because had it not been for this initiative on the part of Mrs Smet, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport would probably not be in the situation at all where our enquiry is being debated at least in this Parliament. Mrs Pack pointed out that the Committee on Culture has been waiting for months for our questions – just the questions – relating to applying coordination in the field of culture, education, youth, the media and sport to be dealt with here at all. This makes it abundantly clear that something is not right with the system. The debate this evening is an opportunity to lay the issues on the table, and I hope that we will also come to some conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">The method of open coordination can certainly make an important contribution to helping us meet the public’s expectations, and to improve coordination in important areas of policy where we do not want harmonisation. In my experience, however, this process will not gain public approval if it is not a democratic process. And to date it has not been democratic; it has been intergovernmental. This is why it is up to us to do something about it. If we believe efficiency to be contradictory to democracy, or flexibility or transparency contradictory to the responsible involvement of Parliament, then this – in my opinion – is indeed a sad reflection on our own shortcomings. This is why I hope that this debate and report can help to ensure that we finish our homework within a few weeks after the conclusion of the Convention, and that this House – and especially the two committees concerned – can respond to these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective of the so-called open method of coordination is to have a legislative effect in various areas of policy, and there is no proper legal basis for this in the EU Treaty. This means that the Council and the Commission can create competences at the European level at will without having the legitimacy to do so. This does nothing for legal clarity or for legal truth, and it certainly does nothing to gain public acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">I also know, however, that coordination in various areas is already possible, definitely necessary and perfectly sensible. We can always learn from others. But turning this legal, voluntary coordination into a set of quasi-legislative instruments and conferring on it, moreover, the power to apply sanctions, makes European actions completely incomprehensible. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, of which I too am a member, knows exactly how sensitive and varied are the traditions in individual Member States; the fact that it is precisely this committee that is approving this presumptuous acquisition of competences by the back door, as it were, in an own-initiative report, is, I think, much to be regretted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always promoted a clear delimitation of competences for Europe and respect for competences in the nations and regions, which demand these things, and open coordination amounts to a slap in the face for them. Furthermore, I could not celebrate the involvement of Parliament in this method as a great achievement, because it would not actually change anything about it. Indeed, I believe it would make matters even worse, because it would give a veneer of democracy to this method, which in no way corresponds to the principles of the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
