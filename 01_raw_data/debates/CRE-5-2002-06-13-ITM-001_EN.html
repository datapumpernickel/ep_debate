<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hedkvist Petersen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, every year, 42 000 people die on the EU’s roads. This is a very big political issue for people within the EU. In the White Paper on Transport, the Commission writes that we must halve the number of people killed by 2010. In that case, we must be active, not passive. We must take all kinds of measures at all levels. Everyone must help, especially industry, because we know that this is what consumers are demanding. The case for safety is self-evident.</p>
<p class="contents">How, then, must cars be designed so that they cause as little harm as possible to unprotected road users? The proposal for a voluntary agreement which we have obtained from the Commission and which the automobile industry has negotiated is inadequate. It is amazing that the Commission has seen fit to accept it in its current form. It is not always clear how it is to be implemented, and the EEVC tests are not taken seriously, in spite of the fact that they have been developed over a period of more than 22 years.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned here with survival on the roads and life in our society, and we must therefore be careful. The subject has been difficult to deal with, and I wish to thank all the shadow rapporteurs in the committee for a very successful piece of work which has demanded a great deal from us all. There have been many different opinions on the subject, many lobbyists and many points of view from the committees. It is now important to proceed on the basis of road safety and consumer demands.</p>
<p class="contents">We had three alternative responses to the Commission. The first was to accept the voluntary agreement. The second was to recommend a detailed directive, stating exactly how cars are to be designed. The third was to recommend a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee does not believe that the voluntary agreement is sufficient. It is not provide enough certainty and does not offer scope for any grassroots parliamentary supervision of how the automobile industry assumes its responsibility. It is insufficiently binding, and its processes insufficiently transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee therefore proposes a framework directive, as mentioned by the Commission too in its communication. It means that we in the political assemblies establish the objectives, whereupon experts oversee the implementation under the supervision, and with the participation, of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework directive we are now proposing and calling for has a number of components. The objective is that, by 2010, all models of car should meet the requirements of the four EEVC documents. This process must be initiated now. The EEVC is the institution that has made the most progress in researching road safety throughout the world, especially in the area of pedestrian protection. We are, however, able to envisage other methods of testing which provide at least the same level of protection for pedestrians. There must of course be effective tests that influence car design.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want the process to be assessed regularly, with annual reports sent to the European Parliament. In that way, we shall be part of the process and be able to check that the goals we have set are really being met. We want the Member States, through their type approval authorities, to help assess how the framework directive is being implemented. We also believe that the EEVC has made the most progress when it comes to methods of testing and that it can make further progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the demands made by the committee. We await confirmation from the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen that the latter will be tabling a proposal for a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we should like to have gone still further in certain sections by, for example, placing significantly sharper emphasis upon the exclusive merits of the tests developed by the EEVC and by setting a clear subsidiary objective with a view to obtaining a straight line of development in pedestrian protection between now and 2010. The Group of the Party of European Socialists also wants the Commission to table its framework directive immediately, and preferably before the end of the year. That is important if the Commission wants to show that it is serious about the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, this is a very controversial matter. We have now reached a compromise and shall therefore support this in order to obtain as much backing as possible for the demand for a framework directive as the best solution where the issue of road safety is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will therefore only support the committee’s proposal in the report, and I would urge other MEPs to do the same. We approve the compromise which, for the sake of road users, I am pleased that we were able to negotiate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaking as the rapporteur for my own committee – the Legal Affairs Committee – I can say that we were in favour of the Commission's proposal for a voluntary agreement and felt that the overall package achieved what Mrs Hedkvist Petersen wanted. It will save lives earlier than any other proposal. It also takes very seriously the need to improve design standards for cars. But – and this is a crucial issue she did not mention – it allows the industry, and everyone else involved, to tackle the issue on a broad front because we know that simply making the front end of cars more resilient in the event of a crash is a second option. We want to avoid collisions with vulnerable road users altogether through accident avoidance measures within the vehicle itself. Remember that anti-lock braking systems fitted as standard will be part of this package. We also have to look at road design, user education and many other things. This has to be a concerted effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to talk about design standards because this is important. I am an automotive engineer by background; I have seen the test laboratories; I have talked to the engineers about the problems of achieving more pedestrian-friendly cars. This is not a simple issue. Some groups have been guilty of gross over-simplification about the problems involved. Mrs Hedkvist Petersen implied that the industry was not taking it very seriously, but I know from my visits that it is.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving forward, she is right to say that we must look at a broad range of test measures. I call upon the industry this morning to join with the Commission to put together a team of all the best talents in engineering and design, together with all other interested persons, to come up with the best tests possible, given today's technology and not the 1998 technology on which the current EEVC tests are based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware that, when problems crop up, the simplest way to deal with them is by means of incentives and assistance. The Sixth Framework Programme for Research, which we have adopted, contains many incentives to achieve improvements by the use of scientific methods. My second point is that we have standards, whether national or European, which give pride of place to the principle of mutual recognition and thereby make competition in the market possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The next stage, which is new and in fact sensational, is a voluntary commitment, whereby very strong pressure is brought to bear by both parties. An amicable settlement has to be reached, and additional criteria can be introduced in order to actually enforce such settlements. On the one hand, we have a simple contract, as originally planned, which of course involves risks and obligations for all parties to the contract and creates a number of problems, and on the other, we have the very slimline directive we are working on now, which we will use to do nothing more than draw up a timetable and lay down methods of supervision and assessment so that Parliament and the Commission can keep an eye on the progress made.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like, and I believe that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would like it as well, is for this directive to amount to no more than one page. That would serve as an example of how we are constantly up to date in laying down principles and demonstrating how our work in lawmaking can also be slimline and forward-looking. Thank you, Commissioner; you have done an excellent piece of work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission has had the courage to present self-regulatory measures in order to get industry and governments to commit to greater pedestrian safety, which is also necessary, in fact. I come from a culture where self-regulation is very common. I am very much in favour of it, because self-regulation invariably entails the latest state of the art technology on which industry too can agree. Moreover, it can be a very quick process. The legislative process is always much more protracted. There is always one condition, namely that these self-regulatory agreements are monitored effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">If you ask me for my personal opinion – and this is also what Mrs Petersen said –I would have been satisfied with sound self-regulatory measures, and legislation would not have been by definition necessary. However, this is what Parliament has decided and I will have to reconcile myself to this decision. A skeletal directive is what we will end up with, one that leaves open plenty of opportunities to repeatedly lay down further regulations according to the latest state of the art technology. I am such a staunch supporter of self-regulation because in my view, a number of processes in the European Commission are too slow.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I have stated in the recommendation by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that something needs to be done about whiplash, although this is not at all related to this issue, but rather to a safety issue which also robs a huge number of people of their health. Moreover, it incurs a high level of costs in our society. Not for nothing have I included this as my final point. I know, after all, that far too little is happening in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also asked questions in writing, upon which I receive the response that something will indeed be done. We have already discussed it in the context of the Fourth Framework Programme. Why does the handling of all these issues that are related to preventing accidents and preventing extra expenses in this area take up so much time? This has been going on since the Fourth Action Programme; we are meanwhile looking at the Sixth Research and Development Action Programme. Surely, something else should replace it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commissioner not only to enter into consultation with industry very promptly in order to do something about this pedestrian protection, possibly by means of self-regulation, I would also ask him to tackle these other problems too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Koch (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for years, and in vain, Parliament has been calling on the Commission to produce proposals for binding legal instruments that would compel the automobile industry to reduce the risk of injury to pedestrians in the event of a crash by means of passive safety measures on the front of motor vehicles. Instead of doing so, the Commission presented a communication on an agreement negotiated with the automobile industry, which, however, incorporates not only passive safety measures, but active ones as well. As substantial parts of it can become effective at once, it is very much to be considered as a useful means of realising the policy objective of reducing by 50% the annual total of those killed or gravely injured in accidents by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I expect all the parties concerned to regard the agreement thus negotiated as a contract by which they must abide. No doubt the Commission is able to confirm to us that it is not the case that – as we have been informed – motor manufacturers are already questioning their obligations on one point. The motion for a resolution before us now will motivate the automobile industry to step up its research into passive and active safety for pedestrians, rather than – as individual lobbyists fear – contributing to the crippling of development. The protection of pedestrians is at last becoming a matter of public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The two-phase improvement of pedestrian safety envisaged is acceptably close to the aim of the White Paper on European Transport Policy. Phase A, which commences at once and will end in 2005, will already contain essential measures, including, among others, the equipping of all new vehicles with ABS anti-skid equipment with effect from 2003, the immediate installation of daytime running lights on new vehicles, the requirement that new vehicles should cease to be supplied with bullbars, and the carrying out of modified tests by the European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC) to examine impacts on pedestrians.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst reference is made to the importance of the EEVC's research and development programme, we call for the quality of the four systematic tests in phase B to be further developed. In order to truly guarantee phase B's legal certainty, we call on the Commission to draft a framework directive, primarily to stipulate a clear timeframe for further measures and details of the monitoring process. We furthermore expect such a directive to prescribe coherent and practicable test methods, dealing with more aspects than do the EEVC's testing areas and take the interplay of the tested objects into account. The result of this is a challenge across the board to the automobile industry's capacity for innovation and research.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers are coming of age and will increasingly value the cars of the future in terms of their safety for their occupants and for pedestrians, and will choose which to buy on that basis. Safety is being used more and more in marketing and sales, which brings advantages for consumers and advances in road safety. I recommend the adoption of the text as voted on by the Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has to do, on the one hand, with their subject matter – traffic safety, which is an important issue to the European public. It also, of course, has to do with this report's role in the overall discussion - of which there has been a great deal - of the documents on European democratic governments and<span class="italic"> </span>better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most grateful to the rapporteur for taking an actual example to show how things could go and what roles are played by Parliament, the Commission and the interest groups – which some would call ‘lobbies’ – by industry and consumer protection groups, and so on. Surely it is right for MEPs to be suspicious of agreements such as these, as we are never quite certain how far the industry will go, and to what extent it will keep to what it has supposedly committed itself to? It is also understandable that industry is sometimes suspicious of MEPs, whose wisdom and expertise in these different fields is called into question. So I believe it to be right that we should try to go down the road of compromise – the way pointed, thankfully, by the rapporteur – not an empty compromise but one that really shows the way things can go.</p>
<p class="contents">Being members of this House, we are naturally torn between the obligations and tasks imposed on us by a parliamentary democracy and the knowledge that there are many details we really cannot get to grips with unless we are experts in a specific area. We are torn between trust and mistrust of industry's knowledge and also its willingness to be decisive in making things happen that may only be burdens to it and do not do anything for industry's profits. We are also torn between our responsibility in matters of principle and, at the end of the day, the responsibility many people see us as having for many of the details. I therefore think it right to call for a framework directive in this case in particular. I am all in favour of it being slimline, and we will certainly not argue about whether it should take up one page or one-and-a-half.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rübig was so fulsome in his praise of the Commissioner that I do not know how to add to it, but I find it perfectly understandable that the Commissioner should use a commitment to perhaps get us MEPs to take the middle way that he, as a democrat, believes to be the right one, and to get this House to pass a framework directive. I will conclude by emphasising that this is all the more the case as we are dealing here with the area of traffic safety, and, whilst there may well be a technical issue at the bottom of it, it is a technical issue that has an effect on human lives. Any technical issue capable of making people's lives better or saving them is, after all, one on which we MEPs should at least lay down some principles. I support the rapporteur's motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found it interesting to take part as a shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Liberals. We succeeded in establishing fruitful cooperation with the other groups, and particularly the rapporteur, and reached a balanced report with sufficient support from Parliament and in which, therefore, a very clear signal is being given to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Under normal circumstances, my line of approach would have been to try to persuade the various parties in the field to reach a covenant, a workable cooperation, with agreements and obligations, but in this case, it is right and proper, in my view, that Parliament should take the responsibility to fight the corner of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget the past when we draft the report. I therefore think it important to apply past efforts as a basis for a framework directive. It would be excellent if we asked the Commissioner if he thought he would be able to draft a proposal for a framework directive in the shorter term after all. Indeed, the framework directive has 22 years of research behind it. Also, there have been so many dialogues between the partners in society, between the automobile industry and the consumer organisations in the past. It would, in itself, be a nice gesture to us to indicate that you on your part are also committed to a straightforward implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, every person who becomes a victim of a road accident is one too many. This effort is therefore a welcome one. The report has managed to strike the right balance in the descriptions of test methods and such like, and I am therefore pleased that the point of departure for the ETSC method is sound, but there should be scope for possible developments in the future. It is, after all, a dynamic process. Particularly in the technical and hi-tech industry, there are a whole host of options with which we may not be all that familiar yet. This is why it is to be welcomed that the report offers scope for possible, even better, methods than we have at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to note that it is not only the European Parliament that prevents road victims. The behaviour of road users is particularly important. This also means, therefore, that it is an integral process in which others in society will also need to play a role, and this is why I am pleased with this contribution to establishing a safer and integral traffic policy to which consumers too can make a contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a common denominator: we all agree that the number of accidents, injuries and deaths on European roads is absolutely unacceptable; and we also agree that we need to find viable methods of considerably reducing this number of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">This report talks mainly about the most vulnerable road users; I would therefore have liked motorcyclists to have been explicitly mentioned as well as pedestrians and cyclists, since they are just as vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Vehicles need to be designed and built to be safer both for their occupants and for those around them, such as pedestrians. The problem is finding a legal, quick, effective and transparent way of doing it. Front designs that are capable of absorbing the impact of a pedestrian who is hit are vital in quantifying how much harm accidents would cause if they happened.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, forget that we need to take care of other aspects, such as promoting safer driving, maximum dissemination of road safety information and, essentially, as has rightly been said, designing and building road infrastructures that are safer for all users.</p>
<p class="contents">The black spots on European roads are also black spots for this group of most vulnerable users. Metal barriers, inappropriate vertical signs and kerbs are among the causes behind an enormous number of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">From the start of the debate our Group has rejected the so-called “voluntary agreements” with the automobile industry proposed by the Commission in order to improve the protection of the most vulnerable groups, as it is a system that could leave the way open for other extra-legislative agreements associated with transport and the environment, which concerns us given the lack of an interinstitutional agreement in that respect. This would not happen with a legislative process, because, although it would take longer, it would maintain stricter parliamentary control. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that a voluntary agreement with industry would enable us to start sooner. But it is also true that, according to all the data, it would save fewer lives.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled a series of amendments rejecting this voluntary agreement. Amendment No 4 refers to the need for consumer and user organisations to continue to express their opinions, whatever the form of regulation; Amendment No 6 expresses our concern regarding the requirement to use Daytime Running Lights across the Union, as their current use by the most vulnerable users, motorcyclists and cyclists, would lose its value. In any case, we ask that this should not be obligatory until the matter has been studied in detail, or that Member States who ban Daytime Running Lights should be allowed to have positive discrimination for cyclists and motorcyclists.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have tabled a series of amendments in this respect and we ask for them to be looked at or at least to be voted on. By accepting the Commission’s proposal, Parliament is explicitly accepting a loss of power over this important aspect, which concerns the safety and the lives of hundreds of European citizens, and we will be losing independence, judgment, transparency and control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more the case in view of the dramatic incidence of serious traffic accidents which make it impossible to regard as appropriate the deadlines envisaged for implementing the recommendations regarding impacts involving the lower leg and head with the front or windscreen of the vehicle: 1 July 2005 for all new vehicle types, 1 July 2010 for 80% of new vehicles and 2012 for all new vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not, as a matter of principle, opposed to commitments in general, but in this specific case I see it as necessary to produce a binding framework directive. That would be a preferable way of going about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report reflects this problem. Attempts have been made at negotiating a compromise, but, unfortunately and apart from any compromise, a whole array of shortcomings remain. You, Mr Koch, looked only at the positive side of that; I am now considering it from another angle. Excessive delays prior to the commitment's implementation, the reduction of tests from four to two, the commitment to equip vehicles with daytime running lights, the provision that the implementation of phase 2 should be subject to technical feasibility, which gives no guarantee that the objectives will actually be achieved, the failure to adopt a ban on fitting front and rear bullbars after a vehicle is purchased. We of course support the equipping of all vehicles with ABS, as we do the introduction of a range of electronic active safety devices.</p>
<p class="contents">Making the first move is always better than doing nothing. This one can help cut down on accidents. So, despite all my reservations, I will vote for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Measures that relate to both vehicles and to road user behaviour. Everyone has his or her own responsibility to take. In my opinion, the Community should not be able to shirk its responsibility too easily. It has the task of protecting its people from the risks of public life, including the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Community is prescribing requirements for the design of cars, which is good, in my view. This power must not be relinquished. This is why voluntary agreements with industry have to be treated with great care. Industry is only secondary, and never able to adopt the role of legislator, simply because it always wants a compromise of criteria without any of the sharp edges.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement with the automobile industry which we are discussing here is partly illustrating why that is. Let me start by saying that the agreement offers more certainties than are currently laid down formally. That is to say, provided that all parties provide their cooperation to the letter and spirit of the agreement. This does depend on the basic premise that is opted for: either an existing situation or a desirable one. I would opt for the latter, namely the need for considerable improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, there are a few observations to be made about the agreement. One point that deserves attention is the existence of two different test methods. One is related to industry and one is independent. It goes without saying that the first one will not be as far-reaching as the second one, or at least not be as critical. There is also a clear difference in the set-up of the test. The EEVC goes considerably further and can ultimately guarantee a higher level of protection than the NCAP. The timeframe plays an important role too. Industry suggests that technical adjustments to models require more time. This is also reflected in the voluntary agreement on the basis of which requirements for all new cars only start to apply after a very long time. Practice has shown, however, that adjustments can be implemented remarkably faster, not in years but even in weeks, as long as the right incentives are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the specific content of this resolution is concerned, there is only one conclusion possible, in my view. We believe that Community legislation is the only way in which the criteria for the safety tests can be established. Accordingly, we warmly welcome the proposed legislative instrument, namely a framework directive. As for its content, the four EEVC tests will need to occupy centre stage, because they prescribe higher requirements and, in so doing, offer a higher level of protection for weaker participants. On the basis of information available to us, it is very feasible for the automobile industry to meet these standards. There does not seem to be a problem there either. The inclusion of alternative test methods is, in our view, superfluous. It is claimed that this would be necessary in order to be able to incorporate progress in the test methods. However, the EEVC tests too are updated regularly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the plea for the ban on bullbars both during and after production receives our support. In short, with the exception of a few minor changes, we can endorse this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By way of illustration, according to the statistics, there were 23 000 road traffic accidents in Greece alone in 2000, 3 900 of which involved pedestrians. So you can see that we are talking numbers which are not easily disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the Commission communication we are examining today is about a commitment by the European automobile industry designed to increase the chances of survival of pedestrians and cyclists involved in collisions with motor vehicles. This particular commitment comes in two stages, one by 2005 and one with even more stringent measures by 2010. The important thing is that, first, the industry itself is anxious to make a voluntary commitment, meaning that no direct legislative intervention is required in the first stage and, secondly, this commitment covers all the important manufacturers, European, Japanese and Korean alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on this report in the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had what I consider to be a very satisfactory outcome, thanks to the efforts of the rapporteur, Mrs Petersen. Of course, with it being a compromise, we are not overly excited about the result but, when all is said and done, it takes account of our group's concerns, which is why we voted for it in committee and shall do so in Plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental elements in this agreement are paragraphs 6 and 14, so I shall just reiterate them if I may. First, we consider that the voluntary commitment being negotiated with the automobile industry represents a first step towards improving road safety and, secondly, we are asking the Commission to come forward with a framework directive in which a clear, realistic time schedule is established for the intermediate and final goals to be reached, as well as methods for monitoring assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks also go to Commissioner Liikanen for his unbiased and fruitful endeavours. The compromise that has been achieved represents the new decision-making culture and is a step forward for dealing with matters faster and more flexibly. The voluntary agreement will allow us to adopt simple solutions to increase pedestrian safety more quickly. However, Parliament must ensure that the car industry keeps its promises. For this reason a loose framework directive is appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time it has to be remembered that this commitment is just a start. As has been said here in several speeches, the targets for action might have been a lot more ambitious. New technology makes it possible to improve road safety in general and hence also pedestrian safety. Solutions already exist and more are on the way. They must be speedily adopted.

First of all, I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the sound work she has done. In the final analysis, the background to what we are discussing here is the fact that public roads claim forty thousand victims annually, including a number of vulnerable road users – as they are referred to – cyclists, pedestrians and also, of course, moped riders and motorbike riders to a certain extent. These are the people around which everything ultimately revolves.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement that is being discussed here is in the first instance voluntary. To a certain degree, I can go along with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and others who would ideally like to see voluntary agreements concluded with industry. However, this has already taken some time. These tests have taken 22 to 24 years, although some adjustments are taking place. I do, in fact, share the view of Mr Van Dam who claims that these adjustments can be made a great deal faster. These days, consumer adjustments can be made very quickly thanks to technological connections between both the requesting parties and, ultimately, the implementing operative activities in industry itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Phase one is, in itself, a step forward in this procedure where, for example, the application of ABS is concerned. We have some misgivings about daytime running lights, because it is, after all, the weak vulnerable users who end up being portrayed in a bad light. We have tabled a few amendments on this score. Ultimately, it is also about the front of the cars and what goes on around these.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome phase one's implementation on a voluntary basis. As for phase two, I go along with these four tests where it is clear which ones are the best, but this is, at the end of the day, about a framework directive. This is what we should focus our attention on now. I fully agree with the rapporteur on the scope and intention of this framework directive. I also agree with her – this is also why we have tabled an amendment on this – to implement this framework directive, which should not be formulated in a technically complex manner, as soon as possible. This is why we state in our amendment that we would ideally like to see this before the end of this year. In the light of 24 years of history, this is certainly not asking too much.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I should like to ask a number of groups – for a number of those are agreed – to consider Amendment No 9, particularly part one, which is about submitting this relatively simple framework directive to us before the end of the year, and this according to the criteria that have been laid down in the low-key consultation between all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Industry would like measures on a voluntary basis that only partly meet the public’s expectations and that can easily be avoided by companies that stand to benefit from doing so. It is sad that the European Commission wanted to meet this wish and that some of the Right-wingers in this Parliament were prepared to endorse this. The argument in favour, namely faster results and more flexible adjustments, is largely cancelled out by the fact that the interested parties themselves have a huge bearing on the outcome. They want to leave room for effects which may be harmful to others but beneficial to themselves. Insofar as additional agreements with industry are meaningful, these can at most relate to the speeding up of the introduction of new rules and ways with a view to a prompt and goal-specific application.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a remark about the content of the covenant itself. Compulsory daytime use of headlights is only safe in sparsely populated countries with a low sun position, few cyclists and without the need to make motorbike riders more visible, and there is a problem in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, this new instrument presumes twofold legitimate expectations. For a start, we are trusting the Commission, as, before the directive reaches us and is adopted by us, we have to expect that you will check to see that the Commission really will fulfil its obligation for the next two or three years from the word go, as it were.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, secondly, presupposed that you must, in theory at least, join us in trusting the industry to actually do what it has declared itself willing to do. In so far, I call on the industry and the Commission to prove to us and to the citizens whom we represent, that legal undertakings are a good way of achieving rapid improvements, particularly in technical fields.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, though, we Members of this House are, as I see it, obliged to check up on the Commission and on the industry to see whether they actually merit our trust and whether they really are promptly and effectively putting their promises into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, Commissioner, to make another point. I take the view that, should this directive and this system come to pass, we in this House must also be free not to insist on all the old technical standards. That, Mr Bouwman, is why I cannot vote for your Amendment No 9, as item 14 of our motion for a resolution states that we expect the directive to take as standards either the four EEVC tests or other methods offering at least equal or possibly better safeguards. This Parliament should not behave in 2002 as if it already knew what testing methods will be right in 2005 and 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr President, as regards the question of which are the right tests for the framework directive, I ask the Commissioner to submit proposals founded on objective criteria and modern knowledge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cars remain excessively and unnecessarily dangerous. Safer car fronts could save 2 000 lives a year at a cost of only EUR 30 or GBP 20 a car.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree it should be possible to turn off daytime running lights. Indeed, I would want them banned in the United Kingdom because I think they reduce the visibility of motorbikes and make motorists feel superior and invulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted at the ban on bullbars, not only when cars are sold, but also an as after-sales purchase. May I congratulate not only the rapporteur, but also my own colleague, Hermann Vermeer, for his excellent work in leading the search for a compromise and breaking the early deadlock between the two sides of the House, one insisting that voluntary agreements should never have a role, and the other saying that legislation should never have a role.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the attempt by the car industry lobby to discredit the EEVC tests. The report properly reminds us that EEVC is the institution which is at the forefront of research in road safety, with wide experience in the field of pedestrian protection in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EEVC and other test methods should continue to develop with new technologies, currently there are no equivalent tests, so those tests are for the moment standard. Just as I do not think that it is useful to be theological about voluntary agreements or legislation, nor do I think that it is useful to be theological about a particular kind of test, but there are no different standards at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is also a good example of a non-legislative approach which can benefit the citizens quickly and strengthen the framework of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures proposed by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association – introducing more pedestrian-friendly car fronts, fitting all new vehicles with ABS, installing daytime running lights in countries where this is permitted, and vehicle crash tests – should indeed make it possible to reduce the unacceptable number of people and pedestrians who, each year, lose their lives or are seriously or irreparably injured. A negotiated agreement would therefore be an initial positive step towards improving road safety, and the commitment could still be improved in time and monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it would appear fundamentally important for the European Parliament to call upon the Commission to guarantee the independence in both form and substance of the technical services certifying the conformity with the tests laid down of all new vehicle models that manufacturers intend to place on the market. In this regard, the motion for a resolution to be put to the vote today quite rightly calls for the conformity inspection procedures to be set on the basis of guidelines established jointly with<span class="bold"> </span>the Joint Research Centre<span class="bold"> </span>and under its supervision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we are calling for EU legislation to take its place. We welcome manufacturers' development of pedestrian-friendly car fronts, automatic braking systems and the use of daylight running lights, although obviously there is controversy on that particular topic.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome this because we are assured that these measures can be implemented relatively quickly. However, the motion for a resolution recognises that this agreement is not the best way to protect pedestrians in the long run. What if one of the partners fails to act? It is not as binding or as transparent as legislation, and there is a real lack of confidence expressed by the pedestrian protection bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The car industry itself admits – and none of us can be happy about this – that it has not been proactive in the past 22 years. Phase I will take five years to implement, with phase II in 2010 and a review in 2004. We are taking only a first step.</p>
<p class="contents">The car industry states that the framework allows it to move forward more quickly, that a directive will slow down implementation. But we ask the Commission to come forward with a framework directive that will lay down a clear timeframe and detailed monitoring methods because at the end of the day we must protect the most vulnerable and pedestrian safety in our communities is of the utmost importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking about human life. For that reason I was happy to come and speak here at such very short notice.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a pity that the Committee headed off in the wrong direction right at the start. We politicians wanted to leave our mark only because we were elected to this Parliament. The issue is a lot more serious than that. This is about saving human lives and finding the means of doing so as quickly as possible. We must therefore forget the political approach; we have to support the Commission’s very rational proposal and, likewise, the excellent work undertaken by the rapporteur, Mrs Petersen.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the way to implement those very technical changes – which are in fact huge in scale – as quickly as possible? We must remember that we are elected just once every five years, but the car industry holds an election every day. Consumers vote with their wallet every day, and people’s awareness of safety matters should not be underrated. Today they are insisting on safe cars and also that cars should be safe for pedestrians. We especially must not get ourselves caught up in an EEVC test, good though it may be in itself, because developments are happening very fast. What will we have to offer in terms of technology in two, three or four years’ time? We should not let ourselves get bogged down in the framework defined today and I give my utmost support to the Commission’s proposal, as well as Mrs Petersen’s work to reach a compromise, and I would just briefly like to say this: even Olof Palme would have been satisfied with the work that we have done here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When considering which approach to take to this issue, the choice has been between a voluntary commitment from industry on the basis of agreed objectives and the traditional route of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">After talks with the European Commission, European motor vehicle manufacturers, represented by ACEA, committed themselves in June last year to introducing a range of measures starting this year, actually in January 2002, leading to a high level of pedestrian protection. Identical commitments have been entered into since then by the Japanese and Korean automobile manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">In a communication adopted in July last year, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council the main elements of the industry’s commitment and invited both institutions to express their views on it. The Commission would decide thereafter whether to accept the industry commitment or to propose legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitment constitutes an innovative package that combines passive and active safety. On the passive safety side, manufacturers have agreed to design cars according to a series of tests introduced in two phases, starting in 2005, aimed at verifying that the car design will minimise injuries to pedestrians involved in an accident. Another important passive safety element of the commitment is the ban of rigid bullbars from new cars as from this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding active safety, industry has taken three additional initiatives: firstly, to equip new vehicles with ABS from 2003 onwards, secondly, to introduce daytime running lights on all vehicles from 2002 (it should be noted that this refers only to the technical prescription of DRL, but it does not supersede national laws on the use of DRL), and, last but not least, industry is committed to progress and report systematically on the introduction of additional active safety devices to improve pedestrian protection, such as adaptive speed limiting devices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would monitor the implementation of the commitment, on the basis of tests conducted by independent laboratories and possibly with the involvement of national type-approval authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, an intensive debate has taken place in the European Parliament and the Council in the past few months on the options presented by the Commission in its communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November the Council of Ministers approved the idea of an industry commitment in this area and its fundamental elements, subject to certain conditions on particular points.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is the turn of the European Parliament to express its views. I am grateful to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and in particular to the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, for her impressive work, and also to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mr Harbour and Mr Rübig for their opinions. I appreciate the efforts invested in this matter, which have shown exceptional commitment, professionalism and openmindedness. The aim has been to seek a balance between a high level of protection, flexibility and efficiency in law-making on the one hand, and the preservation of legal certainty and transparency on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission welcomes the support expressed by the Transport Committee for the objectives and timeframe proposed in the Commission communication for the introduction of pedestrian protection measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission welcomes the views expressed in the report regarding the legislative approach, suggesting the use of framework legislation in this area to ensure legal certainty on the fundamental goals.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been asked what the Commission will do if the report is accepted. If a majority of the European Parliament agrees to this approach, the Commission is willing to put forward a proposal for framework legislation, based on the relevant measures of the commitment. I believe that we can do this by the end of the year, this coming autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
