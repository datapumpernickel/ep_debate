The first should be to the government of Macedonia. Much gratitude should be conveyed, as well as admiration expressed, for the courage demonstrated by the Macedonian government in proposing amendments to the constitution and giving the Albanian minority the place required by a modern democracy. It has been difficult, and the European Union must express its heartfelt gratitude to the Macedonian government for what it has done. The second message I think we should convey to Macedonia should be addressed to the NLA, or what is known as the liberation movement. It will be appreciated that this originally emerged under Milosevic – I shall not go through the whole story – but now there is only one thing to say to the NLA and to its remnants in northern Macedonia, and that is: the struggle is over now; all weapons must be handed in now; there is now no reason at all for the NLA to continue with the activities of which it has been guilty – and I use the word ‘guilty’ advisedly, for the NLA is of course a very mixed organisation, certain aspects of which do not bear too close examination. Now, the Albanian population has been accorded its full civic rights. That is the way to solve problems involving minorities. I myself come from a border area between Denmark and Germany, in which we solved all the problems 45 years ago by according both minorities, north and south of the border, full rights in a modern democracy. That is what Macedonia has now also chosen to do. It is the right way, and both parties deserve our thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Peace is still a precarious commodity in Macedonia, perhaps because faith in a shared solution, a shared state and a shared society is not yet fully established. This is not surprising, for something like this takes longer than sitting at a negotiating table and engaging in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we look at the Framework Agreement, I think it is very important that renouncing violence is the first priority. This is a democracy; it does not need violence to bring about change. In a democracy, it must be possible to talk about change, conduct negotiations and then bring forth legislation to achieve change.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the country's integrity. We do not need new borders or new states painstakingly drawn along some sort of ethnic lines, but which can never be drawn precisely. We only need to look at the capital Skopje to see how impossible this is. I have never understood why both sides – even if only briefly – have actually talked about the option of dividing the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this is a multiethnic state. Many countries are multicultural, but this is a multiethnic state with a significant Albanian minority which cannot treated in the same way as a five or six percent minority. Its status must be enhanced. Its status has been enhanced, and we think it is right that these minority rights are being expanded beyond the usual extent. I believe that overall, a good compromise has been found.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be in Skopje in the next few days. We will stress the need for the remaining necessary measures to be put in place. For our point of view, this continual prevarication and threat that there will be no agreement and coordination after all, or that there may be recourse to violence once more, are incomprehensible and unacceptable. I hope that just as we are able to discuss Macedonia with a greater sense of satisfaction today, this prevarication will give way to a genuine feeling of satisfaction and acceptance within the next month or so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The NLA has been dissolved, so it claims. We all know that there are still a great many weapons in Macedonia, and the issue of a criminal association is still on the agenda. It includes those who want it. I still assume that most Albanians want it. I also assume that most Macedonians want it. However, the problem in many Slav Macedonian heads has not yet been resolved – otherwise, we would never have had the problem in the first place. In recent years, nothing was done to enable the Albanian minority – a substantial 28 percent of the population – to participate genuinely as citizens on an equal footing. If this issue had been addressed seven or eight years ago, instead of just two years ago, and if progressive measures had been taken to make all citizens equal, the rebels would not have had such an easy ride, in my view. It is a pity – also for the Macedonian people – that it now looks as if there is only a response when criminal elements appear to be overrunning the country. It is a pity, but it is the fault of all the political parties on the ground. Ultimately, we have now achieved what this House has always asked for.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Swoboda has said, I would also like to remind you that we do not want a divided country. Macedonia is a state. It should continue to be a state, and it should not be divided along ethnic or national lines. Anyone who considers this option puts the entire region at risk. That is something which is extremely dangerous. I very much hope that this new Parliament will also now try to implement the laws as quickly as possible. The problem is that we are now hearing that what they have already voted for is being called into question again, and that sessions of parliament are constantly being postponed. Obviously, there are reasons for this. In Tetovo, for example, repeated attacks are being carried out on the Macedonian police. We must ask ourselves why this is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore be very diplomatic but firm with all our colleagues in Macedonia and ask them to make genuine efforts to progress with the Ohrid Agreement. We must not allow any recourse to this dreadful idea of holding a referendum in order to put off these constitutional changes indefinitely. That must not happen. Hannes Swoboda, Joost Lagendijk and I will try to bring influence to bear on our Macedonian colleagues over the next two days. I also think it is very important for an amnesty to be granted in whichever way is appropriate under the laws of the country, but this should not apply to crimes to be investigated in The Hague. I think we should make a fine distinction here. Naturally, I very much hope that the parliament will now put in place the laws necessary to strengthen local autonomy and give the minorities – which, after all, are majorities in some regions of the country – the opportunity to take genuine responsibility for their fellow citizens. I think that if they pursue this course, as Johannes has said, we will have peaceful situations by the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Did the August agreement really ensure that the multi-ethnic society and the single rule of law were in fact maintained? We say and we hope that it did. But the only evidence we have at the moment is that weapons are being collected and the National Liberation Army has been disbanded. However, we do know that determining in advance how many weapons would be handed in was hardly conducive to being taken seriously. How were the numbers calculated? Just as we also know that it is the easiest thing in the world for a resistance movement to say that it is disbanding and then to regroup without further ado.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we share the incredulity, the degree of difficulty which the Slav Macedonians appear to be having in making further progress. We hope they will make progress. We want to remain optimistic, but the only serious argument for being optimistic and supporting the line taken in the motion would be, first, a stable political line, not double and triple messages coming out of the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ, as has happened in the past, with catastrophic results at political level; secondly, real, generous financial assistance – and soon – and, thirdly, to give European prospects to all the Balkan states at long last, and to this particular country as quickly as possible, so that there is a way out of the crisis, hope and prospects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But all in all, the peace process in Macedonia may still be considered a small miracle. I fully agree with the words of Mr Haarder in congratulating the Macedonian government and pointing to the courage that government has shown. Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, a Gordian knot has been cut.</p>
<p class="contents">The minority rights of the Albanians are guaranteed, the operation ‘Essential Harvest’ has succeeded, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia remains secure. The multi-ethnic society is indeed being given another lease of life and dialogue is central to the parties. We must continue to pay attention to this region, to the whole of the Balkan region. The Afghan crisis, the war on terrorism, must not distract our attention from this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We must invest in the stability of the Balkans. We must invest in the stability of Macedonia. We must ensure that sufficient support for the execution of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is being granted. We must provide good guidance for refugees returning home. We must see to the re-building of that country. And I wish here to underline the words of Mrs Pack. The political history of my own country has demonstrated that only forgiveness, only reconciliation can guarantee real peace in a country. And so amnesty for the revolutionaries is indeed important. This does not mean the revolutionaries who may possibly be accused before the Court of Justice in The Hague. It concerns the others, for whom a regulation is required. I hope that our fellow MEPs who are departing tomorrow for Skopje will be able sufficiently to alert our counterparts over there to this problem. I also fully support extension of the mandate of the European Agency for Reconstruction in that region. Macedonia should be brought under the scope of that regulation, and I also hope that we as Members of the European Parliament will be paying enough attention to the work of the European Agency for Reconstruction, so that we may be sure that the European taxpayer’s money is well spent in an efficient and timely manner in that region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We always talk very pompously about European standards – which, in reality, do not exist in this form – and often demand that other countries meet criteria which many of our own EU Member States are not prepared to comply with themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I am gratified by this positive development in Macedonia, not only in the wake of the most recent acts of violence but over the last two years since the Georgievski government embarked on a reform course in this area. Once again, the violence has jeopardised this process. I am pleased that the European Union and other international organisations, including NATO, have succeeded in shoring up the process, so that the reform course has not only continued but has actually improved and accelerated.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this should not be a reason for us to fob off the Macedonians with mere thanks, as it were. Like Mr Haarder, I too believe that we owe them a debt of gratitude. However, this gratitude must be of a practical nature. We must finally take action in response to the scandalous handling of the issue of the country's name. We must finally take action on the financial resources for Macedonia, which must be used to benefit the country as a whole, including the very underdeveloped east and south and not just the capital or the few regions which were particularly affected by the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">What is very important is that we must finally begin to recognise that this country is our partner, based on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. We do not need any special instruments, we do not need a (pseudo) protectorate status, which is obviously still being mooted in some circles, also in connection with the idea of special agencies etc. I regard Macedonia as our partner. The Association Agreement is the instrument through which we can channel our cooperation. We must continue to work with Macedonia in partnership and assist it in its progression towards membership of the European Union.</p>

As far as handing in weapons is concerned, the NATO "emergency harvest" operation involving 4,500 men only recouped 3,300 weapons, i.e. not even one gun per NATO soldier, while NATO sources are quoting a figure of tens of thousands of weapons. Thousands of refugees are still unable to return home and the de facto division of the country continues.</p>
<p class="contents">At the political level, the Slav Macedonian parties are under tremendous pressure to make constitutional changes, changes opposed by the majority of the people. The European Union representative, Mr Solana, is already in Skopje, together with the Commissioner for External Relations, Mr Patten, trying to speed up the process for the so-called "political dimension" of the agreement. To put it simply, this means that they are exerting pressure to get the fine points of the amendments to the constitution, such as a general amnesty for the rebels, voted through and, more importantly, to avoid a referendum at all costs. The future of the country appears to the intermediaries to be too important a matter to be left in the hands of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The ΝΑΤΟ and European Union operation has not resolved any fundamental problems. The only thing that foreign intervention has done is to bring the rebels into contact with government officials. Apart from the NATO corps of 200 soldiers which is now stationed in the country, intolerable pressure is also being exerted by the so-called donor meeting. We again reiterate our fear that, unless various forms of foreign intervention stop, not only will the communities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia be unable to ever reach an agreement, they will face a new Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the former Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, the Albanian language was the language of administration and education. This right was suspended following the independence of Macedonia. The situation is comparable with the language rights of the Hungarian minority on the southern edge of the equally new state of Slovakia. National minorities which become a majority often appear to have no understanding for the other language groups within the territory of their state. In 50 years’ time, the roles will be reversed as Albanians come to form the largest group in Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Only through an agreement based on equality can two peoples find a way to live peacefully as good neighbours. In that respect, much can be learned from the government structures of multi-lingual federal states such as Belgium, Switzerland and Spain. From that perspective I can now, in contrast to 3 May, consent to support for Macedonia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten and EU High Representative Solana are in Skopje today to underline the importance of, and convey the urgent need for, constitutional changes and a revised law on local self-government, as foreseen under the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We face truly formidable challenges over the next few weeks and months in FYROM. The EU is fully behind the Framework Agreement and is committed to providing financial assistance, including assistance for emergency aid and for measures in support of the agreement. We have provided over EUR 10 m in humanitarian assistance through ECHO since the crisis began; EUR 54.5 m under CARDS in 2001, which includes a recent top-up of EUR 12 m for housing reconstruction, local infrastructure and support for host families; EUR 12.8 m under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism to repair and reconstruct houses, to repair electricity and to support confidence-building measures, such as mine clearance, election monitoring and police training; and EUR 50 m in macro-financial assistance still to be disbursed from a previous macro-financial package, which is being combined with an additional grant of EUR18 m to help FYROM cope with the specific needs arising from the crisis. This assistance is, of course, conditional on an IMF agreement with the Macedonian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the World Bank are ready to organise a donor meeting on 15 October, provided that the Macedonian Parliament adopts the necessary constitutional changes set out in the Framework Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not an overstatement to say that the effective delivery of EU assistance could be critical to the success of the Framework Agreement and, therefore, to peace. Our paramount concern is to ensure that we act quickly and flexibly.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore decided to propose an extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction, which has an excellent track record in delivering assistance throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The agency has people on the ground and direct experience in the region, notably in the sort of emergency reconstruction that we will need to deliver in FYROM this autumn, as well as in longer-term assistance of the type it is now overseeing, for example in Serbia. We therefore urge Parliament to give positive consideration to our proposal to extend the mandate of the agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the Framework Agreement, we are determined to pursue a strategy of closer integration of FYROM into the European mainstream, simply, first of all, by implementing the new Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed in April. A lot has to be done in this area and FYROM must demonstrate that it can live up to international standards by respecting minority rights and show that its democratic structures are stable enough for it to pursue its path towards European integration – in simple terms, to become a member of the European family. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
