<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karamanou (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, as you know, following the fall of the Berlin wall, the area of south-east Europe was shaken by ethnic quarrels and armed violence, resulting in deep political, economic and social changes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I present the situation of women in south-east Europe as configured during the transitional period, compared with the previous situation. My report complements the reports on relations between the Union and the countries of south-east Europe and the progress of these countries within the framework of the stabilisation and association agreements. My intention was to present an integrated picture of the position of women in an area in which there are important differences between countries, but a great deal of similarity in the problems which they face. The report focuses mainly on the following sectors: education and economic activity, participation in democratic institutions, violence against women and sexual exploitation, health and reproductive rights and trafficking in women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">In most countries of the Balkans, there has of course been a considerable improvement in the situation of women over the last five years. Nonetheless, the basic problems remain and the question of addressing them is not very high on the political agenda of the countries in the area. There is no sign of change in numerous sectors and, where there is some change, it is very slow in coming. Armed conflicts, the perceptions of the regimes, traditional social prejudices, outdated practices and attitudes and ethnic quarrels have marginalised women. It is telling that women from various minority groups, such as the Roma, receive no or little state care. The report analyses the problems, giving typical examples of the weaknesses in each individual country, in order to send a strong message to the governments of these countries, so that they can immediately develop actions and initiatives to combat discrimination against women and actively promote gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as education and the economy are concerned, the acute changes have differentiated to a major degree both the positions and possibilities of different generations of women. Demographic trends today demonstrate that family life is no longer a primary life objective for women, who are more interested in their economic independence and professional achievement and are therefore investing more time and energy in education. In numerous countries in the area, such as Greece, most university students are women. As far as professional life is concerned, women are more often employees, in other words they are employed in the tertiary sector, in services, and are less often employers than men. They are also less often self-employed. In the sectors in which women are mainly employed, pay is generally low and there are few prospects. I also note the higher percentage of unemployment and poverty among women in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the participation of women in political decision-making is concerned, the situation is rather disappointing in most countries, although this participation is tending to increase constantly. One of the main similarities between these countries in the political sector is the fast spread of non-governmental organisations which are active in women’s rights and are making a significant contribution to strengthening the position of women in employment and politics. However, I must point out that, in comparison with other regions of Europe, such as central Europe, the Balkan countries have the highest level of exclusion of women from political decision-making positions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as women's health and reproductive rights are concerned, I stress that particularly stressful living conditions, by which I mean the economy of survival based on the intensive exploitation of female human resources, the increase in violence against women and the fact that, in numerous countries, the health care systems have collapsed, put women's health at real risk. Similarly, in the Balkan countries, domestic violence is often one problem with dramatic dimensions; it is also basically a problem which is inadequately recognised and addressed. This problem, together with trafficking, has reached explosive dimensions. Nonetheless, in the entire area, there is a lack of serious and systematic statistics on the problem, a lack of adequate legislative regulation, monitoring and guidance and a lack of economic and psychological support for victims.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trafficking in women is concerned, south-east Europe in general has been identified in recent years as an area in which the trafficking networks act almost unimpeded. Trafficking prospers because it is of course economically viable and it constitutes a basic part of the sexual economy and part of consumer society. Trafficking in the area is a real industry, consisting of small- and large-scale businesses and local and international networks. The industry in question has political support and economic resources in the countries of origin, transit and destination, in the form of corrupt officers, and I should like to quote as a typical example the scandal of sexual slavery in Montenegro. A woman from Moldavia, the victim of trafficking, recognised key political figures as clients and/or as those involved in the white slave trade. I should also like to stress that the peace forces in the area have increased this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to say that it is certain that the road towards the economic and social development of south-east Europe and respect for the rights of women depends on their integration into European structures and I should like to remind you that the European Council in Thessaloniki in June 2003 emphasised that it supported the European prospects of the countries of the western Balkans. Europe cannot be secure and at peace while violence, ethnic hatred and violations of fundamental rights are a daily occurrence within its borders. The role of women in reconciliation, peaceful coexistence and development in the countries of south-east Europe must be given the recognition it deserves by the European Union and strengthened in every possible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission welcomes the adoption of the Karamanou report on women in South-East Europe and the many valuable observations and proposals which it contains. In its relations with the countries of South-East Europe the EU is striving to promote stability, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights, including of course gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission pays the utmost attention to ensuring that gender issues are integrated into the mainstream of all European Community assistance programmes as a cross-cutting issue. It is nevertheless clear that in a number of countries the situation is far from ideal and is a problem of great political importance. The Thessaloniki agenda for the Western Balkans as endorsed by the EU-Western Balkans Summit in June 2003 specifically states that support for activities to defend women's rights and improve their situation should be better reflected in EU policies towards the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Involvement of non-governmental organisations, civil society and local authorities in EU-supported policies and activities is of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding trafficking in human beings, in the Thessaloniki agenda the EU also urges the countries of the region to act both domestically and regionally in line with the principles of the EU and proposals contained in the Brussels Declaration of September 2002. The EU assigns high priority to victim assistance, training programmes for competent bodies, exchange of information, public awareness, and strategy development. In this context, coordination of all international actors is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Most recently the Commission has pointed out in its 2004 report on the Stablisation and Association Process for South-East Europe that gender is insufficiently ensured and domestic violence remains a problem in several countries. Although improvements have been made in certain countries on issues such as equal salaries, equal treatment of men and women concerning employment, training, career advancement and working conditions, and women's participation in government, progress is generally slow and insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the regional CARDS programme for 2002, the Commission published an open call for submission of proposals for support for the rule of law, good governance, public accountability and freedom of opinion. Promoting the equal participation of men and women in the democratisation process was one of the priorities of the CARD stabilisation programme for 2002. Of the twenty-two projects selected for funding which are ongoing until 2005, one is funding a women's leadership programme and another a project on women in media. The rest relate to work with various representatives of civil society to improve the access of citizens more generally to the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 2003 CARDS regional programme on democratic stabilisation, an open call for submissions was issued recently and the deadline for receiving proposals is 28 April. While this programme does not specifically target women, it supports equality of men and women and the participation of diverse civil society groups and associations at local grassroots level in the process of strengthening democratic structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an additional call for proposals under the 2003 CARDS regional programme is due to be issued soon. The programme proposes to strengthen capacities of civil society network associations in order to deliver better services to their member organisations. This constitutes a logical continuation of the 2002 initiatives and we expect and hope that women's associations will submit sound proposals in response to this call.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a new CARDS multiannual programming cycle is currently under preparation and the suggestions in the Karamanou report will be duly taken into account in the context of this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out in the report, problems have also occurred and still exist in certain candidate countries. In order to address this situation, from 1999 to 2003 gender equality projects under the PHARE national programme and MEDA totalled more than EUR 13 million. During the same period, participation by the candidate countries in the Community programmes involved close to EUR 1 million and gender equality projects financed under civil society programmes totalled EUR 2.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Once they are members of the European Union, these states will obviously be subject to the same obligations and benefit from the same instruments as other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues related to gender equality and the improvement of women's employment are raised in the regular reports on Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. This matter is being dealt with in the negotiations on the Union's social <span class="italic">acquis</span> for the first two countries. Furthermore, as pointed out by the honourable Member, more that 20 projects have been financed for civil society actions to improve women's conditions. Recent legislation adopted in the three countries is improving the legal situation of women and the Commission is following the implementation of this legislation very closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My political group has supported their move towards Europe and all the development and cooperation procedures which have been applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Historic experience and daily life in the European Union have demonstrated that development and prosperity cannot be achieved without democracy, without respect for human rights and special attention to women's rights, without making full use of the manpower of both sexes, without a dynamic civil society. That is why I wish to welcome the initiative by Mrs Karamanou in drafting a report on the rights of women in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the monitoring of the stabilisation and association agreements, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has drafted various opinions, one of which I had the honour of drafting, in which it emphasises the problems faced by women in the Balkans and the need to integrate equality into all policies. The seriousness, however, of the issues, as presented to us by the rapporteur in her report, and the challenge of addressing these issues, for the sake of development in the area and good collaborative relations with the European Union, warrant a special report. I also take this opportunity to welcome the statement by Commissioner Nielson on including many of the proposals by my fellow Member in her report in the new CARDS programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that, in the face of this challenge, we are responsible on both sides. We, as the European Union, must activate all the mechanisms and potential for a good collaborative approach with the Balkans, but also the countries of the Balkans must take serious account of the fact that democracy and standards are the best guarantee of their development and their integration into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are fundamentally talking about democracy, Mr President, because we are talking about equality and freedom, the combination of which should result in democracy. Democracy has not reached the women of the Balkans. Trafficking in women, domestic violence, difficulties accessing reproductive rights, lack of political participation, unemployment, poverty and prostitution are the reality of thousands of women living in the region. Each country has its own distinctive reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In Albania we could emphasise the serious increase in the trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation. Bulgaria is entirely lacking in mechanisms for creating equal opportunities between men and women, which is a prerequisite for transposing our rules. Trafficking in women and girls in Bosnia Herzegovina is also increasing. In Croatia, violence against women goes unpunished. In Greece, we are faced with serious problems in terms of the political representation of women. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the sexual abuse of Albanian and Roma girls takes place on an almost daily basis and the legislation does not include any law relating to the crime of trafficking. In Romania there are crimes on ethnic grounds, mainly against Roma women. These women have practically no access to contraception and forced marriages and poverty are also part of their reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In Serbia and Montenegro, there is a very clear increase in trafficking in women, also influenced by the arrival of Kafor troops. In Turkey, violence against women is widespread and sentences are still reduced for what are so wrongly termed ‘crimes of honour’.</p>
<p class="contents">We must open our eyes, Mr President. We must pay attention to the situation of women in this region and we must not move ahead without taking account of the daily reality of thousands of women and girls living in poverty, exploitation and hopelessness.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must serve as an essential lever, as the incentive for these countries to commit themselves seriously to human rights and freedom for their citizens. No cultural tradition can be placed above universal human rights. There cannot be first- and second-class citizens. Inequality for women in south-east Europe must be a priority for all of us, because we are talking about democracy and not about women's problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call for exhaustive monitoring of the accession agenda in relation to the candidate countries, and greater solidarity with women, for this is what they expect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, equal opportunities between men and women in this region deserve our utmost attention in light of the problems caused by all types of exploitation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Human trafficking in south-east Europe is giving us the greatest cause for concern and worry. I am sorry to say that women are, in large numbers, the main victims of this terrible trafficking. The countries of this region too are called upon to take all measures necessary in order to put a stop to this modern slavery. For my part, it is true that combating the trafficking in women is an absolute priority, in line with our European values based on the principle of respect for fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The horror of testimonies from Romanian, Moldavian and other women who have been sold for a handful of dollars is intolerable. The marketing of women must be very strongly condemned. Some Balkan countries that persistently hammer on the door of the European Union with the aim, of course, of becoming Member States should make it their absolute priority persistently to target these mafia-like organisations, break them up and severely punish those guilty of this horrendous trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate that we cannot tolerate the exploitation and abuse either of women or, especially, of girls, who are slaves of unscrupulous networks. Nor can we tolerate any longer the indifference of governmental authorities that all too often tend to close their eyes and ignore what is not only a problem but also a curse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should now like to make some comments on trafficking in human beings in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spent a lot of time working in the Balkans and continue to do so. I notice that a lot is happening there. Action is being taken and, as the Commissioner said, many programmes are in place. I have mixed feelings though. Yes, on the one hand there is progress, but what about the other hand? I am seeing more and more well-motivated young politicians, both men and women, who want to do something. Improvements can be seen in the towns, but things are still very different in the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said of the humiliation of the victims. We identified 5 203 victims between 2000 and 2003, but the actual number could be over 175 000. So a lot of work remains to be done. Since 2003 we have been seeing far fewer victims because the criminal sector is going more and more underground. What are they doing? They are bringing their victims, the girls, not to bars or brothels, but to private flats. This makes the networks much more sophisticated. Previously they operated in small groups, but now they are on their own – one dealer for each victim, and so the chance of catching them is smaller. It takes a lot of work. Secondly, blood vengeance is on the rise, not only among men but also involving women and children. If you are an Albanian woman, raped and kidnapped and taken to the West, what happens then? According to Albanian custom, this woman has shamed her family and even today they have the right to kill her. That is the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, I would urge you to support actions aimed at gender equality and activities and training aimed at the police, the military and the authorities. Jobs must also be created, jobs with a reasonable wage, in order to deal with the problem of corruption. In addition, we should involve Balkan countries in the European institutions. Invite people from these countries to attend courses so that they can see that there is another, less corrupt, way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
