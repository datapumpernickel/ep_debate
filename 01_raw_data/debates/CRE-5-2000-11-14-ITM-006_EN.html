We are obliged to do this because of a very heavy schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing me to give an assessment of the current state of the European Union’s Mediterranean policy since this is, as you know, the eve of the Fourth Conference of Foreign Ministers from the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, which is to be held in Marseilles.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be aware of the importance the French Presidency attaches to enhancing the Mediterranean aspect of the European Union’s external relations. Indeed it has made this one of the priorities of its term in office. It is, moreover, the reason for our insistence on drawing up an assessment of the results of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, in order to be in a position, in Marseilles, to establish the necessary guidelines. Commissioner Patten, whom I must welcome, expressed some interesting avenues for investigation in this respect in his communication on reinvigorating the Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok referred to the common strategy on the Mediterranean Region, adopted in Feira in June. This was an important and useful contribution. This, however, unlike the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which unites the Fifteen Member States with twelve partners on the southern coast of the Mediterranean, is an instrument for discipline within the Union, to some extent, designed to intensify the coherence and coordination of all Community instruments and Member State policies with regard to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">Priorities for the implementation of this common strategy have already been established by the Presidency and were presented to the Council of Ministers in September. The Presidency strove particularly to identify areas on which the European Union and its partners of the southern Mediterranean should concentrate their efforts in order to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, particularly by intensifying political and economic dialogue, improving the effectiveness of Community aid, the implementation of sub-regional cooperation and South-South integration, and even intensifying initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">This is indeed also our objective for the Marseilles Conference. In the course of the two days of the meeting, the Presidency aims to succeed in giving a new impetus to the process, with everyone on board. There is probably no need for me to outline in detail the political background of this conference, but I very sincerely believe that the current problems in the Middle East make this Euro-Mediterranean dialogue more essential than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the situation in the Middle East is difficult at present is not, therefore, a reason to lower our ambitions for the Marseilles conference. I am not, of course, saying that the current situation will have no impact on our meeting. I am thinking in particular of the Charter for Peace and Stability, which was discussed at great length among the 27 partners, but whose adoption probably calls for a regional environment where peace has been established.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok, who has now rejoined us, asked questions specifically about the delays noted in negotiations. Should we really use the term ‘delay’? It is true that discussions have been lengthy and occasionally delicate, but I would say that this is understandable, considering the political context in the Middle East. The main thing, in my view, is that work is going forward and that the project is not being abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that the 27 partners are resolved to adopt this text as soon as circumstances permit. Let us not forget that the Barcelona Process is a recent development, only five years old. Indeed, when we instigated the partnership in 1995, we were aware that we were undertaking a long-term project. There was plainly nothing easy about the task of bringing together, overnight, 27 partners as diverse as this against an often tense, and occasionally more than tense political background and within a framework as original as the Barcelona arrangement. Yet, we have managed to maintain dialogue even on occasionally sensitive subjects: stability, terrorism, emigration and human rights, for example. You may rest assured that we fully intend to continue in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation in the field of politics and security, known as the ‘first aspect’ of the Barcelona process is essential, even though we know it is the most sensitive and the longest to implement. There are also, however, the other ‘aspects’ of Barcelona, the economic and financial aspect on the one hand, and the social, cultural and human aspect on the other. This, indeed, leads me to highlight a fundamental principle of the European Union’s Mediterranean policy, and I shall thereby be giving a direct answer to Mr Brok’s question.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise the subject of the overall approach of the process of the parallel, balanced development of these three aspects, which underpins the spirit and originality of Barcelona, something we must preserve. And even if it is true that the economic aspect of Barcelona is the one that, despite the delays, is working best, the main thing is that we must not lose sight of this overall approach, without which the process would be consigned to being nothing more than just another free trade area, lacking in political or human vision in the long term and this would be unfortunate. Our Mediterranean partners are our direct neighbours. We have a great deal in common with them, a shared heritage, culture, trade and interests. Finally, as Mr Brok emphasised, we have common challenges, which we must meet together in order to deal with racism, intolerance and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Great prospects are opening up, too, for cooperation in the areas of combating trafficking of all sorts, migration and enhancing the rule of law. We Europeans have experience that we can profitably share. It is furthermore in our own interests to support our partners in their process of structural reforms, upgrading and opening up their economies to competition. In Marseilles, therefore, this new impetus we wish to give the process must be based on all its political and economic components which are, let me reiterate, complementary and inextricably interlinked.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Barcelona process and the partnership are ambitious projects requiring resources appropriate to the allotted objectives. Mr Brok mentioned financial resources. They are, of course, never sufficient. The challenges are such, the needs of the southern countries are so great that the resources of the European Union will always appear to be inadequate, especially since the external commitments of the Union have increased to an extraordinary degree in the last few years. This is a debate which, as you know, we have had several times in the Council; a debate which I think I can say lies at the heart of the reform undertaken on the initiative of Commissioner Patten.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that the Council, particularly since 1995, has striven to allocate more extensive resources to the Mediterranean region, appropriate to the challenges of the partnership. Since 1995 the French Presidency has made particular efforts in this regard, especially at the European Council in Cannes, where we succeeded in restoring balance between the funding for Mediterranean policy and that properly allocated to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the spirit in which the MEDA I programme was launched with EUR 3.4 billion committed between 1995 and 1999. The multiannual total must now be established for the period 2000-2006, and I can only hope – although I cannot put a figure on it at this stage – that it will match up to the ambitions of the European Union in its Mediterranean policy.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware that we are attempting at this very moment to reach an agreement between the fifteen Member States, if necessary by holding an Extraordinary Council meeting tomorrow in Marseilles. We have already managed to agree on the arrangements for the MEDA II financial regulation. I feel that the instrument we shall have in future will be more effective, more speedy, more transparent and therefore, ultimately, more credible. The programme’s administration will be simplified, and the rate of reimbursement and payment will be accelerated. Furthermore, there are still the EIB loans, which are essential to the development of our partner countries, particularly its major infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that with an allocation of several billion euros for the Mediterranean region over the period 2000-2007, we shall be in a position to fulfil the expectations of our partner countries in the South over the next few years, and that is crucial. Today, on the eve of Marseilles, the French Presidency naturally wishes to see the European Union’s Mediterranean priority confirmed, including in financial terms. In fact, it is no longer just a matter, as it was in 1995, of restoring balance with Eastern Europe, but also of making ready for the future enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that Barcelona, like the rest of the European Union’s external relations, forms an integral part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and that therefore the candidate countries should make preparations for seeing the Mediterranean countries as privileged partners, since they are the privileged partners of this Europe of ours. This is a major challenge for the Europe of the future, whose centre of gravity will, indeed, be shifting towards the East of the continent, but this need not happen at the expense of relations with the South. In our opinion, this is one more reason to emphasise the Mediterranean dimension of a European Union that wishes to be an actor on the world stage and for which the Mediterranean region must and shall continue to be the ‘uniting sea’ or in Latin the ‘mare nostrum’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, it is a sign of the President-in-Office's competence that he has answered questions which I have not even asked. I should like expressly to thank the French Presidency of the Council for endeavouring to give the necessary momentum to the Barcelona process. This is a hugely important issue and I say that as someone who comes from central Europe. We in central Europe must understand that the debate on the Barcelona process is in our common interest, just as we expect southern Europeans to understand that enlargement to central and eastern Europe is in our common interest. If we look at it from this point of view and take account of all this, then we will be on the right and a reasonable path.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are trying to do is to enlarge the European Union on one side and foster good neighbourly relations on the other. Both are in our common interest and the European Union is prepared to put its hand in its pocket for both. Of course, we will have to raise the question of how we are to continue funding the overall process, given the current financial perspectives and taking account of our policy in the Balkans, because there has been doubt for some time as to whether we will be able to last the course. Naturally, we hope that Mr Patten's concept will succeed and that the Commission will be able to implement these projects more quickly than has been the case in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of paramount importance that we understand the advantages of the Barcelona process, i.e. that, with our help, it will trigger the economic and social development needed in these countries, giving prospects to the people living in these regions. It also has something to do with preventing emigration. In the long run, social need should no longer be a reason – as in the European Union – to emigrate from anywhere in the Mediterranean and the desire to emigrate should be motivated by other considerations. I think we should help to bring this about. With proper economic and social prospects in place, there is a good chance of implementing human rights and democratising the community of states in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is obviously immensely important to us from the point of view of security policy. In other words, this is not just a chance for more trade and commerce, it is security policy <span class="italic">par excellence </span>and this is the message which we need to get across to our citizens if this process is to gain acceptance. Xenophobia and national and other forms of terrorism come under this heading and I hope that we shall have a chance to straighten things out here too. The worrying developments which we have witnessed in many states in North Africa in the past and, in fact, are still witnessing today, also come under this heading and I hope that we shall manage to bring all the countries of North Africa on board in this process without any whys and wherefores.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation in the Middle East is making abundantly clear what measures are needed in the form of joint policies and cooperation. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my hope that neither of the two parties to the present conflict in the Middle East will take any unilateral action this week which might make a return to the negotiating table nigh impossible in coming weeks. We should try and help to give the people of Palestine the chance to decide their own fate, forge their own future and build their own state on the basis of agreement with and the security of the state of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the European Union will prepare in Marseilles to push the Mediterranean process forward and that we will be able once again to take joint responsibility for what Mr Moscovici rightly called the <span class="italic">mare nostrum</span>. The Mediterranean is the <span class="italic">mare nostrum;</span> the three great monotheistic religions, two of which are now involved in conflict, developed along its shores. We must get back round the table on this very fundamental basis. I think that the European Union has a special role to play here and that the countries and the people in these regions are waiting for the European Union to exert its political influence because it can bring balance and credibility to bear there. I trust that the fact that this political influence is expected and we are expected to play a part there will help to get things moving in Marseilles and provide the necessary credibility, allowing us to make a contribution to peace in this region and enhance our own stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Minister said a moment ago, the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles this week takes place against the background of the persisting crisis in the Middle East peace process. We had all hoped that the circumstances would be a great deal better, and they almost were a great deal better. Many of us were delighted, even surprised, by the extent of the progress which seemed to have been made this summer at Camp David and we gave a great deal of applause to President Clinton and his administration for all they had done to move things forward. We came so close, which makes the difficulties, the tragedy of recent weeks, all the more sad. With the agency reports this morning and this afternoon the news continues to be grim. The current difficulties should encourage us to redouble our efforts to promote cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody would seek to deny that the Barcelona process and the Middle East peace process are interconnected. The breakthrough in Euro-Mediterranean relations at Barcelona was made possible partly by the breakthrough at Madrid and then the Oslo Accords. It is also true that setbacks in the pre-peace process have slowed down the progress of Barcelona. That is a fact that, alas, we have to live with. But we should not forget that the Barcelona process has progressed over five years. This has happened despite all the difficulties in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is abundantly plain. We must not allow the Barcelona process to become a hostage to the Middle East peace process. Barcelona has its own momentum. It has its own objectives which remain wholly valid. We all have an interest in demonstrating both resilience and ambition in Marseilles this week.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been encouraged by the generally positive reaction to the proposals that we set out on reinvigorating the Barcelona process, both in the European Union and among the Mediterranean partners. Perhaps I can just touch on some of the main elements in the strategic approach we have suggested that I hope will meet some agreement at Marseilles.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, speeding up negotiation and ratification of the association agreements. First of all with Egypt but also Algeria, Syria and Lebanon. We in fact completed our negotiations with Egypt almost 18 months ago and I wish that we could now rapidly proceed to initialling the agreement and then in due course to full signature.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to see us commencing more serious negotiations on association agreements with the other countries. We put forward the argument that we should tackle the sensitive issue of agricultural trade. We should review, in our judgment, what needs to be done to ensure that the agreements are fully WTO compatible by the end of the transitional period. We argue for enhancing south-south trade by encouraging the signature of free trade agreements between the partners. In this context the Commission undertakes to provide technical assistance on crucial items such as rules of origin and customs matters. We want to see the bringing together of policies on single market issues and agreement to introduce cumulation of origin side-by-side with the sub-regional free trade arrangements for all partners entering into free trade with each other and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to see an increase in the attractiveness of the region to investors. In addition to economic reforms, the newly created networks of cooperation among investment promotion agencies and among employers' federations will help, as should the introduction of a new regional risk capital facility. Reaching agreement on a new regional programme on justice and home affairs covering migration in the widest sense, the fight against organised crime and cooperation on judicial matters is another subject on which we hope we can have a good exchange of views.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the issue which I know we had many opportunities of debating in this Chamber: that of improving the delivery of MEDA. The revision of the MEDA regulation and the reform already announced of the Commission's external aid system will help to achieve this and will also lead to more human resources being available. By decentralising the delivery of aid, we shall involve partners much more in all stages of policy formulation and implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have an interest in ensuring that MEDA is tightly focused on the right objectives. We intend to do that through a close dialogue with partners at all stages. But there is no escaping the fact that the partners who have faced up to the challenges inherent in the association process are the ones who should get most support.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as human rights are concerned, we propose a structural approach looking at the performance of countries over time. But here again we should be frank. A country which has serious doubts raised about its record on human rights, democracy and the rule of law and is not prepared to discuss these matters transparently will not find it easy to fit into the new world pattern and it will be less likely to prosper in the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say one more thing about MEDA and the reform of our external aid which is relevant to debates which Members are having elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that we deliver more rapidly in the Mediterranean and elsewhere in the world, we need – as Members accept rationally and intellectually – more resources to actually manage our programmes and the Commission has put forward what are sensible proposals for doing that. There are some Members who think that we should put those extra resources into the reserve until we have accomplished certain other objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to Members of Parliament, in all good faith, that there comes a moment when you have to trust us and when you have to let us try to do the job, because we cannot conceivably implement our plans more effectively if the people we need to manage them are not made amiable until we have actually demonstrated that we can manage things more effectively. It is a crazy situation to put us in so I beg all honourable Members who have any influence on these matters to recognise that, if we are to be serious about the reform process, then you have to give us the opportunity to demonstrate whether we can be as good as our word or not. If we cannot we will have to take the consequences, and the Commissioner for External Affairs will have to take the consequences in due course, but do not put us in a position in which the ends are willed but you do not give us the means until after we have demonstrated that we can achieve the ends. It makes no sort of sense whatsoever. It is an issue which is extremely important to all the Mediterranean countries and I hope I will be able to assure them this week that it is our firm intention to do a great deal better in the delivery of our programmes in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that all the Ministers who gather in Marseilles will recognise the need to agree on this set of realistic proposals to reinvigorate the Barcelona process precisely now that the Middle East is suffering serious difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be glad to inform Parliament about the results of the Marseilles meeting at the earliest possible opportunity. We have committed in the past huge resources to this partnership. We have not managed them as well as we should have done but we have committed huge resources and that reflects the priority which Parliament, the Commission and the Council give to strengthening the partnership around our "middle sea".</p>
<p class="contents">In the next few years the success of that partnership will be even more important than ever and I hope that, at Marseilles this week and in subsequent weeks, we manage to ensure that this whole enterprise has even more impulse and energy in it than it has had in the past.</p>

We welcome with great satisfaction the news that the Commission intends to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process. However, we feel that the events taking place in this area bordering on the European Union are extremely important and that we need the undertakings and proposals outlined by Commissioner Patten just now to be more effectively implemented than has been the case in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider the peace process to be vital for the development of the Partnership in the Mediterranean, but we see before our eyes all the difficulties which have prevented the completion of the Peace and Stability Charter. So we need fresh, maybe more tangible proposals making it possible to complete the Stability Pact, before the end of this year, or during the first six months of next year at the latest. Then there is the whole area of the association agreements, trade issues and the Med programme. It is true that some agreements have been concluded but many, too many questions remain unresolved or at best still open: the lengths of time involved,<span class="bold"> </span>the<span class="bold"> </span>time frames for ratifying the agreements, the many difficulties which have arisen because of the inflexible nature of the negotiating mandate conferred by the Council upon the Commission, not to mention the bureaucratic difficulties which we have encountered over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the initiatives supporting the improvement of the management of the Med programme are important and can contribute vastly to the progress of the economic and financial partnership. This considerable progress will allow us to achieve substantial results for the Mediterranean area, results which will contribute to bringing about economic stability, the liberalisation and privatisation process and structural adaptations necessary for investments and, last but not least, decentralised cooperation and a common management policy for migration flows and employment, policies which will allow the European Union to accomplish fresh development in the future in the southern areas of its territories.</p>
<p class="contents">One final observation on the subject of the budgetary issues: we need to ask the Commission whether the current budgetary provision for human resources is in actual fact sufficient to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process, since there is no mention in the general budget of reviewing the financial resources. I will not go into the details of the appropriations because they were the result of a heated discussion in committee. Therefore, should the financial provisions intended for the regions in question be changed, as the European Parliament has requested, how will the Commission adapt its interventions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napoletano (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, five years on from the Barcelona Conference, it is time to take stock of the situation. Last March, the European Parliament approved a resolution which made a critical analysis of the policies and instruments of the Partnership, proposing some substantial changes. In June 2000, the Feira Council adopted a common Mediterranean strategy and, after proposing and obtaining endorsement for reform of the Meda regulation, the Commission recently tabled a document on reinvigorating the Barcelona Process. All this shows that we are aware of how inadequate the results achieved thus far have been, although I feel that the responses are not yet sufficient to deal with the situation, even though it is true that five years are certainly not a very long time over which to judge such complex processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the process which commenced in Barcelona, based on three pillars – political, economic and cultural – was subject to three constraints, now generally well recognised, and Commissioner Patten touched upon them in his speech. The first concerned the preference shown for free trade, which is linked to the process of economic and commercial liberalisation in terms of codevelopment, economic integration, social policies, cultural dialogue and the training and enhancement of human resources. The second constraint concerned the type of relationship there should be between the European Union and the Mediterranean partner countries. In fact, we observe that the still-prevailing bilateral dimension, which is anything but easy to negotiate and takes a long time to ratify, is in danger of increasingly shaping the economies of these countries on the basis of their trade with the Union, hampering the development of the south-south dimension, especially because of the partner countries' difficulty in establishing mutual cooperative relations. The third constraint concerns the regrettable involvement of the European and Mediterranean civil societies in this process, which is still too dominated by centralism and the almost exclusive role of the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I have stressed these aspects because they contain the key to reinvigorating the Process, and the enhancement of the Barcelona political agenda must be added to all this. It is, in fact, inconceivable that the agricultural policy, the control of migration flows and the debt<span class="bold"> </span>should not be at the centre of the Euro-Mediterranean project now. As regards agriculture, I would like to point out that Parliament has undertaken to organise a conference next spring.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the tragic interruption of the Middle East Peace Process is changing the situation in the region. Unfortunately, the European Union had based its entire policy upon the success of the Oslo Accords. In fact, the Council's common strategy followed this line. On the other hand, the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference<span class="bold">,</span> which is to open tomorrow in Marseilles, is set against the backdrop of a tragic situation which will make Europe's role in the region even more sensitive and lead the Union to assume a more substantial political role in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The fact that, despite this situation, the 27 partners have confirmed their willingness to meet in Marseilles, at least for the moment, is already in itself an indication that all is not lost, although I agree entirely with Commissioner Patten that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership policy must not become a hostage to the peace process. In fact, I will go further and say that, in the past, the peace process has served as an excuse for both Europe and for the Mediterranean partners not to be more courageous. This is why I feel that the debate taking place today could serve to make us aware that this policy is of key importance for the entire Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Commissioner Patten indicated, it is clear that the lack of consolidated peace in the Middle East is distorting the whole process that was outlined at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference and, in particular, the appropriate and correct application of the MEDA funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party obviously supports the Commission’s actions in favour of a Mediterranean policy, as outlined five years ago in Barcelona, and we want it to be consolidated. A few days ago, in Barcelona, at various meetings of the Círculo de Economía, the Secretary General of the Council, Mr Solana, told us that the priorities for European external activity are firstly with our neighbours, and our closest neighbours are the Mediterraneans. And we are not forgetting that the source of potential conflicts that we have in the medium term, due to demographic change, inequality of income, changing expectations and cultural differences, is also there. Our priority must therefore be to ensure the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we have to make every possible effort to achieve this cooperation and to ensure that the funds allocated are used efficiently, according to what we might call the selfish generosity of the European Union. We have to be generous towards the Mediterranean, but from a selfish point of view, which is to safeguard the stability that we need so much for the people of the European Union, and for European society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten, I read your article in today’s issue of <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>. I concur completely with it. What Mr Moscovici has just said is precisely what you stated yourself. The fact, moreover, that we carried the motion in this House, with the enormous majority of 502 votes in favour and a paltry 17 against, shows that we are all unanimously in favour of renewing and boosting the Euro-Mediterranean Process.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of points I would like to clarify, now that the Marseilles Conference is about to take place, in order to ensure that we get some answers, as it is not enough to repeat ritualistic phrases, given that we are all in agreement. We also need to take practical action and to get specific answers. Indeed, on Thursday evening, I assessed the situation with Mr Josselin, the French Minister responsible for these matters, and I know that the French Presidency is wholeheartedly behind the idea of promoting the process as we see it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, first of all, to discuss the budget. Where do matters stand in this respect? We have been told that roughly EUR 8 billion have been earmarked for the period 2000-2006, but this amount seems to fluctuate. So what, in the end, is the budget for 2001? It seems that at least EUR 1 billion is needed annually, but for the moment this sum has not been allocated, and at the same time there is talk of EUR 200 million to be taken, supposedly, from the margin relating to appropriations for Kosovo and Serbia. It is far from clear. We do not need to create competition between all these various needs but to find new resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in complete agreement with Commission Patten that, in order to do a proper practical job, the appropriations must be made available. I strenuously urge all my fellow Members to set aside the appropriations needed for us to be able to take action and to be able to consider the projects. Secondly, I should like to point out that we must give a boost to decentralised cooperation, which seems to be in a bad way. This is a major concern of local communities and non-governmental organisations. The forum that was held in Marseilles on 12 November made that quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we must increase the amount of appropriations for regional development in order to encourage relations and trade between regions, but also environmental protection, the fight against terrorism and drugs trafficking, emigration and integration, and to make progress towards human rights, as we have requested.</p>
<p class="contents">We would ask what action the Commission intends to take in order to invite proposals for projects, with the involvement of civil society, and in order to process and monitor these projects.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the important practical questions I wished to ask, and I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing us to have this debate just before the Presidency and the Commission are due to discuss these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even those behind the Barcelona process consider that it has broken down – that is the description which has been used – and it is a long way from having fulfilled its promises. In this respect, today’s motion for a resolution falls a long way short of the declared ambition. The peoples of the South are often critical and are concerned about this failure. I share their impatience, and even their disappointment and their anger, at the delays but also at the inadequacies of this partnership and at the initial damage it has caused.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still extreme disparities between the two sides of the Mediterranean, which keep the peoples of the South in an explosive economic and social situation, with poverty and unemployment, particularly among young people. The path leading to an area of shared prosperity has, for the time being, stopped at the association agreements, which are governed by strictly economic and financial interests in denial of the needs of the people. These populations, however, are already suffering under the weight of the debt, the drop in the price of raw materials and imposed structural actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The free trade area is in danger of considerably intensifying these imbalances, even though there is an urgent need, instead, for greater collaboration in order to meet needs. I am thinking in particular of public services, more especially in the areas of water, education, health, public transport and housing. This partnership will have no future unless it has the benefit of close cooperation with the representatives of the citizens concerned, the associations, the NGOs, the trade unions and civil society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the dream of peace on both sides of the Mediterranean should be listened to and the wish granted at the earliest possible opportunity. The spiralling violence in the Middle East, the war being waged so violently and resolutely against the Palestinian people, whose right to statehood is still being denied by Israel, are all threatening the future of the entire region. The European Union must, as the Palestinian leaders expressly request, henceforth take bold action in order to put an end to the gunfire, to promote effective dialogue and actively militate in favour of applying the UN resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marseilles Conference could have been used to this end. The failure – or, at least, the relative failure – of the Charter for Peace and Stability proves that it is not possible to achieve Europe’s “security” on the basis of marginalising the South and closing borders. These last few days in Marseilles, I have observed the great numbers of speakers addressing such comments to the Conference of Ministers, speaking in favour of cancelling debt and replacing free trade with relations of mutually supportive codevelopment...</p>

<p class="contents">The world is moving inexorably towards globalisation and, as a result, is having to organise itself into large blocks which act as protagonists on the great stage of world competition. This is prompting the Europe of national States to form a single political, economic and commercial entity in order to organise and boost a market of over 350 million consumers and set it on a level with other markets. To this end, we need to establish suitable structures, which could be both political and economic. However, first and foremost, we need political strategies which are free of bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is the guardian of great values: peace, freedom and social progress, values which must be protected day in day out precisely because they are the result of victories won at the cost of great sacrifice.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's economic progress is now under threat from the current globalisation process, and our continent is in serious danger of a recession caused by competition from South-East Asia – where the cost of labour is a tenth of the cost of labour in Europe – the USA and Japan. The Mediterranean policy is now operating in a world of extremely varied interests and latent stabilisation, and it must therefore include certain elements such as the development of peace-keeping initiatives – but it must not, I would stress, be limited to this – and the creation of partnership projects which involve northern and southern Europe, precisely because the objective of making the Mediterranean an area of dialogue, tolerance and cooperation and a guarantee of peace and stability cannot be achieved without firm political will or without the lasting, well-balanced social and economic development of less-favoured peoples and the social development of the coastal peoples, improving their employment possibilities, in order to put an end to the multitude of problems caused by the tremendous number of emigrants leaving the Basin and now affecting all the countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore convinced that the Union's Mediterranean policy must take account of the Mediterranean Basin and therefore treat the Mediterranean as a project, mindful of the fact that the rights of peoples take priority over the rights of individuals, if only because, when all is said and done, conflicts between nations harm the life and development of the individual citizens. Braudel's ‘Mediterranean of a thousand things’, the ancient civilisations which, for years, have regarded each other with hostility across the Basin, now have the opportunity to start afresh, setting off along a common path which, through political will and the power of dialogue, will lay the foundations for genuine progress and economic and social development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to set priorities; in other words, we need to use the enlargement process to strengthen Europe from the centre outwards and force a stabilisation process in south-east Europe and in the western Balkans, but without neglecting the Barcelona process, which has been drifting for five years now.</p>
<p class="contents">We can hypothesise as to whether a decisive, uniform EU policy in the Balkans might have prevented the Balkan war and the European Union might therefore have avoided the consequential costs of the war. Now, on the eve of Marseilles, we need to ensure that aid is not given to the Balkans at the expense of the MEDA programme or vice versa and that everything stays within the financial framework agreed in Berlin. With these conditions in place, it should be possible for the special council in Marseilles to reach a consensus which does more than just highlight the fault lines in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that the MEDA aid programme is not delayed by bureaucratic hurdles for which the Commission is to blame and that projects are identified more quickly in future by the Mediterranean countries involved. It is disappointing to see that the Mediterranean countries only called up just under a quarter of the EUR 4.7 billion budget of the MEDA I programme which expired in 1999. But this also illustrates that we need to estimate the absorption capacity of the countries bordering the Mediterranean more realistically. I therefore particularly welcome the Commission plan to speed up the association agreement and I think that the revision of the MEDA regulation was a very good move.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, I have deliberately avoided making any link between the Euro-Mediterranean conference and the conflict in the Middle East. The very fact that this conference is even taking place and that Israel and the Palestinians have agreed to attend and the threat of boycott by the Arab League has come to nothing must qualify as a success. We can only hope that this conference in Marseilles does not turn into a platform for polemics, pushing the first important signs of a Mediterranean policy in the European Union and the revival of the Barcelona to one side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be a success that will show that the Barcelona process, which began on the back of the Oslo agreements, has reached a sufficient level of maturity and solidity to prevent it from being caught up in the difficulties of the Middle East process. Moreover, by continuing it can make the best possible contribution, a secondary but significant contribution, to the resumption of dialogue in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in all the evaluations that are now being made of five years of the Barcelona process, many people think that we can be satisfied simply that the process is continuing, due to the fact that there have been ministerial meetings attended by representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon, etc. And this is, perhaps, a sad consolation. The evaluation is now a contrasting one and, of course, the strategic development of Euro-Mediterranean policy cannot depend on a temporary evaluation. It is continuity over time that can provide results, and positive results will be ultimately measured by the development of the countries of the southern Mediterranean. Those countries come up against a great deal of problems finding a place for their development and economic integration in the context of globalisation and we must do everything in our power to help restore balance to a situation characterised by gulfs between North and South.</p>
<p class="contents">If current tendencies continue we can be pessimistic about the future. Today a European is statistically twice as rich as someone from the Maghreb, and in twenty years’ time he will be twenty times as rich, if we do not manage to turn the situation around. In this respect, the proposal that the Commission has made for a new impetus is a positive one, and we fully agree with the two priorities that Mr Patten has set out in his speeches and repeated here this afternoon. We need to speed up the processes of the association agreements. Above all, we need to avoid having to make an evaluation of the application of MEDA in five years’ time that leads us to conclude that only 26% have been used.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not enough. We probably need to open up a more medium-term perspective and I can only list the three areas that I feel are essential in that respect: The first is European projects to structure a regional area in the southern countries. The second is an essential policy dealing with the human aspect of managing migration flows. The third is discussion and the quest for progress and consensus in developing a common agricultural policy in the Mediterranean, without which we will probably not be able to achieve a positive outcome in the medium term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It means bringing about the necessary social reforms, focusing on employment, the need to revitalise the economy in the southern countries and the reduction and cancellation of debt as central issues. It means promoting economic, cultural and political exchange between the southern countries themselves as well as with the northern countries. It means ensuring that civil society plays a greater role. However, we must not ignore the fact that the Barcelona Process has entered a critical stage, caused not only by lack of impetus or a slow down in the European undertaking in respect of the events in the Balkans or enlargement, but also by the conditions of tragic open conflict in the Mediterranean which are holding back reinvigoration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian question has once again become central. Commissioner Patten has said that we must not be hostages to the Palestine-Israel situation. That is true, but we cannot avoid it. If we do not tackle very soon the issue of the recognition of a Palestinian State, a State which can coexist with Israel, if military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip does not cease, the issue cannot be resolved. It must be resolved, first and foremost, of course, in order to put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people, but also in order to bring more stability to the region. I hope that when the Conference of Ministers of the Union meets in Marseilles, it will be able to adopt a position on this matter which is coherent with what is always pompously stressed, that human rights must not be violated. It is essential to reinvigorate the Process and we must do so, but we must do so in the knowledge that we cannot escape the central issue of the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that this Conference is going to take place in a context of violence and of a peace crisis as a result of the conflict in the Middle East, but it is also true that holding the conference will enable us to keep the flame of the Euro-Mediterranean process burning and that it should not be contaminated by the tragic conflict. There are many common problems that are currently affecting the Euro-Mediterranean area: illegal immigration, poverty, foreign debt, human rights, drought and terrorism, which mercilessly destroys the lives of innocent individuals and families, as we are tragically experiencing in Spain, Algeria and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Now more than ever we need to proclaim that only regional cooperation, dialogue with civil society, economic and cultural exchange, solidarity and mutual understanding can make the two shores of the Mediterranean a prosperous and peaceful area. The Commission and the Council need to urgently undertake what was agreed in Feira and they need to make a common policy for the development of the Mediterranean region viable. We cannot and must not waste our human resources, our agricultural, industrial or traditional craftsmanship resources which, along with such vital products as oil, gas and new technologies, should be basic tools for the development of a Mediterranean society that is much more balanced, fair and competitive than at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will come back to the conflict in the Middle East; not two months ago, the Presidents of the Israeli Parliament and the Palestinian Assembly united in this House with the President of the European Parliament, in a plea for peace and harmony, and we all joined in hearty applause for that gesture. When weapons replace words, dialogue and understanding, the foundation and substance of democracy that is Parliament fails, and this is also our failure. It is a warning call to the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean area, which historically and culturally has enriched our European continent. It would be an error not to take on the leading role that history requires of us.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I also think, Commissioner, that the borders that geo-politics demands should serve to prevent the free movement of those who make a way of life out of organised crime, the trafficking of arms, drugs and human beings and particularly terrorism, a way of life that is condemned by all civilised countries. Let us make borders a real filter for crime and criminals, and not a barrier to development, culture or the prosperity of peoples. The European Union needs a new culture of immigration and a better management of migration flows. The European Union is jointly responsible, with the countries of origin, for immigration and for organising those migration flows, which are so necessary for the development of the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When things go well in the South, peace is possible, democratic progress can be achieved, there is more economic development and less illegal emigration. In short, there is hope. When things go badly in the South, we have war, violence, fundamentalism – and this also affects the areas in Europe in which we live – not to mention the risk of a new oil crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, once again, we face the worst possible scenario. This is quite clear from looking at current events. Some of us have been saying all this time and time again for many years in this House. Unfortunately, for many years, too, factors such as the enlargement of Europe to the East, the Balkans crisis and wars have displaced the South in the minds of a great many Europeans, hence the repeated delays in Mediterranean processes and policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen cuts in appropriations and problems in harnessing these appropriations. The general negotiations are bogged down; there are delays in the negotiations for association agreements and even greater delays in ratification procedures. This creates the most serious disappointment in our partners in the South and our political influence, that of Europe, has suffered as a result, even though we continue to be, in spite of everything, the foremost financial backers of the South.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore, as several of us have said this afternoon, immediately tighten up our political objectives with regard to the South, support the appropriations that have been committed, expedite the association agreements with the partner countries, make the Charter for Peace and Stability a priority once again, make great efforts to assist development and do something about the burden of debt of the poorest countries. At long last we must open up our markets to their produce, and standardise our regulations for the reception and asylum of persons immigrating into Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we must restore Europe’s confidence in its determination to achieve a real partnership with the South. Everyone is aware of this. We must make a quantitative, but also a qualitative effort. The Commission and the Council claim to want this. We are willing to believe them, but the countries of the South need more than just promises and speeches, and it is up to us to give them those things.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt, Marseilles is our last chance for that. This is one of the major issues of the French Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is the economic pillar which is brought to the fore. In this instance, as at the EU-Asia Summit meeting, ASEM III, in Seoul a month ago, the European Union is once again seeking to export its own economic model and its capital. Marseilles too, the other summit, brought together the members of associations, trade unions and political bodies from all around the Mediterranean, and these people were together attempting resolutely to find solutions to meeting the needs of their peoples. As far as I am concerned, this necessarily involves using new means, and hence cancelling debt.</p>
<p class="contents">What is much more serious, however, at the very moment when we are calmly exchanging points of view, often very divergent ones, within this Chamber, more and more Palestinians are being killed. The European Union must, as a matter of urgency, strongly condemn the Israeli attacks on the Palestinian people, whose demand to live in peace in their own state is a legitimate one and one which must, therefore, be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I have seen that in all these documents on strengthening the Barcelona agreement we are forgetting some things. One of them is that liberalisation, a single market, cannot be established without taking care of some important aspects, such as people and culture or education. If we liberalise the markets and encourage a drive to integrate them while forgetting this, we run the risk of ultimately achieving colonisation rather than cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to think outside the principle of subsidiarity or go beyond it and realise that it needs to provide a great deal of aid in order to raise the level in the recipient countries, among both men and women, not only of basic education but also of minimum education, which in Europe is considered to be for all citizens. Therefore, we cannot just talk about products and the organisation of markets without thinking about those citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that we are also forgetting another important subject, which is the environment. Europe has not produced any policies on desertification or on water that benefit the Mediterranean countries and we need to think about a Mediterranean environment policy that understands the location, the systems and also the climatic diversity of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Policy as it is set out today could not be transferred to many countries of the southern Mediterranean. In this respect, we need to take into account that in Europe there is serious pressure from citizens of the north on the southern Mediterranean, through tourism. With the rise in crude oil prices there is going to be much more pressure on the Mediterranean. This translates into the consumption of the land, and a policy of environmental dumping, which is absolutely unacceptable. Also, we cannot demand that European citizens properly implement their environmental policy and not apply this to other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
