These are the words of Mr Kinnock, the vice-president of the Commission in charge of reform, in the Commission’s consultation paper dated 18 January 2000. It was on this premise and with the noble claim that it would not repeat past mistakes – the last Commission having been brought down just under a year ago as the result of fraud and irregularities – that the Prodi Commission took office in September. The Commission must be measured against this claim and its self-evident obligation, as guardian of the Treaties vis-à-vis third parties, to guarantee that their application begins at home.</p>
<p class="contents">It was against this yardstick that the Committee on Budgetary Control came to the conclusion, as the leading committee, that it would recommend that discharge be postponed until 15 May 2000 and would call on the Commission to adopt 17 measures. These measures relate mainly to four areas which still require clarification or the oft-quoted fresh start.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the error rate of over five per cent calculated by the Court of Auditors over several years must be cut considerably by 2001 and a positive declaration of assurance must be achieved by 2003. Secondly, the particularly blatant cases of fraud and irregularity in connection with the Fléchard case, ECHO, MED and contracts awarded to visiting scientists must be fully clarified and dealt with in disciplinary terms. Thirdly, Parliament must be given unrestricted access to information and documents for its control activities, as called for in the 1997 discharge resolution. Fourthly: reports must be filed on the relevant disciplinary hearings and fundamental reforms implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee did not pass this resolution lightly and finally adopted the proposal submitted by a large majority of 19 votes to 1. The fact that this motion was tabled in the form of a compromise between the four main groups demonstrates clearly that Parliament is pulling in the same direction on this extremely important issue and wishes to signal its unity over and above party political divisions and any national interests or chauvinism. The Commission should agree to it if it wishes to retain its credibility in its handling of the taxes paid by European citizens and its democratic dealings with the elected representatives of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel particularly strongly about the integrity and the ability of the European executive to act, especially in view of the imminent enlargement of the EU, because the Commission needs to have its hands free for political policy-making and must not be hampered by time-consuming and irritating justification campaigns. Parliament takes the control function assigned to it in the European Treaties seriously. All the cases of fraud and irregularity addressed in the resolution relate directly to the 1998 financial year, even though some originated much earlier. All the measures called for must be carried out by the deadline set. All the cases are awaiting a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the new Commission cannot be held directly responsible for the cases I have referred to, even if not all the members of the Commission are new. But it is responsible for dealing with this legacy and it will only distinguish itself positively from its predecessors if it takes a ruthless approach and clears up every last one of these cases. The Commission should also take a close look at how it treats officials who deserve the highest respect for their courageous sense of civic duty in dealing with irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite countless lofty announcements, there is as yet no real evidence of a fresh start. Commissioner’s Kinnock’s reform paper, which is broad in scope if nothing else, sets off every single alarm bell in the area of financial control. Decentralisation must not result in the total <span class="italic">de facto </span>abolition of internal financial control. On the contrary, care must be taken to ensure that reforms concentrate on basics and that the principle of quality before quantity still applies.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is this: “Words enough have been exchanged, let me at last see some action. While you fashion compliments, something useful may happen.” You see, good old Goethe had the right words even in this situation. In this sense, I see the motion for a resolution as a chance for the Commission to justify the trust which Parliament demonstrated in it and its President when I was nominated last September and which it reiterated in its discharge for the 1997 budgetary year.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion should also send out nothing more and nothing less than a clear signal of Parliament’s support to the President of the Commission, who unfortunately is not with us here today. I should like to call on the President to grab this chance and to make use, where necessary, of the powers to issue directives granted to him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rühle (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a number of difficult decisions to take this week. Controlling the Executive is one of Parliament’s main rights and that right centres on budgetary control. However, it is difficult to grant discharge for a budget which is two years old and this problem is exacerbated by the fact that it was not the responsibility of the present Commission but of its predecessor, a Commission which resigned because it failed to take its responsibilities seriously enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Our yardstick must therefore be the central issue of what the new Commission’s attitude is towards responsibility. A good example of this, in my view, is the discharge for the Development Funds. Our Committee had confidential information on mismanagement and irregularities which amounted to suspicion of corruption. In response to our questions, we received only inadequate information, for which we had to wait a long time. The majority of the Committee therefore decided to suspend discharge in order to obtain more information.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, however, we have good news to impart. Together with representatives from the Commission and the parliamentary Committee on Development we have drawn up an action plan, which can be implemented by 15 May. I am therefore able to correct my report in this respect, i.e. we shall replace my report with this specific action plan and propose that we suspend discharge until 15 May and we shall then grant discharge on 15 May on the basis of the Commission report on the action plan. I think that this development clearly demonstrates the direction that we need to take. The Commission and Parliament must work together and must create greater transparency in relation to the budget and its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I was forced to include another postponement in my report, this time in relation to the Economic and Social Committee. There are again problems with the Economic and Social Committee in relation to travel costs and mission expenses. It took the Committee over 15 months to refer justified cases of suspicion of fraud to OLAF. Discharge therefore had to be suspended pending the results of the OLAF investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another problem with the Economic and Social Committee, the problem of buildings. We are still paying rent for the Ardenne and Ravenstein buildings. We are also paying rent for the Belliard building and Parliament must pay for its new building. This means that European taxpayers are currently paying rent for three buildings. We want to exert pressure here to ensure that the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions move into the Belliard building as quickly as possible. However, we have not moved for a postponement in this area because we hope that a satisfactory solution can be found and that we can grant discharge for the buildings in the 1999 budget with no further pressure needed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should just like to say on the subject of buildings that better management is needed at European level. There are similar problems with the European Court of Justice. The Court of Auditors has drafted a special report on this subject, which will be reflected in the 1999 discharge procedure. As rapporteur, I should like to suggest that we need better cooperation between the various institutions at European level as far as the management of buildings and rents is concerned and that we should learn from each other’s mistakes so that, here too, we use the European taxpayers’ money in a responsible manner. As a new Member, allow me to point out that there are serious shortcomings in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have little time left, I should like to give a very succinct and concentrated presentation of the rest of my report. We are able to propose that the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors be granted discharge. Both institutions gave highly satisfactory answers to the criticisms in my report and we have had prompt and comprehensive replies to our questions and comments. We are also able to propose that the Dublin agency and the Thessaloniki agency be granted discharge. However, we would like to see the contradictory procedure shortened for the agencies. We welcome the fact that the agencies have decided to carry out an evaluation and we expect this evaluation to be submitted by December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, as a new member, I should like to reiterate my belief that the procedure for the 1998 discharge represented an important step forward in reinforcing the taxpayers’ confidence in the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kuhne (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent days, just before the debate on this report, certain areas of the media created the impression that we needed outsiders to open our eyes to shortcomings in our own institution, as if Parliament would operate double standards, by being intensely critical of the Commission, but turning a blind eye to its own shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to report quite unequivocally that neither applies. My draft report was presented to the Committee in all language versions on 10 February this year and all the shortcomings reported in the press, such as the article in the <span class="italic">European Voice </span>about 10 days ago, have already been addressed in an open and critical manner in the report. There has been no whitewash. The report before Parliament today both contains a description of the shortcomings and lays down clear conditions for the attention of Parliament’s administration, including deadline commitments, which clearly show what needs to be done in order to rectify these shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, contrary to the Commission discharge procedure, we have no cause to complain that we did not receive certain documents. Some were perhaps a little late in arriving, but they did all arrive. That is another difference in the discharge procedures. We here in Parliament certainly have cases of mismanagement in certain areas which need to be criticised and cleared up, but we have no legacy such as cases of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">I say that in order to highlight an important difference, because interested parties have “let it drop” that, if Parliament is using the same yardstick, then it should come to the same conclusion and cannot postpone discharge for the Commission on the one hand and be prepared to discharge itself on the other. I am all in favour of the same yardstick, but the same yardstick does not necessarily give the same results. We should not sit down with the strategic far-sightedness of garden gnomes and say, now we must kow-tow to those who have given the impression that we should go around in sackcloth and ashes just so that our decision to postpone discharge of the Commission seems more credible. Were we to do so, I can assure you that, within half an hour of the vote on Thursday, you would hear the sound, from Brussels to Strasbourg, of the champagne corks popping in many a Brussels office in which many people would be delighted if Parliament were to make the content of its own discharge the variable upon which the Commission discharge depended. If we did that, there would not be a single Commission over the next 20 years which needed to fear Parliament’s discharge or, at most, its merciless opportunism!</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to come now to the question of where the shortcomings which we must clear up lie. We must, for example, reverse the trend whereby the number of direct contracts has increased dramatically in comparison with the number of open competitions. This refers mainly to the fixtures and fittings in this building. It is not a procedure which is illegal per se and it would be wrong to assume that it were. However, we must insist that this trend be reversed in order to reinstate a sound administrative culture. This direct contract procedure must not catch on and become the predominant procedure. In the long term, it would mean accepting cost increases on orders without being able to check if they could be obtained more cheaply elsewhere, which is why this trend must be reversed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is this: Parliament has lost several cases on personnel issues before the European Court of Justice over recent years and the verdict of the European Court of Justice has been harsh and clear. It has been clearly stated that our own, previously public, competition criteria have been broken for certain positions in order to lever certain persons into those positions. Parliament and its members must ensure that there is no place for this sort of thing in our House and that we keep our employees motivated by ensuring that they can be certain that promotions and recruitments are made on the basis of merit and qualification, not cronyism.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point addressed relates to the question of buildings. We have come to the conclusion that Parliament is in an extremely difficult position, for which the Council is mainly to blame. The Council finances its own building out of compulsory costs in the budget but has denied Parliament the facility of direct financing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not in favour – and I say so quite clearly, despite all the difficulties which we have to overcome – of sending yet another box of chocolates over to the Council in its building and tying yet another ribbon around it and saying, all right, we profess our faith in the fact that the whole procedure is beset with legal problems. We have already discussed them at length. We have received every document written on the subject. What I say is, whoever still has a problem should please go to the European Court of Justice and get it cleared up there, rather than turning plenary into an extrajudicial seminar. They should also consider what it means, from a political point of view, if we go ahead and give these sweets to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The inventory has been addressed. Mr Seppänen addressed it yesterday. The report itself lists the difficulties which have arisen, the huge number of items which have disappeared or, to put it bluntly, been stolen. In the meantime, thank God, we have introduced an electronic inventory system in Parliament. We are now waiting for an explanation as to how this electronic system functions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to come back to the question of yardsticks and results. If the majority in Parliament decides, not for reasons which have something to do with this report, but for reasons which have to do with the fact that certain groups have more skeletons in their cupboard than others when it comes to what they have done with their group money and what they have done with party financing; if a majority plays pass the parcel with this report, then we here in Parliament will end up in the position over the next few weeks of having to ask ourselves what future the Commission and Parliament discharge procedure has, now that it is no more than an excuse for party political manipulation and manoeuvring. I hope I do not have to sit in such a Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mulder (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the discharge which we are discussing today, as far as agriculture is concerned, pertains to 1993, 1994 and 1995 and you may well wonder why we are so late. The reason for this is that we delayed the discharge for 1992 for a long time, because we had made certain requirements of the Commission which up to last year it had failed to meet. We are pleased to note that this has meanwhile been rectified. So what exactly were Parliament’s requirements? </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we asked for 15 extra jobs to be created in the inspection department within agriculture and for the financial corrections to be increased from 10% to 25% maximum, in case something went wrong with agricultural expenditure. This has since been done and we are grateful for this. It still causes Parliament some concern that the jobs have not yet been filled and that it is extremely difficult to do so. </p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, the error rate for agriculture is below the general error rate for the budget. Where the general rate is 5%, as already mentioned, that for agriculture is 3%. This is moving in the right direction. This may also partly be due to the fact that agricultural policy has changed over the years. I believe it is easier to keep income policy in check than it is price policy. There has since been an increase in expenditure for development within rural areas but I will come back to this. </p>
<p class="contents">Special attention should also be paid to the European revenue. Although the own resources are falling, they are still an important source of income and it has now been decided that certain Member States are allowed to retain 25%. This is all the more reason why the Commission should keep tabs on all the money coming in to which the European Union is entitled. </p>
<p class="contents">What does the Committee on Budgets mainly want? First, the Commission should work towards driving back the current error rate within the short term. In my opinion, we should be able to have a 1% error rate within a number of years. One way of achieving this is to establish an estimated reliability level for each sector. This is something which the Commission could undertake itself. What is the error rate in the milk sector, the dairy sector, the cereal sector, etc? In this way, the various offices will benefit from a healthy rivalry. Everyone wants to outstrip the others and agriculture would be able to take the wind out of the sails of the other budget components.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, we have also talked about an integrated management and inspection system for agriculture and lamented the fact that many countries are still unable to meet this requirement. I think it is about time this stopped. We have stipulated in the resolution that the Commission will have two years to solve this and I have been given assurances that this should be possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Although the agricultural budget components are scrutinised, they cannot be scrutinised in the same way as guaranteed expenditure, which is down to the Guidance Section for agriculture. We think the Commission should come up with proposals to actually apply the financial corrections system to structural expenditure for agriculture. In common with the Court of Auditors, the Commission is also concerned that huge mistakes are still being made in the export refunds system. </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets, therefore, recommends discharge. There are, however, a few problems remaining, one of which I have already mentioned, namely export refunds. We are expecting a report on this. We are also waiting for a report from OLAF on fraud involving the aid provided to flax in certain countries, notably Spain. Finally, and I may come back to this at a later stage, we are waiting for a report from the Court of Auditors on the Fléchard affair. We can grant discharge to the Commission without these three elements. </p>
<p class="contents">There is something else. Since 1995, there has been a conciliation committee for agricultural expenditure. If there is a difference of opinion between the Member States and the Commission on the financial correction to be imposed, we can call upon a conciliation body to mediate. We have as yet to be convinced of the usefulness of this conciliation body. The Commission has promised to assess this. We look forward to the findings because we would like to considerably reduce the number of court cases at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So Amsterdam provided two new elements in addition to the principle introduced in Maastricht in accordance with which Member States are obliged to adopt measures comparable to those they take to combat fraud harming their own financial interests. These two new elements mean that the European Parliament now has powers of codecision, and that the protection of the Community’s financial interests will have to be effective and equivalent. The entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam therefore means that the principle of the equality of all citizens and of the equivalence of all acts in the eyes of the law must be applied in the area of the protection of financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are now considering the first legislative measure on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force. This is an amendment to a regulation designed to prevent fraud and other irregularities relating to the common agricultural policy. In 1970, the CAP accounted for up to 87% of Community expenditure and this amount has gradually fallen over the last three decades to around 45% of Community expenditure today. It is therefore understandable that legislation for preventing and combating fraud should have developed independently for the CAP and not in relation to the general rules which apply to the whole budget. Until a few years ago, even the policing of fraud in agriculture was not overseen by the appropriate department, which was UCLAF, but by the Directorate-General for Agriculture itself. Now that the Treaty of Amsterdam is in force, this situation is no longer acceptable. We cannot allow the protection of the Community’s financial interests to continue to be undertaken on the basis of loose, unconnected and contradictory legislation which deals with the various attacks on the Community’s financial interests according to the specific amount at stake and not in accordance with principles of fairness.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As regards protecting our financial interests, we must put a stop to the rigid divisions between the various chapters of Community expenditure and ensure that no double standards are involved. Reform of the Commission cannot continue to be seen as a stream of meaningless clichés and as a hypothetical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of various models of ex ante and ex post control and of decentralisation. Instead, it should be seen as the determination to put an end to feuding and to bureaucratic sectionalism.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we propose that this House should request that the legal basis for regulating the prevention of fraud and other irregularities be changed from Article 37 to Article 280. In the same way that the Commission and all the European institutions have finally accepted and understood that all action in the fight against fraud must be undertaken in an effective and equivalent way, by entrusting OLAF with this task, the Commission must now accept that legislation on preventing fraud and other regularities must also be developed in an effective and equivalent way, in strict observance of the Treaty of Amsterdam. We are confident that the Commission will ultimately be able to agree fully with this principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have decided to give the discharge on three conditions, and the conditions are clearly spelt out. We hope that by 15 August those concerned will give us the information that is requested. What I find extraordinary is that EUR 2 billion are being managed by this vestige – the last remainder of the European Coal and Steel Community, which, of course, was very important historically but is not important any more. It is being wound up and it is remarkable that such an instrument should continue with that budget and 145 staff. I believe such an instrument should be wound up as quickly as possible so that it is incorporated in perhaps a reformed European Investment Bank: a European Investment Bank that is transparent and accountable. Such investments can and should be made by professional banks rather than the little outfit that we have at the moment. The number of people employed for the amount of money being invested is again quite disproportionate. I am hoping that this can be wound up speedily and incorporated in either the EIB or the European Investment Fund, because that would be a better way of using the money and resources.</p>
<p class="contents">This is for the social and research fund, but again these objectives could be better addressed by a bank that would ask other banks to manage investments so that we have the highest return.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the three conditions, the conditional discharge and the obligations on those concerned to address these conditions will be taken seriously. Far too often in the past we have found that promises have been made and not kept. So I hope that the answers will be given to Parliament and to the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that is about all I need to say. On that basis I recommend to this House a discharge.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have, what is more, received no complaints from any officials at all. I am not aware of any vengeful articles by investigative journalists, or any OLAF inquiries, and personally I have not managed to discover any proven cases of mismanagement, fraud or misappropriation of funds in our sector. In a word, as far as our committee’s area of competence is concerned, there is nothing to prevent the discharge being granted to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">And now, to express my own personal opinion, I would like to say more generally that I support the conclusions of Mrs Stauner’s report with a view to postponing discharge to the Commission for the year 1998. The citizens’ primary right is to see that their money is managed and spent properly and as long is this is not clearly established discharge must not be granted. I should, however, like to make two observations. Settling political scores or making personal attacks must not be mistaken for combating poor management, irregularities and fraud. In this context, it is essential to prevent a climate of political vendetta arising between the main institutions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is that, in my opinion, it is essential to be as implacable in criticising oneself as in criticising others, and I therefore wonder about the effects, which I expect to be disastrous, of postponing discharge to the Commission on the one hand, even though Parliament is prepared to grant its own discharge, despite the administrative problems it acknowledges, and although the political groups gloss over their own administration. My personal preference would be for adopting a more self-critical attitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission has paid over the odds most of the time because the beneficiaries had failed to declare non-eligible costs.

Alas, I sit here between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, I would and should recommend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism too, that the Commission be discharged due to the satisfactory take-up rate of the budget lines which affect us, despite numerous critical comments. On the other hand, I cannot in fact recommend discharge due to unclarified incidents at the Commission which are beginning to threaten the very existence of regional project agencies and which, as the representative of my home region, I have been fighting to have clarified for months.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, certain measures dating back to before 1989 have still not been completed. Secondly, the irregularities identified by the Court of Auditors refer mainly to errors in relation to proof of expenditure which are signed by Member States, and for which they are responsible. The Commission is indirectly and to some extent jointly responsible here insofar as it should have issued clear rules for grants and aid. Thirdly, delayed payments by the Commission which unsettle and, sometimes, ruin our citizens, as the result either of transgressions or inefficient bureaucratic structures and cover-ups or liquidity problems following cuts in payment appropriations by the Council.</p>

We have translated this criticism into a number of very concrete questions, answers and proposals in order to make drastic changes to the policy as it is being adopted now and will be adopted this coming year. To our great delight, we are also at the dawn of a drastic reform of development policy. Policy as it was adopted in 1998 by Europe as one of the world’s key players did not really have a clear poverty focus or clear-cut, result-orientated objectives and, as such, it was difficult to judge whether we had achieved our goal. </p>
<p class="contents">We have now agreed to re-arrange the entire budget in a number of clearly defined sectors according to international agreements in the field of poverty control and, following on from this, to submit annual reports on the results within the various sectors to our Parliament. It has also been agreed that in these sectors, clear objectives will be formulated and that, in these objectives, basic health care and primary education will be considerably reinforced as components of social development. This is not just restricted to either the European Parliament budget or the EDF budget, but refers to the total. This brings us to the desire and agreement that the EDF, even if it is just in terms of figures, will at least be absorbed into the 2001 budget, so that we in Parliament can actually see where the money is being spent. After all, we are talking about a huge amount which the European tax payer expects to be used to combat poverty. If we look at what really happens, however, it is often not about a child who goes to school or food which is grown locally in a more productive way. Very often, economic interests of the various Member States in Europe take priority over poverty issues in the relevant countries. In terms of inspection, this is all undoubtedly neatly justified in accounts, but is incorrect in terms of content. This poverty focus is essential in order to actually get value for money. </p>
<p class="contents">We hope that, with the inclusion of the EDF in the 2001 budget, even if we do not have any formal budgetary authority there, we will be able to pursue a more result-orientated policy by breaking it down into clear sectors. Then there is still the staffing problem. Many shortcomings, the lack of spending and the fact that 80% of the commitment appropriations are sometimes not spent, are due to an organisational structure which is inadequate, not sufficiently decentralised in the various relevant countries and guided by a form of regulation which does too little examining after the event and is too bureaucratic before the event. In the light of this, there is a great need for reform on this score. We at the Committee on Development and Cooperation have every confidence that we can bring about this reform thanks to the agreements we have reached with the Commission. Further to the agreement we concluded with the Committee on Budgetary Control, I also expect that the action plan on 15 May will help us at the Parliament to turn a corner, in tandem with the Commission. I would like to underline the confidence we have in the Commission and all its Commissioners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, for the second time this year, we are debating the discharge of the Commission for the budget of a previous financial year. Two and a half months ago, you granted the Commission discharge for the 1997 budget. That discharge was accompanied by numerous, far-reaching calls to the Commission which provided strong momentum and incentive for the reform of the Commission and which are incorporated in the Commission’s White Paper. I should like once again to extend my thanks on behalf of the Commission, especially to the rapporteur at the time, Mrs van der Laan and, in this context, to the rapporteur for the reforms, Mr van Hulten.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are debating the discharge for the 1998 financial year. Under the European Treaty, Parliament has a duty to audit the accounts, the statements of assets and the annual report of the Court of Auditors, together with the replies from the bodies being audited. In its report on the 1998 financial year, submitted in November last year, the Court of Auditors granted the Commission a declaration of assurance with regard to receipts and the handling of commitment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors did not grant the Commission an auditor’s certificate establishing that payments had been implemented in a lawful and proper manner. The error rate was considered to be too high by the Court of Auditors. As the Commissioner for the Budget, I subscribe fully to the opinion that, in some areas, the shortcomings in the implementation of the budget are simply unacceptable. That is why I immediately took the initiative, in my official capacity, of drafting an action plan listing specific measures sector by sector on the basis of a specific timetable, in order to reduce the number of errors identified.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly 90% of all errors identified or highlighted by the Court of Auditors concern the Member States. The majority of payments out of the EU budget are paid not directly by the Brussels administration, but by administrative units in the Member States. This decentralised implementation of the budget has numerous advantages, but, of course, it also calls for efficient and close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the SEM 2000 programmes and decentralised management measures, Mr Kuhne has dealt with these questions in detail and I should like to thank him for his work in this area. The Council, which recommended discharge for the Commission, included the question of shared management in its debate on the 1998 budget discharge and the proposal was mooted that the Member States should perhaps set their own objective for reducing shortcomings in the implementation of EU funds, an interesting proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission will step up its efforts to formulate more manageable financial rules for the administrations in the Member States and to provide advice and information, especially on the control systems. Alternatively, should it prove necessary, the Commission will use financial corrections to refunds paid to Member States as a monetary lever, as is the case in agriculture. The fact that the error rate for agricultural expenditure is well below the error rate for the Structural Funds is perhaps due to this financial correction instrument. My colleague Franz Fischler will go into this in greater detail in a moment but I should like at this point to thank Mr Casaca for his report and to congratulate Mr Mulder on his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors made no critical remarks on the budget for the European Coal and Steel Community and I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai, for the report which he has just presented. The European Court of Auditors also issued a declaration of assurance for the budget of the European Development Fund, although it did find cause for complaint. Overall, there was a clear drop in the error rate for the Funds in comparison with previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this gives the Commission no cause whatsoever for complacency. On the contrary, the Commission also wants to achieve more satisfactory results for this financing instrument, which is so important to development policy, and this applies in particular to the question of the speed of aid. You addressed this point, Mr van den Berg. This is also one of the concerns of the rapporteur for this area and I should like to thank you, Mrs Rühle, for your willingness to include the arguments of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the Commission in your report and to propose an action plan and also, at this point, to thank Mr Blak for his preparatory work in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative, budgetary and control powers of the individual institutions overlap even more in the European Union than they do in the Member States. It is therefore essential that we act in unity if European policy is to work. This presupposes a clear and reliable division of tasks, which is why current talks and negotiations between Parliament and the Commission on the agreement, which also includes the question of access to and dealing with confidential information, are extremely important. The chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, also has a very responsible role in this respect. It is in all our interests for these negotiations to come to a swift conclusion, hopefully with results which enable there to be a good policy and collaboration on such important matters as discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made a commitment to transparency and openness. These are not just empty words as far as the Commission is concerned, which is why I have transferred all the confidential audit reports needed to the Committee on Budgetary Control, or rather to the rapporteur, during the course of the discharge procedure and which is why the Commission has also replied in detail to questionnaires, even though this differed from past reporting practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has nothing to hide and this Commission sees it as its duty to support Parliament fully in the performance of its duties. But we need a procedure which safeguards the confidentiality of information and, more importantly, the principle of the rule of law whereby people cannot be pre-judged. That must also apply to the Commission staff, just as it applies to people who belong to the other European institutions and to all our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is called on in the report adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control to answer various questions or take direct action by 15 May. I should like to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control for this resolution and also for the deadline attached to it. Some of the points refer to dealing with so-called old cases, i.e. cases of irregularities or suspicion of fraud from previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say quite clearly at this point that the Commission will do everything within its powers to fight fraud and that applies not only to the future, but to clearing up past cases. This Commission has no fear of any findings. The Commission has proven this in the so-called Cresson/Barthelot case by passing documents to the courts, introducing disciplinary proceedings, lifting the immunity of a former member of the Commission, giving the investigating magistrate access to the Commission premises and demanding repayment of missing EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">But I repeat: for the Commission, the rule of law applies. This means that it cannot of course influence judicial proceedings, even if they are unsatisfactory, as for example in the ECHO case, on which the competent courts, which received the file a long time ago, have still taken no action. It also means that proportionality is required when meting out punishment and demanding refunds and this applies both to demands by the Commission and to refunds demanded by the Member States. The European Court of Justice again made that clear in its most recent judgement a few weeks ago, when it halved or even cancelled fines in the case of the cement cartel.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Franz Fischler will shortly be going into the question of the agricultural budget in connection with discharge in greater detail. But I too should like to say at this point that I do not see the letters drawing the Commission’s attention to the fact that companies may fold or jobs be destroyed following certain Commission measures as an illegal attempt at intervention, irrespective of whether the letters originate in Parliament or in a Member State and regardless of whether they come from France, Ireland or Bavaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, decisions must be taken where there is room for discretion and they must be taken according to clear rules and in a transparent manner. I shall fight for clear rules within the framework of the financial regulation. Of course the Commission will take very careful notice of the Court of Auditors’ recommendations and findings in the so-called Fléchard case and all I can say is that I, for my part, am very grateful to the Court of Auditors for taking on this task. </p>
<p class="contents">I am not in a position at this point to go into the individual points of the resolution in detail. However, the Commission will immediately notify OLAF of your demands and, as far as the administrative investigation is concerned, I have set the procedure of clarification in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">Your resolution insists first and foremost on a reduction in the error rate. I can assure you that the Commission is doing everything it can to achieve this, which is why we submitted the action plan, containing specific measures with specific deadlines and which is why we are completing revising the financial regulation and I shall shortly be reporting on this to Parliament. This is why the European Anti-Fraud Office is being reinforced. This is why the Commission has started reforming financial management as a whole by increasing the responsibility of everyone who handles the money of the European taxpayers, by improving efficiency and by setting the clear objective of restoring trust in the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will do everything to ensure that the reform is a success and it would be a good thing if all the European institutions were to expose themselves to such reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to restrict my comments to the so-called Mulder and Casaca reports. Mr Mulder, I should like to start by thanking you on behalf of the Commission for your report on granting discharge in respect of the decisions on clearance of accounts of the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF for the 1993, 1994 and 1995 financial years. The main thrust of the report is that clearance of accounts for the expenditure financed by the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF was a job well done. This can also be seen from the financial corrections quoted under number 1.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider this to represent a certain degree of acknowledgement and, at the same time, to be an order to do even more in the future. I expressly state that I agree with number 4. The date of April 2002 is needed in order at last to guarantee the proper operation of the integrated administration and control system in all the Member States. It is also a prerequisite to our being able to reduce the error rate still further. As regards the question of building up a central database containing data on all payments to final beneficiaries, I should like to draw your attention to the following. The interaction between the common agricultural policy and the final beneficiaries currently passes via approved paying agencies in the Member States. These agencies have all the data on the final beneficiaries and the Commission services naturally have unrestricted access to them. However, I should like to stress that the Commission does not need a central database per se in order to exercise its control function and I would therefore suggest that a cost-benefit analysis should be considered here.</p>
<p class="contents">A study is currently examining if it is technically feasible to set up a central database for recording all payments and hence all final beneficiaries. Even if it is not prescribed under law, it could of course simplify a number of operations, not only for the Commission, but also for the Court of Auditors or OLAF. The Commission is aware of the fact that the European Parliament considers it important to know the names of the recipients of the largest sums. However, I should point out here that, because of data protection at Union and Member State level, it would be impossible to publish such information, even if it were technically feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as staffing the clearance of accounts unit is concerned, I can confirm, Mr Mulder, that only the three posts of the new unit leaders have yet to be published. The recruitment procedure for the remaining six posts has already been completed, or will be shortly. The Conciliation Body referred to in number 16 of the report is one of the measures which should ensure that efforts to speed up the procedure do not compromise the quality of document audits. However, this is only a consultation process and it is the Commission itself which takes the decision in all cases. I can also assure you that refunds and the aid regime for flax and hemp will be examined very conscientiously. Corrections totalling EUR 249.8 million were made to refunds for the financial years from 1994 to 1998. However, before we can make any further corrections for subsequent financial years, we must first carry out the scheduled control visits.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude with a few comments on the declaration of assurance. It is proposed in the resolution that there should be a separate declaration of assurance for the EAGGF and the individual sectors. This question is, of course, addressed first and foremost to the Court of Auditors. The Commission notes this proposal with interest. A first step in this direction should of course be a declaration of assurance for individual policy areas, i.e. separate declarations for the agricultural fund, the Structural Fund and so on. This alone would considerably improve this instrument. And finally, my thanks in this respect to the Committee on Budgetary Control for their excellent cooperation in drafting the report.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words now on Mr Casaca’s report. I should also like to thank you, Mr Casaca, for your report. According to Council Regulation No 723/97, the Community contributes towards the costs “incurred by Member States in implementing new action programmes, arising out of new Community obligations, approved by the Commission and aimed at improving the structures or effectiveness of EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure controls”. The purpose of the proposed amendment tabled here is to improve controls. In addition, provision is made for the Community to make a contribution in cases in which the Commission calls on the Member States to carry out additional controls over and above the minimum rate laid down in the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make the following comments on the proposed amendments. The Commission cannot, unfortunately, accept proposed Amendment No 1 insofar as the rapporteur proposes changing the legal basis for the regulation from Article 37 to Article 280. The Commission takes the view that Article 37 of the Treaty is the correct legal basis because the most important objective of the proposal is to prevent irregularities in EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as proposed Amendment No 2 is concerned, the Commission cannot accept the part which refers to the second paragraph of Article 5a, in which mention is made of administrative and staffing costs incurred by the Commission in administering this scheme. I agree with the idea behind the proposal, i.e. to ensure that the Commission has sufficient means at its disposal to perform its tasks, but the proposal confuses the administrative and staffing costs incurred by the Commission which are covered solely from Part A of the budget with the operational costs in Part B of the budget and I am unable to agree to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, fellow Members, Mrs Schreyer, Mr Fischler, I should like to make one thing clear from the outset: postponing a discharge is not tantamount to refusing a discharge, irrespective of what is always wrongly assumed. On the other hand, granting discharge is a serious procedure with serious consequences in that the controlling body answers for the fact that the activities and financial conduct of the body being controlled have been correct from a legal, economic and political point of view. This responsibility on the part of Parliament vis-à-vis European citizens and taxpayers is a heavy burden, which is why discharge for the Commission’s management of the budget cannot be reduced to a compulsory, but somewhat tiresome annual exercise and I am sorry that the President of the Commission could not be here today.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, what is needed is a thorough examination on the basis of pertinent sources of information and a conscientious appraisal of the results. And that is what we have done in the Committee on Budgetary Control over recent weeks. The rapporteur, Mrs Stauner, and the draftsmen of the opinions of the other discharge reports and working documents, whom I should like to congratulate on their work, have based their work first and foremost on the annual and special reports of the Court of Auditors and on the Commission’s replies.</p>
<p class="contents">The sources for the information and documents needed from the Commission, on the other hand, gushed little, if anything at all, despite a great deal of paper and, unfortunately, no clear answers were given to the questions asked. When the Commission then writes to complain about the questionnaires and working papers of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, that shows that something has gone wrong with the flow of information between the controlling and the controlled parties and this must be rectified as quickly as possible. We are working on that. Mrs Schreyer also mentioned it. However, I am warning you that the Commission is heading straight for the same fate as its predecessor.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 276 of the Treaty, Parliament, and hence the Committee appointed by it, is entitled to any information or documents which it needs or demands in order to prepare its discharge. This includes reappraising old cases. The rapporteur quotes four cases by way of example. Other cases should be on the list, but the Commission has unfortunately not yet passed them on, despite the date of March 2000 set in the 1997 discharge. Here too the Commission misunderstands our basic cause for concern. The rapporteur and the Committee on Budgetary Control are not holding the present Commission per se responsible for the deplorable state of affairs in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">The resignation of the previous Commission did not put an end to it. On the contrary, the new Commission was completely aware of all the outstanding accusations before it entered office and it undertook to assume responsibility and establish transparency. I take this to mean that it must clear up all the old cases without exception and – where necessary – must pass them to the courts. Cover-ups or even sweeping issues under the carpet are not the answer. On the contrary, the answer means being prepared to draw conclusions from the unhappy events of the past, so that the same thing does not happen again in the future. This ranges from precise filing rules, so that documents cannot simply disappear, to a fundamental reform of disciplinary proceedings and much else besides.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach also informs the White Paper on the reform of the Commission tabled by Mr Kinnock. Mrs Stauner’s report lists our short-term demands with respect to these conclusions and we all consider that they can be met by the stated deadline. The Committee debated them at several meetings and finally adopted them with one vote against. Here we must thank the rapporteur for her honesty, on the one hand, and for her perfect readiness to compromise, on the other. One of the most important objectives that we consider the Commission should achieve is to reduce the error rate in payments to well below the persistent figure of 5%. I know, Mrs Schreyer, that you have tabled an action plan. Nonetheless, the error rate has remained at the same high level for the last five years. We shall have to debate this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also know that most errors occur in the Member States and we are prepared, as a committee, to discuss this with you. Nonetheless, we take the view and the Treaty states that the Commission is responsible for implementing the overall budget. Excuses and promises are no use. We need clear proof of improvement. On balance, my conclusion is that we need a strong Commission, which is able to act, which works openly together with Parliament and which supplies Parliament with all the information needed or requested.</p>
<p class="contents">Using the pressure of postponement to advance discharge is constructive pressure because it gives the Commission the chance to clear up shortcomings caused by slowness, pettifogging or unwillingness so that Parliament will be able to grant discharge for 1998 as quickly as possible, hopefully before the summer recess. I think that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, should direct his team forcefully here in order to take transparency in Europe a stage further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control has considered several reports recently, mostly relating to the 1998 discharge procedure. It is a strange time for us to be considering how the Commission is faring after its forced resignation last year due to many of the issues highlighted in the 1996 discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">The discharge procedure is, of course, an opportunity for the European Parliament to exercise its responsibility in terms of monitoring the Commission and the other institutions' behaviour. We check their accounts. We ensure that policies have been well managed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission spent the last year preparing for a radical reform, outlined in the White Paper presented on 1 March, and we appreciate that it will take more than a few months to turn this massive tanker around. Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee are, however, keen to ensure that the reform occurs at a speedy pace, which is why we have decided to postpone discharge in the expectation that the Commission will hit the targets that we have set them within the next two months.</p>
<p class="contents">The report as it stands at the moment is very different from the initial report that was submitted by Mrs Stauner on behalf of the EPP Group. That was clearly used as a political battering ram. Mrs Stauner quoted Goethe. I will quote Shakespeare. The report was full of sound and fury signifying nothing. That is why the explanatory statement attached to this report has not been agreed by the Budgetary Control Committee. It makes no sense in the context of the postponement report, and it is totally nonsensical and hysterical in tone.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted that there was an almost unanimous consensus, however, on the new practical approach to the general discharge. We would like to thank the rapporteur for her cooperation on that. We expect and hope that the Commission will deliver and the rapporteur will perhaps take a more considered approach in her final report. But one thing which has become manifestly clear to me during this process is that we need an overhaul of the discharge procedure to avoid this kind of confrontation again.</p>
<p class="contents">This discharge procedure should be an opportunity to study systems failures within the Commission. In an ideal world, it should be based on the Court of Auditors' Report, but that does mean that both the Budgetary Control Committee and the Court of Auditors must develop a much closer relationship. There is a massive amount of expertise in the Court of Auditors, expertise that Parliament should draw on in order to reach its own political conclusions. The discharge procedure should not be a time to score political points nor to hound individuals but, where systems fail and lead to inefficiency or – worse – to fraud, it is the duty of Parliament to correct them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also make sure that we find a mechanism within this system to make sure that we take account not only of the reports that are submitted by members of the Budgetary Control Committee, but also those by members of other parliamentary committees.</p>
<p class="contents">In postponing the discharge, we have set out clear points that we expect the Commission to act upon. Never again will we accept the situation where we cannot get to the bottom of a case, because documents have gone missing. Clear lines of responsibility must be established so that if problems occur, disciplinary action will follow. Never again will we accept a situation where misconduct or a bad administrator will be judged by his or her peers. We expect an external element to be included, as advised by the Committee of Independent Experts. These are just two examples of how the Commission can improve its act in the short term without waiting to implement all the recommendations of the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a question to answer as to whether the current Commission should or can take responsibility for the mistakes and problems of the past Commission. Let us not forget that here we are considering the discharge for 1998. If we took this to its logical conclusion, it would mean that Parliament could only judge a sitting Commission during three years of its tenure. That is why it is clear that we must address systems failures rather than attack individuals or individual Commissioners who may no longer be involved. We do not want witch-hunts. We want answers as to how best we spend European taxpayers' money.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to turn very briefly to the other reports that we have considered in committee, and first of all to the Kuhne report on the European Parliament. Mr Kuhne has done an excellent job as rapporteur for the Parliament discharge. There is no doubt that there have been vast improvements in Parliament's performance. Our financial control system does not have the quantity of payments that the Commission has and therefore things are more manageable. We have had everlasting problems, of course, with the buildings, often through no fault of our own but because decisions have been imposed on us by the Council. If the Council had any concern about budget control, we certainly would not be sitting in this building right now.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a great deal of talk about a report on political group expenditure. The fact is that our committee has not seen this report. It has still not been published officially, and therefore it is difficult for us to comment on it. But transparency is a principle that we must hold dear in this context. I am delighted that Mrs Rühle has done such a great job on the EDF report. Mr Mulder has done a great job as well, displaying his usual wizardry with the EAGGF accounts. We support Mr Casaca in his approach, although we did not expect the Commission to support us on that of course. We certainly do not expect the Council to support our position on the Casaca Report.</p>
<p class="contents">We are voting for postponement on many accounts. The important reports, of course, will come next. We hope that we will be able to develop a better approach in the next part of this discharge procedure. It is important that we find a new way of doing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President, for all your kind support over the years for the Budgetary Control Committee. It is always greatly appreciated.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All I can say at the beginning of this first debate is that the Commission would do well to go through the resolutions with a fine tooth comb, because this time Parliament is serious.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Stauner report is concerned, the liberal group is able to support the compromise resolution. We are in favour of the Commission publishing an extensive report before 15 May which covers all the points we have raised. In common with Mrs Theato, we hope that everything will be signed, sealed and delivered before the summer. I should add that we, as a group, have less appreciation for the explanatory note which the rapporteur has added to her own resolution. This was already mentioned last night. In our opinion, an explanation should reflect the resolution itself and should not include any new elements. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a brief comment on the report by Mr Kuhne. We too have a great deal of appreciation and admiration for the way in which Mr Kuhne has drafted his report. If we are to criticise the Commission, we should perhaps make sure that we have put our own house in order first. It is difficult to scrutinise somebody else if we as Parliament do not ensure that we are completely beyond reproach ourselves. I also think that Parliament’s administration would do well to stick to the many dates and deadlines included in the Kuhne report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to come back to the Stauner report and a number of points made in it. The Court of Auditors will shortly be publishing a report on the so-called Fléchard affair. There have been many speculations in the press, in Parliament, and so forth. We must not get ahead of ourselves. A few things are already clear, however, irrespective of the fraud affair itself. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, how is it possible for documents intentionally to go missing from the four Directorates-General or directors dealing with these? The documents disappeared everywhere simultaneously. The big question to the Commission is: what has it since done on this score? Secondly, we would like proportionality explained. Should large businesses pay larger fines than small businesses? Thirdly, where does the Commissioners’ responsibility lie? To what extent can officials decide some things for themselves? This is an extremely political issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The following general rule will need to apply to this Commission: the error rate is too high. It is not enough to say that it should come down. We need a plan of action: by such and such a year, the Commission should bring the error rate down to such and such a level. Then Parliament would know where it stood. The Commission would then have a goal to work towards and we could market ourselves better to the general public. This is what it is all about at the end of the day. Europe’s ideal needs to be preserved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, we had no party political axes to grind in our committee and we obtained a broadly-carried compromise across all groups with just one vote against.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that the new Commission is making an effort, but the 1998 discharge is at issue here and we must take it very seriously. We must restore the public’s lost confidence in the European institutions. We must re-establish confidence and that means that, as a committee, we must make a critical examination of the 1998 budget. We want neither to play down nor sensationalise the problem. On the contrary, we need to exert constructive pressure and we see the decision as a chance, not a punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our yardstick was how responsibility and transparency were dealt with and requires an open approach to shortcomings and an open approach to mistakes. We hope that the action plan will help the administration to achieve better management. We also take the view that the same yardstick must then be applied to Parliament and in this we completely disagree with Mr Kuhne, although we welcome his critical report.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism is just one side of the equation; consistency is the other and we hope that a majority in Parliament will vote to postpone the decision, subject to the clear condition that the administration of Parliament must also table an action plan to improve management. The questions of the award of contracts, buildings and staff are at issue. We know all about the pressure of time up to the point of discharge. The report by the financial controller, for example, was submitted relatively late. Obviously it was not possible to submit this action plan in time for today’s decision. However, we call on Parliament for precisely this reason to vote for a postponement here, so that an action plan can be drawn up jointly by 15 May. This too we see as an important chance for Parliament to restore confidence and make it clear that it takes its own administration and the shortcomings in its own administration seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also highlight something else, since Mr Kuhne appeared to be hinting that a hush-up would be in the groups’ interest. I can only say, as the new treasurer of the Greens, that I went to the administration and to the Court of Auditors back in November or December and pointed out that I had discovered a number of errors in the management of the finances on entering office, that there was mismanagement and that I would fight to get this mismanagement dealt with over the next three months. I also pointed out that I was in favour of maximum transparency and openness in this area and that we urgently needed to address the financing of European parties in order to be able to refute the accusation of indirect party financing which was rightly being levelled at Parliament. We need clear-cut criteria and clear-cut guidelines. We must do away with grey areas at European level because, as we all know, grey areas can and will always be abused, which is why we want transparency and openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and openness mean – and this is my clear call – that we must apply the same yardstick to all the institutions. We should vote for a postponement whenever we are of the opinion that an action plan can be drawn up within a month which will show the public that we take our errors seriously and are trying to correct them and I would stress once again that it has nothing to do with dismantling institutions; on the contrary, we want to strengthen them and we want to restore trust in the eyes of the public in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is particularly problematic in matters of finances. Parliament could achieve it, and it does wish to, which is clear from the reports now under discussion, but it lacks credibility in this area. To maintain its own self-respect Parliament must accept the rules and regulations for the Members forthwith. Parliament must investigate the misappropriation of funds by its political groups. Our group will not agree that the practice of party aid should be introduced at the taxpayer’s expense to cover up such malpractice. Parliament must investigate why it was so lax in its vigilance when it came to millions of euros’ worth of Parliament property disappearing. I do not really understand why it should discharge itself just now, when the report by the Court of Auditors of the European Communities on monetary and economic issues for 1998 is being prepared and is about to be published.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you how difficult it was in Parliament to raise the issue of malpractice on the basis of the accounts of the Commission for 1996. I would remind you how the Social Democrats in particular defended Mr Santer’s Commission, and how we were obliged to compile a list of Members’ names when passing a motion of censure. Those parliamentary members that compiled the list were obviously right. The 1998 accounts and data give weight to earlier conclusions: Mr Santer’s Commission appears to have approved a framework of budgetary discipline in which it was possible for malpractice to exist. The members of the Commission in many cases are not themselves guilty of furthering their own interests, but the officials continue to act as before, and this Commission must take them to task. To support them will be the fifty or so trade union officials employed by the EU, defending people who are guilty of malpractice. They are the home guard for the officials that have behaved dishonourably. Most of the officials in the EU are diligent and decent people. In this case there is a need for increased vigilance, and that is something Mr Santer’s Commission was unable to achieve. It would appear that Romano Prodi’s Commission has not got off to a very good start in this respect either, and the President of the Commission, in particular, has delivered opinions that show that the notions of public accessibility and transparency are not being honoured in this Commission. However, postponing the discharge is justified and is the correct course of action in this situation. We want to give the Commission the opportunity to improve the way it does things and show that it is able to do the job it inherited from the previous Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though it is not a question of discharge being refused at the present time, the postponement is a consequence of the Committee on Budgetary Control’s not having been able to obtain adequate information on time, of documents’ having disappeared and of the fact that there is so much that can be criticised in the financial and administrative spheres that the impression is one of dealing with a South American banana republic rather than with a supranational European organisation. These extraordinary results from a seedy administrative culture go back to 1998 and are not this Commission’s direct responsibility, but it is the present Commission’s responsibility to show that the misconduct, fraud and betrayal of mandates which have taken place really do belong to the past. We have still not obtained proofs of this in all areas. We have heard excuses, often in a dismissive tone, from the Commission, as if it were the Commission which was to be giving <span class="italic">us</span> discharge, rather than the other way round. We have seen an express reluctance to hold those officials to account who are responsible for the circumstances open to criticism. It is not that there are no rules. Rather, it is a case of rules having been quite deliberately set aside in many areas. </p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Kuhne rightly pointed out, it is important that we should also direct criticism against Parliament’s own economic administration. I would especially point out the quite unacceptable buildings administration and the way in which the rules for using the competitive tendering procedures were circumvented. The impression cannot be avoided of systematic nepotism of precisely the kind which the competitive tendering procedure should prevent. We shall therefore vote against the discharge for Parliament’s 1998 accounts. If there are no dramatic improvements in the financial administration, European taxpayers will know how to react against this irresponsible misuse of their money. The Commission must understand that they are not Europe’s overlords but the servants of European citizens. I should like to emphasise that there is broad agreement within the Committee on Budgetary Control about postponing the discharge for the most important accounts, and I would thank the rapporteurs for the splendid and painstaking work they have carried out. I would also especially draw attention to Mrs Stauner’s and Mrs Rühle’s very efficient work, just as I should like to thank Mrs Theato for her very conscientious and effective leadership of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Mrs Theato should know that we value her desire to call a spade a spade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite ironic that this should happen at a time when a draft report by the European Court of Auditors is being circulated which shows that our Parliament has not exactly spent the taxpayers’ hard-earned money wisely either. In the light of this, it might be expedient to establish in all honesty at this stage that the reproaches which we are quite rightly hurling at the European Commission today might well be heading in our own direction tomorrow, again quite rightly. Indeed, if we are to believe the draft report, the groups deal with the many millions which are made available to them for God knows what reason in a very careless, even fraudulent manner, and the administrative department of this Parliament gets off anything but scot-free, to put it mildly. </p>
<p class="contents">This is just to add to the issues which have been dragging on for many years, such as the nonchalant way in which we deal with the expenses we are paid as MEPs, in principle with a view to recruiting personnel, or the way in which we handle the building policy of this Parliament, which is so strange as easily to prompt thoughts of large-scale fraud. In short, today we are quite rightly acting as the plaintiff, but we need to be very aware of the fact that, tomorrow, we will be in the dock ourselves. The fact that this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black should not, however, be any reason for tolerating deceit, fraud and further theft of taxpayers’ money and should not, especially, give certain people any excuse for tolerating these things. Nor should it be any reason or excuse for allowing those who have lined their pockets and taken advantage all these years to go unpunished. </p>
<p class="contents">I only wanted to make the remark because I am quite convinced that fraud and mismanagement are inherent and are causally linked to systems where there is no obvious connection between revenue and expenditure, between the levying of taxes, on the one hand, and the policies being financed with these taxes on the other. In my own country, for example, I know of projects which have been launched with so-called European money which would never have been accepted or requested by the people, if it they had known that their own tax money would be used for them. European money is always spent with less thought than tax money which has not made a detour through Europe. This is done under the motto: if we do not spend this European money, somebody else will. This may sound harsh or even simplistic, but that is how it is. </p>
<p class="contents">I have not even mentioned the overlap which exists in a large number of these European credits. National states provide development aid, so does Europe. National states combat racism, so does Europe. National states support the women’s movement, so does Europe. National states support the trade unions and parties, so does Europe. National states support all kinds of Third Way movements, so does Europe. And so on and so forth. Manna falls from heaven and nobody knows whether it is all spent wisely, or worse, we know for a fact that a great deal of that money is not spent wisely, but there are no complaints because, in the case of European money, a kind of pro-European goodwill is systematically bought from all kinds of pressure groups. </p>
<p class="contents">Returning to today’s topic, I would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Stauner, on her report. It is true that the explanatory note to the resolution reads much like a piece of crime fiction. It contains scandals which are now out in the open about waste, nepotism, theft, the Fléchard affair, the ECHO affair and such like, not to mention the direct involvement of Commissioner Cresson. There is no need to keep on about what is stated quite clearly in black and white in this report. I would only like to add that I, as representative of hundreds of thousands of tax payers, am shocked to find that the present Commission too is manoeuvring in all kinds of directions and making all kinds of attempts to protect a number of people responsible for this mismanagement. I think that we need to do some straight talking to the Commission and that we may have to penalise their persistent bad conduct with a new crisis of confidence after 15 May, if necessary by means of a motion of no confidence, because desperate situations call for desperate measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to complement Mrs Stauner on a good report. My group will not grant discharge in connection with an account which conceals more than it reveals and has been submitted by a Commission which despises openness, subsidiarity and democracy. How is it different from the Commission which was overturned? Are our rapporteurs now getting complete information and full answers in response to their questions? No. Have administrative procedures been instigated against those who had their hands in the till or covered up for those who had their hands in the till? No. Has Mr Paul van Buitenen been rewarded for his courageous efforts to turn the Commission into a responsible organisation? No. He has moved to Luxembourg and has had to agree to keep quiet. Moreover, any future van Buitens know that they will be fired if they behave as any person of integrity would expect of officials of the Commission. Mr Prodi’s Commission is not responsible for the sins of the past, but all 20 Commissioners are now responsible for the fact that procedures have not been cleaned up and put in order and a fresh start made. It is you 20 who are responsible for the fact that the Commission’s draft regulation on transparency will cause documents which are at present readily available to be locked away. It is you 20 who are responsible for the fact that we, as Members of Parliament, are still not receiving the information we request. You operate on the principles of absolute monarchy. Come out into the open and acknowledge that it is no longer possible to govern with old-fashioned secrecy. Admit that you will be replaced if you continue to sweep the dirt under the carpet. You will soon have been in office for a year, so we have to observe that you too will be accountable if you fail to meet your responsibilities. And we must apply the same critical standard against ourselves. We ought not to approve Parliament’s accounts for as long as we have assistants who do not pay tax and yet obtain social security and for as long as travel expenses not connected to actual costs are refunded.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, a few years ago discharges in this House used to be perfunctory debates, certainly not held on Tuesday mornings. But we now have a wider remit to discuss this subject. and over the last few years it has been realised that discharge is a very important part of the life of the European Union. Under Article 276(2), the EC Treaty requires the Commission to submit to Parliament any necessary information on the execution of expenditure and operation of the financial control systems. Article 276(3) of the Treaty requires the Commission to take all appropriate steps to act on Parliament’s observations concerning execution of expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not be any surprise to outside observers, or those in the system, that as Parliament has become more authoritative in ensuring the democratic accountability of the institutions, it will not be simply fobbed off with a lack of reply to questions which have been asked, however far they go back into the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate all the rapporteurs on the discharges before the House this morning. I have a few comments on Mr Kuhne’s and Mrs Stauner’s reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the question of the Parliament discharge. There has been significant progress on a number of issues outstanding but it is clear from Mr Kuhne’s report today that there are still a number of issues to be clarified: the question of the calls for tender; the issue of the financing plan for buildings; the question of the security service for this House here, and not least the question which is raised under paragraph 15 of the Kuhne report, concerning personnel policy. Here it states and I quote: “deplores most strongly the residual impression left by these cases, whereby it would appear that favouritism plays a significant role in the granting of appointments to high-grade posts within the administration of Parliament”.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take the context of this report we will see that it has to stand on its own merits. If we add to that the Court of Auditors’ report on the operation of the political groups, we have come to the conclusion in our political group that we need to postpone discharge on its own merits. It is not a question of the popping of champagne corks between Brussels and Strasbourg, that is an irrelevance if I might put it politely. It is not a question of parallelism, it is a question of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the admissibility of the amendment, I draw to the attention of the services of Parliament and to your attention, Mr President, the fact that Annex V of our Rules of Procedure does not apply to the Parliament discharge but applies to the Commission discharge and therefore our amendments should be considered to be admissible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I turn to Mrs Stauner’s excellent report and the explanatory statement. It is a pity Mrs Morgan is not still here in the Chamber, because I understood her to say that you cannot just leave a discharge to systems alone; it is the question of access to information, so that we as a Parliament can grant discharge. You can ask for access to information, but if you do not get it then you have to start applying a certain rigidity and postpone discharge. The explanatory statement very clearly sets out the reasons for so doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I come to two points here. The first is access to information. We do not have at this time a framework agreement between Commission and Parliament – that is still outstanding in the context of Annex III. Why? Because Parliament and the Commission cannot agree about what access we have to information. The impression is left that we are foot-dragging, but in fact we are not getting complete answers to the questions put by Mr Bösch and Mr Blak. Parliament is not getting the answers it requires.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the question of the disciplinary procedure. It is an arbitrary procedure. It seems that high officials get off and ex-parliamentarians, who are in the Commission services get downgraded for no apparent reason and against the information available. I am thinking of the case of Mr Zavvos in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we, as a Parliament, should look at each of these cases as it stands. My group will be in favour of postponing discharges both for the Commission and for Parliament until all the information is available to us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact has been overlooked today that, if memory serves me well, this is the first time the finance ministers of this Union have not unanimously recommended that the Commission be granted discharge. So things are not improving, Commissioner Schreyer; they are obviously going in the opposite direction, which is why we must follow the recommendations proposed by Mrs Stauner in the Committee on Budgetary Control as closely as possible. As far as the information policy is concerned, I am in full agreement with Mr Elles.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not holding you responsible for past errors, but I believe that, pragmatically speaking, we are entitled to expect two things of you. Firstly, you must ensure that monies paid in error or, as in the Fléchard case, sums waived in error are recovered. In other words, you must repair the damage to the taxpayer, insofar as it can still be repaired. Secondly, you must ensure that the people responsible for mismanagement and erroneous developments are punished consistently, if necessary by making them compensate for part of the damage caused out of their own pocket. That would represent two innovations at the Commission because, as far as I am aware, officials implicated have never yet had to pay money back into the EU budget. The provisions of the financial regulation on this point do not need to be revised. We need no reforms for the purpose, we merely need to apply these provisions, otherwise they will remain dead letter.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, you will understand, I think, that we have serious doubts about some of the proposals which you have put before the European public in the much-publicised Commission reform. I need only refer to your plan to do away with independent – I repeat – independent financial control or your plan to delete provisions on the financial liability of authorising officers from the financial regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that some people have been living in glass houses in Brussels for a very long time. If any of us goes to our constituency and tells our voters, now that one Commission has had to resign because of fraud and misconduct, that independent financial control and the liability of officials are to be deleted from the relevant provisions, then, by God, we shall have done Europe a bad turn. Mrs Schreyer, Members of the Commission, use the postponement of discharge for the 1998 budget as an opportunity to show that the new team is strong on management and able to act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our most powerful weapon in this regard is the discharge. This is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of postponing discharge, as suggested, until such time as the Commission has fulfilled our specific condition. In this way, we can keep the pressure on and bring about real reform. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Council failed once again this year to follow the good example of Parliament, and discharge for 1998 has been granted as if the matter were quite insignificant. This is particularly regrettable because the national governments are responsible for 80% of European spending and are, as such, responsible for a proportionate share of the irregularities. It is now high time that the Council followed our example and searched its own heart. </p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that our discharge resolutions are effective. This is borne out by the far-reaching reforms which the Commission has now undertaken. I would like to illustrate this with a recent example. Our pressure has prompted the European Commission to undertake drastic reform in foreign policy. I am keen, therefore, to share with you my initial reaction. The plans for changing the project cycle and transforming the SCR into a European bureau are a positive step forward. But the real political prioritising we need for the purpose of employing our very limited resources is still lacking. </p>
<p class="contents">The attention paid to the discharge granted to the European Commission is overwhelming, but I am of the opinion that the discharge granted to the European Parliament deserves just as much, if not more, attention. Within the European Commission, a drastic reform programme has been launched at our insistence. Unfortunately, it has proved impossible so far to take the same drastic steps in this House. </p>
<p class="contents">The Kuhne report is Parliament’s first report which takes discharge seriously. Not only did Mr Kuhne manage to identify the sensitive areas where all the key points were concerned, he also managed to set fixed deadlines. This is what Parliament will be judged on and he deserves our true appreciation for this work. </p>
<p class="contents">Some claim that the European Parliament should be judged by the same stringent measures as the European Commission. I do not share this view. In my opinion, we should raise the standard for ourselves. We are the controlling body. We have the direct link with the citizen. We are primarily responsible for restoring their confidence in the European project. This is why it is not enough to measure up against the non-elected officials within the Commission. We should outstrip them by far. Unfortunately, nothing is further from the truth. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphatically lay the blame for Parliament’s bad image with those who have always had a majority. The two large parties are responsible for the ethos of nepotism and underhand dealing which permeates this House. But the small parties too which have mismanaged the party funding have once again put our name in a bad light. </p>
<p class="contents">The Kuhne report will be an important weapon which can be used by those in favour of reform in this House. But whether it will be adopted at this stage remains to be seen. There is in fact a risk that, if we grant discharge to ourselves whilst not having done so for the Commission, we will then take the edge of this report and this is exactly what we do not want to do. We must think very hard about this so that we can actually restore the citizen’s confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the attitude we must adopt in this difficult exercise constituted by the annual discharge. Mrs Theato was right in stating that granting discharge is a serious matter. To grant discharge is, when all is said and done, to grant a certificate of good management. I would like to thank all rapporteurs, but also the Committee on Budgetary Control, for all their hard work. The Stauner report, including the explanatory note – which I fully support, by the way – is very critical of the European Commission. The four largest groups have reached a compromise in which it is recommended that discharge be delayed and that the European Commission be given a list of 17 specific questions. I am in favour of this approach and as such, would like to ask you to adopt Mrs Stauner’s report without any further ado. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to comment on the Kuhne report. I am not trying to argue that what is wrong is right. I wish to make it absolutely clear here that the Kuhne report does not follow this theme. Mr Kuhne has completed an excellent piece of work. His report incisively denounces what is going wrong in our institutions. Mrs Morgan told us a moment ago that we do not want witch-hunts. But Mrs Morgan, this is not happening. What we denounce is stated quite clearly in the courageous report of our financial controller, Mr O'Hannrachain. The complaints are staggering and include a faulty inventory and many thefts. I was a victim of this myself in a previous life when my computer and printer were stolen. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are far too many restricted and private allocations. These should be the exception, but we have noticed that in 1998, 50% of the cases were awarded privately. This is no longer the exception. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to mention buildings policy, a policy in which decisions are taken step-by-step, rather like slicing a salami, and which is made up of faits accomplis. Ladies and gentlemen, we need a long-term building policy, to ensure that policy is not only carried out correctly, but that unnecessary expenditure is also avoided, a case in point being the underground tunnel being built here in Strasbourg which links the printing department in the IPE-I building to the distribution department in our building. The price tag is FFR 27.4 million. This is ludicrous! Mr Kuhne has hit out in the press and also here today at the stance taken by my Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. He is blaming us for playing a party-political game. Well, Mr Kuhne, I can assure you that this is not the case. What we <span class="italic">are</span> doing is being consistent in our approach, however. Surely, asking for our offices to be treated in the same way as the Commission is not a political game. Hence our amendment which recommends postponement of discharge for Parliament’s budget and which has given the Secretary-General a list of queries which we expect to be answered by 15 May. I am delighted to state that Mr Deprez has adopted the same stance a moment ago. I am delighted to state that Mr Elles has tabled a similar amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats. I therefore hope to receive more support for our amendment which was completely voted down in the Committee on Budgetary Control. I am now counting on a majority in the plenary meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is of direct concern to the citizens of our respective countries, since it discusses European Union finances, and the citizens of Europe are entitled to ask for explanations regarding the use made of their money.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is also important because it deals with serious inefficiencies in the European Commission’s implementation of the budget, inefficiencies involving considerable amounts of money.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group is in favour of any action which may be taken to combat fraud, by definition, and therefore shares the rapporteur’s opinion regarding the overwhelming need to make the management of the European Commission more efficient and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We are extremely concerned at both the irregularities committed within the scope of the MED and ECHO programmes and at some of the details of the Fléchard case. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group is convinced that such practices can only seriously impair the credibility and, hence, the image of the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also remember, ladies and gentlemen, that we have been forced to note shortcomings in the procedure for dialogue with the Commission, which seems not to have been able, or not to have wished, to respond to the expectations and questions of the members of the parliamentary supervisory body.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the many contentious issues still pending, whether they involve irregularities or budget funds, our Group considers that, at the moment, it is essential to refuse discharge for the year 1998. All we can do is urge the European Commission to pass on, within the necessary time limits, all the information requested by the Committee on Budgetary Control regarding the measures adopted, in order to overcome the obstacles to the granting of discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">For us to grant discharge without asking the European Commission for further details would, of course, be evidence of weakness on the part of the European Parliament. This House would lose face and would discredit itself in the eyes of public opinion in our countries, and that is something we do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the European Commission’s proposal, there could be no question of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group’s accepting sharing responsibility for the decision on discharge. The Treaties clearly establish the exclusive competence of Parliament in matters of budgetary control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its 1998 annual report, the Court of Auditors mentioned an unacceptably high error rate and felt compelled, would you believe, to issue a negative Statement of Assurance. As long as the Commission does not commit itself to drastically reducing that error rate from the beginning of next year, we cannot grant discharge to the Commission. The Stauner report deserves every support on this score. </p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament set high standards for the Commission, but do we set them for ourselves too? We are right in insisting that the Commission base its budget on accurate estimates, but how accurate are the estimates for our own budget? Year in year out, many EP budget lines show up enormous surpluses which are subsequently used to purchase buildings by means of a collective transfer. I cannot help thinking that many administrative expenses are intentionally estimated on the generous side in order to have the extra funding for buildings in reserve. These shady tricks must stop at once. </p>
<p class="contents">We also need to search our own hearts regarding public tenders. It is unacceptable that the number of privately awarded contracts in 1998 increased to half of all contracts. Why such a steep rise? The Secretary-General has mentioned a few procedural reasons, but is this the full story? A clarification regarding this drastic rise is urgently required. </p>
<p class="contents">Rapporteur Kuhne also puts his finger on the problems regarding the financing of the Spinelli building. This is the umpteenth affair involving new buildings. Is it not about time we commissioned an independent inquiry into the decision-making process for building projects? </p>
<p class="contents">We can no longer afford to cover the above issues with the cloak of charity. We need to exert parliamentary pressure to bring about the necessary reforms. We will therefore support the amendments to postpone discharge until such time as the Secretary-General has produced concrete plans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Beginning with the most important discharge, the discharge of the Commission’s accounts – in political terms, the most relevant and, in terms of quantity, the most significant – we are aware that your responsibility in terms of expenses is limited and that a majority of the responsibility in the field of expenses lies with the Member States. It is important that you try to become, firstly, an example for the Member States to follow and that, therefore, you understand that we demand more of you, if possible; and one day we will have to start to talk very seriously about these cases which are always detected in the Council rather than in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore I would like you to look at Mrs Stauner’s report from the most positive point of view possible. All the groups have reached an agreement to raise 17 questions in relation to certain cases. They are not the only ones. We could have mentioned other problems arising from the TACIS or PHARE programmes. After the crisis of the previous Commission, which you have begun to deal with, what we want – because we believe in your intentions and we want a strong and independent Commission and we are therefore giving you time – is for you to give us a positive response to certain very specific cases. I can assure you that you will be able to reply in the affirmative to each of the cases which we are putting to you. Therefore, between now and the summer, we could hold a sitting for the purposes of discharging the accounts. Not only are we as interested as you in the discharge of the accounts, but in fact we are more so. I would therefore like you to study the report which has been presented by Mrs Stauner with the broad consensus of the Groups.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a political debate, and you must understand that we need you to act. Documents must not disappear. You must do something, irrespective of the fact that I want us to reach an agreement soon on the way we will have to deal with the documents you call confidential. As rapporteur for the 1999 Commission budget, I would love to be able to do my work in the clear knowledge of which documents we have access to and which we do not and why.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you an additional piece of information. This debate must not concentrate excessively on the accounting issues. As you can see in this budget, this is a political debate which goes beyond a strict examination of what you have done with regard to the 1998 budget. It is a general debate. We will also have to reach a framework agreement on how we can include in this debate – which is becoming increasingly important – not only accounting issues but also issues from other years relating to expenditure or management.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that an unknown amount of money is lost through fraud or misappropriation. You are facing a great challenge, because even more resources are lost through a lack of motivation, that virus which has infected the entire administration of the Commission and which you must eradicate. More resources are lost through lack of motivation than through misappropriation. This is a quality issue which will also have to be increasingly discussed in the context of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I will refer finally to the European Parliament’s budget, and I would like to reply to those people who say that, since we are supposedly tough and demanding with you, we must also be so with regard to our own institution. Of course we must. However we must not compare separate issues. For example, the auditor has not detected any irregularity in Parliament’s budget. We must therefore be prudent and fair and try to treat everyone as they deserve. The same must be demanded of Parliament as of all the others, but this is our House, we have more information and we can therefore take a different approach when it comes to proposing, as the Kuhne report does, a conditional discharge and not a postponement of the discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that you can reply to the 17 questions we have raised. We want you to do so, and we understand that in that way we can support you so that you, who have just joined this Commission, can really control your house. ‘Take the bull by the horns’ – as we say in Spain – and we will be able to achieve a discharge for this year on the part of the majority of the Groups in this House before the summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission maintains that the matters in question do not fall under the 1998 discharge. That is not the case. All these matters surfaced in 1998 and they should therefore, of course, also be dealt with under the 1998 discharge. The Commission has, on the whole, employed many dodges to avoid responding to our questions, and that is completely unacceptable. The Treaty is clear: in accordance with Article 276, Parliament is entitled to obtain all necessary information in connection with the discharge procedure. I should like to give an example. In accordance with general practice, I, as the rapporteur responsible for the subject of development aid, sent the Commission a questionnaire concerning ECHO. It was sent to the Commission in November. Only in March did I receive an answer in which, moreover, I was told to take a running jump. In the meantime, Mrs Fontaine received a letter from Mr Prodi, stating that the Commission was tired of answering all the stupid questions from the Committee on Budgetary Control. Excuse me but, either the man has been out in the sun too long or he must have some incredibly bad advisers. The Commission is obliged to answer our questions, irrespective of whether or not it likes the content of these. Until they understand this, I think we should postpone granting discharge. I hope the Commission will take our demands seriously. If they do not, we shall be ready to send them on a very long holiday in May. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to explain what the ECHO case is about. First and foremost, I should like to emphasise that this is not a smear campaign directed against individuals, but a question of putting matters in order. What signal is being sent out to present and future leaders of the Commission when the people responsible escape indictment? The ECHO scandal has still not led to any repercussions. The case is at present before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg which admits that nothing will probably come of the case and that it will no doubt refer it to the Belgian authorities in a couple of years’ time. The problem is that the ECHO case is not about property crime. It is about gross negligence and about an official who has taken decisions without regard to the finance regulation. The decision to exonerate the previous director was taken by the previous Commission, and this was a political decision pure and simple. Now, the Commission has until 15 May to solve the problem. If they do not come up with satisfactory solutions, I shall campaign for our obtaining a parliamentary committee of inquiry which can examine the matter in depth. I also think it is a good idea to look a little more closely at the discharge for the development fund. There are still unresolved demands but, if we postpone granting the discharge, this will be accompanied by clear demands upon the Commission. The Commission’s delegations have failed. There are several examples of cases where they could have prevented fraud if they had been just a little observant. Unfortunately, there are too many delegations which are just there for the ride. I have therefore asked permission to prepare an own-initiative report so that we can have these issues clarified. The final thing I want to say is that the Commission should undertake to refer the fraud cases to OLAF. I obtained 11 reports under Pentagon-like conditions, but OLAF still does not know anything about these. I therefore think it is time that these matters were tidied up, and I am pleased that Mr Nielson has now shown that he wants to get this process under way. I look forward to seeing the results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its importance is evident in the fact that in many cases it is now being proposed that the discharge should be postponed. As far as the Commission is concerned, this is the fifth year in succession that the Court of Auditors has not delivered an unambiguously favourable verdict. As the Member States, that is to say the Council, has advocated discharge, this is almost a matter of structural conflict. Apparently, the Court of Auditors should specify the shortcomings and incidences of malpractice in more detail and place less trust in mathematics.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I say this, in no way does this diminish the Commission’s responsibility, which is a great one. The reports concerning discharge show just how badly administrative reforms are needed. Commissioner Kinnock’s package of reforms must be pushed through without delay. The main focus is the reform of internal auditing in each of the institutions. Administration and auditing must go hand in hand to preserve a sense of personal responsibility and help it grow. The present system, in which it takes various signatures to authorise payments, does away with the notion of personal responsibility. It is totally impossible to find anyone who will take responsibility. Improving the quality of administration is a basic requirement for a greater sense of responsibility and better efficiency. Increased control is only a reflection of the fact that the organisation has failed.</p>
<p class="contents">The main financial difficulties focus on the largest budgetary category, agriculture. This is because agricultural aid is largely based either on land area or the number of livestock, and the Member State in question pays it. This development is largely due to the WTO agreement, which determines the various forms of agricultural aid, their classification and the desired trend it should adopt. The system has led to a tremendous amount of bureaucracy, an enormous increase in monitoring, and, in the long term, we can assume it will also lead to inefficiency and the entrepreneurial spirit of agriculture will vanish forever. At the same time, the European farmers have become the most closely observed section of the population on the Continent, and, for that reason, I am hoping for a lucid clarification of the agricultural aid system at the forthcoming WTO talks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, over the last few days we have read in the press that the European Parliament is a haven for thieves. This is both embarrassing and distasteful. We must act in such a way that EU property is treated with the same respect as other property. In this connection, we must check up on the matter of parliamentary administration. In the EU budget this year there is an appropriation of EUR 300 000 set aside for an investigation into parliamentary administration. According to the budget, this investigation will be given to an independent expert. What has happened to this investigation, why has it not got under way, and what is going to be done about it?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This applies when small family-run farms, such as those dedicated to producing milk, find themselves outside the subsidy arrangements and find their very survival is threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that the Commission’s proposal to amend Regulation No 723/97 and to change the legal basis of the Regulation on preventing fraud and other irregularities from Article 37 to Article 280 of the Treaty, as the rapporteur Mr Casaca proposes, is extremely timely. This will ensure that agricultural expenditure is treated like any other expenditure involving EU resources, and this will strengthen Parliament’s power of intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was perfectly aware of its importance. However, what we could not foresee was that, with the vote on the overall report, outbursts very similar to those at the time of the refusal of discharge for 1996 would occur once again. To refer to the corresponding passages on research, I also make a statement on what have deliberately and disparagingly been referred to on occasions as old cases. Old cases are not the same as obsolete cases; they are an outstanding burden which the Commission must finally remove from our shoulders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors highlighted a series of shortcomings in the research area in 1998. It complained about the pre-dating of contracts and a high overall error rate in payment audits due to incorrect proof of or information on costs, an error rate for which the Commission is perhaps not 100% responsible, but is at least 90% responsible. There is the old case of visiting scientist B and how his contract came into being. They also include the internal audit report drafted in 1997 on the area of jurisdiction of the former Commissioner for Research, Mrs Cresson. This report disappeared from the filing cabinet at the end of 1999/beginning of 2000. At the same time, there was the so-called European nuclear affair. Who then is going to be surprised that a link between the financial controller’s filing cabinet and the roaming plutonium was established at the end of 1999?</p>
<p class="contents">We might be satisfied with some of the explanations that the Commission offers for these incidents. Having spoken on many occasions, I am pleased to say, with trustworthy Commission officials, I have the impression that they are ready and willing to make corrections. As are we. But mistakes have been made and the audit was organised as politely as when an auditor visits a company. However, it was the Court of Auditors that carried out the audit, an institution that has no form of personal interest in the matter and it is no good playing down the mistakes. If, nonetheless, the rapporteur takes the view today that these cases have not been solved properly, then I would like to side with her fully and unreservedly, as did the Committee on Budgetary Control with just one vote against.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to immediately give us satisfactory answers, which stand up in public. Then everyone will have a true picture. Questions can hurt. We asked them because mistrust and criticism have been spreading since the refusal of the 1996 discharge. But what matter are the results which will be presented on 15 May. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferreira (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, representatives of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the discharge procedure is a complicated exercise. We have to assess a budget two years after it has been implemented by the Commission, while taking into consideration the budget which is currently being framed, the improvements needed for the implementation of the budget and the practical realisation of the political goals of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This already complex situation is further complicated by the peculiar situation we have found ourselves in for almost a year now, to wit, the discrediting of the European Union to a certain extent following the resignation of the Santer Commission last year; a new Commission, in which most of the Commissioners were not members of the Commission which was led to resign; a new Parliament, with many Members facing this discharge procedure for the first time; and reforms or proposed reforms directly concerning European Union finances. I am thinking of the Structural Funds for the things already achieved, and the Financial Regulation for the things already achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the context in which we received Mrs Stauner’s report, a report which, unfortunately, makes only a limited assessment of the Commission’s implementation of the budget for the financial year 1998 against the yardstick of the political goals which the European Union set itself. If it is unthinkable and intolerable for public money to be used for irregularities and fraud, and if we must both dismantle the mechanisms enabling such abuses to take place and denounce the people involved, then we can also question the methods used to draw up this report.</p>
<p class="contents">This report was unacceptable in its initial form because it did not give us the material to form an opinion as to whether or not the budget for 1998 was correctly implemented by the Commission. It has been possible to adopt a compromise, but the fact remains that we find the explanatory statement unsatisfactory, as it does not reflect the new direction of the report, and portrays relations between our institutions as frozen in an attitude of defiance, at a time when we and our fellow citizens are hoping that productive cooperation in the interests of improved cohesion between our States will develop. The content and the arguments presented in other more specific reports provide no more justification for postponement of discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me refer, by way of example, to Mr Khanbhai’s report, which revealed some problems in the ECSC accounts, including, among other things, the solvency ratio and the transfer of property, although the Commission and the High Authority are currently reducing these problems with a view to the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002. In this specific situation, it would seem that the current discharge procedure would be a perilous exercise. Should this not require giving a more precise framework to the work of Members of Parliament within the Committee on Budgetary Control?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by mentioning the internal reform of the Commission. Among other objectives, the Commission has set itself the task of improving financial control by various means: new structures, responsibilities of authorising officers, and financial controllers within each directorate-general. We must be attentive to ensuring that this reform makes it possible to achieve the set objective and that it requires the various financial operators within the directorates-general to assume real responsibility. It also seems essential that, in combination with the determination to reduce irregularity and fraud effectively, the reform should be able to look into the implementation of our policies within Member States, where one of the problems arising concerns payment deadlines and the inadequacy of some payment appropriations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One problem that I have about it is that there is a natural tendency to concentrate much more on the 4% of the budget that might have been lost, or the 2% that probably was lost, than the 98% of the budget that was properly spent. It is necessary to acknowledge that 98% was properly spent. It is also important to try to correct the situation where things have gone wrong, but in so doing not to exaggerate it in such a way as to create in the European public's mind an image of a European Union that is out of control, that is a sea of corruption and cannot be trusted with taxpayers' money.</p>
<p class="contents">There is fraud at every level of government at which I have served – local, national and European and regional. It is always there, but local and national bodies can stand up to criticism better perhaps than this younger institution of the European Union, which is less accepted. While it is important to put things right and to give people confidence, nevertheless it does not help their confidence if we exaggerate the extent to which abuses occur and money is lost.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mrs Stauner for her report. Some people have criticised it for being a bit too severe. Mrs Stauner is new to the Budget Control Committee, but her statement is a real reflection of the mood and the debate that went on. I do not agree with all of it, of course, but nevertheless it was agreed by a majority. I would not entirely accept the explanatory statement. It is Mrs Stauner's own explanation but it is the motion for resolution that we the Parliament have to decide on.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I would like to make is that in seeking to bring everybody into accountability, whether they be officials or Members of the Commission, we ought, like Mr Deprez said, to avoid this vendetta between institutions. We ought avoid particularly vendettas between an institution and individual commissioners. We should see this Commission as a college and while the individual commissioners must be held accountable, nevertheless we must take an objective view of what is going on and beware of either European party politics or international politics colouring our judgement.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I will make is that we have not only an obligation to ensure that accounts are better kept and money is better accounted for. We also have an obligation to ensure that when we make regulations they are regulations which can be put into effect. Over the years, I witnessed the making of all the regulations that are creating the problems and my experience in this Parliament was that we wanted to pander to public sentiment. We never sought to ensure that our regulations were enforceable.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Hulten (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Parliament’s refusal last year to grant discharge on the 1996 budgetary year heralded the fall of the Santer Commission. Parliament employed its powers in a sound manner under special circumstances. A college of Commissioners, which has since been appointed, has presented an ambitious reform programme. Last year’s opposition from the Commission to Parliament has now developed into good working relations. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, Parliament needs to keep a critical eye on the Commission. It is unseemly, however, to deploy the discharge procedure as a weapon in a party-politically motivated battle and, what is more, it undermines Parliament’s influence in the long run. Mrs Stauner’s motion for a resolution, which was before us initially was, in this respect, unbalanced. It over-simplified the issue and its sole aim appeared to be to malign the new Commission. Her motion for a resolution contained damning accusations regarding the Commission which, as it happens, did not even relate to the 1998 budget year. Meanwhile, the motion for a resolution has been amended drastically and the suggestion was made to postpone the discharge decision. The Commission is being given the opportunity of responding to a number of urgent questions raised and requests made by Parliament before 15 May. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to single out one point from among these questions and requests. Over the past year, it has become clear that the Commission’s disciplinary procedure does not function properly. In countless cases, no action was taken or if it was, it did not lead to any result. The procedure needs to be completely overhauled. The Commission has made suggestions to this effect in its White Paper. However, these suggestions do not go far enough. The Committee of Independent Experts has recommended the appointment of an independent outsider, preferably in the role of chairman of the Disciplinary Committee. Parliament supported this proposal in January and does so once again by means of this motion for a resolution. I would ask the Commission to reconsider its position. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s financial situation has been the subject of extensive media coverage over the past few weeks. Mr Kuhne has drawn up a report on this subject, on which I would like to warmly congratulate him. He did not let himself be talked into adjusting his well-balanced approach in the face of sometimes heated publications. The Kuhne report proposes granting Parliament discharge, provided a number of well-defined requirements are met. For example, the offices of Parliament are expected, from now on, to offer, in the majority of cases, contracts for tender which are public in nature. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Parliament needs to indicate when the reform process which is being launched within the Commission will start taking effect in Parliament. One of the key proposals is to separate the audit and financial control functions. The Commission has already indicated that it will submit proposals to this effect before the summer. I am of the opinion that such separation should also take place within Parliament. An independent parliamentary audit office needs to be set up as soon as possible whose task is to ensure the effectiveness of public spending by Parliament. Such an office should make annual – and if necessary, more frequent – recommendations regarding the working method of Parliament’s offices. Only when Parliament has its own financial housekeeping in order will it gain credibility when it comes to assessing and sometimes condemning the Commission and Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore all the more at home today in expressing the concerns I have due to the discharge procedure which is being carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to challenge the compromise which appears in the resolution negotiated between the political groups and the rapporteur. This compromise has three distinct advantages over the rapporteur’s initial draft. Firstly, it no longer uses the vehement and aggressive tone of the initial draft report, a tone which I do not find, as I might say in the style of Kenneth Starr, worthy of this House, being rather more suited to the tabloid press, and one which should not in any case be used to characterise relations between a responsible institution, such as our own, and a Commission in which we expressed our confidence but a few months ago. In this respect, the report has been improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this report ceases to indulge in the unjustified implication of officials who may have taken more or less appropriate decisions but who do not in any way deserve to be exposed to public condemnation and pilloried in a procedure which is not subject to judicial process.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this report asks the Commission questions which it can answer within reasonable time limits, enabling us to vote upon discharge within the time limits stipulated by the Treaty. These are the three positive features.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, three forms of sidelong shift which give me pause. The first is that we are forgetting what the discharge procedure consists of. We must remember that discharge involves, and must only involve, accepting the financial statements for the year and ensuring that expenditure is in order, and does not involve digging out again and again the skeletons which have been hidden away for years in the cupboards of the various institutions. It is paradoxical, and even unfair, that the report in question makes so little mention of the financial year 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The second shift in emphasis involves the failure to make it clear that the explanatory statement is distinct from the report. On the one hand, we have a dispassionate and objective report, undoubtedly insistent, but legitimately so, and on the other hand, we have an explanatory statement which, even though it represents only the opinion of the rapporteur, nonetheless is a godsend to the press. How many journalists are aware that the resolution represents the opinion of the House but that the explanatory statement represents only the opinion of the rapporteur? This gives us grounds for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final anomaly is the gap between Parliament’s handling of its own problems and Parliament’s handling of other people’s problems. We cannot adopt a sliding scale for measuring correct behaviour, and we are taking a major political risk if we are more indulgent towards ourselves than towards others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, thank you for letting me conclude. I should just like to mention the maxim that the police always catch serial killers as soon as they step up the rate of their killing. We brought the Commission down a year ago, and we had better not give in to our homicidal impulses again.</p>

Many of my colleagues have raised this issue this morning. We need better access in order to move forward. In my committee, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we are determined to take our responsibilities as MEPs very seriously indeed. We have asked Members of Parliament to volunteer to follow budget lines. These Members of Parliament are now approaching Commission services to talk to the officials responsible for those budget lines. We are having problems and we are having problems in finding out who is the right person; the people we talk to are not clear what their responsibility is, what information they should be giving us. Some services cooperate very well; some are setting up briefing meetings for Members of Parliament – but others are not.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need from the Commission is a new system. We need a better reporting mechanism to parliamentary committees, to the spending committees, so that we know what information it is going to give us. A start would be a list of who is responsible for what in which budget lines of each committee. Only in this way can we do what we are supposed to do, and restore the public confidence that Mrs Schreyer spoke about this morning. We need to know that money is being spent properly. If we have that confidence we can pass that message on to the public in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mrs Morgan, spoke earlier about the need to overhaul the whole discharge procedure. That is right. For too long discharge was seen as something bureaucratic and rather unnecessary – something to get out of the way very quickly. Now we have to move away from that, we have to overhaul it, and I hope proper reporting mechanisms to committees will be part of that overhaul.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her report. I am delighted that we now have a broad-based compromise on the issue of discharge which enables the Commission to make progress and to solve a number of problems which have cropped up recently. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on a few points which are included in the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Firstly, we share the Court of Auditors’ criticism regarding the inadequate measurability of the effects upon employment of the structural fund measures. I would ask the Commission to pay more attention to this aspect. We have, slowly but surely, made tremendous progress in this field, but this does not seem to be evident from the way we are dealing with the funds. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to mention the issue of financing. There have been problems recently regarding the payment credits of the Social Fund, in particular. Unfortunately, these problems have not been solved. This merits further attention too. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the problem surrounding the Leonardo programme. You will be aware that the Leonardo programme has played an extremely important role in the events which have led to the previous Commission resigning from office. Nevertheless, we wish to underline that this association needs to be brought to a definite close, and it is also important that sufficient consideration be given to the lessons we have learnt in the field of BAT. These are the key points which I would like to highlight here. The Committee on Budgetary Control has naturally been unable to adopt all these points in their entirety. This would not have been appropriate either, but I would like to take this opportunity to add these specific points to the list which is, in fact, already before you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, we take the view that we must learn lessons from past cases and, of course, clear up every single case for which we have new, additional proof. Nonetheless, we want to give the Commission instructions which look to the future, not instructions to deal with a past for which it is not even responsible. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we passed punishable offences to the courts in a one-off show of strength during the last parliamentary term. We ensured that OLAF had the structure and facilities needed to pursue any suspicions or irregularities. We want, in the final analysis, to place our trust in the courts, OLAF and the disciplinary measures and decisions taken and to work together with President Prodi’s new Commission on a basis of trust and on the basis precisely of the relevant new rules and obligations introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this includes, as Mr Bourlanges explained earlier, acknowledging and accepting results such as the disciplinary proceedings carried out in the ECHO case, even if Mr Blak wants to fight this tooth and nail, as he said earlier. But every Member must, in the end, understand that, as Members of the European Parliament, we have to carry out our control duties as accurately as possible, but that we are neither detectives nor public prosecutors, let alone black angels of vengeance.</p>
<p class="contents">Demanding a new audit, without submitting any proof or evidence, is hardly going to enhance the credibility of our Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I make my initial comments, I just wish to welcome what Mrs McAvan said about access to information from the Commission. I have found it remarkably difficult to get important documents and information from it on a number of occasions, especially for various budget lines relating to culture. It would be very useful if the Commission were to release more information to us and give us the reports we ask for.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mrs Stauner's report for a number of reasons. One because, as we are dealing with 1998, we should be looking at the past and trying to find answers to the questions we have raised about Fléchard, ECHO and the MED problems. These are all relevant nowadays because we must learn the lessons from them. Any new proof that arises from these cases must be investigated. These investigations must be very rigorous and must be reported back to us. OLAF must use its teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">The three cases I have mentioned are also quite important because they reflect remarkably on four current Commissioners. All four of them must look carefully at their past, come clean and show this new Commission where reform is needed. I hope that Commissioner Kinnock listens to this debate and will reflect upon. There are lessons to be learned and many questions to be answered and he is the man in charge of getting these questions answered for us now.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to make a couple of points on the Kuhne report on Parliament's own budget discharge. We regularly cast stones at the Commission, but when it comes to looking at our own finances sometimes we are a bit slow on the uptake. Although we have recommended discharge for our own budget this time, there are a number of points in the discharge report we should look at, especially the inventory services and the new system. I welcome the fact that the Kuhne report has called for a report on the new inventory system for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission takes the time to look at this debate seriously. This Parliament is very serious in the way it discharges various budgets. I agree with Mrs Morgan that maybe we need to reflect on how we discharge budgets in the future. However, for now, the Commission has a number of questions to answer and I hope it will start right now.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time I have spoken today and I should like to thank you for the highly constructive atmosphere in which this extremely detailed debate is being conducted. Because of the time available, I cannot, of course, comment on every intervention; however, I shall try to summarise the various points.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of access to information in order to be able to carry out the discharge procedure with the required degree of seriousness and with the documents which you need for the discharge process was central to various interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out once again in this context that the Commission has passed all the confidential reports requested to the rapporteur, or rather to the Committee on Budgetary Control. I must simply therefore ask, if we are being accused of withholding something, that you specify what has been withheld, because it is only on this basis that we can clear up misunderstandings or give you more information and this should not fail because of the Commission. There is in fact a contentious issue, which also needs to be regulated for the procedure for the future, and that is the question of the minutes of disciplinary proceedings or administrative investigations. This question has again been left out of the agreement on the grounds of valuable personal interests and I should like to point out that specific regulations also apply to Parliament in disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on Mr Blak’s question on the questionnaires. There has been a specific procedure for questionnaires in the past. The committee has now changed this, albeit informally. This resulted in the Commission’s confusion as to whether or not the questionnaire drafted by Mr Blak, but not confirmed by the committee, was an official questionnaire. The Commission then said that it would, of course, reply to the questionnaire, despite the fact that this point was not clarified. That again shows that it really does make sense here to lay down clear procedural rules. The Commission is really not interested in such misunderstandings or discussions; let us lay down clear procedures here so that our cooperation is complete and satisfies all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pick up on a point made by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control because the question of why the list of old cases was not passed on was asked. I can only say in this context that the procedure changed with the legal basis for OLAF. The legal basis for OLAF clearly states that the director of OLAF is responsible for information on investigations or the results of investigations. I think we need to discuss this at some point together with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the director of OLAF because the Commission no longer has jurisdiction here. It has no more information than you do, on which investigations are at what stage. We have to discuss this with the director of OLAF. I shall, of course, pass on any requests but I cannot give you any information in lieu of the director of OLAF in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is the question of disciplinary procedure and I should like to comment on this. The Commission explained to Mr Van Hulten in its White Paper that it would reform this disciplinary procedure as it now stands. Nonetheless, our reform must remain within the bounds of the European Treaty. But what we can do is become involved in disciplinary procedures externally in order to make it clear that this is not some sort of closed shop but a regulated procedure conducted objectively in order to examine accusations.</p>
<p class="contents">A multitude of points were made but I should like to comment on the question of the discharge procedure. Mrs Morgan, I should like to thank you for your proposals concerning clarification of the discharge procedure, together with Mr Bourlanges, who referred to it in his point on the question of the interpretation of the current Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch, you made the comment that the Council did not unanimously recommend discharge for the Commission this year. In fact, it was the Netherlands which failed to carry the decision on the grounds that the Commission should draw up a clear timetable. Mr Mulder, you also returned to this point. I think we should discuss this at some point – including in the Committee on Budgetary Control – because although the procedure in the Netherlands is of course different, there are valuable points which we could perhaps adopt for the procedure in relation to the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the question of reform and financial control, which was also raised in several comments, criticisms and demands. The Commission made it perfectly clear in its White Paper that one of the most important points was to reform financial control. Even if one of the suggestions made in it was that previously centralised, ex-ante financial control would be changed, abolished and decentralised, Mr Bösch, it also includes a suggestion which is stressed time and again by the independent experts and the Court of Auditors. It is not a question of reducing control but of making it more efficient. I firmly believe that this can only be done by making every official who handles European money responsible for ensuring that money is disbursed efficiently and correctly. No one must be able to hide behind centralised financial control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also decided to set up a separate, internal ex-post audit service and I think that this will again demonstrate that the Commission takes the subject of improved financial control extremely seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been clearly stated that the objective must be to reduce the error rate and I can only agree with this. But obviously I cannot reduce the error rates for the 1998 or 1999 budgets in retrospect. On the contrary, the objective is to take clear steps to achieve a better result in the future. That is the purpose of the action plan submitted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like in this respect to come back to what you said, Mr Pomés Ruiz, i.e. that the Commission should perhaps tell the committee which confidential reports it has submitted for the discharge procedure. I would be glad to comply with this request because I think it too helps clarify matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Langenhagen used her intervention to criticise the independent financial controller of the Union in connection with a report on the research centre in Geel. However, I should like to point out that to say that the financial controller is responsible for the plutonium incident in Geel is unfounded because she exercises no atomic supervision or any other type of supervision in Geel. But I have of course taken note of this accusation and have already started an administrative investigation in order to ascertain if there was a duty to provide information about the discussion of the report with the research centre and to pass the report on to the European Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferreira, allow me to congratulate you on your first speech in Parliament and to thank you for your call for cooperation for the benefit of European politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by saying that I do not see any confrontation in the postponement of the discharge; what I do see is that the European Parliament has exercised its right to demand information, set conditions and call on the Commission to take action, as it is entitled to do. I also see in the demands in the resolution support on the road towards a renewal of European politics and, in this respect, I really can promise you that we shall examine every point of this resolution very carefully and take it very seriously and we shall give you our reply on the information demanded and the steps taken without delay.</p>
