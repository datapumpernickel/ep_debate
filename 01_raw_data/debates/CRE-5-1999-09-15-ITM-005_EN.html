European policy in the field of justice is in a state ranging from bad to useless, a point I want to make to my newly arrived Finnish colleagues too. Two examples: massive numbers of people were driven out of Kosovo and, prior to that, out of Bosnia. The European Union did not and still does not have any arrangements in place for the temporary protection and reception of these groups of people. The relevant proposal was put forward by the European Commission two years ago, and was adopted by the European Parliament last year. The national governments have refused up until now to enact the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example is European fraud; it takes so long to get improved co-operation in the field of justice off the ground. The question of a European Public Ministry has been raised. This House voted on that in April and was in favour of it. The Committee of Wise Men is too, and now it is the Council’s move. Madam President, the one thing the Tampere Summit needs above all else is the political will of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no need for new plans of action, nor do we have any need for “soft law”. We want the national governments to abolish the unanimity requirement in decision-making, for it is this that paralyses the process, and we want steps to be taken towards achieving this end in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">May I ask you another question Madam President-in-Office of the Council? Give us here in the European Parliament full control and the final say over legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, on a final note: more plans of action, more fancy press releases, they are no use to us. Decision-making by majority voting, full parliamentary control, it really would not be all that difficult to bring this about. It is a matter of having the political will.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a few years ago, the governments of Member States were not prepared to co-operate with the European Parliament on important matters such as collaboration between police forces, migration or common asylum policy. The time has come for the European Union to lay foundations after Amsterdam. The results of Tampere will determine how democratic and how just the Union will be, if it is really to be an area of freedom, security and justice for all citizens, male and female. As yet I have not seen any documents from the Finnish Presidency. Even in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs remain too vague. We have not seen much sign of great Nordic transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore refer to documents from Germany about Tampere. I regret that once again we have to have a debate on internal politics in this Parliament without having the documents of the Council Presidency on the table. In this connection, I would like to make it clear that my group is very concerned particularly if, in Tampere, the areas of collaboration between police forces, the fight against drugs, data protection and the democratic control of Europol and the Schengen information system are discussed, because we are again afraid, that it is exactly these important points, which have really great significance for European democracy, which will come off badly and that the citizens in general will find in the end that, as far as their rights are concerned, they are the real losers. I am still hopeful, but previous experience has made me pessimistic. I hope that the Finnish Presidency of the Council will take our reservations seriously.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also hope that, on this basis, in trying to create a common area of freedom, security and justice, they are inspired by the principles of solidarity and inclusion and are not thinking about creating a European Community that is peaceful and wealthy on the inside but which is impenetrable to those pushing to get in from the outside on account of hunger, war or social difficulties. Internal peace and well-being cannot last long because the nearby countries cannot resign themselves to living with insecurity, need and chaos for long. We would be terrible hypocrites to take up the fight against discrimination, racism, and xenophobia as a founding principle of the European Community and then, in our normal procedure, to implement exclusion policies which heighten the fears of European citizens of being contaminated by people who are different to us. Just how they are different is a consideration we willingly leave to the racists.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like the area of freedom, security and justice to aim to increase the guarantees for everyone – be they citizens of the Union or people from other countries – and that it does not stop at declaring formal guarantees but also aims to put substantial guarantees into practice, such as those concerning work, social security, personal freedom, equality between men and women and many others which nowadays are being sacrificed on the altar of competition – global competition – so close to the heart of the Commission and its President. This neoliberalist strategy, a typical exclusion strategy, makes us sceptical even of the Tampere Summit, and we would be naïve to hope that our scepticism will be proved groundless.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must commit ourselves fully to this issue, with the aim of strengthening the faith that the European citizens have in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that the idea of creating a Charter of Fundamental Citizens’ Rights does not go far enough. We already have a lot of written declarations which often are not implemented. What we really need is the will to use all the practical means necessary to ensure genuine co-operation on legal and police matters. I think that nowadays, the lack of a European strategy on immigration is unacceptable, with regard to dealing with both legal migration and illegal immigration </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the concept of Europe as not only a single market and currency is very appealing, especially as an area of freedom, security and justice, but it is important for this challenge to become reality through progressively strengthening the Community institutions and developing the collaboration and co-operation between the Member States, rather than resorting to decisions taken by qualified majority, which in itself does not constitute the solution to the problems.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may then be asked how and in what form the citizens of the Union can take their stand on provisions which are in practice inaccessible. This is the only paragraph which can be supported. Other than in this respect, however, both the report by the Council and the Commission and the proposal prepared by Mr Watson head off in a political direction. Under cover of the concept of an area of security, peace and justice, what we have here is an enormous leap forward in the development of the Union. It is a question of the EU’s making its presence felt to a much greater degree than there is a mandate for among the populations of Europe. The point is that this House suffers from the obsession that more power to Parliament means the same thing as more democracy. If I may say so, that is a very restricted understanding of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The crux of the matter is that the proposal and the reports from the Council and the Commission, as well as the motion for a resolution under consideration, contemplate a massive transfer of powers to the European Union. We are talking here about the judicial system, criminal law and police powers. In part it is about constructing a Fortress Europe, necessitated partly by the EU’s own policy, but what we are concerned with in particular here is the fact that these parts of the legal culture represent our democracies’ central nervous systems. These, if the proposers have their way, are to be subjected to a supranational system in which dislike for the EU’s Third Pillar is encouraged. Co-operation between States is not working, so a supranational authority is needed. What is being proposed here is the dismantling of a range of democratic mechanisms and, in their place, the construction of supranational systems which will create democratic problems with a vengeance.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Watson resolution, it says it is convinced that European citizens are tired of proclamations and fine declarations, and in the Napolitano resolution, it proposes nothing less than to carry out a purely stylistic exercise, grabbing the bone which the Council offered its pet dog, in the form of the writing of this great Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have a Charter, the European Convention on Human Rights, we have constitutions, but, otherwise, as a number of Members have pointed out moreover, we have no Communitisation of the Third Pillar, we have no democratic policy as regards foreign affairs. Let us move in this direction then. I think that this is just one more in a series of great exercises in mental masturbation, such as Parliament has been familiar with.</p>
<p class="contents">For two or three years, or perhaps a little less, this Parliament will debate this great Charter, thereby affirming its own European view of human rights, while we know full well that the Chinese have a quite different view. All we are doing is promoting these mechanisms. There will be a lot of talking and a lot of self-congratulation, as we have seen some Members doing already – and I am sorry that Mr Schulz dropped the debate in the end by leaving the sitting – but I would like to say that perhaps this Parliament should look into democracy in its own house.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we witnessed, and I thank the 90 Members who did not go along with this reasoning, we witnessed, once again, the denial of the rights of minorities in this Parliament. We could carry on in this way, and crow over the minorities of the whole world. But perhaps we would be better advised to start to realise that the construction of Europe rests upon foundations which are so undemocratic that there is nothing to choose between the many states in the world which we often criticise and this so-called democratic system we have today.</p>
<p class="contents">So, perhaps, we should go back to the basics, reject this bone the Council tossed to us, as its dog, and get down to asking for fundamental reforms, especially the reform we ought to require of ourselves, so that this Parliament may become a true Parliament and not the instrument of bureaucracies which it is increasingly becoming.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in fact, in these matters of European policy on rights, even with reference to the considerations for a Charter of Fundamental Rights, we have entered a decisive phase of the development of the European Union. We all know that this concerns questions which have to do with the core area of national sovereignty. For this reason we must be mindful of the fact that many Member States have difficulties with this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it must be seen that in the meantime a process of development has taken place in the European Union, with a European agreement on rights and with the responsibilities of the European institutions. This should put an end to inconsistency, which has its starting point in the wrangling about competence among the institutions at different levels.</p>
<p class="contents">This means nothing other than that, with the transfer, for sensible reasons, of responsibilities to a given level, the legal obligations and responsibilities of parliamentary co-operation and decision-making rights on this same level must also be connected because otherwise a legal vacuum is created where Parliament is not present. In this crucial area of the law, involving not only the protection of citizens with regard to the outside world, but also the protection of citizens against state institutions, a situation whereby protection from incorrect executive measures and corresponding control in the interest of the citizens is not provided must not be allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, it is extraordinarily important to close this gap. It is not just a question of general matters which may crop up in future, instead I would like to expressly challenge the Council, because of current developments to do with refugees and asylum, to introduce majority decision on these matters of the scheduled period of five years, by simple resolution of the Council, and with the automatic consequence also envisaged there, i.e. the co-decision rights of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the matter of fundamental rights. I find that the Cologne resolution to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is of unusually great significance. But it does have limited legal validity. In time, we must achieve a situation where the citizen may present claims on the ground of fundamental rights at the European level if European administrative and legislative procedures go against his interests. But the crucial issue in what has been put forward in Cologne is the method, i.e. not having national governments prepare such things any longer but having a sort of convention in which national parliaments, the European Parliament and governments are represented.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, there is a tremendous opportunity here, if we are successful, to find the right composition for this convention, with the appropriate participation of the European Parliament, which must be equal in proportion to the other two areas. From experience with this operation it may then perhaps be possible using this method at some point, in the interests of the citizen, to lay down the main cornerstones of the process of European unification.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but rather a rehearsal in the new meeting procedures between national parliaments, national administrations and the European Parliament, which can provide the European Union with great legitimacy for these cornerstones.</p>
<p class="contents">Please, do not get too caught up in these less important, self-interested aspects, but rather see this great opportunity. Our first concern here is the Charter alone. In Tampere, then, you should be generous and allocate the European Parliament the number of seats which will enable it to legitimise this body.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The aim is simple: what the individual Member States would do less well on their own, we need to do together. Nobody fools themselves anymore that the battle against organised crime, where fraud and the cruel trafficking of children, women and refugees do not respect borders, can be fought effectively by individual countries. We have to do this together, but if we give greater powers to the Union with regard to the prevention and repression of crimes, then this must happen in a framework where every individual is sure that his or her rights will be respected. There is no freedom without security, but there is no security without justice. In the first instance, justice means respect for the principle of equality, for the principle of non-discrimination, for the equal dignity of each person and for diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s policy must draw on this principle. The proposed document draws on it. We know how much resistance the Member States put up, including the countries which do not admit to it, in this field which is traditionally a national competence. But resistance, failure to act and delays are harmful, and we cannot afford to put it off. Enlargement of the Union to include the new applicant countries requires talks to start now on the progressive adoption of common measures and appropriate standards of guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Finnish Presidency, whose statements I welcomed this morning, wishes to take the credit for having started the implementation of the promises enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must have a balanced agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty prescribes the creation of an area of freedom, justice and security, but the Tampere summit is in danger of turning only into a security summit. Of course we want prime ministers to provide protection from threats like organised crime, drug running, terrorism and sex crimes, but let them also focus on the threat of discrimination and racism. Let them also tackle the problems of banking secrecy and tax havens which provide cover for money laundering. They should seek to provide European citizens with protection from injustice so that those arrested away from home can get legal representation, interpretation and bail. Instead of trying to harmonise European legal systems, just start with getting cross-border justice for individuals caught up in expensive red tape. And while countering illegal immigration and abuse of asylum laws is important, governments must respect their obligations under the Geneva Convention to grant asylum to genuine refugees and treat them with compassion and dignity, not demonise them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty stresses liberty and respect for human rights as fundamental principles. We should insist that the Charter of Fundamental Rights not only be drawn up with this Parliament as equal partner but also be legally binding and not just a pious declaration without teeth. Some of the rights we need as citizens are against our own governments, such as checks on our police, customs and intelligence services. Freedom of information ought to be a summit priority and so should ratification of the international criminal court and pursuing perpetrators of crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The message we must send today is that Tampere must be a summit for citizens, not just the bureaucrats, and democratic accountability must increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if our national leaders want to set an example of justice and good governance let them disown their own foreign ministers who disgracefully want to put the Agency for Reconstruction of Kosovo in Thessaloniki. This shabby fix is the opposite of what the European Union should stand for.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These questions are important for all citizens living in this area, since they affect their individual and collective freedoms. Tampere will also provide political orientation on such sensitive questions as immigration policies, which will necessitate a new look at North-South relations, and freedom of movement, which will necessitate real harmonisation of visa policies in Europe, such as the right to asylum and the right to health for all refugees. Other important questions include integration policies, which also affect the cultural rights of minorities, the right to family life with dignity and political rights for all citizens residing in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">All these rights must, of course, be included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a Charter which must address all these men and women who live in Europe and thereby enrich it. It is, therefore, necessary to reinforce democratic control of the choices which we are going to make, as today there are still too many shady areas such as Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Parliament, the product of the will of the people, must be closely associated to meetings such as Tampere.

Large common registers of personal details are being established for refugees and for the purpose of combating crime. This raises important questions about legal security and personal integrity, not least for the most vulnerable refugees of all. Experience so far is not so good. Supervision of the Schengen Agreement’s register, SIS, has been poor and, where the SIRENE structure is concerned, it has been even worse. In the SIS register, details of asylum seekers who have been refused entry have been mixed up with those of criminals and stolen goods. The Joint Supervisory Authority has been severely critical in connection with the misuse of information in cases where refugees have not been informed of their rights and where the authority itself has not had proper access to the register.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal concerning the EURODAC register is worrying, not least when it comes to demands to register groups in addition to asylum seekers and when it comes to the rules about when information is to be deleted. It will be possible for very sensitive personal information, for example about political views, to be entered in Europol’s search register. It will even be possible to register people who have not been convicted or directly suspected of crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal concerning the ENFOPOL Convention is worrying because certain Member States will be able to engage in wire-tapping in other countries without the latter’s permission. In view of all these considerations, it is therefore a disappointment that Tarja Halonen and the country which holds the Presidency of the European Union had so little to say about questions of legal security and personal integrity which ought to be major issues.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This idea, in the form in which it has apparently been adopted, seems to us both unnecessary and dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Unnecessary, because, according to the conclusions of the Council, this should be no more than a purely formal exercise, combining in a single document the rights which are already in force. These are then rights which already exist and which are found in a variety of documents: treaties, the European Social Charter, the European Convention on Human Rights and above all, of course, national constitutions. What is more, these rights, as far as citizens are concerned, are already properly protected by the legal systems in force. The proposed exercise therefore seems pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">It is none the less dangerous, as the Federalist lobbies will seize upon the Cologne decision in order to attempt to take the defence of citizens’ rights away from national constitutions and to crown them with a superior text, a supposedly European constitution. Mr Barnier even complacently stressed, during his hearing last week, that the process of preparing the Charter should be brought together with the process of constitutionalising the Treaties. Clearly the Cologne Council has set in motion a chain of events of which it is going to lose control.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in fact it would be better to leave the rights of citizens to national constitutions and the protection of those rights to the national parliaments who have perfected them over the centuries. As for the Union, it would do better to devote itself to the top priority of the moment: the need to draft a Charter of the Rights of Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As for you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it is clear that we are talking about an area in which an obdurate attachment to sovereignty is in evidence which, in my opinion, should be totally banished. It is with good reason that we identify nationality with the flag, the police and the judge. And that is what we are talking about: the policemen, the judges and what is behind the flag, at least the flags of the States of the European Union, which is the defence of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that you are experiencing difficulties because the functioning of the Presidency of the Council is complex. There is no doubt that you are experiencing difficulties as well because taking decisions in the highest body, the European Council, means starting with general principles, and the will to act. In other areas, such as building roads or establishing Trans-European Networks, these general principles make sense. However, ladies and gentlemen, at this summit we want something more specific, especially in the area of justice. It cannot only be a summit on immigration nor, of course, only on security. Of the three areas – freedom, security and justice – the one which is furthest behind and needs most promotion is the area of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, there is a lack of specific proposals. It is not a matter of providing access to justice or legal aid to victims.

<p class="contents">We will have to discuss the nature of the Charter, its contents, the relationship between the Charter of Rights and the process of creating a Constitution for the Union. These issues will form the basis of a report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in co-operation with other committees, to be prepared over the coming months and which will be submitted to you during a plenary part-session. </p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, however, we must urgently take a position on the procedure to follow in order to draw up this Charter. This is the limited but important aim of the resolution put forward by Mr Watson and myself.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the Council decides on the nature of the body responsible for drawing up the draft Charter, Parliament must state today that we cannot accept fewer representatives of the European Parliament than representatives of the Heads of State and Government. Parliament should also state that we are pressing for in-depth talks before deciding if the essential contribution of the national parliaments should be ensured through the participation of a certain number of their representatives at the appointed body or through other, more efficient channels.</p>
<p class="contents">And now a personal view on the fight against crime and the challenge posed by immigration.

<p class="contents">In this respect, the freedom of movement of individuals within the Union is a fundamental objective of the building of Europe. Freedom of movement must, above all, be applied identically to all men and women, and I am thinking particularly of the difficulties experienced by many alien residents who are too often denied the right to live as a family. I am convinced that the fundamental objective of this European Union is to enable the integration of immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I withdrew my intervention at the opening of the sitting, as the tribute which Mrs Fontaine paid to the two dead Guinean youths, Yaguine and Fodé, showed great feeling. It was with astonishing insight that these two adolescents wrote us a letter in which they reminded us of the enormous difficulties there are today in being a child of the third world. My own name is Fodé and I too come from this underprivileged part of the planet. But I had the immense good fortune to be adopted by a French family, to go to school and now to take my seat among you in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">This tradition of welcoming others with respect for their dignity must continue, for, believe me, no woman and no man would ever leave their family, their village or their country unless there was an overwhelming need to provide for their kith and kin. So let us stop splitting up mothers and children, withdrawing residence permits from workers who have lost their jobs and attacking the right to asylum. To sum up, let us take immigrants out of their precarious administrative position and let us offer them a lasting residence permit, enabling them to stay as long as they think fit in a country they have come to, precisely because it was the countries of Europe which colonised their own country in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this Europe of ours must ban all forms of discrimination, in recruitment, in housing and in access to leisure pursuits, and remind all those who deny the existence of the gas chambers and believe that races are not equal that racism is not an opinion, but a crime.</p>
