It is a solemn occasion in the work of our institutions, when, traditionally, we take stock of the situation and cast an eye together over the work the Commission plans to do in the coming year. I am sad to say that, this year, our hearts and minds are greatly troubled by the tragic events that have dominated the news in recent days. I am referring to the series of acts of violence that have sown terror and grief in Iraq and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">At this moment, your and my thoughts are with those mourning in Italy, to whom we extend the sympathy of all the people of Europe at the death of the 19 young men on a peace mission. Our thoughts are also with those mourning in Turkey and the Jewish communities, and with all those suffering throughout the world as a result of terrorist attacks. I know I can speak for the whole of the Commission when I express my deepest sympathy for all the women, men and children who have been affected by these tragedies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the problems we experience every day show us that, despite these difficult moments, the Union is in good health, notwithstanding the Eurosceptics and the unexpected critics. The situation is not easy because we are in a period of transition that is both delicate and complex, but a larger and stronger Union is within our reach.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come through two difficult years for the economy but the latest indicators suggest that we are leaving this negative period behind. There are widespread expectations that economic activity will pick up over the second half of this year and then speed up in 2004. The worst seems to be over: business and consumer confidence is rising and optimism is, at last, starting to grow among European operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Economies are also recovering in other regions of the world outside the Union. In the United States, monetary and fiscal stimuli and an increase in productivity are keeping growth rates high. However, there are some concerns about the deficit, which could grow further next year as a result of the tax cuts and the cost of the conflict in Iraq. In Japan, the prospects, at last, look good and the trend in the other Asian economies remains positive, with growth forecast at 6.7% for next year. There are also positive signs coming from the countries about to join the Union. In response to the general recovery in Europe and the prospect of enlargement, growth in these countries is expected to reach 3.8% next year. This is another sign that the political decisions taken to support the unification of the continent were right.</p>
<p class="contents">The recovery is still fragile, however, as I said, and we need to speed up implementation of the Lisbon agenda and continue our structural reforms. The European Initiative for Growth, on which the Commission has been working since the start of the year, has now taken shape. It provides for public and private investment to spark growth and employment. Bolstered by the support it received at the October European Council, our initial proposal has become a genuine road map with clearly-defined actions and deadlines for the elimination of the financial and, above all, regulatory and administrative obstacles that discourage investment. The Initiative also includes the quick-start list, which consists of a series of projects that are or will soon be ready for launching. We have worked closely with the European Investment Bank and identified 56 projects in the fields of transport networks, energy, telecommunications and research. When drawing up the list, we applied a number of very clear criteria. Firstly, they are projects at an advanced stage of development that can be launched immediately. Secondly, all these projects have a significant cross-border impact. Finally, we have selected projects that can have a multiplier effect on investment, particularly private investment, but which will have little environmental impact. We have also undertaken to promote highly innovative projects in the field of research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards funding, total investment – public and private – will come to approximately EUR 10 billion a year between now and 2010. Private-sector involvement will vary from project to project. However, as an overall guideline, we expect 60% of the capital needed to fund the projects to come from the public sector and 40% from private investors. This means that about EUR 6 billion a year will come from the Union and national budgets. That is the equivalent of approximately 0.05% of the Union’s GDP, and you will agree that is a very cheap price to pay to give the European economy a beneficial kick-start, a price that is perfectly compatible with the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the stages of this Initiative of ours? The first stage is the December European Council, which will need to approve it. Then the Member States will need to reform their administrations and regulations, which are often the real obstacle preventing these projects from being implemented. In particular, that will make it easier to involve the private sector. I therefore call on the Member States to coordinate their national and regional spending plans with the European Initiative to maximise the impact of the investments.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative and work programme for the coming year coincides, ladies and gentlemen, with the major changes for the European Union. I will just remind you of the key dates for the institutions: on 1 May, 10 new Member States will officially join the Union, the elections will take place in June and the current Commission’s term of office will end on 31 October 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme I am presenting to you today is intended to complete the achievement of the strategic objectives that this Commission set itself for its term of office. In view of the fact that next year will be a special year, it consists of only 73 new proposals; this may seem a lot but it is far fewer than in previous years. The proposals cover the political priorities that were discussed in depth in our structured dialogue with Parliament and the Council between March and June.</p>
<p class="contents">The main priority is to give shape to the future of the enlarged Union. It is based on two cornerstone objectives: ensuring the success of accession and preparing the political ground for the new Financial Perspective. As regards stability, we will need to develop a neighbourhood policy to create a ring of friends around the new borders of Europe. We must also complete the Tampere agenda by 1 May 2004 to complete the area of freedom, security and justice. With regard to the third priority – growth – we need to speed up our progress towards the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">From an operational point of view, the programme incorporates the objectives contained in the new interinstitutional agreement with a view to streamlining legislative activity. For example, we have brought our proposals into line with the Union’s annual and multiannual programming and we undertake to apply the integrated impact assessment process to all the most important initiatives. As regards stability and security, at the Thessaloniki Summit, we presented a series of proposals on justice and home affairs and laid the foundations for a new neighbourhood policy. The proposals presented on economic matters concentrated on the Lisbon strategy, on completion of the single market, on research and on trans-European networks. At this point, we should not forget the recently-adopted legislative framework for the chemical sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, however, that the workload has been extremely heavy this year and the Commission has not been able to complete all the tasks it set itself. For this reason, the programme for 2004 includes some uncompleted initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express the appreciation of the whole College for the excellent cooperation of the European Parliament in the planning exercise. The structured dialogue has proved to be an excellent instrument but there is always room for improvement and that is necessary. Bearing in mind the deadlines that will affect both of our institutions next year, the Commission will work closely together with Parliament to improve our relationship. In particular, we propose replacing the current methods of dialogue with an exchange of views between the Conference of Presidents and Vice-President de Palacio in April; using the written procedure for the mid-term evaluation for the programme and, lastly, deferring the presentation of the programme for 2005 – which will be the responsibility of the next Commission – until the December 2004 part-session, which will allow us to coordinate our work. Lastly, we have conducted an initial evaluation of the internal reforms that have modernised our financial and personnel management.</p>
<p class="contents">The serious irregularities in past management of the Union’s statistical office, Eurostat, have given us much food for thought and led us to re-examine the situation, which has resulted in our proposing a plan of action that I would now like to outline to you. I am sorry this speech is so long, but this is an important section. On 25 September 2003, I gave my views on the Eurostat affair to a meeting of the Conference of Presidents. I gave my assessment of the facts, as revealed by the investigations conducted by OLAF and the extensive work done by the Commission departments. I did, however, accept that breakdowns in our communication system – between OLAF and the rest of the Commission, and between the Director-General of Eurostat and his Commissioner – had meant that the Commission was unable to take all the necessary precautionary measures earlier. I therefore promised to present you with an action plan to remedy them.</p>
<p class="contents">After that meeting, the internal auditor produced the final report and presented it to Cocobu. It does not contain anything new which might alter my analysis. In short, it is quite clear that the most serious events took place before 1999, that the reorganisation exercise started in 2000 and that Eurostat, Financial Control and other sources involved OLAF very swiftly on the main aspects of this affair. In any case, the Commission was only in a position to act as of May 2003 because of a number of communication breakdowns at various levels, which I have identified. We took decisive action; we could have moved more quickly, and that is why we are presenting to you an action plan. The plan is based on the fundamental principles of the reform, and the key points include the functional independence of OLAF, the new Financial Regulation, which came into force in January 2003, the new Staff Regulations, the provisions concerning rights and obligations and the codes of conduct. All these reforms have been introduced gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stated on 25 September, it would be unfair to judge the reform, with its successes and its inadequacies, as if everything had been completely operational as early as 2000. Rather, the period 2000-2003 must be seen as a transitional period. However, this same Eurostat case is an illustration of just how necessary it was, particularly as regards matters such as mobility for sensitive posts, segregation of operational duties and control duties and the establishment of an internal auditor. It is therefore a question of building on what has been achieved by the reforms, which are already bearing fruit. We need to consolidate them, giving the political actors the means of shouldering their political responsibilities. I would also remind you that we have taken some tough measures this summer concerning Eurostat itself: the Director-General has been replaced; the Operational Director posts have been advertised both inside and outside the institution; a new Resources Director has been transferred; the organisation chart has been overhauled, etc.; lastly, a high degree of mobility has been applied to Unit Head posts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same vein, I felt it was necessary, as a first step, to amend the code of conduct governing relations between the Commissioners and their departments, which dates from 1999. Although the general principles which formed the basis of the code in 1999 should be maintained, in particular the principle of non-interference in management, more emphasis should be placed on the Commissioners' political responsibility, which covers not only their own actions but also those of their departments. The revised code of conduct will therefore include a whole series of provisions improving the flow of information to Commissioners to ensure that they are in a position to exercise this responsibility properly, so that they can supervise their departments' work and give them general instructions, including instructions relating to financial management. The code will also lay down a specific procedure for formally referring matters to the Commissioner, so that the Director-General can immediately draw the Commissioner's attention to any fact or development that might involve the Commissioner’s political responsibility or that of the College as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would also like to respond to another question thrown up by the Eurostat affair. It actually seems that certain signals and pieces of information emerged in various parts of our institution concerning this affair well before May 2003. Taken in isolation, these signals were not such as to alert us to the gravity of the situation. Had they been centralised and analysed as a whole, we would not have had to wait for the first substantive information from OLAF before taking precautionary measures. I have therefore decided to introduce a new system<span class="bold"> </span>for collecting and cross-checking all information relating to allegations of fraud, irregularities or wrongdoing, for analysing this information and for informing either the Commission or the Commissioner responsible, as appropriate, so that they can take any administrative, financial or other measures necessary, in particular to protect the financial interests of the Union. I have decided to take responsibility for the political supervision of this system myself, with the help of Mr Neil Kinnock and Mrs Michaele Schreyer. The preparatory work will be carried out at administrative level by a group of officials of the rank of Director-General, coordinated by the Secretary-General. This system will enable us, in particular, to provide better follow-up to information received from OLAF, IDOC and the IAS. Clearly, the idea is not to carry out additional investigations or to usurp the role of the policy-makers or administrators, who will continue to be responsible for keeping a close watch on management and responding appropriately to the information and investigation reports they receive. It will serve primarily as a watchdog and early warning system.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly,<span class="bold"> </span>I have decided to improve the information channels between the central services and the operational departments, strengthening links, improving certain practices and following up some of the suggestions made in the internal auditor's report. These are essentially technical measures, but I believe they are very important for improving the flow of information and strengthening the systems of checks and balances. I described these measures to Cocobu earlier today.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this reflection on the Eurostat affair, I will now come to OLAF. Everyone acknowledges that the present situation is, in a number of respects, unsatisfactory. OLAF is a Commission department, but it conducts its investigations in total independence. It is in complete charge of the decisions it takes in the course of its operational activities. That is also as we intended. Nevertheless, the current legal framework remains vague on whether or not it must pass on information to the institutions or persons concerned by an investigation. This has proved damaging in the Eurostat case. I want to dispel all doubts with this analysis of OLAF: its Director-General, Mr Brunner, enjoys my full confidence. I am analysing the way the institution is organised, not criticising the work of the Director-General, who took the right action in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in the awkward situation of having to take political and legal responsibility for OLAF's work without actually having the means to exercise that responsibility, and it is also legally responsible for OLAF in any court actions that may be brought against it, for example claims for damages by individuals who feel their rights have been infringed. I had proposed to Parliament, in connection with the plans for a European Public Prosecutor, that OLAF be given full independence within a clear political framework. That is still my objective. Further work on making OLAF an entirely external body must remain on our agenda. However, in order to resolve the current operational problems swiftly, I would like to propose immediate steps which will entail amendments to the OLAF Regulation, the aim being to have them adopted by the present Parliament. We have to do something to give our successors a legal framework in which they can work with peace of mind. The need to strengthen the regulatory framework has also been expressed by the OLAF Supervisory Committee and in the work in progress in Cocobu, in particular in Mr Bösch's report. The Commission is taking this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to lay before you the main aspects of the improvements we are planning. Firstly, strengthening OLAF's operational independence by refocusing its activities as appropriate, particularly with a view to enlargement. There might be a case here for reassigning to Commission departments certain horizontal tasks that are unrelated to investigations. Secondly, allowing OLAF to concentrate on its priorities. To this end, we must lay down and enshrine in the Regulation a principle whereby action is taken as appropriate and discretion is exercised. This will allow OLAF to pass on to the appropriate authorities the task of following up cases which are of minor significance or lie outside its priority activities and will also make for speedier and more effective investigations. I would specify here that the decision on whether or not to open investigations must always remain with OLAF. Thirdly, clearer rules on the flow of information between OLAF and the institutions and bodies concerned. We shall also have to look into how this information is handled by the institutions involved. We need to strike a better balance between safeguarding the effectiveness of investigations and protecting the Union's financial interests with precautionary measures. Light will also have to be shed on the question of ultimate responsibility for decisions taken. Fourthly, amendments to the Regulation will also cover safeguards for the rights of the defence, an issue of fundamental importance. Fifthly, at the same time, we need to take a fresh look at the governance of OLAF both in terms of beefing up the role and make-up of its Supervisory Committee and in terms of setting up an interinstitutional Administrative Board.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I am proposing to increase the effectiveness of OLAF — as it faces a growing workload in an enlarged Union — by increasing its staff resources, refocusing its tasks on its investigative function and amending the Regulation, and to make OLAF more accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, here, then, are the basic lines of the action plan I am proposing to launch in response to the questions raised by the Eurostat affair. A communication will be adopted by the end of the year. As for the internal measures within the Commission, I expect to have them adopted as of December. Moreover, I hope that our contacts with Parliament will be advanced enough for us to table a legislative proposal on OLAF that has a reasonable chance of being adopted by Parliament and which takes us forward towards the idea of the European Prosecutor, which we all continue to support.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I began my address by stressing the major challenges that lie before us in 2004. To these I should, of course, add the Intergovernmental Conference. Of the many issues on the table, I wish to focus today on just one, the composition of the Commission. It is claimed in many quarters that a Commission with 25 or more members would be unworkable, but I want to tell you now that, next year, we will be putting that idea to the test because, for a period of six months, we will be welcoming colleagues from the new Member States and the Commission will be composed of 30 members. Of course, this will be a transitional situation in which no new portfolios will be created and it will last only until the end of this Commission's term of office: from 1 November 2004 onwards we will have 25 Commissioners. I am convinced that, whether it has 25 or 30 members, the Commission will be able to function extremely well. In the first place, the Treaty of Nice already guarantees the coherence of an enlarged Commission, and the President of the forthcoming Commission will have increased powers to organise, direct and monitor its work. In the second place, I do not agree that the Commission's tasks break down to a dozen or so portfolios. We must not forget that Commissioners also serve as the face of Europe with regard to public opinion in their countries of origin, and this will be even more important for the citizens of the new Member States. Lastly, the effectiveness of the Commission depends not on the number of its members but on the way in which its resources are used. The reforms we have introduced over the last few years have already brought positive results here.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, collective responsibility and the consistency of the Commission's work remain central to my concerns, therefore. An enlarged Commission undoubtedly presents a number of challenges, but the idea of a two-tier Commission, in which half the Commissioners would have a secondary role, does not provide the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken of short-term commitments, but my Commission is already looking further ahead. Early this year, we launched a wide-ranging debate on the new Financial Perspective. In 2007, the Union could comprise 28 Member States and around half a billion citizens, and it will have a new constitutional framework. Clearly, therefore, discussions must start right now if all the instruments are to be operational by the end of 2006. Past experience has shown us that there is no time to spare.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing for the future, politics should call the shots because, before we begin working out the accounts we have to decide what we want the overall framework for the Union's policies to be. We must keep our eyes fixed on our objectives: peace, sustainable development, solidarity and freedom. In practical terms, this means that we must work along the following lines: a road map for the Lisbon and Gothenburg agenda; solidarity between countries and regions to help those who are lagging behind; European citizenship in an area that has developed from a marketplace into a political area; the external dimension of our model and our policy choices, starting with the neighbouring countries with which we must build a ring of friends. It is important that this<span class="bold"> </span>legislature – the legislature that has brought the enlargement process to its conclusion – should be involved in establishing the policy lines for the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, 2004 will be a year of challenges, renewal and undertakings. The European elections will provide an invaluable opportunity to gauge the extent to which citizens are participating in our venture. Against such a backdrop, the Commission is aware that it acts as a point of reference providing the system with continuity, stability and dynamism. We are committed to striving together with Parliament, the Council and all the other Union institutions to make a success of our appointment with history. Together, we can build a greater, more independent, stronger Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr. President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, as part of the proceedings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, we listened with great interest to the presentation by the Commission of its Legislative and Work Programme for 2004, which has been formally presented to the European Parliament today by President Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">The major institutional events in the Union’s calendar in 2004 give this programme a particular significance. Indeed, 2004 will be a year of great changes. First of all, we have the signing of the new Constitutional Treaty, which will lay the foundations for the future development of the Union. Next year will also see the European Parliament elections – which, for the first time, will also involve the citizens and candidates of the 10 new Member States. On 1 November 2004, the new Commission will take up full office. Finally, next year will see the start of the negotiations for the definition of the next Financial Perspective, which will be decisive in orienting European Union policy in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Council has not yet set out its position with respect to the Commission programme, it certainly agrees with – and is ready to subscribe to – the three main priorities identified by the Community executive: enlargement, stability and sustainable growth. The Council has taken note of the objectives established by the Commission, as well as the initiatives and proposals it intends to present during 2004 in order to implement these priorities. Taking into account the institutional events of the coming year, the legislative work will need to be as focused as possible, and the Presidency is therefore pleased to note the Commission’s undertaking to concentrate first and foremost on the initiatives considered to be most essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that, even more than in the past, the cooperation between the Council and Parliament will be decisive in ensuring that the Commission’s legislative proposals are adopted within the hoped-for timescale. The Council is pleased to note that the Commission has implemented in full the new impact assessment procedure. Indeed, as the European Council stressed in October, this procedure is extremely important if we are to avoid the situation arising where European Union legislation makes the Union less competitive than other major economic areas of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is also extremely pleased to note that the Commission’s annual programming exercise has been carried out within the framework of the structured interinstitutional dialogue. The dialogue between the Commission, on the one hand, and the Council and Parliament, on the other, which was initiated on the basis of the Commission Communication on Annual Policy Strategy, makes it possible for these two institutions to ensure that their point of view on the proposals put forward by the Community executive for the following year is taken into account, before the final version of the legislative and work programme is drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that I must stress at this point that the sooner the Annual Policy Strategy is presented, the more fruitful this exercise is likely to be. More specifically, its timely presentation would enable the discussion of budgetary procedures to be developed on the basis of the results of the structured dialogue with Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though, as I have said, the Council has not yet defined its position as regards the Commission’s work programme, it will, of course, take it into account in drawing up its own work programme. In this connection, I wish to remind you that, in accordance with the reforms approved by the Seville European Council, the aim of which is to ensure greater continuity and consistency in the Council’s work, the six delegations that will be holding the Council Presidency over the coming three years are drawing up a multiannual strategic programme that will be adopted by the December European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention here that the future – Irish and Dutch – Presidencies, which will have the task next year of steering the work of the Council on the Commission’s initiatives for 2004, are already working on drawing up the next annual programme for the Council – as, I remember, was done by the Greek and Italian Presidencies for the current year. Parliament will, of course, be informed at the earliest possible date of the results of this work so that it can put forward its own observations, as envisaged by the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, lastly, I would like, if I may, to take the opportunity provided by this debate on the Commission’s programme to say a few very brief words on the goals of the Italian Presidency with a view to the December European Council, a subject to which I shall, of course, return with you in more detail during the next plenary session in Brussels. The decisions adopted at the December Summit will, to a certain extent, reflect the priorities established by the Commission and will, therefore, be able to help us achieve the objectives set for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards enlargement, the December European Council will be called upon, first and foremost, to evaluate the progress achieved in the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, on the basis of the reports and strategy papers presented recently by the Commission, and thus to establish the timescale for the conclusion of the membership negotiations with these two countries. Again on the basis of the Commission report, the European Council will also be called upon to assess the progress made by the 10 accession countries in the adoption and application of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the stability objective, as defined in the Commission’s programme, where internal actions are concerned, the Council will need to assess the progress made in terms of asylum, migration and external borders, especially in the light of the timetable drawn up in Thessaloniki, Seville and Tampere. As regards external issues, the European Council will be called upon to adopt the European Security Strategy drawn up by the Secretary General/High Representative, to address the question of weapons of mass destruction and to evaluate the progress made in ESDP. The Heads of State or Government will also approve a detailed work programme for the Commission and the Secretary General/High Representative on relations with the Arab world.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of sustainable growth, the European Council will need to adopt tangible decisions on the Growth Initiative, especially where the quick-start programme is concerned, and will receive a report from the Commission containing proposals for the reinforcement of the production framework, with a view to preventing deindustrialisation.</p>

We also wish to voice our outrage at the criminals in Istanbul and convey our respects and sympathy to the families and survivors there.</p>
<p class="contents">There are situations in political life when one would gladly avoid making certain statements or adopting a particular type of speech. Unfortunately, however, I have no choice but to make my views plain, and I do so calmly and objectively, as I do not wish to create even more waves in Italy’s public debate after the events of last week.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you deemed it appropriate to launch a political manifesto in Italy last week. This manifesto, Mr Prodi, is not our problem, although it could be argued that if you present a comprehensive policy programme, this should not be in response to a country’s domestic political situation; the place for this would have been the European Parliament. That also needs to be said, ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling, sustained applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... but that is not my main point. Mr Cohn-Bendit, you will undoubtedly have an opportunity to express your views. As a democrat, kindly let me express mine.</p>
<p class="contents">My main point of criticism, Mr Prodi, is that you have engaged in party politics. You have called on a specific political movement, namely the Italian left, to join forces, thus creating ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... the impression that there are on the one side people who are pro-reform and pro-Europe, while on the other side there are those who are not pro-Europe. Let me say, on behalf of my group, that every single member of our group shares the passion for Europe, and we should not drive a wedge between Europeans, neither in Italy nor in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nor can it be claimed that this was a declaration made in a private capacity, for it comes from the President of the Commission. Anyone who is the Commission President always acts on behalf of all Europeans. I share the view of our fellow MEP Mr Barón Crespo: if the Commission President heads the list for the European elections, he must resign from office. In fact, Mr President, my comments in <span class="italic">Corriere della Sera</span> prompted you, ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause</span></p>
<p class="contents">... finally to make it clear that you will remain in office until the end of your term on 1 November 2004. We welcome this clarification, but even members of your Commission were still saying last week that there were rumours you might be standing as a list candidate in the European elections. Thankfully, you have now clarified your position. Nonetheless, this state of affairs – this rumour mill – has also harmed the Commission and I mention it here because it needs to be mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who holds high office in the European Union should always bear in mind that every time they speak, they do so for the European Union as a whole. Indeed, if <span class="italic">Corriere della Sera</span> had called me to ask me about the statements made by the President of the European Council on Chechnya, I would still have said that I did not agree with the sort of declaration you have issued. We are trying to be objective. We want to serve Europe, and that is why we must not divide Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, let me remind you that on 15 September 1999, you were appointed with the support and trust of our group, even though you do not belong to our political family. We gave your Commission our trust, even though the majority of your Commissioners – contrary to the outcome of the elections – do not belong to our political family. I welcome the fact that the constitutional draft states that in future, the outcome of the European elections will be taken into account when a candidate is proposed for the office of Commission President.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Solbes, I hope to hear a word or two on the stability of the European currency. I believe this is an issue which you will also be addressing today, Mr Prodi. I would like to give encouragement to your Commission and thank Commissioner Solbes in particular – whom we regard as the guarantor of European currency stability – for maintaining this course, not only towards the small countries but also the large countries in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Antonione, I particularly appreciate the fact that the representative of the Council is here today. This should be taken as read, but this was not the case in the past. I welcome the fact that you are here today, and I would like to give you our encouragement and call on you, at the Intergovernmental Conference, not to endorse the ideas floating around in some finance ministers’ minds, namely to reduce the rights of this House on budgetary issues, which we will resist resolutely. I would ask you to make it plain that you side with the European Parliament on this issue and that we want equality between this House and the Council of Ministers on the European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with comments which I make with a great deal of personal regard, as the Commission President is aware, although personal affinity and political issues must be kept separate; criticism cannot be brushed under the carpet out of a sense of personal regard. It is essential to speak the truth. Mr Prodi, you are the President of all the Europeans. You hold the highest office in the European Union. Give us, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the opportunity to give you our trust until the end of your term in office on 1 November 2004. If you prove that you can earn it, you will have our support.</p>

I would like to convey our condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives in recent terrorist attacks. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the families of the Italian servicemen and of the Iraqi citizens who died. We also wish to express our solidarity with the families of victims of the attacks on the synagogues in Istanbul. The latter represent the Sephardi community in Turkey. The word Sepharad means Spain in Hebrew. It should be recalled that five centuries ago those Jewish communities found a haven of tolerance in the Ottoman Empire when my own country was not disposed to accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on, Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Poettering for bringing politics into this debate. It does seem strange that we are unable to speak of politics here. I did indeed say to the President of the Commission that he ought to resign if ever he decided to stand in the elections to the European Parliament. I said more besides. Firstly, the President of the Commission currently enjoys the support of practically all shades of the political spectrum in the House. He must therefore fulfil his responsibilities. As a citizen, however, he is entitled to make known his vision of the future of Europe. I therefore believe that the fact that he drafted this document on the European dream is a positive development. I should add that I find the document far superior to the speech he gave today.</p>
<p class="contents">This said, I detected a degree of pique in what Mr Poettering said. He seemed to resent that someone who apparently belonged to one side should have defected to the other. As I see it, one has every right to correct oneself and mature as a person as one journeys through life. I for one welcome the fact that President Prodi has adopted a more socially and politically progressive stance. There should be abundant opportunity to discuss this in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, between now and the last day of this legislature what we really need is a strong and determined Commission. I would say that the same applies to the Council. I believe the most outrageous behaviour we have witnessed during these last few days was when the President of the Council departed totally from the line taken by the Council of Ministers, the Commission and Parliament. He made unacceptable pronouncements concerning Chechnya and Russia. You all have the power to rectify the situation. We could join together when we vote tomorrow on the draft resolution on the Russia Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to focus on President Prodi’s speech. Firstly, I should like to say that I am not about to complain on behalf of my group about there being fewer proposals. Our difficulty is simply that we do not know what the proposals are. We have been informed that Vice-President de Palacio plans to meet committee chairmen. No doubt we shall find out then. In connection with assessing the Commissioners’ politics I should just like to mention that I shall be sending Mr Poettering the statements made on the Socialists by Mrs de Palacio. It has to be said that she does not miss a single Popular Party function in Spain. Mr Prodi is not the only one to be active in politics back home. We all are.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi resorted to expressions more commonly used by weather forecasters in order to describe growth. He stated the outlook was set fair. I believe it would be very helpful for him to explain, on behalf of the Commission, how the latter intends to adapt the Stability and Growth Pact to the new situation. This is a crucially important request. It goes hand in hand with the need to strengthen economic governance. I have also been struck by the fact that the financial perspective has been left until last, as if it were an afterthought. The Delors plan of ten years ago has indeed been revived. As I see it, it is important to discuss research and development, not just infrastructure. They are the nervous system energising the whole of the Community. I have also been struck that so little detail has been provided concerning reform of cohesion policy following the debate on the Sapir report and Commissioner Barnier’s statements. I believe the President of the Commission should be much more explicit. After all, this issue is crucial to the new Member States and also to the balance between current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Prodi devoted practically half of this speech to Eurostat. I would like to suggest a number of qualifications here. Firstly, through the Casaca report, the European Parliament played a decisive role in the Eurostat issue, over and above the many reports drafted within the Commission and OLAF. I believe this must be emphasised, because new instruments are being introduced whilst overlooking the crucial role played by the European Parliament. I regret the other groups in the House did not agree to debate the Bösch report on fraud to coincide with the President’s presence. This report is available and the President himself referred to it. Regarding Eurostat, I note the proposal to define the nature of political responsibility and the reform of the Commission’s code of conduct. Nonetheless, I am surprised that a new instrument amounting in practice to a duplication of OLAF is now being proposed. I fear we may end up in a situation resembling the one illustrated by a cartoon from the Soviet era. This cartoon showed a citizen being trailed by two KGB agents. They were in turn being trailed by a further two agents and so on. The line of people all minding each other went off into the distance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a case of multiplying the instruments, but of acting in a clear and democratic manner. There is an important role for Parliament to play here. I do not think that the situation will be resolved by creating a new power centre within the Commission. Finding a loophole in every law is a widespread human weakness. I believe there are sayings to this effect in every language. There is certainly one in Spanish. It follows that bringing out more and more rules and regulations will not necessarily improve matters. What is required is the option of specific monitoring. In my view, the idea of establishing a link between OLAF and the European Prosecutor could be a way forward. I would like to hear the Council’s view on this rather than the Commission’s, since the main opposition to the European Prosecutor comes from the governments. It is not a contentious issue amongst ourselves. Mr President, I therefore feel it is essential to negotiate an urgent procedure to allow these issues to be discussed before the end of this legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">President of the Commission, I would like to enquire whether you were thinking of a compromise solution for the December Conference Summit when you referred to 25 or 30 Commissioners. If the two figures are added together some countries end up with two Commissioners. My final point is the following: I should like to know if you are standing by your proposal to distribute portfolios and organise a Commission composed of so-called senior and junior Commissioners.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Clegg (ELDR).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to join others in expressing our solidarity, sympathy and condolences for the Italian <span class="italic">carabinieri</span> and other victims of the attack in Iraq last week and, of course, the victims of the horrific attacks on the synagogues in Istanbul.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to depart from the political pyrotechnics of some of the previous interventions and focus on the subject at hand today – the annual legislative programme. I would first like to stress that the ELDR Group defends the right of the Commission President to express himself personally on political issues concerning the future of the European Union. I must however say that, as a Liberal who treasures the diversity and pluralism of public opinion, I have some personal doubts about the wisdom of advocating two opposing blocks in the European debate either here or, more generally, in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the annual programme, other colleagues will speak on the Eurostat issue later. The ELDR Group has consistently welcomed the progress made over the last few years in the way in which the Commission has presented this important document. Only a few years ago it was nothing more than an arbitrary shopping list of legislative and non-legislative proposals. There has been an attempt, both this year and in previous years, to include some strategic thinking and we welcome some of the recent innovations, such as the move towards more rigorous impact assessment procedures. However, as President Prodi himself rightly indicated, there is still much room for improvement, and we would like to highlight three areas in which we consider that the document presented to us today is still seriously lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the selection of the three strategic priorities – namely enlargement, stability and growth – is fine. However, those priorities are so open-ended it is almost impossible to imagine anyone disagreeing with them. It is equally impossible to imagine any legislative or non-legislative proposal that would not fall under those three strategic priorities. In other words there seems to be no real choice about what the European Commission is proposing this year, and no choice about what the strategic priorities of the European Union should be. On the contrary, there is a risk of a very open-ended approach towards EU business because of the very open-ended nature of the three priorities themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is no discernible link between those three vague priorities and the lengthy annexes containing legislative and non-legislative proposals. We understand that one of the annexes – both of which include around fifty legislative proposals – is supposed to relate to the priorities, while the other is not. Those of you who have examined the lists will have seen that they are interchangeable. They are not clearly organised according to the priorities, but seem to have been organised artificially into two categories. In other words, the priorities themselves do not seem to have guided the selection of legislative and non-legislative proposals before us today, which again gives a somewhat artificial tenor to the selection of the proposals presented to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council have mentioned, this summer we all signed an interinstitutional agreement explicitly designed to ensure better law-making in the European Union. The Commission explicitly committed itself, in that interinstitutional agreement, to explain fully today when it presents its annual legislative programme, firstly the choice of legislative instrument for each proposal, and secondly the choice of legal base. There are some indications on the legal bases, in these lengthy, somewhat impenetrable annexes, but no reference whatsoever to the choice of legislative instrument. It cannot be that, a few months after the signing of an interinstitutional agreement on better law-making, the Commission fails, at the first hurdle, to honour the promises made in that agreement. It bodes extremely ill for the improvement of law-making for that to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a terrifically important moment in the political and legislative cycle in the European Union. It is the moment when the European Commission exercises its supreme privilege and prerogative – namely the monopoly right of initiative. That right of initiative is only ever defensible if exercised in a fully accountable, transparent manner in which motives are fully explained and political accountability is fully safeguarded. On the basis of what we have seen today, we do not believe that to be the case. There is still very significant room for improvement.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blak (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues, and especially my Italian ones, in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I should like to express our deepest sympathy with the badly hit Italian and Iraqi families. We absolutely deplore the dreadful acts carried out by the terrorist groups, and we condemn them most vigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use the GUE/NGL Group’s speaking time to talk about Eurostat, and I should like to make it quite clear that my group is not out to have the Prodi Commission dismissed because of Eurostat. On the contrary, we should like to bring this matter to a close and give the Commission peace to do its work in its last year. The Commission has a very ambitious work programme for 2004 with enlargement and the creation of stability and growth, not only in the EU but also in the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the Eurostat scandal will hang like a cloud over the Commission until political responsibility for it has been assigned, so we should like to call upon Mr Prodi to dismiss the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat so that the Commission can be given peace to do its work.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now obtained the final report on Eurostat from the Internal Audit Service. It unfortunately confirms what we have known for a long time, namely that the administration of Eurostat has been scandalous. It has, however, been very difficult for the Internal Audit Service to establish what really went on in Eurostat. There are no files, and most documents are missing. It is therefore impossible to say very much about practice after 1999, but we know that the unlawful accounts were open right until the summer of last year and this year. We know there is a strong likelihood of a considerable amount of money having gone into the wrong pockets. We know that there is still no database of contracts. We know that the audits have not been followed up. We know that almost nothing has been done to tidy matters up.</p>
<p class="contents">We know, in other words, that Eurostat’s administration has been scandalous, including after 1999. Is anyone taking responsibility, however? No, apparently not. The Santer Commission fell just under five years ago. It did so because the Group of Wise Men concluded that it was very difficult to find anyone in the Commission who was willing to take responsibility. Following a host of reforms, we had in actual fact hoped that those times were over, but we have unfortunately been back in rather familiar territory in recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">After the fall of the Santer Commission, we have now obtained a new article in the Treaty. It has now become possible for the Commission President to dismiss individual Commissioners. That is something Mr Prodi has chosen not to do, given that the person responsible, Mr Solbes, knew nothing. Mr Prodi has, however, conceded that Mr Solbes became guilty through having taken no action. That is, in my view and that of my group, reason enough. Passivity and indifference are also a form of crime, and one for which responsibility must be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi has today presented his action plan for Eurostat. I am obliged to say this very clearly: my group is sick to death of action plans. We want to see results. We have seen a host of action plans and plans for reform over the last four years. It is, of course, excellent to have plans for new and better procedures, and we shall naturally give our backing to such procedures. That is just not enough, however. The culture must be changed. It will be so only if the President sends a clear signal to his employees. Irregularities and fraud have consequences. We do in fact remember some wise words from Mr Prodi: zero tolerance for fraud. Fine words, but patently of no consequence. Less than a short hour ago, I issued a piece of advice in the Committee on Budgetary Control. It was that another Commissioner should be found to take over Eurostat in the last year, with Mr Solbes otherwise retaining his areas of responsibility. He gets bottom marks for his administration of Eurostat, however. With his passivity, he has been a party to maintaining a culture of systematic disarray and irregularities. He can, in other words, no longer have responsibility for Eurostat, and I now really do hope that the promise of consequences and of zero tolerance for fraud will be fulfilled and someone else found to take care of Eurostat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, my group, too, would like to express its sorrow and sympathy after the tragic events of recent days. It was silly to think that an unfounded war could miraculously produce peace and democracy. The Middle East is a daily reminder that one of the reasons that peace and democracy now seem increasingly distant possibilities is the international community’s inability to achieve genuine cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission President started his speech today with an optimistic reference to the economy and told us that the goal of a larger Europe which is capable of responding to the challenges of our time is within our reach. I agree, but I am afraid that, in some cases, the methods proposed reflect a somewhat conformist political and economic approach which is not centred on the most innovative and bold options open to the Union today. Mr Poettering, I can assure you that the approach underpinning the work programme is identical to that of President Prodi’s manifesto. Since our business is politics and we consider ourselves to be a genuinely European political force, our considerations apply <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis </span>to both documents. As the Commission itself admits, it has pursued only the economic aspects of the Lisbon strategy with any determination. President Prodi, that is not good enough! We fear that behind the politically correct concept of sustainable development lurks the concept of continuous development. The environmental dimension continues to do a disappearing act at the crucial moments where existing practice and instruments are concerned. As you are aware, we believe the Growth Initiative to be very important, but we really cannot bring ourselves to share the general enthusiasm over the list of roads, airports and high-speed trains costing billions of euro, most of which are still at the planning stage. Something we see as crucial is the imperative need for greater transparency as regards the European Investment Bank funding criteria and greater involvement of the European Parliament in establishing those criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not convinced by the Commission’s continuing reluctance to launch an energy efficiency plan which turns its back on the nuclear sector completely. What we lack today is a convincing framework for investment in technologies which can save<span class="bold"> </span>resources and focus on social cohesion, education and innovation. Considering, in addition, the delayed presentation of the Commission’s proposals on reforming the Structural Funds, we can only harbour some doubts as to the Union’s ability to respond to the challenges of growth and enlargement in due time. The success of the Growth Initiative depends, not least, on discerning implementation of the Stability Pact – and we would like to hear your opinion again on this, President Prodi – and on a proper programme for observing the Kyoto Protocol. If the majority of the Member States do not change course, the Union will not be able to fulfil its obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, President Prodi, we proposed the launch of a Climate Stability Pact, but I am afraid that we have not received any response. We are just a few weeks off the start of the COP9 in Milan and we would like to put this proposal forward once again. Just as in the matter of the deficit, it is the Commission which has the responsibility of calling to order those Member States – in particular Spain, Italy and Portugal – which, as things stand, will prevent us from achieving the Kyoto objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some points missing from your legislative programme. I do not have time to go into them all so I will just mention two. Commissioner Reding, the European Parliament has been calling for almost two years, genuinely united in its desire, for a proposal for a directive or, at least, a Green Paper, on media concentration and freedom of information. It is clear from your manifesto that you attach great importance to this issue. Why, then, can the Commission not manage to take action on this matter? Lastly, a couple of months have passed since the failure of Cancún, yet we have absolutely no idea what conclusions and what lines of action the Commission intends to follow, and there is no link with the Millennium Goals either, Commissioner Lamy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the question of Eurostat. President Prodi, you said you had learned a number of lessons from the Eurostat affair, but your text fails to mention one that is genuinely important: the Commission must pay greater heed to Parliament. The recommendations in the discharge reports are not just friendly advice – they are provisions which require the Commission to act and to do so in useful time. We used to have an unresponsive Commission and now we have a Commission which is capable of responses, and we do acknowledge this. Now, you have a year in which to make it capable of adopting decisive initiatives. We welcome the reform of the code of conduct and the improvement of the information channels between OLAF, the Commissioners and the Directorates-General, and it will not surprise you to hear that we also welcome the recognition of the role of whistleblowers. Moreover, many of these measures have already been called for by Parliament. We would remind you, however, President Prodi, that transparency is a good way not just of combating fraud but of preventing it too, and it is my genuine hope that, next year, in welcoming the new Members with open, transparent institutions as well as open arms, we will be able to put the events of recent years behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, President Prodi, I would like to say in conclusion, on behalf of my group, that the report still fails to express awareness of a certain sense of responsibility and to acknowledge the errors made. As you, yourself, admitted, the initial signs were there before May 2003: it was a question of seeing them, and we feel that this is something we can be forgiven for expecting of the Commission, particularly after the events which marked the term of office of the Santer Commission.</p>

In the same way, we should like to express our sympathy and respect for those who lost their lives in the attacks on the synagogues in Turkey. The western world must stand united in combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to talk about Commission President Prodi’s statement on the Eurostat scandal. Listening to his statement, as we have done today in the Committee on Budgetary Control, one would imagine that we had all just emerged from the primeval forest and that public administration was still something to be invented. Mr Prodi has reported on everything that does not work, referring to the lack of communication between the Commission and the control bodies, the OLAF internal audit, Parliament etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi now promises that matters will be improved, but these problems are of course known by all governments with much larger administrations than the Commission’s. In all normal democracies, the political systems and administrations are developed in such a way that embezzlement and fraud are prevented or discovered very quickly. The Commission still has to devise all these arrangements. This can only be interpreted as an expression of total incompetence on the part of the Commission and as a lack of will in a system characterised by a down-at-heel administrative culture. That is why the Committee on Budgetary Control has such a lot of difficulty obtaining the analysis reports and has a duty of confidentiality imposed upon it with regard to everything it knows. Someone has known about the scandal for a very long time, and someone has wished to conceal it. Mr Prodi says that his reform, which was begun in 1999, is already working. How, then, will he explain the fact that the press and the European Parliament knew about the Eurostat scandal a good year before MEPs forced the Commission to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi says that OLAF had been working on fraud in Eurostat for several years, without providing a word of information to the Commission, yet he says he has every confidence in Mr Brüner and OLAF. There are three possible explanations: either the Commission gave OLAF’s director completely fatuous instructions, with the result that he did not keep the Commission informed; or the Commission wished to leave unpleasant matters on the back burner for years in a secretive OLAF; or OLAF’s management is appallingly naive and does not understand the political necessity of sounding the alarm bells so that the Commission is warned of serious fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi says that he has now taken some tough decisions. No, Mr Prodi, you have not. You have merely suspended a few criminal bosses on full wages, and you have only done it under pressure from the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament. You bear full responsibility. This Parliament will be naive if it gives discharge for your administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who bears political responsibility for the Eurostat scandal? The scandal is not that someone has had their fingers in the till. The most serious scandal is that we have an accounting system that still makes embezzlement possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Forty-seven auditors and other experts have worked with Eurostat since June 2003. They have asked for 78 contracts but only received 60. Of those 60, 28.5% were implemented in contravention of EU rules governing invitations for tenders. Where are those 18 missing contracts? Who is responsible for their not being there? Who will obtain them? There must of course be copies of the contracts in all the firms. Why have they not been obtained straight away, and where are the banks’ copies for the secret accounts? Who is responsible for the fact that the 47 auditors do not have them? Who is taking responsibility for ensuring that all the documents in proof now come to light?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you have just held a meeting with the Committee on Budgetary Control in my group’s offices, where you promised openness and zero tolerance for fraud, as you also did when you came to office in 1999. Up until now, however, zero tolerance has been shown first and foremost to those who have revealed fraud and warned against the accounting system that permits it. The Commission has shown efficiency in its dealings with Paul van Buitenen, Marta Andreasen and Dorte Smidt-Brown. They were quickly and resolutely frozen out. Who has responsibility for restoring their civil rights?</p>
<p class="contents">When will you say to Mr Solbes: ‘Pedro, you are not perhaps the guilty party, but Eurostat is your responsibility. Step down. I accept Mr Blak’s proposal and assume responsibility myself for providing a full explanation of the Eurostat scandal’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who have died know they were murdered for the same reasons as their US and UK colleagues and fellow-soldiers are being murdered, and for the same reasons that we find ourselves in Istanbul with a cowardly, two-faced, three-faced Europe, which, in general, needs the capacity offered by Istanbul in order to ensure that an Israeli has the same human rights as a Palestinian, the same human rights as someone who is in favour with this Europe of Vichy, with this Europe with pacifist tendencies, of this Europe of our Parliament, not even a tenth of which is present here this morning: just count the heads – 58 – not even a tenth of the elected representatives. That follows, however, for it is nothing but a voting machine, and it is a party political voting machine; this is a Europe which deserves no credit at all for expressing sympathy, for it is sympathy which is impersonal solidarity, solidarity against George Bush and with Saddam Hussein, always, consistently, in all events.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, as I read your ‘State of the Union’ speech I am reminded of something: it is as if the ‘State of the Union’ speech were being made by that Washington which your Europe hates, as it hated it in 1939 and 1940, as it hated the plutocratic Judaeo-Masonic democracies in the 1940s, as it hated the France of Jacques Doriot in addition to the France of Marshal Philippe Pétain, as it hated those who cried, ‘Die for Danzig, die for Danzig!’ – no, never, <span class="italic">jamais</span>! – when, in the name of pacifism, the murderous, shameful Munich Pact struck; the shameful pact which set the scene for the Holocaust and established the fascist, communist, fundamentalist, Counter-Reformist alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of reform, President Prodi? Be patient: minus the beautiful baroque art of Bernini, this is the Europe of the Counter-Reformation, of the era when the undiluted perversion of the policies of the Pope-King made Dante Alighieri call a ‘shameless whore’ the See which exploited the story and mission of Christ in the interests of the most abasing worldly affairs – in the Vatican at that time but I say it is happening today too. I am quoting Dante, and, much as it pains me, I feel that the quotation is appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of the Union, Mr President: according to the lines you are all taking – Parliament, Council and Commission – we should have a Commission comprising 30 members, soon to become 35, because we are the United States of Europe. Of course, the President of the United States ought to have 50 or so ministers to run the country effectively, is that not so? It is not this way that you will unite a Europe which provides an alternative, the Europe of Altiero Spinelli, of Alcide De Gasperi, of Konrad Adenauer rather than of Erich Ollenhauer or his other contemporary nationalistic social democrat rival.</p>
<p class="contents">Such is the state of the Union. This Union, President Prodi, is what funds all the dictatorships with which it sustains relations, following a criminal policy. The provisions of Article 2, which are usually the basis for agreements with dictatorship regimes, are not worth the paper they are written on. At the moment, we have here in Strasbourg the representatives of the real Vietnam of tomorrow and all the years to come, we have representatives of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, who are asking to see you. Every day, in the face of events in Vietnam, Cambodia and throughout the world, we, and Mr Solana and others, as in the case of the former Yugoslavia, essentially side with Milosevic against those fighting for democracy. The state of the Union is pitiful, for Europe is the Europe of television, of Munich, of fascism, of communism; it is a democratic and civil disgrace.</p>

Next June, European elections will be held in very special circumstances, when we welcome ten new countries in the most extensive enlargement that Europe has ever seen. They will take place in an atmosphere of hope for a constitution for Europe, on the basis of the excellent draft submitted by the Convention, all of this against an unstable international background, with an increasingly-entrenched war in Iraq, intensifying international terrorism, presidential elections in the United States and a still-fragile economic climate in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In such a situation we need to hold to our course with a strong and independent Commission at the helm. If, as we all hope, there are signs of an economic recovery, the Commission must be able to respond so as to take advantage of all of the opportunities likely to benefit its economic and employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament cannot afford to lose a year. Our fellow citizens would not understand. We therefore need to concentrate on those proposals that absolutely must be adopted by the end of the parliamentary term, that is to say during the first quarter of 2004, and monitor progress on those that we are patiently waiting to scrutinise for the first time. For the second year running, we have maintained the principle of structured dialogue between parliamentary committees and commissioners. We welcome this, but the dialogue still has room for improvement. We therefore propose the creation of a more reliable interinstitutional timetable, to be drafted on a multiannual basis, which would make it easier to follow up and evaluate the actual results achieved. It would also be desirable to provide for more systematic follow-up to the demands made by Parliament for additional actions to be incorporated in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the accession of the ten new Member States is concerned, we have every confidence in the friends who will be joining us. We take note of the extraordinary progress that they have made, but we attach great importance to their respecting the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>and applying the texts relating to controls at the new external border. Similarly, we also think it is important to monitor the level of nuclear safety within the enlarged Union. This enlargement cannot succeed unless the institutional framework is adapted. Our group wishes to see the work of the Convention respected. This draft should therefore be safeguarded and must be recognisable in the constitutional treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has undertaken to improve our legislation, to make it more accessible, easier to read and more transparent, and to simplify law-making. We will ensure that it does so! This is one of the public’s major expectations. The added value of the European Union rightly lies in policies which further the fight against illegal immigration, in common management of our borders and in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and this thanks to enhanced police and judicial cooperation and the development of a common asylum policy setting out clear procedures. These initiatives should be taken in cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin and the enlarged Union’s new neighbours: Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">An additional key to stability is the concept of sustainable development, which should have a bearing on all of our legislative work. Making a success of sustainable development means fostering private initiative, educating and informing the public, continuing to pursue healthy macro-economic policies that generate jobs, accelerating structural reform and promoting investment in infrastructure and human resources. These initiatives should be undertaken in accordance with the Lisbon agenda, which seeks to boost potential economic performance by increasing the flexibility of the markets in goods, capital and labour. Whether it be transport policy, research policy, which is still insufficient in the light of the brain drain, telecommunications, with the development of the Internet, our Structural Funds policy, which is essential for revitalising the regions – and not only in the enlargement countries – all of our initiatives and policies should place the people at their heart. That is why we expect a robust commitment from you to take account of increasing life expectancy. All of this is part and parcel of sustainable development. Furthermore, although we warmly welcome the thematic strategies for the environment, we deplore the lack of initiatives on the urban environment and the lack of follow-up to the Thessaloniki Council, which was supposed to create a European diplomacy network on the environment and sustainable development.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Prodi, you are right to make the issue of enlargement the central priority for 2004 in your proposals. In reality, enlargement has been formally agreed but in many people’s minds – perhaps in this House, but especially in the wider population – it is still not truly complete. For that reason, the Commission is right to focus in the coming months on ensuring that where there is corruption, where there are administrative issues to be resolved, and where nuclear safety is at stake, all the countries which are due to accede to the European Union on 1 May 2004 are genuinely preparing to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Our negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania must continue too. We must state clearly and unequivocally that 2010 is the envisaged date – but no country can assume that the envisaged date will be the actual date unless they persist with the reforms they have begun.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you will have the task of preparing the Council’s decision on Turkey next year. However, I would ask you to consider this: unless a positive decision is adopted in favour of opening accession negotiations, you will need to come up with ideas on how we can intensify our cooperation with Turkey until – and, indeed, during – the opening of negotiations. The events of recent days in Istanbul demonstrate the importance of cooperation with Turkey, especially on security issues. This closer and coordinated cooperation with Turkey is essential, irrespective of the accession issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement also raises the issue of effective and secure external borders. I agree that this is an important aspect of our development, also in the context of the wider Europe. However, cooperation with our neighbours is also essential, for example, in preventing cross-border crime and combating the evils of human trafficking. Developments in the Balkans have shown that it is quite possible for the European Union to shape this cooperation productively. However, it is also crucial that when we talk about migration, we also talk about integration. I hope that the Commission will point out to some countries that it is not just a matter of restricting migration. The task is also to integrate the people who come to the European Union more fully into our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards policies for growth, which your programme also deals with extensively, we support the Commission’s proposals on investment in networks and knowledge. We need a swift decision here. This House must make some swift decisions in order to implement the Growth Initiative. Emphasising investment is all well and good, but networks and knowledge need investment too. Indeed, experience in recent months has shown that if we merely liberalise without creating incentives for investment in networks – such as energy or transport – at the same time, the temporary or even the longer-term collapse of networks may be the result. If we want to modernise Europe, we – and that means the European Union as a whole and, of course, all the individual Member States – must increase investment not only in knowledge but also in our infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issues of liberalisation and harmonisation, I would ask you, Mr Prodi, also to consider that we are trying to achieve a European social model. In my view, this is not adequately expressed in your paper. I sometimes have the impression that we are more liberal than the neoliberals in their theory books and more American than the Americans in some of our steps towards harmonisation and liberalisation. We must consider the social consequences. We must make combating social exclusion and poverty a priority. In some countries, poverty is on the increase again. Surely that is a catastrophe? This may also be due to the fact that the austerity programmes do not adequately consider how spending cuts and liberalisation measures impact on various social groups. That is not an argument against liberalisation, but simply an argument for considering the social impacts of unemployment etc.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context – and in my view, the paper does not focus adequately on this issue either – I would like to highlight the importance of public services, which we will be discussing next week in this House. Many public services are a particular feature of the European social model which we wish to stand up for, clearly and unequivocally, also to the outside world. I therefore ask you to take more account of that in your work</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two further comments. The first concerns foreign policy. This Parliament has very often discussed the position of this House and the European Union on the Middle East. We must have the strength and determination to pursue the goal we have set ourselves and clearly support all peace initiatives, the most recent being the Geneva Accord. However, none of the developments in the Middle East and none of the criticism we voice towards Israel remotely justifies anti-Semitic statements or actions. Europe must be clear that criticism of the present Israeli Government’s position cannot be a motive for any kind of anti-Semitic words or deeds. We should all have learned the lesson of the disaster of the Second World War in particular, and together, we should resolutely counter all forms of discrimination and anti-Semitism, notwithstanding our clear position on the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you have heard our views today. We want a strong Commission President and a strong Commission. Please do not add grist to the anti-European mill by raising uncertainty or, indeed, doubts that you will represent a strong Commission as its President until the elections next year. This is essential to ensure that when the voters go to the polls in June, they know what they are voting for, namely a strong and united Europe with a strong Commission and Commission President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the process that is now to be begun, it is absolutely crucial to ensure that we continue to have a strong internal audit service which, in spite of everything, is of course the first link in the chain when it comes to discovering fraud, misappropriation and irregularities. It is important for us to have a strong and independent OLAF. It is particularly important for us to have a clear definition of political responsibility. I think, in actual fact, that political responsibility is of crucial importance and, what is more, political responsibility borne by the individual Commissioner. If we do not have this, I do not believe it will be possible for the reforms to percolate through the system and down to the individual employee, lowest in the hierarchy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore listened, of course, with great attention to Mr Prodi’s remark that we are now to have a definition of political responsibility. I should therefore like to ask the President of the Commission how the political responsibility we are now to have defined differs from that defined by the independent experts and that indicated in the Code of Conduct signed by the Commissioners in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now also to have a monitoring unit for picking up signals if something goes wrong. Mr Prodi argues that the Commission did not have the ability to intervene prior to May 2003. My question, however, is this: what kind of signals is this group to pick up? Now that it has emerged that 14 critical auditors’ reports are not enough, just as complaints from various employees to different Commissioners, letters in the press, hearings in the Committee on Budgetary Control and auditors’ letters to the Commissioner responsible in the department responsible are not enough, what kind of signals are needed before the Commission intervenes? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For I have noticed that, slowly but surely, we are moving towards a situation in which social policy competition is increasing considerably and in which the European citizen might well conclude in time that social dumping will be playing a part, more so than is currently the case and more so than we can justify to the citizen in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like a straight answer from the Commission to the question whether we can expect its position on employment directives before the end of March. This would allow us during the last plenary meeting in April to give our position on these employment directives against the backdrop of the current economic climate.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to speed up the process of adopting directives in the area of the European works council and on working times, which have to do with social dumping. After all, in some countries, England being one of them, it is possible to work up to sixty hours or so. We want speed in the package that pertains to the Posting of Workers directives. We want acceleration where the European social funds are involved, and I could go on like this for at least another five minutes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will now focus my speech on the Eurostat case. There are too many unresolved questions in this affair and the measures that have been taken to remedy matters are few and, I would venture to say, belated and, therefore, probably ineffective. My opinion was confirmed after President Prodi’s hearing before the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, in which he was, quite frankly, too general and, if I may say so, a little reticent.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the way the affair has been handled, given that we have a President who has made transparency one of his principal objectives, we do not understand why we have witnessed all kinds of endeavours to keep the documentation under wraps and avoid public debate in the Eurostat case, as if we were dealing with a state secret. There are too many questions, as I said. Has this drain on the EU’s funds come to an end? If it has come to an end, when, exactly, did that happen? Just this morning, the fact that the most serious incidents took place before 1999 was stressed once again. What about the less serious incidents? When did they occur? Are they still going on? Most importantly, what is the criterion for assessing the seriousness of an incident? The size of the sum taken, maybe? I would respectfully point out that fraud is serious by its very nature, and it is much more serious and unacceptable when public officials are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, how is it possible for a fraudulent organisation to have succeeded in operating without hindrance for years in the Commission? Are we really to believe that nobody noticed anything, despite the fact that rumours, faxes and emails on unlawful gains and fake contracts were flying around the Commission departments? What is more, we fail to understand how the Commission’s watchdog system works, for many other outrageous incidents have been discovered in addition to the Eurostat affair, such as the case of cereal prices. In this connection, the most ridiculous thing – it would be laughable if the matter were not so serious – is that the document presented this morning states – and I would draw your attention to this – that we need gradually to lay the foundations for a new culture of responsibility and transparency. What are we to infer from this? That, hitherto, irresponsibility and lack of transparency have been the norm in the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else that needs to be said on the subject of Eurostat and the serious nature of the scandal surrounding the organisation. This is not just another department, one of the many centres of European bureaucracy: it is an institution which, in carrying out its recording and statistical work, is, in actual fact, the guarantor of the Stability Pact, verifying the implementation of the Maastricht criteria. It therefore plays a part in defining Member States’ economic and financial policies and, in practice, in forcing the States to adopt stringent policies which often involve budgetary or welfare cuts. It is therefore an institution which has a watchdog role and which cannot afford to be associated with even the remotest doubt or suspicion regarding its impartiality or authority of the kind currently surrounding it.</p>
<p class="contents">We realise that the affair is embarrassing because public funds have been used for unlawful purposes; we also understand the problem caused by the fact that the affair has exploded at a sensitive time, on the eve of the European elections, of enlargement and of the Constitution; we understand the problem but we cannot compromise on the matter. We can neither condone nor, as some would have us do, underestimate the severity of the incidents of corruption, fraud and malpractice. It is the citizens who demand that we stand firm, the same citizens of whom we ask sacrifices in the name of the Stability Pact. What is more, instead of pointing the finger and making a scapegoat out of some civil servant and bringing the affair to a hasty conclusion in this way, we would have greatly appreciated it if the Commission had fully shouldered its responsibilities, as Mr Santer did over much less.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot let all this pass without speaking out, especially at a time when the President of the Commission is disseminating a political manifesto – or maybe we should call it an electoral manifesto – describing the Europe of his dreams while neglecting the Europe that exists here and now. As if things were not bad enough already! President Prodi is entitled to put himself forward as a candidate for the next European elections, but, if this is his intention, we expect him to do things properly and resign. On the other hand, the damage this would cause at institutional level would be severe and, quite frankly, unacceptable.</p>

It contains good ideas, even if they may be a little trivial and general; some of them certainly deserve support and others less so, but, although I do not object to the Commission President drawing up a political document – he is still entitled to his own political views – it is unacceptable that he should address an individual country and an individual party in this manifesto. It should also be pointed out – and I am going to do so – that, in his position, rather than expressing ideas he should be making things happen. He is the President of the Commission: he is in a position to accomplish things, he can take steps to make them law. As regards the fact that he said that his manifesto is addressed to the whole of Europe, I beg to differ. Indeed, I quote: ‘It is against this backdrop that, turning to Italy and the forthcoming elections for the European Parliament next spring, I have proposed that all reformists ...’ and so on. Then the document makes a clear reference to the Olive Tree for it says: ‘But the inspiration is still the original inspiration behind the Olive Tree’. This is therefore a partisan document, which is unacceptable from the President of the Commission. If Mr Prodi claims to have addressed Europe as a whole then he is speaking a load of codswallop, not least in that I do not seem to remember seeing any olive trees sprouting up and growing in countries such as Sweden or Finland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The priority of enlargement, along with the other two priorities, makes real sense for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Since most of the Commission is here, it would make sense to summon all our colleagues in order to hold a real debate on what the European Union is going to be. That would suggest we should cancel all meetings outside the Chamber to allow our colleagues to be present.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a remark about the Commission reforms which, as you have said, Mr President, were the reason for the Commission coming into office. My Group has continually pressed for reforms based on the Wise Men's report. There has been significant progress, and most recently we received a very positive document detailing changes in the financial regulation and the staff regulations yesterday evening in the Committee on Budgets. However, this document still fails to address the weaknesses in the way the Commission is operating, as revealed by the Eurostat affair.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the three steps you outlined to the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, my Group is disappointed at the way in which the reforms have been implemented. One or two of our members said to you that reforms in relation to the flow of information, proper internal audits and Commissioners' responsibility for the services they run should have been completed by September 1999. If the institutions are to be successfully reformed, which is vital if our citizens are to have confidence in the way in which they are run, it is a problem, as Mr Blak has said, that nobody seems to wish to take responsibility. You have sacked a Director-General, but the Commissioners are still in place. You reassured us this morning in the Committee on Budgetary Control that the Commissioners will have responsibility, but there are still unanswered questions.</p>
<p class="contents">My main question, to which I would like a reply, Mr President of the Commission, concerns the internal documents relating to Eurostat. You have come forward with proposals for the reorganisation of OLAF. However, we as a Parliament are still waiting for OLAF's report on Eurostat. Are the suggestions for reorganising the whole system coming from OLAF, because OLAF is a Commission service, or are we going to be able to have OLAF's report so that we as a Parliament can assess the situation and come to a conclusion? Other speakers have already said that we will need a strong Commission during 2004 to ensure that we can manage the responsibilities of the Union effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not good if the Commission always needs a new scandal before it takes a further step along its road to reform. This is constant grist to Mr Bonde’s mill – if I may be so bold as to name names – and he makes political capital out of it. That is one lesson the Commission should learn.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to some individual points. I greatly welcome your announcement this morning that the information channels between OLAF and the Commission are to be reviewed. That is necessary. However – and let me speak plainly – this must include answering the question how the Commission deals internally with information from OLAF, so that this information is not simply buried in the files without anyone knowing about it while everyone has their knives out for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that when asked, you clarified to the Commission on Budgetary Control that your proposals on the reform of OLAF do not imply that you are questioning or restricting OLAF’s responsibility for internal investigations. That is very important, for it would have resulted in a major clash with this House. We want to see OLAF as an independent agency, especially in light of the internal investigations, and so I welcome your clarifying this point to the Committee on Budgetary Control and urge you to continue along this course.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment on the issue of political responsibility. We have always adopted the position that the Commissioners should also be able to exercise this responsibility. Based on your statement this morning and the fact that a supplement to the Code of Conduct has again become necessary – describing how the Commissioners themselves should ask questions and how the services and the Directorates-General should be obliged to inform the Commissioners about problems, or landmines – I can only assume that this has not been set down on paper or been common practice. That was how we analysed the situation in July. However, the time has come to learn lessons from this. We want a radical reform of the relations between the Directorates-General and the Commissioners, and we will scrutinise your proposals to see whether they match these requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then the general opinion on Brussels is not all that great. This is why it was very much to be welcomed that the Prodi Commission declared that from now on, there would be zero tolerance across the board. We were therefore very shocked to hear the claims made in connection with Eurostat a few months ago. It has to be said that the Commission was quick to react when the news broke, but the big question is: what did the Commission know before that point? In my view, there are clear indications that the Commission, in the years leading up to May 2003, could have had some knowledge of what was happening at Eurostat. The Commission failed to take any action in the light of that information. Although it may talk about the need to improve information, we were told at regular intervals that an enquiry had begun at Eurostat. The big question is: why did the alarm bells not go off sooner in the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">When I hear the Commission speak, the main point it is driving home is that it is proud of the results achieved. In fact, the Court of Auditors stated yesterday that there are signs of improvement, and the Commission can be proud of this, with good reason. However, as for the aspects that went clearly wrong, the Commission washes its hands of them. The fault lies with OLAF, or the director-general, or whoever, but not with the Commission. That is wrong. I can only refer to an English politician, maybe a statesman – Mr Kinnock will undoubtedly know him – Lord Carrington. He knew nothing of the Falklands war, he was not sufficiently informed and despite this, he assumed the political responsibility for it. That is a very honourable position in my view. In the political culture from which I come, a minister, a secretary of state or a councillor is always responsible, and that should also be the case for a Commissioner and for the Commission. That is an issue on which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will be focusing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, its priorities have to be approved, first and foremost the end of the accession procedure for the ten new members and the creation of a neighbourhood policy for the enlarged Union, establishing an area of peace and prosperity on the basis of shared values and interests. Here we see a concern to step up the fight against illegal immigration, which is given greater prominence than in previous programmes. Its move up the list of priorities is realistic and must of course be followed by tangible initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Approval also has to be given to efforts to establish sustainable growth through a whole series of initiatives, including, amongst others, the Lisbon objectives and the major public works programmes that are currently being planned.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we remain perplexed about the calls for increased coordination of economic and budgetary matters, along the lines of the stability pact, as this risks on the contrary reducing flexibility, which would have an adverse impact on growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this programme leaves many questions unanswered. Some are inevitable: 2004 is full of uncertainty, with the European elections, the renewal of the Commission and the Intergovernmental Conference, the outcome of which no one can know in advance. Other questions concern enlargement, which does not amount solely to an accession procedure, as the document that has been tabled would seem to suggest, but which is also going to mean a significant change in working methods, including in the Commission. Will these working methods remain the same, as the document would seem to assume, or will they have to be changed? In addition, will we have to reckon with more differentiation? President Prodi only referred to this briefly at the end of his statement, just now, but we would have liked the document to address this issue in more detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, as I see it, one intangible measure is conspicuous by its absence. A way must be found to restore the harmonious balance between Parliament and the Commission. It is to that strategic alliance that so many advances in the project of European Union were due.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays we think of ourselves as citizens of a Union, not as mere consumers in a large market. The concept of a consumer implies the existence of a market. The concept of citizenship, however, demands and requires the existence of a Parliament as a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>. Such a Parliament needs to be a functioning entity. It must be able to imbue the project of integration with legitimacy. It must also be in a position to audit the Commissioners appointed, to invest the Commission, and to exercise democratic control over the latter. It has to be a Parliament capable of debate, rebuttal, ratification and rectification. It must be a Parliament firmly anchored in the real world that is not vain enough to court stardom. It must not adopt an arrogant stance either. Such a Parliament is certainly called upon to cooperate with the Commission, as the latter is a key institution in the project for European integration. Nonetheless, Parliament must also continue to play a vital and leading role in the future. It is the political engine powering the whole project and disseminating progress achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">This vital cooperation between Parliament and the Commission must not prevent the Commission from continuing with its activities. The Commission must always be governed by criteria of transparency, clarity, honesty and efficiency. For its part, Parliament must also demonstrate a capacity to distinguish between the essential and the ancillary. It must not succumb to the temptation of adopting a permanently hostile attitude to the Commission. It must exercise its rights and duties, in other words, its responsibilities to the citizens, with a sense of proportion, responsibility and in a measured manner. Sadly, Mr Baron, leader of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, has been found wanting in this respect. It is unfortunate that he is absent at the moment. Mr Baron raised doubts concerning the activities of Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission. Mrs de Palacio has a fine record of defending European interests. Many have good cause to be grateful to her. Further, she is irrevocably committed to the cause of the victims of terrorism and to the cause of freedom and the right to life in the Basque Country. I have to say, Mr President, that I was surprised to hear Mr Baron speak of awarding so-called compatibility certificates when you consider he occupies a seat in this House whilst simultaneously holding a seat on the Madrid town council.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to state that the measures proposed by the President of the Commission are on the right lines, taking into account also developments in what has become known as the Eurostat case. Even though I am of a different political persuasion, I have no doubts as to the integrity of the Commissioner in question. There is a general reluctance to stick one’s neck out for anyone these days. Nonetheless, I am prepared to vouch for the honesty of the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, and for the measures he has proposed concerning amendment of OLAFs remit. These measures are on the right lines and aim to restore that strategic alliance and harmonious balance between Parliament and the Commission on which so much of the progress made in the European Union project is based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenge which faced the newly-elected Parliament and the Commission in 1999 was to change this attitude. Over the past couple of years, the Commission has published different proposals for administrative reform within the framework of the European treaties.<span class="bold"> </span>The Kinnock reforms focused on human resources policy and a result-oriented budget. Via the European Parliament, a whistle-blowing regulation was introduced. Thanks to the White Paper on good governance, we obtained programmes for the codification and simplification of existing legislation. Legislative programmes were said to be reduced by 35 000 pages. As proposed by Parliament, an interinstitutional agreement was adopted on better legislation, containing proposals for alternative forms of regulation, with the option for Parliament and the Council to have a monitoring role as legislators.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention subsequently resulted in a reduction in the number of types of decisions from twenty-seven to only six. It also led to a clear and adequate distribution of tasks between Europe and the Member States, and a greater role for local and regional authorities. We would like to give Europe back to the citizen, to adopt policy from the bottom up. Accordingly, we are giving the national parliaments a greater role in order to help us in the European Parliament to monitor compliance with subsidiarity. Keep things at a national level where possible and do at European level what has to be done in a European context.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore carrying out reforms both within and outside of the framework of the Treaties. Thanks to these, Europe will be able to perform better and more democratically, for example in the area of cross-border crime.</p>
<p class="contents">What is irritating is that those achievements are sometimes at risk of being cancelled out by incidents such as Eurostat. Quite apart from the matter itself, it is of major importance for the Commissioners' political responsibility for their officials to be 100% possible and clear, not soon but now. The citizens and the European Parliament want a democracy, not a technocracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the White Paper and many actions that have subsequently been taken by Parliament and by the Commission, better and more effective legislation and administration have been established to a great extent. This has been done by guaranteeing access to documents for the citizens, by remaining committed to a modern human resources policy and a result-oriented budget, by working on announced impact assessments, for example in the economic, social and environmental fields, and by actually implementing the interinstitutional agreement. Actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, we are working towards a recognisable and approachable European administration. In this respect, the coming into being of the constitution will be crucial to the European citizens. We need results in 2004. There is no need for an electoral handbrake; this is not about winning the battle of Italy, but the battle of winning the hearts and minds of the European public. We would ask Italy to launch into an energetic final sprint, and I know that Italians are experts when it comes to cycling and final sprints. We would wish Mr Prodi and his Commission that success in 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worrying that we should continue to exploit this matter for political ends, blowing out of all proportion a question which is certainly not central to the life of the Union, while the Iraq tragedy strikes once again, reminding us of our inability to act and, what is more, our hypocrisy in the face of a war which was started to combat terrorism but which has ultimately served only to fuel it. We are not involved. We do not have our finger on the world’s pulse. Our times demand a great injection of political measures, giving Europe a soul and making it more than a wounded, helpless giant that some people continue today to want to see caught in the vice of bureaucratic neutrality: we need more politics of the kind proposed in Mr Prodi’s document, which he has addressed as a European citizen to his own country, first and foremost, but which applies to the Union as a whole and to all its political groupings, including the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Poettering, the many Christian democrats whom you should be representing as well, who cannot sit back and accept any shift to the right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank him for addressing the House today and giving such a clear account of concerns for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly agree that it is necessary to work for the future and to improve on what has not been done well so far. We are therefore glad to hear talk of reforming the reform, if I may put it like that. In other words, despite reforms or attempts at reform some things have not gone well. Further reform is needed. We were also glad to hear Mr Prodi speak of increased transparency in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, Mr Prodi, Members of the House also like to discuss what has taken place during these four years and what has not worked well. Parliament’s critical approach is aimed in fact at improving things in the future. We hope it will be possible to avoid repeating some of the difficulties we are currently confronted with.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we could have welcomed more detailed responses from you on certain issues, Mr Prodi. We need to be confident that the problems currently causing us serious concern will not recur in the future. We are concerned because we in Parliament wish to work with the Commission. We want to cooperate to strengthen and improve European institutions still further. What is needed is a strong Parliament alongside a strong Commission, Mr Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason we in the Committee on Budgetary Control adopt a critical and demanding approach. At the same time, it is of course a positive approach. Mr Prodi, you must be in no doubt that our aim is for the Commission to become better and stronger as we go forward into the future. After all, that is the message we have to deliver when we stand in the European elections. We will be telling the citizens that they must vote in elections to the European Parliament to promote still stronger institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the positive message we must convey. We would like to work with the Commission to get it across. Mr Prodi, please bear in mind therefore that our criticism is always positive and is aimed at facilitating solutions acceptable to all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this point of view, 2004 ought to be the year that will allow us to reconcile two absolutely essential objectives of our Union: peace and prosperity. In other words, we have no chance of successfully meeting any of the challenges that await us in 2004 unless we re-lay the foundations for prosperity on our continent. The third objective set for 2004 by the Commission, sustainable development, is therefore absolutely essential in the light of the Union’s current economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context my group dares to hope that the Commission will make employment a clear priority, because neither enlargement nor a new constitution will be acceptable to our fellow citizens unless we first turn our attention to the issue of employment. To do so, we also need investment, both private and public, in human resources and we need a return to a level of growth that is sufficient to increase the quality of life of our fellow citizens. We must not rely solely on variations in interest rates or on the outside world to deliver growth areas for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We might perhaps regret the fact, moreover, that the Commission has not, in its wide-ranging programme for 2004, addressed more explicitly the question of economic governance, above all given that the conditions in which the Commission is intending to prepare the spring summit, particularly as regards the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, do not yet appear to be quite clear. We need to know under what conditions the new Commission will have to implement the follow-up to this strategy and with this in mind, it might perhaps be useful for the outgoing Commission to draft an assessment of the first phase of the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it seems to me that the Commission’s programme ought to give a higher profile to the issue of sustainable development. I also note that despite a totally unrealistic number of new legislative proposals, some omissions can be observed. Firstly, there is not a word about the second reading of the directive on investment services, when it is a text on which we have done a great deal of work. I therefore dare to hope that we will be able to complete it before the end of this parliamentary term. The same goes for the review of the Financial Services Action Plan and the extension of the use of the Lamfalussy procedure. This Commission and this Parliament ought to conclude work on all of these dossiers in the course of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by saying how surprised I am, Mr President of the Commission, that your legislative programme, which is so heavy and so crowded, does not even mention a framework directive on services of general interest, something that my group and this House as a whole have repeatedly requested, and for which the Convention also expressed a strong desire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, the parliamentary committees have been fully involved in preparing the legislative and work programme that Mr Prodi has just presented. It is thanks to this interinstitutional dialogue that today we have a programme for 2004 that largely reflects the shared priorities of our institutions. Nevertheless, there is certainly still room for improvement. Although the Commission has not taken account of all the requests made by the parliamentary committees, experience shows that the reliability of the timetables could be further improved. By way of an example, seventeen of the twenty-two proposals for codecision in the 2004 programme have already appeared in previous annual programmes and ought therefore to have been tabled long ago. It is therefore essential for both parties to monitor this programme carefully. In this context I would remind you that last year Parliament put forward the idea of having policy papers for each legislative area. These would form the basis for more detailed programming and would also be entirely in keeping with the objectives of the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’, which requires the three institutions to both better coordinate and better synchronise their legislative work. I would stress the three institutions because the Council is not currently involved in the structured dialogue. At the next Brussels meeting of the European Council, the Council’s first multiannual programme will be presented. It would be helpful if the European Parliament could be informed of the programme in good time precisely so as to establish a constructive dialogue between the three institutions concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also take the liberty of drawing your attention to the need to agree a procedure for an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> dialogue with the Commission for the year 2004. We will be addressing this issue this afternoon in the Conference of Presidents. But in my opinion it is essential that every effort be made to ensure that all of the stakeholders, including national parliaments and advisory bodies and, at the end of the day, the European public, have a legislative programme for the year 2005 in good time. If it is true that the current Commission really will be able to present its political strategy and budget for 2005 to the Union before October of next year then it should also be able to present its legislative programme during the course of that same month of October.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, I said here that I was convinced that, thanks to the structured dialogue, we were seeing the establishment of a genuine culture of planning and interinstitutional programming. The experiences of these last few months and the prospects for the future are in line with the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’ and fully confirm my optimism. It is up to all of us to work on this together in the interests of our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, in the short time remaining we need to integrate the ten new states into this objective. The objective remains unfixed. We have repeatedly expressed Parliament’s concerns about the integration of the Tampere objectives in the acceding countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the internal situation, I am very concerned at the length of list 4 at this late stage. This is the list awaiting decision by the legislator. It contains the directive concerning conditions of entry and stay in the European Union for reasons of work or study. It also contains the decision to be taken on granting asylum status and the minimum conditions for people to request asylum in Europe. The statute of long-term residents and the directive on family reunification should also be on the list. Although a decision has been taken on the latter there are countless exceptions to it, to the extent that there is really nothing to choose between having this directive and having fifteen different sets of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">True, this is a problem for the Council. Nonetheless, it is also the Commission’s responsibility to defend the programme it has itself proposed and to defend it strongly. The programme is good, consistent and global. The Commission must defend it as Mr Prodi stated a few weeks ago before the House when he spoke following the tragedy of the victims in Italy. Sadly, that tragedy was repeated in Spain. Mr Prodi, you can count on our support in defending the programme before the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is currently exerting strong pressure to establish disjointed measures regarding what it terms illegal immigration. These measures are doomed to failure. I am not making an ideological statement. Rather, I am stating it is clearly impossible to take account only of the point of view of ministers responsible for home affairs in as complex and global an issue as immigration. I urge you to put immigration in its broadest sense on the agenda for relations with our neighbours. It has to be a factor in achieving stability and prosperity. Immigration also needs to be linked to employment, as has already been the case. You can count on our support over this.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an extensive list of decisions outstanding in the field of cooperation over criminal issues. Curiously, that list contains, amongst others, the directives on the protection of the Community’s interests and combating people trafficking. As I said, this is curious. I appeal to you to deal with these issues as a matter of priority. Once again, you can rely on Parliament’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What planet is he on? The Stability Pact, one of the foundations of our single currency, is in jeopardy, and the single currency is one of the pillars of this entire Union. With his extremely ill-considered description of the Pact as the ‘Stupidity Pact’, the Commission President has himself contributed to its derailment.</p>
<p class="contents">Two major countries have blatantly departed from compliance with the Stability Pact’s rules. Regrettably, this includes my own country, which pushed for the launch of the Pact in the first place. How, and with what authority, does the Commission President intend to call these countries to order given that he himself has helped to undermine the Pact? What is the Commission President actually doing to counter the threat to the Pact which also emanates from the Convention’s draft? Who actually authorised the Convention to delete the goal of price stability from the catalogue of Union objectives? Price stability is the basis of the Union’s entire monetary constitution. In Germany, we lobbied for our public’s endorsement of the single currency and the phasing out of the Deutschmark by assuring them that price stability and the independence of the Central Bank would be guaranteed. We will feel cheated if the goal of price stability is now softened and price stability is put on the backburner. That is why, Mr Prodi, we expect you to give Commissioner Solbes your backing on this matter, not stab him in the back.</p>
<p class="contents">As a second point, you mentioned the Lisbon strategy. In ten years’ time, we will supposedly be the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world. Is this anything more than empty words? Believe me, Mr President, you will need to change your legislative culture in more ways than one if we are to achieve this objective!</p>

Consequently my first words must surely be words of condolence to the Italian people following the tragic events of recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn now to a subject Mr Prodi dwelt on at length, namely the issue of controls. In modern organisations it falls to the administration of political power or of legislative power to exercise control. Mr Baron, leader of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, referred earlier to the Casaca report on the importance of Parliament as a source of political power. There are also the legislative controls.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Baron said previously, duplication of administrative controls must be prevented. Administrative controls have their place within administration. I do not believe, however, that the outstanding issues before us today can ever be adequately dealt with without an ordered system of political and legislative control.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission’s legislative programme focuses on enlargement. In this connection I am bound to reflect the very grave concerns felt by this House following the Commission’s latest monitoring report presented by Mr Verheugen in plenary. We wonder how many of the acceding countries really are in a position to transpose the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> between now and 1 May. In the event of one or more of these countries failing to fulfil the relevant requirements, we wonder too what measures the Commission intends to propose and what measures the Council intends to adopt to prevent such countries joining the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to say that this House was taken aback by the Latvian Government’s decision to relieve one of its members of the duty of observer at the European Parliament, because the member concerned had expressed opinions at variance with the official government line. This is all linked to the issue of minority populations in the Baltic States. The question arises as to whether these countries are meeting the fundamental Copenhagen criterion of having an open and functioning democratic system in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative programme also contains a reference to the Union’s new neighbours. In particular, there is a suggestion of creating common areas for matters of justice and home affairs together with Russia and Ukraine. I would remind you of recent events in those countries. Leaders of industry have been arrested, imprisoned and tried. It seems likely that this was done for political reasons, not for strictly legal ones. One might well wonder how much we could have in common with governments of that ilk.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to raise an issue touched upon by Mr Clegg and Mr van den Berg amongst others. I refer to the adoption of the interinstitutional agreement. I note that the President failed to refer to this agreement in any way. Though it is recent, this agreement is of major importance. It would be appropriate for the Commission to provide the House with some information on the implications of this agreement for the Commission’s legislative programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That concern is more widespread than I can recall on any previous occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at Annex 3 of the Communication from the Commission, I am particularly concerned to see that the Prodi Commission is claiming great success in this area. Its commitment to achieve a broad programme of internal reform includes agreeing a new financial regulation for the management of Community funds. However, there is nothing new about the Eurostat crisis or the background to it, while the Court of Auditors has been unable to sign off the accounts for nine successive years</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not say that Parliament is suddenly completely in the clear over this. Parliament has, notwithstanding the approach taken by the Court of Auditors, passed those accounts year-in year-out, so there is no doubt whatsoever that the Commission has been led to the view that these were not matters of sufficiently high concern to Parliament. If that has changed I welcome it. Why do I welcome it? Because at this moment EU citizens regard the Commission as synonymous with negatives as regards fraud, maladministration and shoddy accounting.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that and take the view that the European Union's image should be improved. We look to the Commission to address that issue. How can it do this? Very simply by addressing the concerns that have been raised, by not disregarding those concerns and by taking action in relation to the position of the whistleblowers who have drawn them to public attention. There are currently three such persons who have been suspended from their duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commissioner to take action to ensure that those people who have drawn attention to the scandals relating to EU accounting, and whose current suspension is completely misunderstood by the people of Europe, are restored to the role of clearing up the EU's accounts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For 2004, you list a work programme with seven proposals of interest to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. I must start by voicing criticism of the fact that these work and action programmes are always submitted relatively late in the day. As a result, we are currently negotiating the programmes for youth, culture, organisations and vocational training. We are under enormous time pressure and have to find solutions under these conditions. Otherwise, the programmes for next year will fail and will not be implemented. No one wants to be exposed to this criticism and, above all, this responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities of the Commission’s action programme for 2004 do not necessarily lie in the area of education, youth and culture. For specific reasons, it has other priorities, such as enlargement, parliamentary elections, economic security etc. Nonetheless, I would ask the Commission not to neglect education, youth and culture. In the planning timetable for this year, the objectives set were far higher than actually achieved. I am thinking, for example, of legislative proposals which should have been adopted in September or October, such as the Europass Training, European CV, etc. but which were postponed, may be adopted at the end of this year, and in some cases will be implemented in 2004. The post-2006 training programmes are a case in point, which are a key aspect of cultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commission to adopt the pledged proposals to ensure that they can at least pass through their first reading in Parliament during this electoral term. I wish to draw particular attention to the legislative proposals in the audiovisual sector, which are supposed to be submitted in December. There is still no text submitted for the long-announced revision of the Television without Frontiers Directive. What we have instead is an apparently never-ending consultation process by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession of ten new Member States, stability and sustainable growth are undoubtedly important, but this does not mean that culture and education should be overlooked. Education must be a priority for enlargement. Topics should be interlinked. The focus should not always be on economic and political linkage. Culture and education must be integrated more fully, education as the basis for progress and development in the European Union, and culture as a prerequisite for community relations, dialogue and respect for cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And that the architects of this pact have shifted from being strong to being weak, from being stable to being unstable, from being reliable to being unreliable, and from having a sense of responsibility to having no sense of responsibility. These are the terrible facts that were also recently reaffirmed on Dutch television by the director of the Dutch Bank, when he also remarked that without a Stability Pact, there would not have been a euro and that we are even being taken for a ride by those who have drafted this Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">It is under this cloud that further discussions on the EU's enlargement are taking place. There are a few more countries waiting to join. In my view, it is very important for us to doggedly persevere with honest and coherent policy, and also to remain strict with those countries in respect of the criteria, particularly where the issues of the rule of law, democracy and good neighbourliness are concerned. It is unwise to treat the Balkan countries as if the race were already over. Those countries will first need to prove that they belong in the European Union. In addition, the introduction of criteria other than those previously agreed should be rejected, such as differences in religion, the size of the country or of the population, any strategic location, political benefits, the date of membership application, historical relations or economic benefit. These are all elements which, naturally, occur to everyone sooner or later, but it would be extremely bad if these were to exclude or relativise the agreed criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen mentioned the need for more common foreign and security policy in the light of enlargement. What is the Council's position on that? Does it share Commissioner Verheugen's view that we, because of enlargement, should strive towards a common foreign and security policy with all the more urgency? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we can do, however, is learn lessons from it. Firstly, this means that in future, the Commission must listen to Parliament, the directly elected assembly representing Europe’s citizens, instead of disregarding Parliament’s reports out of a strange mixture of ignorance and arrogance. Had the Commission listened, the matter would not have assumed such proportions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have an obligation towards our citizens to rectify the things that have occurred during this period, that is, during our, and your, term in office. We have put forward a number of proposals in this context. The report will be tabled in this House shortly. It has already been adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control. Among other things, it raises the issue of the financial regulation, which you have not touched on at all so far. For example, it addresses the fact that it is apparently still possible for firms to enter into contracts with the European Commission without being required to disclose details of their financial circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">There are firms that have their company headquarters in the Bahamas and it is rumoured that some European Commission officials are behind them. That must change. Directorates-General can currently exist outside the scrutiny of auditors. That must change too. Eurostat is a case in point. This is not good, and we must change this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we propose that the financial regulation or the internal rules be amended so that internal audit capacities are subordinate to the Head of Internal Audit. Had this been the case, the Eurostat issue would not have occurred on this scale. We want a solution, Mr Prodi, and we want it now, not in one or two years’ time. We must act now. The things that have happened must be rectified, and then we can restore voters’ confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The plan of action that he presented to us needs some commentary, and I would like, in the first instance, to deal with the continuing failure to sort out the issue of communication between the administration and the Commission – by which I mean the Commissioners, even though I can see how many measures already exist on paper; the September 1999 code of conduct, the ‘Charter for Delegated Authorising Officers’ of December 2000, and so on.

President Prodi, let me warn you most urgently not to create even more bodies, but instead to strengthen the ones we have and implement reforms where these are needed. I see little point in this new machinery to collect all the information on possible instances of fraud. I see no point in having a body to uncover financial irregularities. I do not see that there is any need to set up a management committee as a replacement for OLAF’s Supervisory Committee. You have touched on a great deal, and there is good in that, but the issue of whistleblowing still has to be sorted out. Reference has already been made to the fact that it is no longer a live issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is so much for us to do together, and so I urge you, before you issue the communication, to take Parliament seriously, to talk with us, to have a look at the Bösch report, so that we do not go down false trails. To do so would harm the European budget and hence the European taxpayer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was a first positive sign, which we cannot ignore, that the Commission is now prepared to listen to us more closely than it has done in the past, and we must therefore note this fact. I also wish to note something else that cannot be ignored and that is the fact that the internal hearings, both at central and Eurostat level, have worked well and independently. This is an extremely positive outcome of the current reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to say that, where Eurostat is concerned, responsibilities must be defined, some mechanisms are working much more slowly than they should, but something is at last happening. I also wish to say that I fail to understand why the Publications Service, the body financially responsible for allocating funds to Planistat, has to date taken no action, opened no enquiry and held no one responsible. Why has the body that provided most of the appropriations misused by the company CSD – and this is a body that depends on external aid – not been called to account or been subject to any action, with everything carrying on as if nothing had happened outside Eurostat?</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission wants to have us believe that it is going to take the principle of accountability seriously, it is absolutely crucial that it adopt measures concerning these two Commission departments. Otherwise, we will not be able to take the Commission seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among other things in relation to this, you propose taking steps towards the establishment of joint border control. For that you have our entire support. In so doing, you will ultimately be acceding to our demands, for we have always wanted the same high standards to apply on all our external borders after enlargement, and precautions need to be taken for that to be the case. Last week, at a press conference, you again suggested establishing, at the very outset, an agency to take over the work of control and coordination. This would be the sixteenth agency, and what we have learned so far about agencies can be summed up by saying that we have forgotten the names of many of them, we have forgotten what they do, and that we are most aware of them at the time of the Budget, when we notice – generally after they have been in existence for only a few years – that the outgoings are mushrooming. All that comes into my mind is that we should propose setting up an agency to examine the other agencies’ efficiency and consider whether we need any more of them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What we would like is for the means of control and coordination to be set up within the Commission or in close association with it, for the sake of efficient external borders control. We need control, we need coordination, we need the efficient use of resources, but under no circumstances do we have any need of an agency.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that you say that there must be tough action taken against illegal immigrants and something done to integrate those who are here legally. In that you have our full support, but please take action once and for all; see to it that return agreements are in place, not just with Macao or Hong Kong, but with the states from which migrants actually come. There is one thing you must not do, and that is, to offer the abolition of visas as a <span class="italic">quid pro quo</span>; instead, provide something that will be more help, namely trade facilities and economic aid, so that emigration ceases to be necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I want to stress the need to be careful not to damage our European institutions by blowing up into a major scandal matters which are important in relation to Eurostat but which, bearing in mind the prospective elections, might do untold damage to our institutions if pursued too strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is deeply regrettable that the Commission has still not come forward with the promised initiatives highlighted again and again by the European Parliament: the collective rights of employees, social security for atypical workers, protection against individual dismissal, revision of the working time directive and of the European Works Council directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also seems to be stalling on the other important areas, such as minimum income. It has produced a detailed study on the costs of non-social Europe which concluded that, while the so-called costs of social policy are usually immediately visible, the benefits are more difficult to identify and quantify. However, that social policy contributes to the quality of the labour market and the formation of social capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the recent coverage of, for example, charges for wheelchairs at Dublin Airport by Ryanair, it is important that the Commission comes forward with the promised regulation on the contract between passengers and airlines, particularly for passengers with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious from the opening speeches in this morning's debate that the election campaign is already under way. I would ask Members to be particularly careful not to undermine the confidence of Europe's electorate by going over the top about scandals. It is important to root out corruption, but we should be extremely cautious how we present this to our electorate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is this: ‘Not in the beginning is the reward, but only in consistent perseverance, the setting and achievement of objectives’. And the second is this: ‘He who does not take himself seriously will not be taken seriously by others’. Although we went into the Convention aiming to make Europe more transparent, to bring it closer to its citizens and to make it more democratic, we have not yet made that a reality. The objectives are more relevant than ever. So, Mr President of the Commission, he who would make Europe more transparent must be prepared to know his own tasks and pursue objectives in a consistent way. What that means is that I am calling for greater earnestness, a more earnest approach to Parliament, to our resolutions, to our aims, to our fears and criticisms and to make our self-image as a corporate body a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We get more and more proposals that actually ought never to have emerged from the Commission: on lines of credit for consumers; the Chemicals Directive; for the prohibition of discrimination, which flies in the face of economic reality; there is the harmonisation of duty on diesel, which has been thought through sector by sector rather than as a whole. I urge you to take up your collegial responsibility; with specific reference to Eurostat and to the statements you have made today, I demand that you take your political responsibility more seriously. With the Stability and Growth Pact in mind, I demand that you insist on compliance with the law. We read in your programme your call for better coordination of the Member States’ economic and budgetary policies, but I can tell you that we have no need of better coordination; what we need is compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. To do that would make for enough coordination!</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon you to take initiatives to strengthen the internal market, competition policy and social cohesion. If you also put yourself at the head of projects to create a sense of European identity, that will play a part in making European policy domestic policy, so that the internal politics of the Council will not be able to block European projects, for which people at home will blame the Commission and Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, the Commission must obviously continue to see its job through to the end.</p>
<p class="contents">In the transport sector, I want to say that important work has been done over all these years: the single European sky, the two railway packages, the liberalisation of port services and the new proposal for the trans-European networks where, of course, I want to point out that the main issue is not so much the legislative proposal as funding, about which I personally have certain doubts.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, I think that, in the transport sector, the main issue from now on is that we and the Commission need to join forces and convince the Council about certain issues which have been pending for about two years now, so that they can be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. For example, the Meijer report on urban transport is a classic example and, what we need is to use the time from now until the elections in order to advance a number of other issues, such as the harmonisation of certain social dimensions in the road transport sector, the amended proposal for a regulation on action by the Member States concerning the terms under which public services are provided in the rail, road and internal waterway transport sectors and the ban on heavy goods vehicles at weekends, which is also an issue that has been dragging on for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as far as regional policy is concerned, although it is not a strictly legislative matter, I want to point out that the Commission needs to present the third report on cohesion as quickly as possible, so that the European Parliament has an opportunity to take a position on this very important issue before the European elections.</p>

I am very disappointed by the measures announced by President Prodi, which indicate that the will to really tackle these problems is absent. Above all, I note the absence of changes in structure and personnel, for example changes to the responsibilities of the three Commissioners concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just remind you how this House, right at the beginning of this Commission’s term of office, wanted to hold fast to the separation of the budget and budgetary control, precisely in order to avoid the conflicts of interest that face us now. I find no trace of any serious reprimand for the three Commissioners responsible, making it clear that they were in breach of their supervisory responsibilities and of their duty of care. That, Mr President, is something that every ordinary employee, in similar circumstances, has to guarantee in the course of his employment. Thirdly, the controls must be made much more effective, as Eurostat is, in my view, a shining example of how all the Commission’s checks and balances can fail. It would have been easy for you to take at least one or two of these three possible courses of action, but you have taken none of them.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means, Mr Prodi, is that, for the second time since 25 September, you have failed to draw a line under the affair and regain the trust of Parliament and the public. There is one thing that I will not under any circumstances allow you to get away with, and that is your assertion that the reform of the Commission will be completed only in 2004 and that a Eurostat case will no longer be possible. Let me tell you that the opposite will be the case, as your reforms and the new Financial Regulation will weaken control still further. As a result of the abolition of the independent auditors, the Directors-General possess power to an unparalleled degree. Let me ask you this: is that really what you want? Democracy needs control, and an entity as deficient in democracy as the Commission certainly does.</p>

This is the fourth time running I have been here to listen to his presentation. Indeed, it is the fourth year running that his Commission has failed to get a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors for its accounts, and the ninth time running that the Commission, as an entity, has failed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that no one in Mr Prodi's Commission accepts political responsibility for anything, but am sure there are members of the Commission who have political antennae and can sense the mood of Parliament when it comes to the problems found at Eurostat and in the accounting system. I personally consider that Mr Prodi has weakened his position and the Commission's position by stepping into Italian domestic politics, which is something I am sure he should not be doing. I think he makes the Commission slightly more impotent by admitting that Commissioners currently have no political responsibility. With Eurostat he has shut the stable door too late, a long time after the horses have bolted, and is looking to blame the messengers rather than resolving the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to talk very briefly about the whistleblowers' charter, which is something I know Mr Prodi mentioned in the Committee on Budgetary Control's meeting earlier today, because his Commission's biggest failing has been the way it has treated some of the whistleblowers. The Commission has been a kangaroo court. It has suspended those who raise questions and problems and has actually rewarded those who have been involved in covering these things up.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to be positive, because I know that ten new Commissioners will be coming into your midst as of May 2004. As well as wanting to see an independent OLAF, I would like the Commission to consider the possibility of one of those Commissioners assuming responsibility for budgetary control and the internal audit service of the Commission, because the sooner it is separated from the budgetary function itself, the sooner we may start to make headway as regards these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The accession of the new countries, which we planned, promoted and achieved all together, must take place within a solid, transparent framework in order to avoid creating major problems for the Community staff, who are already being called upon to take on more work, or damaging the image and credibility of the European Parliament. Therefore, the priorities and major decisions must have the necessary support of a Europe which works, which is transparent and, most importantly, which can account for how Community funds are spent and used. The Eurostat affair does nothing to further that cause. It pained me to hear Mr Procacci, who had not read the OLAF reports or the audit, describing this as a minor incident; if we were to read the reports he would realise that they are extremely disturbing. It is therefore the responsibility of the Commission to step up the controls that have proved to be as watertight as sieves thus far, improving the system in such a way as to distinguish between monitoring and controls, on the one hand, and operational management – officials granting authorisations – on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Consultative Committee for market operations, which operated under the previous Financial Regulation, has been abolished, and yet it has become clear that many transactions were not made subject to any requirement of economic benefit, transparency or contractual legitimacy, creating a kind of free zone, in which, even after 1999, or maybe especially after 1999, orders could be assigned with only one firm taking part, often where there was a conflict of interests and with unsigned contracts, leading to damage to Community finances, the extent of which it is difficult to assess. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall endeavour to be brief.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, concerning what you have grandiloquently termed the Eurostat Action Plan, I suggest this is merely chapter three of a work in which chapters one and two are lacking. The missing chapter one should have been entitled ‘facts’ and the missing chapter two ‘responsibilities’. This chapter on measures to be adopted would be chapter three.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already stated at the Committee on Budgetary Control, I believe these measures are absurd, curious and outdated. They are absurd because the person or body to be controlled is actually charged with informing the controller of possible infringements. They are curious because coordination committees are not what is needed to follow up allegations and seek the truth. Instead, compliance and immediate investigation of the truth are called for. Alternatively, the information should be placed before the judicial authorities. The measures are outdated because auditors have repeatedly stated the need to break away from the guidelines of Directors-General who have control over them.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, this plan does not concern Eurostat alone. It applies generally to the functioning of the Commission. Mr President, I believe the sequence is wrong. It should be reversed. After all, information does not generate responsibility. Rather, responsibility demands information to be able to cope with commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to OLAF, President Prodi, I suggest the introduction of some kind of ruling on admissibility. This would allow rejection of long, costly and useless proceedings detrimental to specific institutions or bodies. A number of recent cases of this kind spring to mind. None of them resulted in significant achievements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must take into account the fact that Parliament will have to suspend its work for much of the year and that the Commission will change twice: once in May – although that will only be an expansion rather than a change – and then, again, in autumn at the natural end of its term of office. That is why the programme we have put forward is very limited, containing proposals that can feasibly be implemented in 2004; no more than what is feasible, taking into account, not least, the experience we gained in implementing the work programme for 2003, with the good and bad points of that process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have 126 priorities, some old and some new, on which we can guarantee delivery and action. These are crucial, major priorities, but, clearly, we cannot guarantee anything in addition to them. We are also working, as has been explained, on the Financial Perspective. We are a great deal in advance with our work, not least because we were quite aware that the interruptions in the coming year will cause substantial delays.</p>
<p class="contents">The question you are asking is whether the Commission is going to present specific legislative proposals. Yes we are: to start with, we present them as the lines of a political project, and then, of course, we supply the facts and figures later on, when the political project has been approved. I would, moreover, stress that this Commission has made enlargement its main objective and will present its project for an enlarged Union. All the specific legislative proposals will be made by the enlarged College, after 1 May 2004, that is, and then we will have to discuss the timetable for work after that.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of major issues have emerged from the debate, including – and this was raised by many speakers – the issue of the Stability Pact. I would like to make it quite clear that the Commission will enforce the Stability Pact in the proper manner and according to the proper conditions. We are the guardians of a rule which has been handed to us by the governments. I still remember the eyebrows of the German Minister for Finance, when I was Prime Minister of Italy, as they frowned at me, forcing me to accept the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter. Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have now made it more flexible and, I believe, more workable, and the Commission will enforce it properly in this framework, taking into account the genuine problems but also bearing in mind that the Pact is the basis of our protection of the euro. We must establish it as such.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address another minor postscript to you as Members of Parliament. We are talking about the Stability Pact, but while we are arguing numbers, fractions and decimal points, there are developments taking place in the political arena which I feel give cause for concern. I will give just one example: the attempt by Ecofin to bring about what would essentially be the end of the Stability Pact through intergovernmental and extra-institutional agreements. This is much more serious than any other issue. If this attempt succeeds, it will be the end of that little – which is too little, as I have reiterated many times here before you – economic governance which the Union has. It is not a question of any particular country: the entire Ecofin system is, at present, heading in that direction. I would like to hear not just the Commission but Parliament, too, speak out loud and clear on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I do not mean to be malicious when I say that this plot is not completely free of attempts, which we have witnessed in recent days, to divest Parliament of its annual and multiannual budgetary powers, which are already too few. At the moment, I believe it is in our common interest not to be excluded from one of the greatest political processes, from one of the most important decisions affecting the work of our Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked another question on cohesion policy. Our ideas will be outlined in a political document which will be presented before the specific proposals for the Financial Perspective. I would emphasise two of the areas we are working on: firstly, cohesion will continue to operate in order to prevent the regions which are lagging behind from being marginalised, and, secondly, cohesion will be more explicitly linked to the sustainable growth programme we are developing on the basis of the experience we have gained from managing the Lisbon and Gothenburg processes. The same applies – and I am responding to Mrs Frassoni here – to the issue of sustainability with regard to Kyoto and to that process.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards OLAF, there is a key concept: we are on no account trying to turn the Eurostat crisis into an OLAF crisis. All the observers with any sense have seen that the information channel between OLAF and the Commission failed to work and is still not working, and it would be irresponsible of us not to do something about this problem. Nobody is thinking of removing OLAF’s responsibility for internal investigations: quite the opposite, all investigations must continue to be carried out by an OLAF which is even more efficient. We do not plan for any more bureaucratic bodies to be created, a point raised by Mr Barón Crespo and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. In my opinion, we have made quite a simple plan, but, listening to these concerns, I feel it would be right and proper to discuss the matter further, to talk again, for it is not our intention to make the institutions even more complex by adding more structures. We merely want to be in a position to gather together all the relevant pieces of information – not all of which were available in this case – from the different parts of the Commission, in order to be able to take a clear, rapid decision on any measures to be adopted so that OLAF can proceed with full knowledge of the facts and we can take a fully-informed decision. The decision – of whether or not to open an investigation – will remain entirely at the discretion of OLAF. It will be for OLAF to decide, like any investigative body, whether the case is sufficiently important for an OLAF inquiry to be opened or whether it is of purely administrative significance, or whether, quite simply, no action is necessary. This will be decided by OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Blak, I would like to say that, if we continue to stir up dust, we will not be benefiting anyone, least of all the European citizens. We have produced independent, accurate, factual reports which have shed light on all the points and have not revealed evidence of any irregularities after 1999. We are looking into other specific proposals which we will discuss with Parliament. I will not accept<span class="bold"> </span>kangaroo courts or summary sentences: everything is in order where the past is concerned and we are working on more effective measures for the future too.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude my speech with two points: as regards services of general interest, which are at the centre of our attention, the programme mentions a sequel to the White Paper because, as things stand, the idea of presenting a proposal for a directive has not been excluded but has not yet been decided upon. We are working on it and the decision will be taken in the light of the debate which is currently starting. Clearly, if the <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> legal basis is included in the final text of the Constitution, that will be an extremely important factor, for it will make it possible for us to work on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a personal response to Mr Poettering: I would remind him, first of all, of the total legitimacy of the document containing my opinions, my experiences and my dreams, too, regarding the future of Europe. I have to say that it is also a legitimate part of my duty to express my political opinion,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">a duty which my predecessors discharged liberally and, in many cases, to a greater degree than I have, taking an intensely active role in party politics, as I consider to be right and proper and increasingly important for the Commission’s development. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats itself, quite rightly, has already mentioned the fact that the results of the political elections will be taken into account when the new Commission President is appointed. This has been decreed – as, I feel, is right – because the Commission is increasingly becoming a political organ which takes the general interest into account in its work but which cannot fail to have a public opinion, otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, you would have had no reason to give me your vote of confidence. You gave me your vote of confidence on the basis of a political line!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word about the content too. I am very happy, Mr Poettering, to hear you criticise the Italian newspaper which called you before reading the document, for if it had read it, it would have found there the spirit of our founding fathers and your own words, the words you speak when you are not weighed down by the burden of the Eurosceptics who surround your group, words with which we agree and have agreed many times in the past.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to you that I am President of all Europeans, and I have to express my political opinions before all the citizens. Therefore, I wonder why the words of such an intensely European programme which are so dear to you, Mr Poettering, and to us all, can cause such concern. Because people are frightened by values and projects in which you have consistently firmly believed?</p>

It is not the manifesto that is at issue, and it is tendentious to reiterate that I, when I gave the interview to ‘Corriere della Sera’ last Monday evening, had not yet read the manifesto. I based my criticisms on an agency report, according to which you had given a recommendation to a party political list in Italy, and that is not compatible with your role as President of the European Commission!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Vigorous applause, heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it perfectly clear – and Mr Barón Crespo’s statement shows that I cannot be wrong in this – that the office of President of the European Commission is not compatible with being on a list of candidates in the European elections, and that this ought to result in your resignation. This comment, though, hung in the air. There was the question in your own college of whether you would carry on with your mandate until 1 November 2004. Thank God you clarified that, but the mere fact that these rumours could surface is not something for which we can applaud you. Mr President, I say this to you very much as a friend, but also in all earnest and also in restrained language: you need the support not only of one side of this House. If you carry on like this, we will, in future, no longer be able to support you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Vigorous applause, heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We need a Commission – this is not party polemics, but my profound conviction ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... we need a Commission at a difficult time, when we face enlargement, at a difficult time in which we have a constitution, and we need neither a Commission nor a Commission President who constantly meddles in the internal political debates in his own country, a country, let it be added, which still holds the Presidency of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Vigorous applause, heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, it is for you alone to decide whether the confidence of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and you call yourselves democrats, when you do not even listen to what is being said? We always listen when your group chairman speaks, and that is good democratic practice. I will therefore conclude by saying this: President Prodi, it is for you alone to decide whether you want us, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to be alongside you. We want you to succeed because we all share in your success, but you yourself must be prepared to cross this bridge. If you are not prepared to cross this bridge, then you yourself must bear responsibility for the consequences.</p>

Such a debate was launched this morning, but only four of us were present.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to respond to the comment made by leader of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. This is a curious body with two souls. Mr Poettering, I would like to clarify my statement last week. Firstly, Mr Prodi, President of the current Commission, was invested and endorsed by the majority of the groups in this House. I have today reiterated that as my group and I see it, it is Mr Prodi’s duty to lead the Commission until the very last day of his mandate. It has fallen to him to steer the Commission through a period of great political importance. Secondly, in his capacity as a European citizen Mr Prodi has a right to express political opinions on the future of Europe. He cannot be denied that right.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Preventive censure must not be introduced. It would be like forbidding Cardinals of the Catholic Church to speak of God. It simply does not make sense.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to state my personal opinion, if Mr Romano Prodi, who is both an Italian and a European citizen, decides to stand in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament, he should then resign. I think that is pretty basic. That is what I actually stated.</p>

<p class="contents">Secondly, I say this because it is absurd that you should set yourself up as a preacher of morality in this matter out of a desire to protect Mr Berlusconi, who, politically speaking, is currently cutting a poor figure as President of the EU.</p>

<p class="contents">I find it intolerable that you should stand up in this House and say, ‘I have built bridges and you have not gone over them’. Mr Prodi is entitled to cross the bridges of his choice rather than the ones you build. You have to understand that once and for all, my good sir!</p>
<p class="contents">It is absurd for you to stand up in this House and say, ‘What you say is in fact perfectly correct, and I regret that Mr Berlusconi did not say that. That is why you, Mr Prodi, may not say that, as I would rather Mr Berlusconi did it’. That is your problem. Sort it out in your own group and leave the rest of us in peace, and let Mr Prodi be politically active in whatever way he wants, without constant moralistic attacks by you.</p>

I am saying this because someone spoke about President Berlusconi, who, until there is proof to the contrary, is head of a government and as such has the right to take political decisions in his country. President Prodi has been appointed by the Council and voted in by Parliament. We respect him as President of the Commission and we have asked him to be President of the Commission. I agree with what Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo said, since the essence of their speeches was the same: that President Prodi has the right to go back to active politics as and when he wishes, but not as President of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of enlargement, the fight against terrorism and the difficulties that we are facing every day in the attempt to make our institutions more transparent for the citizens, none of us can exploit Europe for the purposes of internal politics. I hope that what was said today was partly due to exceptional emotional strain and that, in the next few hours, everyone will go back to the job they were appointed to do. If anyone wants to relinquish their current role, let them state this clearly: they can take on another role but they cannot have two institutional roles at the same time.</p>

Clearly, these points of view diverge. I want to make one appeal: whatever the divergent views, at this moment the European Union is going through an important phase of redefinition. The biggest single, immediate challenge in the weeks to come is to find the serenity and wisdom together, across the institutions and with the Member States, to produce for tomorrow's Europe a constitutional treaty that reflects the logic of the work of the European Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us make sure, however diverse our opinions are on the years to come, that over the next several weeks we work together, in the interests of the public, to deliver the first and necessary challenge of a constitutional Europe.</p>
