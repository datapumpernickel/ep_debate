<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roth-Behrendt (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is actually a technical measure. The resolution before you, on which we are to vote, refers to what we term comitology, something which the spectators in the galleries will be surprised to learn, many Members of this House have difficulty understanding, and indeed, they certainly do not have to. It is comitology that entitles the Commission to use the specialist committees to approximate legislation within the scope of the power that the legislation itself confers.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution passed unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy charges the Commission with now desiring to avail itself of a right which it does not possess. What we are talking about is the Commission's intention of deferring the entry into force of the sixth amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, which was actually meant to have happened some time ago. In the sixth amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, Parliament decided on a ban on the marketing of cosmetics that had been tested on animals, sharing as it did the conviction of most of the public that we have enough cosmetics and do not need more – toothpaste, shower gel, and so on – for which animals have had to suffer and die.</p>
<p class="contents">This ban had a definite deadline – 1998. In 1997, the Commission gave itself the power to delay its entry into force. Whilst, admittedly, stating that the entry into force was to be in 2000, it added, at the same time, the option of an extension of two years. I do not want right now to state whether that was lawful. As things stood, the marketing ban was meant to enter into force on 30 June 2002, and it did so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now planning to use a comitological measure to again, very soon – in a week or a few days, quite possibly on 24 September – put back the date of entry into force, by six months. This it justifies by the assertion that we are in the midst of the conciliation procedure on the seventh amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, and that the measure could therefore not enter into force in June. Mrs Wallström, I am sorry that you are the member of the Commission to whom I must say these things. We charge you with acting illegally, with breaking the law. You are in breach of the Treaty and of existing legislation!</p>
<p class="contents">I would much rather say that to Mr Liikanen, but he is, unfortunately, not here today. I am aware that the Commission acts as a collegiate body; I am equally aware that there are individuals sitting on the Commission who have very different views. That, Mrs Wallström, is why I regret that it is you whom I have to address today. I would very much prefer to have been very hard on Mr Liikanen. I admit that, with you sitting there, I find it more difficult. Nonetheless, what you are doing is illegal! It is against the law, and we will therefore be taking you to the Court of Justice if necessary. I am sure that the majority in this House will support that.</p>
<p class="contents">What you are now proposing to do is not merely contrary to the law, but is positively absurd. I could use old-fashioned language and call it daft! You want to pass a measure with retroactive effect. You want to pass something that enters into force retroactively, namely from 30 June. Why, actually, do you want to do this? We are already at the end of September. The conciliation procedure will be completed in two months at the latest – it has to be. Even now, you have not implemented the marketing ban. In theory, you are already acting illegally, but we are saying: OK, that's something of a legal vacuum, we'll put up with it. The Member States are not proceeding with transposition, and we know that they are doing the right thing by waiting for the seventh amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commission now has in mind is the creation of a precedent, and we are not going to let them get one past us. They want, again, to give themselves the right to defer the sixth amendment, and if we now lie down quietly like little lambs, then they will believe that they have the right to carry on doing the same thing. We will not let you have your precedent! We are not good little lambs! I'm not one, and nor are my fellow MEPs! That is why we are telling you now that your actions are illegal. This resolution makes that very clear. We call upon you not to implement this measure. The four articles are very clear in calling on you to desist. We are telling you to keep your hands off this measure. We are telling the Member States not to touch it, not to pass it into law. And we are telling you that if you do it anyway, we will drag you off to the Court of Justice!</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallström, I really do beg you to take this message back to the Commission. I can see the gentleman from the Industry Directorate-General sitting beside you. Tell them that we are serious about this. We believe that you are in breach of the law! As the Commission, you may not break the law. You know that it did not do past Commissions any good, and you too should act as properly and honestly as possible. You are not doing that if you want to pass another Implementing Measure. So, as rapporteur for the Cosmetics Directive, I can only tell you, as firmly as I can: hands off!</p>

I would never want to be attacked by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, because I respect her very much.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank her and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the resolution on the postponement of the entry into force of the ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals. The aim of this postponement is quite simply to regulate a short-term situation, from 1 July 2002 until 31 December 2002, and this corresponds to the period envisaged for conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive currently in force prohibits the marketing of cosmetics products containing ingredients or a combination of ingredients tested on animals after 30 June 2002. The current conciliation procedure between the European Parliament and the Council relating to the seventh amendment aims to settle definitively the question of tests on animals in the cosmetics sector. This conciliation procedure is expected to be finalised in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there are responsibilities incumbent upon the Commission in the areas of the free circulation of goods, protection of public health and respect of international rules. The Commission therefore considers it has an obligation to take the appropriate measures in accordance with the provisions of the current directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States, represented in the Cosmetics Committee, will have to express their views on this proposal. The Commission is convinced that further work, in close cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council, will finally lead to a balanced solution within the context of conciliation. This solution should be of genuine benefit to animal welfare whilst safeguarding consumer health and our international commitments. It is the intention of the Commission to do its utmost to achieve a result which satisfies everyone. I will, of course, give your regards to Commissioner Liikanen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As is explained in the resolution and as the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, has already explained, the Commission was empowered by the Council to postpone the entry into force of this measure, which it did by postponing the date of 1 January 1998 to 30 June 2000 and, subsequently, from 30 June 2000 to 30 June 2002. This postponement – as recital 10 of the Directive points out – should have been the last one.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament cannot therefore accept it since, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already said, the Commission’s proposal for a new directive postponing the entry into force of this measure – which, furthermore, has been in force since 30 June 2002 – is not legal.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, the plenum of the European Parliament approved, on second reading, a modification – the seventh – of this Directive which laid down the prohibition of the marketing of products which have been tested on animals, five years after its entry into force. Currently, as has also been said, the process of modification for this sixth modification is being implemented and we are now on the seventh modification.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear – and the rapporteur knows this because we have talked about it many times and she agrees with it – that an immediate prohibition of the marketing of products tested on animals, which the application – which is already in force, I would remind you – of this sixth modification of the Directive would represent, would at this time involve difficulties in terms of compliance which are practically impossible to overcome. We know this, I believe that is the spirit guiding the conciliation on this Directive: to find a formula for agreement so that the industrial sector – the cosmetics sector – can comply with the new time limit which may be stipulated.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how the conciliation debate is developing: finding a final time limit which allows the industry to adapt to the situation without harming competitiveness. However, while it is important to stress that we must find consensus during conciliation which provides a viable solution, this can in no way mean that the Commission is given the freedom to exercise a right which it does not legally have to order a further postponement of the entry into force of the said provision.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament cannot therefore accept the use of such an undemocratic procedure as comitology to deal with a modification that contradicts the decision of this Parliament and of Community legislation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">And I also regret, Mrs Wallström, that it has been you who has had to endure this torrent of criticism of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner Wallström always brings a light and happy touch to our proceedings and we are grateful for that. The severity of some of the remarks you will hear from the floor today do not reflect on her, but on the fact that she is caught in one institution which is now on a collision course with another.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur said that those listening to us in the gallery today may be curious as to what the word 'comitology' means. Some of us are too. Our visitors should not go away with the feeling that comitology could be effectively translated as a lateral means whereby the Commission can frustrate the will of the Parliament. We are an elected institution. We have certain powers. They have been extended. They are still not all that considerable, but we know where the boundaries are.</p>
<p class="contents">On this issue I must say to the Commissioner – and I hope she will take this back to Mr Liikanen – that we in this House have had a debate which has continued through a number of Parliaments, through pretty much the entire parliamentary lifetime of everyone sitting in this Chamber now, from 1993 onwards. In 1997 the Commission purported to give itself a further power of delay and that was extended, although challenged, because all of us here – and everyone who serves as I do on the Conciliation Committee – agree with the rapporteur in acknowledging the difficulties which arise where there are not yet viable alternatives to some forms of animal testing. That is perfectly taken into account in the deliberations we have had, which estimate that it may take another decade to reach the point and the conclusion that we all want.</p>
<p class="contents">But what happens in the meantime? What happens if this conciliation fails? We are not talking then of something which is only temporary, only due to last for the duration of the present conciliation. We are talking of something quite different. I would like to read to the Commissioner the fifth paragraph of the vice-chairman's letter, written on behalf of our committee, to Commissioner Liikanen. He says that the Commission exercised its powers – which are disputed anyway – in 1997. When the implementation date for the marketing of animal-tested cosmetics was postponed to 30 June 2002 by Directive 2000/41, this postponement was to be – to quote the words of Recital 10 – for the 'last time'. Now here we are again – and it is not the last time, it is the penultimate time. Or is it just one in a whole series of delays and frustrations?</p>
<p class="contents">If you have an elected Parliament you have to listen to what it says, otherwise these people in the gallery are wasting their time and we are wasting our time in coming here. Commissioner, you must go back and say to Mr Liikanen that he should think again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not acceptable for the Commission to act illegally, for them to put off the implementation of this decision, delaying it, and so on. Nor is it acceptable for them to look on and do nothing while the Member States endow their omissions with something like legitimacy. Now at last, what has been resolved upon – namely, a ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals – must be put into effect with all force.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is itself, after all, the guardian of the law, and as the guardian of the law, it must ensure that laws are implemented. Now the Commission, rather than guarding the law, is obstructing it. What you are achieving here will be catastrophic in its effect. It is precisely in terms of the great implementation deficit in our European Union that you are giving such a bad example that in future all the Member States will be able to point to the Commission and say: Look at that, even the Commission itself is incapable of implementing its own laws, preferring to make laws for itself, and set itself above the law. As Mrs Roth-Behrendt so rightly said, it acts illegally, bending the law to suit itself and contributing to the Member States' noticeably diminishing interest in putting the law into real effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, I would like to reiterate, with as much emphasis as I can muster, that it is not acceptable for you to send out this calamitous signal; on the contrary, the Commission must change its ways, become the guardian of the Treaties and do everything in its power to really get the Member States to transpose this law, and not itself go and break current European law. That is not tolerable, and Mr Whitehead was right to say so. How on earth do you intend to get it across to the public that the Commission has failed to make any real effort to put into effect things that should have been done in the past?</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from that, I find it positively absurd that the Commission is also stabbing the Conciliation Committee in the back, depriving it of fallback positions, and making something of a mockery of the work currently being done in Parliament. That the Commission should go so far as to do that really is unique in history.</p>
<p class="contents">You can see how great is our displeasure, and I cannot expect us to do other than adopt this resolution by a large majority; I look forward to the Commission really seeing what an emphatic rebuke this is and realising how far-reaching is its significance.</p>

What has happened to the sixth revision? Are we moving straight on from the fifth to the seventh and ignoring the sixth? That is what everyone is wondering. However, we all want to have safe and anti-allergenic cosmetics, to spare animals any unnecessary suffering, to maintain jobs, competitiveness and the expertise of our businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">This seemingly straightforward desire seems difficult, nigh impossible, to implement. This resolution is a good illustration of Parliament trying to gain the upper hand, and the Council, quite rightly, refuses to support it. To impose a target date for a ban on animal experiments could lead to several measures. The first is to no longer guarantee the safety of products placed on the market. These products would not have been subject to the full tests that provide the same guarantees as those carried out on animals. The second point is to put European products on the markets of third countries at a disadvantage by continuing to carry out tests on animals, these are currently the only fully reliable tests. The third point is to risk a sanction being imposed by the WTO which may perceive this ban as a barrier to the marketing of cosmetics produced outside the European Union, even though it is generally accepted that few directives proposing alternative solutions will come to light until another ten years or so and that animal experiments may be phased out completely in perhaps another 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it would be more realistic to enter into dialogue with the Council, leaving behind this overly passionate – and now ideological – debate, so that we can work together to find the best solution which will be acceptable to industry, consumers and animal campaigners. I believe that a ten-year ban which includes exemptions for three types of tests – namely reproductive toxicity, toxicokinetics and toxicity through repeated use – would be more acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I note that some directives are being revised for the seventh time whereas others, such as Directive 79/409 EEC, have never been revised before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, and this is meant for the Commissioner's ears, it transpires that the Commission does not share Parliament's ideology which has been approved here many times. It therefore breaks the law – if I may put it that way – by flouting the rules that we have laid down several times. In other words, the Commission's ideology is not in line with Parliament's wishes. This strikes me as a dangerous situation, not only because Parliament is thus rendered a plaything, but also because the responsibility of Parliament – which has not always been undivided in this very complex matter, but has always acted responsibly – is being eroded at the very moment that we are discussing the conciliation procedure relating to the seventh amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore once again ask the Commission to take account of what Parliament has always stated, namely that animal testing for the purpose of cosmetics is unacceptable, that safety should always come first and that we are willing to help consider all the possible alternatives, and help weigh these up. This is, in fact, something we have always pointed out for every amendment to this directive. I would now ask the Commission not to frustrate Parliament, to withdraw its plans and implement what we jointly agreed on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You, Commissioner, are a young and beautiful woman, and, whilst you have no need of cosmetics, I need them urgently. I will be seventy next year, and, whilst I am very keen to get some anti-wrinkle cream, I do not want some animal to suffer as a result. Do you really believe any woman would use any cosmetic product if she had to see an animal suffer for it? We want to look good without others having to suffer to make it possible. I really want to make an appeal to the cosmetics industry. Look how the introduction of the catalytic converter led to prophecies of ruination and claims that the end of the motor industry was nigh -– and yet, it experienced a boom.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the cosmetics industry not announce that it will invest money – a great deal of money – in research, in order to have the means to make women beautiful, but not at the cost of the suffering of others? I believe the cosmetics industry would enjoy a massive upturn, and European women like us would be even more beautiful than all the other women on earth.</p>

I promise my colleagues, though, especially Mr Casaca, who is to explain the next report, that I will not exploit that advantage. Mr President, I am glad that it is you who are currently in the chair, as you are also chairing the conciliation procedure on cosmetics and are as helpful a guide as one could wish to have in the conciliation procedure. I therefore take great pleasure in seeing you here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for this debate. Our discussion today has not only been a very lively one, as our discussions frequently are, but has also been able to evoke some enthusiasm from the visitors in the gallery, as shown by their applause, which is admittedly unusual, but also gratifying. I just want to return to one point and not so much correct Mrs Flemming as just add to what she said, so that our male visitors can be aware that it is of relevance to them, too: the Cosmetics Directive that we are discussing today is not just about anti-wrinkle creams – which I, at the age of 49 and working in Parliament, urgently need – but it is also particularly relevant to deodorants, shampoos, aftershave, toothpaste, soap – which all of us here today use on a daily basis. The subject we are dealing with today, namely the issue of whether animals should be made to suffer for the sake of these products, is of concern to all of us irrespective of gender. It is obvious that lipsticks and anti-wrinkle creams are always particularly useful for making points and adding emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for your support. The past years have seen us working very closely together, which has involved the blurring of group boundaries. We had elections in my country on Sunday, and election campaigns tend to polarise in order to emphasise differences. Perhaps I should do that better in this House, but I am unable to. I can only thank my fellow Members from other groups for their help and support, notably Mrs García-Orcoyen, who, along with Mrs Flemming, is doing most of the PPE group's work on this issue; I could not, in fact, ask for greater support from an opposing group. In this area, we are guided by the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">But what I must also say, addressing the other Members here, is that we have always reached compromises. We have sought compromise among ourselves, a point I make for the benefit of, among others, Mr Bernié, who is perhaps not yet fully convinced, but has not yet been in Parliament that long, and is not so long-acquainted with the subject. Of course we are considering the industry's interests. Of course we said, as long ago as 1993, that the industry still had almost ten years. Even now, with the seventh amendment, a legal amendment, under discussion in the conciliation procedure at this moment, we are reiterating that the industry, once this legislation is adopted, will have five years to go before there is an absolute ban on animal experiments and a ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals – and then another five years for certain special tests, the development of alternatives to which we can assume will take even longer. How more accommodating can one be? Of course, there have to be incentives for the industry and a certain amount of pressure still has to be exerted to get money invested in finding alternatives, as otherwise the money will be paid out only to the directors when we believe it could also be invested in science.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now again address the Commission, Mrs Wallström and the ladies and gentlemen from the Industry Directorate-General, who are at the moment engaged in conversation but doubtless have an idea of what I want to say to them. Mrs Wallström said earlier, in a response that certainly cannot have been easy for her, that the Commission is trying to get the best result. If you are really trying to get the best result, then there are two things you have to do. For a start, you should tell Mr Liikanen that he should get round to at last coming up with a proposal that might help bring about a compromise in the conciliation procedure, and that he should not block Parliament's decisions. You will be aware that, a few months ago, Parliament, by a massive majority of nearly 500 votes, decided in favour of these marketing bans, or to put it another way, sales prohibitions for cosmetics. To date, the Commission and Mr Liikanen's Directorate-General have been blocking them, and so I ask you, Mrs Wallström, to inform Mr Liikanen, and also the new Director-General, Mr Mingasson, that France is not the only country to have a cosmetics industry, but that there are other interests to consider and that Europe has a Parliament, and he would be well-advised to accede to that Parliament's wishes. That is what I would like, but I have not seen it happen yet. If the Commission wants to take seriously its role as mediator in the conciliation procedure, then let it make a proposal that meets Parliament halfway.</p>
<p class="contents">I furthermore call on you to inform the Member States – I'm sorry, but can I point out to the gentleman from Directorate-General III that it really would be helpful if you were to let Mrs Wallström listen for a bit? Yes, I am happy to wait a moment. I am capable of quite a few things, but not even I can listen to two people at once!</p>
<p class="contents">So I call on you to inform the Member States that the marketing ban – and please note that it is an absolute one – has been in force since 30 June 2002, and that the Member States would be well advised to be rather more amenable, rather more flexible and a bit less obstinate in the conciliation procedure. If the Commission wants to be helpful, Mrs Wallström, then you can tell the Member States that they have two options: one is to be helpful to the conciliation procedure, and then your cosmetics industry will get another five years added on to the five it has already got. Alternatively, you can be unhelpful and keep on blocking as you are doing at the moment, and then you will have a marketing ban dating back to 30 June. The Commission's task is to convey that information to you. My request to you is really very firm, and is meant in earnest, although without it being intended to have any threatening undertone, but it would poison cooperation with Parliament and do it serious damage, if you were to have recourse to this comitological measure. It is unnecessary, and we would interpret it as an affront and as a breach of the law. Three months after it took effect, you would again resort to a comitological measure for another two months; any person with a normal mind would find that ridiculous. Even the Commission knows that it is ridiculous, and is trying to dupe Parliament, to create a precedent, and that is how we too see things. That is what you have heard today. I would be obliged to you if, having heard all the Members of this House, you would tell that to Mr Liikanen as well. We consider it an affront to Parliament, and a breach of the law which we would punish by taking it to the Court of Justice, and I ask you to help the conciliation procedure, support Parliament, and help me and the Members of this House, whom I again thank for their support, in the conciliation procedure rather than using comitological measures to make our cooperation more difficult. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I used to be a minister for consumer affairs so I could very well do so, but will not because my task is to represent the Commission. This is purely a technical issue of ensuring legal clarity during the six months that the conciliation procedure is ongoing. The Commission does not want to impinge on future decisions or the result of the conciliation procedure, but would underline that it has a responsibility to ensure the observance of rules on the free circulation of goods, the protection of public health and the respect of international rules. We have been urged by the Legal Service to make sure that we provide legal certainty to economic operators, who must ensure that the products they put on the market are safe. That is the aim of this postponement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is important because the Commission proposal also has to be retroactive in order to achieve the objectives of ensuring that products are marketed only when they fulfil the conditions laid down by Directive 76/68 and because we must also be able to require manufacturers to guarantee that the products they put on the market are not harmful to human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is such that there are no comprehensive alternative testing methods at the moment and that is why we must ensure that there is legal certainty for these six months. That is the background to the Commission proposal. I have taken note of everything you have said and fortunately, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we have developed the capacity for listening to two people at the same time. You have to do that and the advantage of listening to German is that all the verbs come at the end so that also helps! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
