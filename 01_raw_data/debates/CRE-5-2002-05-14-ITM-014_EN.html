<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schnellhardt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur and draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy</span>.<span class="italic"> – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Commission and my fellow Members here in Parliament very sincerely for their highly constructive and expert cooperation. The reports before us reflect that cooperation, and they represent part of the framework needed for safe food production, especially in health terms.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are sitting here today at this hour discussing measures for greater food safety, people throughout the European Union are sitting in restaurants or at home and enjoying their food, and are unlikely to be asking if their food is safe. In fact our food is safe, safer than in many other places in the world. The Commissioner has seized the opportunity given to us by the crises we have experienced recently – and we have indeed been through a great deal over the last few years – to develop a new strategy. Quite rightly so, but these crises alone should not be the reason for us to adopt new food legislation, because they are history now and virtually no one is writing about them any more. What is far more important is that changes in food production and also changes in consumer behaviour are forcing us to consider how we can make food production safer, as the public has different requirements and increasing demands are being made for greater safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the many rules already in place, it has to be said that there are many shortcomings in the way the Community has shaped food law up to now. The individual rules are each limited to a specific sector, but there is no overall plan. Community food law is especially notable for its significant deficiencies as regards coherence and legal certainty. These deficiencies are not just a matter of drafting, they are really substantial and they put at risk the efficiency and implementation of food law.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all the more reason for welcoming the radical new concept proposed by the Commission in its White Paper, which on closer inspection turns out to be not so much a new safety concept as a new legislative concept. For the first time, general food law is being proposed at Community level, with uniform definitions and principles and without any ifs and buts. This food law is based on a comprehensive and uniform concept ranging from the producer to the consumer and it creates a coherent and transparent set of food law provisions. The consolidation process has also been used to make fundamental improvements in the quality of a great deal of the legislation up to now. I regard this consolidation of the hitherto incoherent body of rules and regulations to create consistent food law as being essential.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of food hygiene, we need legal bases that can easily be applied by food business operators, that permit an exchange of information between individual production levels, that correspond to the conditions of the internal market, and which are accordingly valid in all Member States, which increase the responsibility of food business operators, and which facilitate the official control activities of the authorities and guarantee the implementation of administrative measures. The regulation reforming the law is essential to achieve all this. Parliament will not agree to any change here. Encompassing the existing 17 directives in just four regulations will result in a sharper definition of the borders between food hygiene, animal health law, official food controls and thus user-friendly legal bases.</p>
<p class="contents">This also reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of the economic sectors affected. Most producers nowadays operate on an international basis. A regulation provides a uniform framework for action with the same provisions governing all the EU Member States and accordingly, more than a directive can do, establishes fair conditions throughout the European internal market. The new food law can only take account of special national and regional situations in exceptional cases, which is something I would particularly like to emphasise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs was significantly modified by the committee, with almost 200 amendments, and I believe that this regulation now provides a better legal basis. Many of the amendments are based on the text of the Regulation laying down general principles on food hygiene which has already been adopted, and were accordingly chiefly amendments needed for drafting reasons. There is a common thread running through all the proposals for regulations, and that is the emphasis on the primary responsibility of food producers for the safety of the foodstuffs they place on the market. The BSE crisis in particular did a great deal to demonstrate that we have failed to impose the same responsibility on those involved in primary agricultural production that we have long since expected of food producers elsewhere in the production chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the HACCP principle is also relevant here. I am of course aware that the HACCP principle can only be applied to primary production in a few areas. However, in farms with significant numbers of animals it is possible to identify the critical points that need constant monitoring. If we apply the 'from farm to table' principle, we would also ensure that the scope for self-regulation is also fully used in primary production. The Commission's proposals suggest that HACCP should not be applied to primary production, whereas the regulations before us contain general provisions on hygiene for primary production.</p>
<p class="contents">This implies a totally new chapter in the legislation on food hygiene. For example, if a farmer has to keep a record of measures for containing risks, that amounts in certain areas to the first step towards the application of the HACCP principle. Despite the high level of safety standards and seamless controls, production errors cannot be totally avoided. If the causes are to be established, the traceability of products must be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee considers that additional labelling such as that proposed in the Commission proposal is not necessary. Although systems of labelling for traceability may vary from one EU Member State to another, they all guarantee a seamless picture of the production chain. I gathered from Commissioner Byrne's statement on Monday that product labelling is to be simplified, which suggests that the committee's proposal is actually to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to support production processes, the regulation provides for guidelines for good practice. As a rule these will be sectoral and national guidelines which are to be drawn up by many interested parties. The application of these guidelines is of course voluntary, and this House supports that. However, if European guidelines are drawn up for a specific sector or a specific area of production, then those guidelines would have to emerge from a general consensus and would have to reflect best available practice in Europe. That is why sectoral, national or regional guidelines should be replaced by European guidelines, because in that way we can compel food producers to apply precisely this best practice and to introduce these methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Food production in Europe is very diverse, and it is therefore necessary for the regulations to permit a certain degree of flexibility. That is why it would be possible for there to be exceptions from the provisions of these regulations. Parliament wishes to limit these exceptions to regions with geographically difficult situations and to regions with supply difficulties, and also to traditional production methods and to supplies for local markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure for approving exceptions should be a simple one. However, Parliament cannot agree to uncontrollably broad powers for the Commission to amend the appendices of this regulation on food hygiene which define the basic framework of hygiene conditions by following the comitology route. In theory it would possible be to amend the appendices again only one day after the regulations were adopted. An arrangement of this kind would certainly not be in the spirit of good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the procedure needs to be different for the regulation on specific hygiene rules. These annexes cover detailed issues regarding hygienic trade in food, and in this case rapid implementation has to be achieved by means of amendment through the committee procedure. We have therefore taken various areas – definitions, approval of plants, labelling and so on – out of the annexes and incorporated them into the articles of the regulation, so that if any amendments are needed this can only be done by means of legislation. But I am content for other rules to be dealt with through the committee procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main points with regard to the regulation on specific hygiene rules is the chapter on hunting. The debate on this in Parliament was very lively. We have now presented a proposal that the Commission also finds acceptable. We must of course accept that there are national peculiarities regarding the development of hunting traditions, and these have now been included in the proposals, so that we can work on the assumption that we can still guarantee game meat to be safe in health terms. This means in particular that existing traditions should be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that with these proposals, and with the proposed regulation on animal-health rules governing the production, placing on the market and importation of products of animal origin, we have created an important basis for improving rules governing foodstuffs. I specially want to thank Mr Kindermann for having produced such an excellent report. The provisions regarding the importation of foodstuffs are so well presented in his report that I do not need to explain any further. I consider that the regulations before us provide a good basis for extending the Regulation on official controls of foodstuffs. I am very anxious to see that because we want to deal with it as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kindermann (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>.<span class="italic"> – (DE)</span> Mr President, the package of proposals for regulations we have before us aims to reformulate and simplify the entire body of EU food law. The draft regulation for which I am rapporteur lays down specific animal-health rules governing the production, placing on the market and importation from third countries of products of animal origin, with the objective of preventing the spread of animal diseases in connection with the marketing of these products. At present, this area is governed by seven different directives. The proposal for a regulation under consideration is intended to make the animal-health rules more transparent and encompass the existing directives within a single text. I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has deliberately chosen a regulation as the legal instrument so as to ensure that the rules will in future be enforced in the same way in the EU as a whole and in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I support the proposal, even if I have one fundamental criticism of it. In many places the Commission has used the procedure referred to in Article 11, that is to say the committee procedure. This is neither unusual nor anything special. Particularly in the field of animal disease prevention it is right and important for the Commission to be able to react more quickly and effectively to new scientific developments and unforeseen situations, without having to embark on a cumbersome legislative procedure every time. However, in this case I believe that rather too much use is made of the committee procedure. In some places I have therefore introduced either additions or refinements to the text of the regulation establishing certain criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is that exceptions should only be granted if the animal disease situation does not prevent it and if it would in no way adversely affect the level of protection against animal diseases. Secondly, unannounced checks should be carried out at irregular intervals. Thirdly, when lists of third countries are being drawn up, all additional factors such as the adequacy of staffing levels in the control authorities and the reliability of the information provided by authorities in third countries must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I have included two new proposals in my report. Member States and the authorities of third countries shall, where so requested, submit a report to the Commission on the controls carried out, specifying in particular the frequency of controls, the nature of the failings and infringements found to exist, and the nature of the steps taken by the competent authorities to punish them. We all know that the effectiveness of the legal framework depends to a large extent on controls carried out, and detailed control reports of this kind are essential if the effective application of controls in Member States is to be guaranteed. They also allow the Commission to react immediately to any weak points identified. The Commission should also draw up a list of categories of possible infringements of this regulation, its implementing rules or safeguard measures and should determine in each instance whether the infringements are punishable by the competent national authorities under criminal or administrative law. If the provisions of the regulation are infringed, uniform sanctions should as far as possible be established for all Member States. It is not acceptable for the same act to have different consequences in Member State No 1 as compared with Member State No 2. This problem, which is certainly even more urgent in other areas than in the case before us today, needs to be fundamentally addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">It was my intention to make a start here with my proposal, even if the Commission has indicated to the committee that this kind of approach may not be practicable at the moment for legal reasons. Nevertheless, I am convinced of the need for this and my fellow members of the committee supported me in this. I would lastly like to thank the Commission for its constructive cooperation and I hope that will continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The opinion from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Schnellhardt report, for which I was the draftsperson, focuses in particular on the need for consistency between food safety practices, which are deemed essential for the domestic sale or supply of foodstuffs, and those practices which cover the sale of such foodstuffs internationally. The committee has therefore sought to make it explicit that the scope of any regulation needs to apply equally to exports, as well as to domestic sale and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wanted to broaden the membership of the proposed standing committee for foodstuffs to include experts representing public authorities and consumer groups. It is quite wrong that the Commission Decision of 18 May 2000, which defines the composition of standing committees, specifically exempts consumer groups from representation on these committees. It is clearly of great importance that such committees gain the trust of consumers and are genuinely stakeholder committees. It therefore seems quite essential that consumer groups be represented on them.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy wanted to build in greater flexibility, particularly with regard to slaughterhouses. We therefore proposed that measures should be introduced to allow flexibility in application of the so-called HACCP system to regional slaughterhouses which are in peripheral or remote regions. Strict rules in the past have caused unnecessary difficulties to slaughterhouses in the more remote areas of the EU, often because geographical restraints can lead to unfair competitive conditions which tend to favour larger enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, as we begin to learn the lessons of, say, the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK, it is quite clear that one of the reasons that disease spread so far and so fast was precisely because of the closure of local slaughterhouses. We must not induce, however unintentionally, any more closures in that vital area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on a personal note, an existing concern I have with this whole regulation is that it is insufficiently flexible for the small enterprise in particular. We must be mindful of the extra burden which can be placed on small enterprises and ensure that we are not adopting any sort of regulation which risks undermining their livelihoods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, here we have a proposal under Article 37 which is fully justified as a common agricultural policy issue, and, therefore, the procedures are appropriate. Of course, it is important that we should check that there is an adequate legal base. We are now discussing in the Convention and elsewhere, the question of holding the Community organs to their proper competences and I am delighted that this regulation passes muster in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also, as Mr Kindermann has said, a good thing to take this complex body of law and consolidate it into a single regulation that will give us a community of approach throughout the Community. I am not sure if I would have felt that I was justified in taking up the time of the House, had that been all that there was to the matter, but I want to add to the point we are discussing today. The importation of animal products for human consumption is intimately connected, as Mrs Lucas has just said, with the disastrous outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that we suffered in the United Kingdom. In my own constituency, Dumfries and Galloway, we were as you know particularly afflicted in that case.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to move more and more strongly towards local production for local consumption, just as Mrs Lucas said a moment ago, we would avoid some of these dangers. It is vitally important that, in introducing these very necessary laws, we are careful to ensure that we do not create circumstances which themselves increase the pressure for excessive animal movement. I hope that will be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have strayed beyond the limits of the Legal Affairs Committee, at least I have not strayed beyond my time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation is based on Article 37, relating to the common agricultural policy and aims to put in place more rational legislation to avoid the contamination of farm animals by products of animal origin containing pathogenic agents. We all remember the food-and-mouth epidemic which recently struck Europe and the ensuing crisis within the agricultural industry, primarily in the United Kingdom. Initial enquiries confirm that the contamination was caused by food of animal origin from third countries, which was used for pig feed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as animal-health conditions governing the production and sale of Community products are concerned, we must carry out careful and regular monitoring of the health state of producing regions. Official controls and Community inspections must be carried out without prior warning. So that we have the resources required, we must consider – as Mr Kindermann said – how many vets are needed in the Member States, as well as at the European Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin. In addition, our legal mechanism must take into account the candidate countries and we must make penalties uniform.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards imports from third countries, we must have the same provisions as for Member States. However, overly strict hygiene measures must not be perceived as barriers to trade. If that is the case, we should make adjustments but continue to bear in mind the original aim of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We support Mr Kindermann’s report, which provides the necessary clarifications to the Commission proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Additionally, the proposals that have been put forward are reasonably good and very detailed, and I believe that all sectors involved have recognised this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the two rapporteurs, because the food chain is long and consequently the subject area is very large and complex and they had to study and come to an agreement on many amendments which – I am sure – will improve the project.</p>
<p class="contents">These legislative requirements are based on the control of food safety from farm to table in order to provide the best possible guarantees to consumers. I support everything that the two rapporteurs have said. One of the key points of future legislation is the mandatory application of HACCP in all food companies including those in the primary sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis of risk and the control of critical points were formulated to be applied in the food industry and have, without doubt, represented a great step forward in the area of food hygiene. However, in reality, many small companies have still not been able to put this into practice. Precisely because it is not yet being applied throughout the processing sector, and because this system has been designed solely for industry, it should not be extended to the primary sector just yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary sector is already obliged to respect the ‘good practice guides’, a set of rules with similar aims to the HACCP but better adapted to the characteristics of this particular economic sector. If there have been problems, these have not been due to the lack of standards, but to the lack of compliance with these standards. I am not saying that in future the primary sector should be required to meet HACCP standards, rather that these should be adapted to the real requirements of agriculture and livestock farming. The application of these standards should be considered to be an essential food safety practice, but it should never replace controls. I believe we should concentrate on these and that they should be standardised for all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic agents must take responsibility for the safety of food products, guarantee their viability and that of their ingredients and establish product withdrawal procedures in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out that exports, and, more importantly, imports must meet hygiene standards, because, otherwise, problems could creep up on us from abroad, whilst our companies will become less competitive compared with those that do not fulfil the same requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, food once again occupies a prominent place on our agenda. We have made a great deal of progress over the past two years. Food must be safe, and confidence in this respect is essential. The internal market must be founded on common rules. Consumers must be able to rely on the fact that food produced in other Member States is safe and meets the hygiene requirements. Hence my warm support for the Commission’s proposals. It is useful to create a comprehensive framework for food hygiene and for hygiene in the veterinary industry. It is also useful to combine all the legislation in one package. I would also like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr Schnellhardt. Many hours of work and consultation have gone into this report. Despite this, I should like to make seven comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, too much emphasis has been placed on hygiene procedures. This is why we have somewhat lost sight of the end goals, which is unfortunate. In my view, the results that we aim to achieve with legislation must be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that a certain level of flexibility is permitted in the procedures and working methods. There is more than one way of skinning a cat.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must realise what we are doing. We know that emotions run high where food is concerned. Against globalisation, against large-scale production, in favour of local production and in favour of tradition. These emotions are often there for a good reason. Politics cannot, and must not, ignore these emotions. We must realise that tougher and stricter rules can often only be observed by larger companies. Stricter rules encourage industrial production, but it is precisely this industrial production that consumers distrust. In this sense, over-regulation has the opposite effect. Moreover, we must create room for national cultures. Flexibility is therefore what is needed in order to use the guides for good practice. There is no reason why we should prefer European guides to the national guides. There should be a choice. Above all, we should realise that these guides are ultimately nothing more than an aid. In this connection, we should ask whether HACCP should be applied in agriculture. HACCP was not designed with farming in mind. The strict application of the HACCP principles is said to be detrimental to one-man or family businesses. Here too, HACCP is an aid. It provides a way of preparing food in a responsible manner. It is not a goal in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">A third comment concerns hunting. This is, without a doubt, an issue that has been accorded excessive amounts of political attention. In our opinion, national legislation can be used for hunting on a small scale. However, there are limits. We are not in favour of excluding the whole of Section II for private and local use. If a check shows that there are no disturbing characteristics, we believe that small-scale supplies to local markets can then be subjected to the same rules as private consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I should like to say a few words about third countries. We must guarantee that imported food meets the same high hygiene standards as food produced here. For this, fair and thorough checks are required. Food safety, however, should not be used as a stalking-horse for protectionism. Food safety is a world task. We must support developing countries in order to place safety at the top of the list of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, responsibility should be clearly defined on behalf of citizens and politicians, but certainly on behalf of businesses and their workers too. Training for workers is important, in my view. Annual training can be useful. During the course of the decision-making process, it is possible to make some changes to the nuts and bolts of this amendment. Workers who pillory a lack of hygiene should not fall victim to this. This is what the whistle-blowers' amendment comes down to.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth comment concerns the detailed nature of the legislation. We should keep the objective of food hygiene in mind. People who organise and monitor food production are skilled professionals. European politics does not need to regulate the number of tiles that should be on the local butcher's shop wall. We now have an opinion about the packaging of bivalve molluscs too. We know how bivalve molluscs retain their vitality. But to be honest, this is not the reason why I became a politician.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to a final, political consideration. We must ask ourselves whether this is the way forward. Should we as Parliament continue to be concerned with such detail? We support Schnellhardt's comitology amendments, but I should already like to state that Parliament should not get bogged down in all the technical details. This is a task for the Commission, which can call on Food Authority experts. I suggest that for the second reading, we reconsider our stance on this score.</p>

I am very pleased that primary production has been included and that we now finally cover the whole of the food chain. I am also very pleased that individual producer liability has been specified again in the food legislation. We shall not get anywhere merely with ‘policing’ power if people themselves do not take responsibility for their companies, work and own actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally am incredibly pleased about Mr Schnellhardt’s willingness to compromise, so that we now have Article 4.4 (Amendment No 31) through which Europe’s endlessly rich and varied stock of traditional food can remain on the market without individual Member States thereby being given the opportunity to ignore the regulations and label all their products as traditional.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of this wording, we have also ensured that we are not concerned here only with small-scale production. Some of Europe’s most important food exports in fact consist of traditional cheeses and hams and so on which require special production methods without, however, being hazardous as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that we have got this section through, for it would have been terrible if we had obtained food legislation in Europe which only suited Nestlé and McDonald's.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to point out that I too am very pleased that we have arrived at sensible and sustainable compromises where hunting is concerned. I live in the middle of the forest in Sweden and should scarcely dare come home at all if some elk hunter had got the idea that I had banned elk hunting. That is an extremely emotive issue, and I think we have arrived at a good compromise which both pheasant and elk hunters will be able to live with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The large number of amendments also show, of course, that the final product will look different to what the Commission had initially proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">In one area – namely, that of the way in which game is dealt with – the Commission’s proposal would have created major problems if had been put into effect. The Commission’s proposal was in danger of having an extremely negative effect upon hunting and the sale of game in shops. I believe that, by means of the amendments now adopted by the committees, we have avoided the risks that existed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to see that a variety of national supervision models can be used to achieve the common objective of good food hygiene. I am therefore especially grateful that account has been taken of the fact that game can be monitored in different ways, that we have different climatic conditions and therefore need different refrigeration periods and that we can also organise training in different ways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fully support the idea that this principle should apply to the food industry, which supplies food to millions of consumers. But the directive attacks every aspect of primary production – in other words, products of the soil, of stockfarming, of hunting and of fisheries – upon which it is seeking to impose a restrictive traceability system. How can we hold individuals personally liable for a mushroom picked in a forest or for a fish caught from a river? This seems utterly unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The first article, or the ‘Scope’, of the regulation specifies that these provisions shall not apply to the primary production of food for private domestic use or the domestic preparation of foodstuffs for private consumption. We must extend this measure to include the supply of local markets and to the sale of natural products from primary production.</p>
<p class="contents">Local produce, such as berries and mushrooms, can contribute to a region’s trademark image, strengthen its identity, its gastronomic reputation and encourage green tourism, which is essential to the rural economy. Jobs and traditional methods are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">As for game and game meat, delivered directly by the hunter to the consumer or retailer, these must be considered as traditional food products, which must benefit from specific marketing methods. We believe that Amendment No 92 relating to <span class="italic">Spiralis</span> goes too far, since freezing or cooking at temperatures of above 65° will destroy any parasites.</p>
<p class="contents">The relevant authorities of each Member State are the best placed to weigh up the situation and to draw up guidelines which will provide the consumer with adequate protection. We must see reason, by attaching priority to flexibility, given the diversity of geographic and climatic situations, rather than encasing ourselves in rigid regulations, which can only result in a dead-end situation and considerable dissatisfaction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is important to reintroduce clear, precise rules in this area, as well as to simplify the texts. Simplifying the texts does not mean, however, that we can relax requirements. Very much the opposite in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, define the responsibilities to be shouldered by manufacturers, such as the respect for rules, product traceability and the prior analysis of risks. Manufacturers are the guarantors of high-quality food, in which consumers can have confidence. Yes, the requirements are considerable, but these requirements can only help to improve the image of their products.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers must also shoulder some responsibility: they must be able to have the freedom of choice, hence the important role of information and consumers’ associations in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these texts which are before us, I would sincerely hope that the European Union decides to launch an information campaign to spread awareness regarding the essential hygiene measures that must be observed in the home. These are the little things that we can do on an ongoing basis to help reduce the risks, such as the importance, for example, of cleaning the refrigerator, of storing products properly and at the appropriate temperature.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities are also responsible for putting in place rigorous controls during manufacturing, production and sale, and for imposing effective sanctions, in the event of these controls being flouted, not only on the parties concerned, but also on the Member States which do not respect Community legislation. In other words, we must be seen to be very firm.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have had numerous discussions concerning game meat. We must, of course, ensure the quality of this product and we know that procedures vary from one Member State to another.

<p class="contents">Amendment No 31 deals with products using traditional methods or sited in remote locations. All of us have some examples of this kind. I have seen this in the UK, with people trying to operate our beef assurance scheme. We should defend this amendment because it specifically states that such products should have no demonstrable adverse effect on food hygiene. Similarly the references to HACCP in Amendment No 9 are permissive and not mandatory, and the small business sector can live with that.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the Goodwill/Bernier Amendment No 18, as Mr Goodwill would expect me to, exempting hunters from these regulations. We accept this for the individual hunter consuming or passing on the game he has shot or caught. But there is a difference between the noble Nordic hunter scaling the utmost peak in pursuit of an individual elk, the picture that Mr Sjöstedt would commend to us, and the syndicates of flabby businessmen turning out on English landed estates, as they turn in a large quota of inexpertly shot birds and animals for the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, I believe that, if such products go to a retail outlet or a restaurant, there is a difference. The great wit, Oscar Wilde, described the English hunting fraternity as the 'unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable'. I do not mind that but when the 'unspeakable' begin to peddle the 'eatable', they should be open to the hygiene rules, as set down in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I see no reason whatsoever why we should make an exemption where, what starts off as a little outlet doing no harm, a brace or two of birds here or there, ends up as another supply route. We should protect the hunter's right to hunt but we should not guarantee him an unprotected route into retail outlets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My view is that in certain Member States hunting brings an important extra source of food to the dining table. For example, in my country two million small and 100 000 large wild game animals are hunted every year and there are 300 000 hunters. It is therefore important. Game animals are naturally also for sale on shop shelves or they are given or sold to neighbours and relatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the issue is whether it is reasonable for the EU to start regulating this sort of activity, which is often based on trust and close acquaintanceship. It is as if social control were a guarantee of quality when a local shopkeeper buys meet from a hunter to sell. A sense of moderation should be kept in these matters. I am also wholeheartedly in favour of accepting Amendment No 82 in this report by Mr Schnellhardt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly hope it will work out that way. However, I would also like to make a special plea for scientific research into products of animal origin to be continued on living animals in the case of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease for example, and that this should then be applied in an affordable way. High new technical and organisational standards need to be practical, and by that I also mean affordable. I also particularly have in mind food imports from third countries.

This regulation goes way beyond the directives that it replaces. In particular, it extends Article 3 of Directive 93/43 which introduces what are know as the HACCP principles. The hazard analysis and critical control points were developed in the 1960s for NASA to guarantee high purity food for astronauts. Uncontrolled bodily functions in a space suit can be rather inconvenient! But HACCP is a food safety management system devised for highly sophisticated food-processing operations.</p>
<p class="contents">This space-age system is to be made compulsory throughout the EU. In the UK alone it is going to effect 300 000 businesses, costing an estimated GBP 2 billion a year for SMEs alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that has been developed for a sophisticated technology-based organisation is not appropriate for Joe's Cafe in Lewisham High Street or Jean Dupont's bistro in the rue de la Révolution in Marseilles.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year, in the very shadow of this building, I toured the local food markets with a food safety expert. I found dozens of basic food hygiene failings. There, and everywhere else, the basic provisions of Directive 93/43 have yet to be complied with. So why is the Commission creating even more laws? These technocrats are totally out of touch with reality. They have gone into orbit and landed on another planet like the astronauts for which the HACCP system was devised. For this reason alone the Commission should not be putting forward more law. We do not need more complexity. If Parliament endorses it, it proves that it too is living on another planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Commissioner, precisely because this is a regulation, you know better than I do that prudence must be exercised, for the regulation will be implemented immediately and, by its nature, harmonises, or rather, I would say, as good as standardises all the procedures throughout the vast area of the Union in the food and gastronomy sector, which, we must never forget, is a major part of the culture and civilisation of our continent. I therefore agree that there is a need for harmonisation, but we must remember to exercise caution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on three points, in particular. The first, which has been fully addressed in the report and by the rapporteur, is the question of traditional products, products which have a history not just as products but in terms of their production processes too. Restricting these products to geographical areas or local markets is not enough: they are genuine products which need to be dealt with separately.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the question of the primary sector, which is certainly not fully covered by the regulation but which is regulated to some extent. The situation is different for the primary sector, particularly where small and medium-sized businesses are concerned. I have tabled an amendment which I urge you to support, which seeks, at least, to reduce the bureaucratic, administrative impact as regards keeping documents – it makes no sense for records relating to vegetables to have to be kept for five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – apart from the question of game, which I will mention briefly in passing, with regard to which a balanced solution appears to have been found – there is training. It is right to ensure that our food chain operators are always trained. With regard to this aspect too, we must avoid enlarging the scope of the debate to include quality, which is a separate issue: there must be training on hygiene and hygiene alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before any legislative intervention or questions of a technical nature, we need to identify why not just food products but the entire food chain has been downgraded, distorted and adulterated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is mainly because the food chain is managed solely on the basis of the laws of profit and speculation that the quality of food is so poor. The more intensively we farm, the more the food chain is run and controlled by the huge multinationals in the industry, which decide the method of production and the quality of our food, the less chance we have of any effective consumer health guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is first and foremost a political problem. Only by wiping out capitalist profit as the ultimate purpose of the production process will we be able to stop illegal and dangerous production, processing and marketing methods.

In future, food producers and processors will have to document all steps in the production and processing chain. This obligation also extends to the feedstuffs used and the state of health of animals. This means that in future consumers in the EU will be able to trace food and food ingredients from the shop counter back to the producer. A transparent production chain will thus be guaranteed both for major companies and for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would like to make a particular point about SMEs in the meat processing business. In the European Union, there are around 150 000 small-scale butchery workshops with a total of over 1 million employees and an annual turnover of around EUR 60 billion. It is these small workshops that ensure local supplies and maintain a variety of products in rural areas. They use their special skills to produce local specialities and make an important contribution to Europe's delicatessens. The close contact between them and the consumer creates confidence in the quality and safety of their products. That is why we need to pay special attention to the needs of small businesses and to come up with suitable and practical legal arrangements for these companies, which offer people in Europe so many jobs and training opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled an amendment jointly with the rapporteur which relates specially to single-place slaughter in butcher's workshops because in addition to rules governing slaughter lines in large slaughterhouses we also need to take account of the conditions that prevail in small-scale slaughter operations. If sufficient care and expertise is applied, single-place slaughter can be carried out in perfectly hygienic conditions. That is why I urge you to support Amendment No 133. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we do not hunt elk every year, the elk population grows rapidly, the number of people killed in road accidents rises and there is a considerable increase in damage to the forests.</p>
<p class="contents">When, in September, we begin hunting in the morning, it is often freezing, and the climate at that time of the year corresponds to the temperature in a refrigerator. Sometimes, it even corresponds to the temperature in a freezer. In my part of the country, there is, from the environmental point of view, no better refrigerator for the hunter than nature’s own cold-storage room.</p>
<p class="contents">The bigger the EU becomes, the more difficult it becomes to regulate in detail using EU provisions. The EU directives must hold good in all parts of the EU. They must provide scope for adjusting the provisions according to different circumstances. Member States with up-and-running procedures governing the inspection of game before it is released onto the market must be able to retain their rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, politicians who want to influence opinion against European cooperation have exploited this proposal for a directive to cast suspicion on the EU as a threat to traditional hunting. It is important to emphasise that they are mistaken, for the EU has no legal powers to regulate hunting for household requirements and the use of game for private consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">This also emphasises the need for general provisions governing hunting to be decided upon in accordance with the subsidiarity principle. Through Mr Schnellhardt’s efforts, the section on game in this directive has become really commendable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This new legislation is based on the fundamental need to guarantee food safety from farm to table, along the lines of the initiatives that have been adopted over the past months in order to provide the consumer with the best possible guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has made a great effort in trying to achieve consensus between all the groups. I think he has written an excellent report. I should also like to congratulate the Commission on having also presented a reasonably well-balanced proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key points of the future regulation, however, is the mandatory application of the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) for all food establishments. The application of the HACCP standard should, however, be considered as an additional safety measure, which cannot replace official controls. The HACCP system cannot be extended, for the moment, to the primary sector, given that this system has been designed exclusively for industry. The primary sector is already obliged to respect the ‘good practice guides’, a set of rules with similar aims to the HACCP but better adapted to the characteristics of this particular economic sector, and which we should not aim to duplicate.</p>
<p class="contents">The various food crises that have taken place make it necessary to strengthen hygiene regulations in order to regain consumer confidence, an objective that the European Commission has duly included in its proposal and which will no doubt be improved by the European Parliament with the approval of its amendments on the basis of traditional products, game, and so on, listed by the Members of this House who have spoken before me.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic agents must continue to shoulder responsibility for food safety, ensure traceability of food and food ingredients and must put in place product withdrawal procedures in case of food emergencies. Codes of good practice should be established by the various food sectors in order to give guidance to food business operators on food safety. Also, imports from and imports to third countries must comply with Community hygiene standards.</p>

<p class="contents">To get to where we are today has required a massive input from Members of this House. First, may I offer my sincere thanks to all those Members who have worked so tirelessly to drive this dossier forward – in particular Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Kindermann and the Members of the environment and other committees, who have made such valuable contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly two years have passed since these proposals were adopted. Slow progress, some might say. But this would ignore not only the importance of this dossier, but also the simultaneous work this House has undertaken on other related initiatives – in particular the proposal for a General Food Law and for establishing the European Food Safety Authority, now enacted by Regulation 178/2002.</p>
<p class="contents">A vast number of amendments have been discussed in the Committee on the Environment and other committees. But it is not just the quantity of your work for which I am grateful – but also, and especially, the quality of the results, which, in my view, is excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the proposed amendments seek to improve the proposals from an editorial and technical point of view. There are also a large number of amendments, which align our proposals with the newly adopted Regulation 178/2002. I welcome these amendments, which represent important and rational suggestions to improve our texts.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I will start with the first of Mr Schnellhardt’s reports – on the horizontal measures covering the whole of the food sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I must first mention the recurring question of comitology. I welcome the acceptance that the Commission can adopt implementing measures under comitology procedures. However, I am disappointed that Amendment No 30 seeks to remove the mandate to the Commission to grant derogations from the annexes of the regulation. Such a mandate already exits and I see no reason why this should not continue and, thus, cannot accept Amendment No 30. Perhaps Members of the House will be aware of my views on comitology which is important as a form of secondary legislation to get measures through into law in a short space of time and Parliament always has the "droit de regard" which it can exercise. If it did exercise it in any piece of legislation that I was responsible for, I would take full account of that. To that extent I am often disappointed at Parliament's view in relation to the comitology procedure even though it may indeed need some amendment, reform and modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The annexes to the regulation are technical and should therefore be adaptable using the comitology procedure. I therefore cannot accept Amendments Nos 28, 29, 58 and 59.</p>
<p class="contents">The HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) system has already provoked strong feelings. A number of amendments aim to implement this system at farm level. This is overly ambitious – and I must therefore reject Amendment No 8, the first part of Amendment No 9, and Amendments Nos 35, 37, 38 and 67.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of Amendment Nos 36 and 104 would require food businesses to keep documentation on the HACCP system for an extensive period of time. This is not acceptable, as the measures we propose with regard to documentation for small businesses must be realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on HACCP, this system is the full responsibility of the food business operators. Amendment No 108 is therefore not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Flexibility in the context of food hygiene is an issue with which I am greatly concerned. Throughout the European Union, there are longstanding cultural traditions with regard to food and food preparation and I am keen to protect and encourage this and have sought to ensure this particular provision was included in this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal therefore contains a procedure to ensure sufficient flexibility to ensure that these traditions are preserved. I welcome the general acceptance of this. I will try to take into account, as far as possible, the suggestions in Amendments Nos 31 and 32, making editorial amendments where needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal provides for the establishment of guides of good practice – for use by food businesses to assist the achievement of the very highest level of food hygiene. I welcome the amendments that aim to clarify the procedures on how such guides should be established, and those that underscore that such guides should be voluntary instruments. But I must reject Amendments Nos 47 and 48, as these would impose unnecessary obligations on food businesses or on the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On the registration of food business, I am happy to take into account the suggestions for flexibility regarding the registration procedure. But on the linked question of traceability, I take the view that this is fully covered under Regulation 178/2002. Amendment No 53 must therefore be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 13, on support to developing countries, I find most interesting. This is an important matter – and one that calls for profound reflection. While I must reject this amendment – please note that it is a matter to which I intend to return.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also reject Amendments Nos 69, 71, 76, 77, 83, 89, 92, 93, 95, 101 and 105 because these may have a negative impact on small businesses. Similarly, Amendments Nos 5 and 14, the second part of 16, 53, 55, and 107 since these are already adequately covered in other parts of Community law, and Amendment No 39 since this is already dealt with by Amendment No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also keen on keeping a strict separation between the duties of food business operators and the competent authorities. Amendment No 55 is not in line with that objective and must therefore be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">The other amendments are either wholly or partly acceptable, subject to editorial amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to Mr Schnellhardt’s report on the proposal on the hygiene of food of animal origin.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that stands out above all others is that of game meat. It would appear that our proposal has ruffled a few feathers! I can assure this house that our objective in making the proposal was to design pragmatic rules and to preserve traditions in the Member States, such as the delivery of small quantities of game meat by the hunter to the consumer or local retail trade.</p>
<p class="contents">It was certainly not our intention to interfere with private consumption. I am grateful for the effort made to strike the right balance and I believe that you have broadly succeeded.</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, I am ready to accept the following amendments on game: they are Amendments Nos 90, 92, 94 to 97, 129, 13 and the first part of 130.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 91, however, overlaps with Regulation 178/2002 and must therefore be rejected. I must also reject Amendments Nos 85 in part and 132 since they are not compatible with other amendments that I can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I must further reject the following amendments either because of a possible negative impact on small businesses or because of overlap with other parts of Community law. They are Amendments Nos 17, 33, 35 first part, 38, 44, 45 first part, 55, 58, 65, 69, 91, 101, 116.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also reject Amendment No 8 because it mixes obligations to be respected by food business operators with those of the competent authorities; Amendment No 10 in part because it widens too much the scope of the proposal with regard to special guarantees for salmonella in meat, as well as the last part of Amendment No 13 since this would compromise the right of initiative of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The other amendments are either wholly or partly acceptable, subject to editorial amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to Mr Kindermann’s report on the proposal dealing with animal health issues as a consequence of the consolidation of the rules on food hygiene.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that there is strong support for the proposal, with only a small number of amendments. There are, however, six amendments that I cannot accept: Amendment No 4, in relation to BSE, as there is already extensive legislation laid down to cater for this BSE requirement and it is neither necessary nor good legal practice to repeat this.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5, on traceability, as this is already covered by Article 3(2) (a) and is already included in animal health legislation. I could, accept the amendment if the term "human health" was replaced by “animal health” as foot and mouth disease is not a risk to humans.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 8 and 9 concern infringements and publication of results. This is a matter of subsidiarity and therefore should fall to each individual Member State. In addition, there are no public health concerns, and it is not possible to draw up an exhaustive list of animal health infringements. To try to do so would inevitably lead to omissions. If necessary, this should be done in a horizontal fashion. However, I would encourage Member States to aim for the level of transparency highlighted in these amendments in their national implementing provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I have major concerns with Amendment No 12 on derogations for developing countries. If rules are stricter than those laid down by the OIE, then these must be to ensure that the Community animal health situation is not jeopardised. To allow more lenient rules for developing countries would clearly be self-defeating. I therefore cannot agree to Amendment No 12.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 16, the Early Warning System was set up for specific public health concerns, not for the purpose foreseen by this amendment. In such cases, the Commission would usually propose a draft decision to Member States to suspend importation of the relevant animal products. Additionally, Member States' veterinary services would be warned immediately with detailed information from the Commission of any risk consignments and therefore inclusion in the Early Warning System is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these six amendments, there are two amendments that I can only accept in part. First, on Amendment No 7 in relation to unannounced inspection and penalties, I agree that there should be provision for unannounced official controls, but the proposed amendment appears to limit these controls to unannounced inspections only. Alternative wording to allow for some to be unannounced would be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, on Amendment No 11 concerning assistance and notification of results, the first sentence repeats paragraph 1 of this Article and should therefore be deleted. The other amendments are either wholly or partly acceptable subject to editorial amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now comment in detail on the amendments to these three reports. As far as the Schnellhardt report on the hygiene of foodstuffs is concerned, the Commission can wholly or partly accept the following amendments subject to editorial changes: Nos 1 to 4, 6, 7, 9 to 12, 15 to 27, 31 to 34, 36, 40 to 46, 49 to 52, 54, 56, 57, 60 to 66, 68, 70, 72 to 75, 78 to 82, 84 to 88, 90, 91, 94, 96 to 100, 102, 103 and 106. The Commission is unable to accept the following amendments: Nos 5, 8, 13, 14, 28 to 30, 35, 37 to 39, 47, 48, 53, 55, 58, 59, 67, 69, 71, 76, 77, 83, 89, 92, 93, 95, 101, 104, 105, 107 and 108.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Schnellhardt report on specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, the Commission can wholly or partly accept the following amendments subject to editorial change: Nos 1 to 7, 9 to 16, 18 to 32, 34 to 37, 39 to 43, 45 to 54, 56, 57, 59 to 64, 66 to 68, 70 to 90, 92 to 100, 102 to 115, 117 to 131, 133 and 134. The Commission is, however, unable to accept the following amendments: Nos 8, 17, 33, 38, 44, 55, 58, 65, 69, 91, 101, 116 and 132.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Kindermann report, the Commission can wholly or partly accept the following amendments subject to editorial change: Nos 1 to 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13 to 15 and 17. The Commission is, however, unable to accept the following amendments: Nos 4, 5, 8, 9, 12 and 16.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that Members will understand the reasoning behind the decisions to reject or amend some of the amendments put forward by the committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I repeat my sincere thanks to all those who have participated in this Herculean task. The food hygiene package marks another important step in our overhaul of food legislation in pursuit of our objective to ensure that European consumers have access to the safest possible food supply in the world.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
