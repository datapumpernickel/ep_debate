<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is deeply concerned about developments on the Korean peninsular over the last three months. The entire international community must make every possible effort to stop any action which will give the peninsular a nuclear capability, to restore the sunshine policy between North and South Korea and to ensure that North Korea continues to integrate smoothly into the international community. I believe the High Representative, Mr Solana, referred at the last session to consultations over the telephone with China, Japan, South Korea and the USA, following the escalation of tension. The European Union is ready and waiting to offer its good services to support the negotiations currently under way. However, it is not prepared to allow anyone to challenge the international framework for the control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We believe that nuclear weapon programmes pose a serious threat to both world peace and the fragile environmental balance, be they for peaceful purposes or other, uncontrolled uses which, unfortunately, do not exclude the possibility of their being traded.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start with the parameters and background to the problem, so that we all come at this from the same starting point. In pursuing its current nuclear weapons programme, North Korea has broken every international agreement to which it is party, either implicitly or explicitly, and in stating that it is entitled to do so, it has failed to honour its obligations under at least four agreements, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Safeguards Agreement, the North-South Joint Declaration on Nuclear Disarmament and the framework agreement which, if violated, undermines the agreed KEDO framework on oil supplies. North Korea has ignored international demands and specific suggestions that it clearly and openly abandon its nuclear weapons programme and has exacerbated the situation by reacting to the halting of oil shipments under the KEDO agreement, which does not allow it to receive oil and run a nuclear weapons programme at the same time, by expelling the IAEA inspectors and reactivating its nuclear facility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it replied to the Agency’s demand for inspectors to be readmitted by announcing that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is a most unfortunate and worrying development. Especially at a time when, from what it said, the United States was willing to talk. The European Union has issued a series of statements expressing its deep concern about these developments. It has called for North Korea to reverse its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty immediately and to readmit the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and has also stated that it undertakes, mainly in agreement with the USA but also in collaboration with the most closely affected countries in the region, to work towards a peaceful solution. Our aim is to resolve the problem as quickly as possible, which is why yesterday’s General Affairs Council discussed recent developments in North Korea and international efforts to alleviate the situation and find a solution, and what preconditions would attach to its sending a high-level Union mission to Pyongyang.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday’s meeting agreed in principle that a mission was a good idea, with almost everyone emphasising the importance of involving North Korea in the whole procedure at the highest possible level, including Κim Jong-il personally. It was decided that the preconditions, timing and composition of the mission would be determined in the immediate future and that, in the meantime, close contacts would be maintained with the main protagonists and our main counterparts. I think that, if we want to work within this framework towards a peaceful solution, one of the basic things we have to do is to take account of North Korea’s security concerns and try and reassure it on this count by offering the necessary guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community needs to focus on normalising relations between North Korea and the countries in the region as a whole and efforts in this direction need to be stepped up, without overlooking the fact that its citizens need support in their daily struggle to survive in the face of a shortage of energy resources. A policy of persuasion, accompanied by measures to respond to North Korea’s needs and concerns and find a way of allowing it to back down without losing face, will be the most effective way forward. For its part, North Korea must understand that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Safeguards Agreement serve the wider interests of every country and every nation and must be respected by one and all. We support the Agency and the resolutions it has passed on this issue. Developing nuclear weapons is not an effective defence policy. Developing peaceful and open mutually beneficial cooperative relations with every country in the world is, I think, a much more effective policy and this is the approach adopted by the European Union, which has a history of good relations with North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">We again call on North Korea from this tribune to reconsider its decision and honour all its obligations under its international commitments. May I also say that we are pleased with the approach to this issue taken by the international community, which has remained firm and united in a bid to achieve its common purpose. The European Union is determined to continue sending humanitarian aid to North Korea and the Union bodies responsible are continuing to discuss ideas as to what future part the Union can play in supporting a peaceful solution. We expect and encourage any action predicated on maintaining democratic principles throughout the world; as history has taught us in many countries and regions in the world, there lies the way to economic development and peaceful international relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, just three years ago we all hoped that the Korean peninsular could look forward to a much better future. North Korea, traditionally isolated from just about every other country and consistently hostile to South Korea, had for some years been in very severe economic difficulties and eventually Pyongyang was forced to call upon the international community for assistance with food and medical supplies and for help in tackling the effects of a series of disastrous floods.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community responded and, in the wake of that, the mood of the regime in Pyongyang seemed to soften, raising the prospect of some change, however slow. In South Korea, the election of Kim Dae-jung as president in the late 1990s meant that the economic crisis there was tackled effectively and also resulted in efforts to implement the sunshine policy of trying to achieve normalisation of relations with North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit meeting in Pyongyang in 2000 between President Kim Dae-jung and North Korea's Chairman Kim Jong-il encouraged hopes of further constructive developments. Against that background, the majority of our Member States who had not already done so established or restored diplomatic links with North Korea and agreed to increase assistance, with a promise of more, if North Korea continued its cautious opening to the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">The high level EU visit led by Prime Minister Goran Persson to Pyongyang in May 2001 was regarded as a further important step that reinforced our nascent dialogue concerning, inter alia, human rights, and brought from North Korea a promise of a continued moratorium on missile testing.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, however, progress has not been so evident. Political level contact between North Korea and South Korea continued, as did family reunions and business contacts, but the promised second summit did not take place. Hopes of reconciliation are kept alive, but the patrol boat clash last summer shows how fragile those hopes are.</p>
<p class="contents">With the visit of Prime Minster Koizumi to Pyongyang last August, Japan also took a major step forward in opening up dialogue about normalising relations, nearly sixty years after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea. But the admission by Chairman Kim Jong-il that over the years Japanese citizens had been kidnapped and that, tragically, some of the abducted people had died in North Korea understandably caused emotional reactions in Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">All that has generated justified concern, but it is the deterioration in the relationship with the United States that has generated most worry. The initial determination of the Bush administration not to follow the policies of President Clinton in relations with North Korea fed Pyongyang's suspicions that the United States was implacably hostile. The antagonisms have obviously been increased by the discovery last November that North Korea has been carrying out a covert programme of uranium enrichment in violation of the engagements it undertook in 1994 under the agreed framework, when the Korean Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) was set up to ensure that nuclear energy supplies to the DPRK under international supervision reduced the risk of war.</p>
<p class="contents">We all, I am sure, share anxiety about the developments over the past two months. North Korea is now the only country ever to have left the non-proliferation treaty. It expelled the IAEA inspectors and said it was restarting plutonium production at Yongbyong. Clearly, if North Korea begins to process significant quantities of plutonium for military use, the situation would deteriorate quickly and seriously. That reality is understood by all our partners and, of course, not least, the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not however just an issue between the DPRK and the United States. It is a regional issue which carries grave risks for both Korea and Japan. It is also a crisis with global impact in terms of the non-proliferation worries which it raises. Clearly, if the situation worsens, there are likely to be adverse economic effects on the global economy including the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The development crisis therefore calls for common efforts by the main partners to find a diplomatic solution which can satisfy the demands of the international community, including the European Union, that North Korea must return to conformity with the non-proliferation treaty and which also gives North Korea the assurance that it will not be attacked by the United States. Plainly, if the international community is once again willing to help North Korea to address its enormous internal problems of shortages of energy, food and all other basic needs, this could also assist to get the country out of the crisis. But it is also clear that the European Union is not a major participant in the affairs of that region. We are of course a significant participant; we have provided nearly 300 million euros in different types of aid to the DPRK since the mid-1990s. Our most significant contribution politically is our participation in the KEDO, where we are board members together with the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan, and contribute 20 million euros annually. The European Union has also consistently been involved as a humanitarian donor – a role that was symbolised most recently by the 9.5 million ECU emergency food aid package for nursing mothers. This is assisted and delivered through the World Food Programme, as much of our humanitarian food assistance has been over the years, and the conditions for doing this are very clearly spelt out in a way that creates very tight monitoring procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, for this and other reasons, has some credibility vis-à-vis the DPRK. We can consequently raise the question of whether the European Union can find an effective role in persuading the DPRK to see reason and back down from its current threatening posture and in helping to promote a diplomatic solution, particularly in a way that helps the United States and the DPRK to get back to dialogue and negotiations. Those were among the issues discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council last Monday, when foreign ministers decided to give a mandate to the Presidency to organise a high level visit to the DPRK. The timing, composition of the delegation and modalities are to be decided later and preparations for such a visit can now be undertaken. A clear condition, however, is that the delegation must be received by Chairman Kim Jong-il. Naturally, in our contact with the DPRK, we will not lose sight of the need for that country to address the human rights abuses that also add to the problem of the dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I can report that our South Korean friends have pressed strongly for an EU initiative and there has been general encouragement from other partners. The timing of such a visit must however be decided only after careful consultation with the partners concerned and when we are certain that our delegation will be received at the highest level.</p>
<p class="contents">Plainly, we also need to prevent a wedge from being driven between the efforts of the international community to counter the recent DPRK decisions. Further contact may therefore be needed with our closest allies and the United States in this case in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">As the situation develops, the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed. In the meantime, we hope for the continued and valued support of Parliament in our efforts to foster temperate and constructive attitudes on all sides. I would end by saying that the world is not in acute need of more conflicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

North Korea presents one of the most threatening humanitarian crises and military flashpoints on the globe. Run by a vain and maverick dictator, Kim Jong-il, whose disastrous Stalinist economic policies have brought the country to its knees, the DPRK is now resorting to nuclear blackmail and dangerous brinkmanship with the world community, in breach of the 1994 framework agreement and other previous binding international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kim has chosen to withdraw from the NPT and to expel IAEA inspectors, and threatens to reactivate his nuclear weapons programme by switching on the Yongbyong nuclear power station, ostensibly to generate electricity, but no-one is really fooled by this as it is really a source of weapons-grade plutonium for him.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than feed his people, he has chosen to maintain one million men under arms, with an immoral diversion of food and resources to the military, irrespective of the sufferings of the civilian population, many of whom are rotting in political re-education camps or dying of starvation. North Korea remains a failing, rogue state and a very dangerous one at that. It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it is technically still at war, and it has ten thousand artillery pieces aimed at Seoul.</p>
<p class="contents">I am at a loss as to why out-going President Kim of South Korea is so flattering about his Pyongyang counterpart. I suppose the sunshine policy requires a very sensitive approach to such a strange man who has just rebuffed the South's special envoy, Mr Lim, who returned empty-handed yesterday from his trip to the North. Also, our so-called ally Pakistan needs to consider the consequences of its actions in its alleged provision to North Korea of uranium enrichment technology in exchange for help in weaponising its Ghauri-2 long range missiles with nuclear warheads by adapting North Korean Nodong missiles. Already many are suspicious of the genuineness of Pakistan's commitments in its war against terrorism and the disappearance of the records of Pakistan's relations with North Korea is worrying. There are also suspicions that both countries are helping Iran's covert weapons proliferation programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must close ranks against this rogue state and stop it becoming a nuclear proliferator if it is not one already, not only because of the threat posed to the South and the 37 000 US troops stationed there, but also the 40 million civilian South Korean population. It also has a track record, no doubt worsened by its desperate self-inflicted poverty, of exporting arms, including weapons of mass destruction, to any willing buyer irrespective of the danger posed to world security.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, China and Russia, for once, have a common agenda with the West in preventing a nuclear arms race in the region, which will quickly spread to the South Korean part of the peninsula and to Japan, with very dangerous consequences for the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must assess the situation carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid. It must also, however, send a very clear and strong signal to North Korea – which, rather surprisingly, listens carefully to our pronouncements – that it will not tolerate nuclear blackmail in the event of UN sanctions. It must also urge strongly against any further provocative testing of ballistic missiles over Japan, as happened a couple of years ago, or moving the sealed spent nuclear fuel rods which are currently sitting in water tanks, which therefore would effectively show that they are very serious in their intent to progress to manufacturing plutonium weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">The DPRK cannot pursue a policy of ignoring the collective will of the United Nations and must cease its nuclear proliferation immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not have many real differences with our fellow Members from the PPE-DE on this issue. North Korea is withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, refusing inspections by the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and re-launching its nuclear programme. And what are we doing? Are we going to threaten war? No! Thank goodness for that and I am glad to see such wisdom.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with the motion for a resolution. I would like to highlight three points from it. The first point relates to Pakistan’s role in this issue. Pakistan is one of our supposed allies, an American ally, which, solely due to the fact that it claims to be fighting terrorism, could, furthermore, without anyone taking any notice, provide North Korea with enriched uranium. We find this completely unacceptable and it should be condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I welcome the decision of the Council and the Commission to also view the North Korean problem from a humanitarian perspective. From a humanitarian perspective without cutting humanitarian aid, but also trying to find other solutions to the problem of energy, which is a very serious problem in North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the point which is probably closest to our hearts, which is dialogue. We believe it is urgent that we initiate dialogue between the seven major powers, which are the European Union, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, North Korea and South Korea, on economic, security and peace issues. I believe that it is really this firm dialogue which could lead to a solution to the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andreasen (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, only two weeks ago North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it had been a party for 17 years. This decision was made in a climate of international uncertainty, especially when weapons of mass destruction are concerned. The threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons is grave and we are currently balancing on the brink of war in Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states.</p>
<p class="contents">The North Korean withdrawal is not only a threat to regional stability. Destabilising the Korean peninsula would have more far-reaching consequences. Neighbours in far-off countries alike have an interest in making North Korea change its mind. Besides displaying a lack of respect for international security, the North Korean decision also shows complete disregard for the well-being of an already impoverished population. Human suffering in North Korea is immense. Every human right is being violated, including the most fundamental of all: the right to live.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past eight years, more than two million people have starved to death in North Korea. More will suffer the same fate if donors feel forced to restrict aid as a direct consequence of North Korean withdrawal from the NPT. A concerted effort by regional partners and international organisations is the best way forward. China, Japan and South Korea along with the United Nations, the EU and the United States should be active in seeking a solution. The recent resumption of talks between North and South Korea demonstrates that dialogue is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Some groups here have worked together to table a joint resolution expressing a reaction to the current situation in North Korea. Together we share the view that the North Korean position is untenable. Besides condemnation and calls for a change of course, we have underlined the need for dialogue and repeated our position on human rights. North Korea must change its decision for the sake of regional and international stability as well as its own people. Our joint resolution sends out a clear signal from the vast majority in the Parliament that condemns the current situation and state of affairs in North Korea, but at the same time suggests a course of action which, given the right amount of commitment, could remedy the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ahern (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, US President Bush branded North Korea as part of an axis of evil with Iraq and Iran. These unwise words evidently caused North Korea to believe they were on George Bush's hit list. The proliferation of nuclear weapons in east Asia opens up an appalling vista. This is potentially a much more serious conflict than that in Iraq. Already last October, the government of North Korea was reportedly running a secret uranium enrichment programme in blatant violation of the KEDO Agreement. In December, North Korea cancelled its membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, expelled the International Atomic Energy Authority weapons inspectors and announced that it would reactivate a nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant producing weapons grade material.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that KEDO was ill designed from the start, neither addressing North Korea's immediate energy needs, nor delivering technology adaptable to the country's infrastructure. The developments on the uranium enrichment programme led the European Parliament in October last year to freeze the EUR 20 million EU contributions to KEDO for 2003, and the US administration to stop its oil supplies to North Korea under the KEDO Agreement. It is now inconceivable that Commissioner Patten, as he himself has acknowledged, could come to the European Parliament and request money from the EU funds for nuclear transfers. Even if he assures this House that the funding will be used for the non-nuclear components of KEDO, the transfer of such technology is now so evidently dangerous that a complete review of KEDO, deleting the nuclear technology transfers, is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to respond to this point in particular, and to ensure that the money be spent on a proposal to provide clean energy from North Korea's electricity plants, by reconstructing its ancient conventional energy plants so as to make them efficient, by contributing to the proposed gas pipeline from Irkutsk as well as developing the great potential in Korea for wind and solar energy, bio-mass and geothermics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He only has to threaten and the heads of government come begging for concessions on bended knees. This is the vague picture of his absolute rule that millions of North Koreans get.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we find a sensible answer to the real threat from this tyrannical Sun King? The regional leaders appear not to have the power, the will or the opportunity they need to free themselves from the threat of North Korea. On the other hand, one cannot expect the Americans to solve this global problem alone. The Security Council is the organ designated to act in this case. Section 7 of the Charter states that the Council should adopt a resolution that contains clear steps towards de-escalating this dangerous conflict.</p>

I believe that this is proof that the threat of North Korea to world security is seen as greater and more real, as, moreover, both Commissioner Patten and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have said this afternoon. Clearly, there can be no possibility of military action to destroy nuclear plant in Korea. In his account of the facts with which we who are concerned with these issues are already quite familiar, the Commissioner mentioned a possible US attack. I feel that this is to be completely excluded, for it could lead to war, possibly even nuclear war, on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, unlike in the case of Iraq, here, a peaceful approach is the only possible way forward, and that could take two forms: the isolation of North Korea or diplomacy and an attempt at dialogue. The United States, which favoured isolation at the start of the crisis, now appears to lean more towards dialogue. I believe that this is the opinion even of those Members who were here just now but have just left the House holding up placards saying ‘No to war’, not realising that, in doing so, they are making war more likely. Every initiative which supports Saddam Hussein’s cause makes him more stubborn and less inclined to bow before our requests and pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, there are two mistakes we must avoid in negotiations with North Korea. Firstly, we must not fall into the trap laid by Pyongyang, which is trying to create a division between the United States and South Korea, an attempt which is furthered by the fact that north-south relations have not been very good for some time, to the extent that the outgoing President<span class="bold"> </span>was moved to describe Kim Jong-Il as a very astute man whereas, judging from what he has done with his country and the way his people, the population live, one might be induced to think the opposite. Secondly, we must not give other countries, other potential Kim Jong-Il-style dictators – and they do exist – the impression that one only has to violate the non-proliferation treaties in order to be rewarded with support and assistance from the United States. There must, however, be two indispensable conditions in our negotiations with North Korea. Firstly, we cannot tolerate the existence of a nuclear weapons programme in that country. Secondly, any agreement must lay down exceedingly rigid, pervasive control measures to prevent North Korea from taking us for a ride once again. On this basis, the conference we propose in our joint motion for a resolution would be extremely useful as a European Union initiative.</p>

We strongly condemn these decisions by North Korea, just as we should equally strongly condemn the decision of the Pakistani Government which provides the technology for the enrichment of uranium. On the other hand, we recall that our policy has always been, and still is, aimed essentially at the promotion of peace, stability and economic development in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">If these objectives are to be shared by North Korea, we strongly urge the parties to engage in constructive dialogue. In order to fulfil the conditions for this dialogue, I believe it is essential that North Korea state that it is prepared to entirely respect its obligations in accordance with the international treaties and that it is returning to the course it itself traced two years ago. I entirely agree with the proposals of the Council and the Commission aimed at continuing humanitarian aid and providing the technical assistance necessary for the operation of coal mines in order to provide that country with the energy it so cruelly lacks. It is also an important element in terms of the dismantling of the nuclear programme.</p>
