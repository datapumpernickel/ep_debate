The first is to make the Union fit for enlargement eastwards. The second is to reform its own policies, especially its agricultural and Structural Funds policies, in a sense to bring a breath of fresh air into our policies. The third is to safeguard the financing of these policies over the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">The master plan presented by the Commission to this end did not come through the more than two years of discussions in Parliament and the Council unchanged, and I admit that this was not advantageous in every respect. It will become apparent that we have not entirely achieved the objectives I have just listed. But it is also true that we have come very, very close to doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of Berlin is a compromise. That it came into being at all is also thanks to the German Presidency of the Council, and in particular to the German Chancellor. Every compromise, including of course the Berlin compromise, has some more and some less satisfactory aspects. Perhaps in the European Union maximum satisfaction can be achieved only if the dissatisfaction is equally distributed. Here too the German Presidency can boast some success. But so can Parliament! Never before has the European Parliament been so closely involved in the decision‐making on a reform project of this scale.</p>
<p class="contents">From the time of the first reading of the reports in the European Parliament up to the Berlin European Council at the end of March, Parliament influenced and modified the results in the course of intensive discussions, and in intensive negotiations after Berlin. This result is certainly not quite what we had hoped and wanted. However, we are also aware that for the first time the European Parliament has managed to change important aspects of a European Council decision. We succeeded in ensuring the implementation and funding of a fourth URBAN Community initiative, so as to promote the economic and social regeneration of cities and urban neighbourhoods.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to take this opportunity to particularly thank the Commissioner, Mrs Wulf‐Mathies, for supporting the European Parliament"s position on these questions, as also on a range of others. We would not have carried off this success without having her on our side.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be thanks to us if more attention is paid in future to land‐use planning, to remote regions and islands. It will be thanks to us that more support is to be given to education and training, and above all it is thanks to us that the flexibility instrument can be increased. Also to our credit is the review clause for the financing of future policies, especially in the external policy area and in relation to aid for the reconstruction of the afflicted Balkan regions. It is thanks to us that codecision has been introduced at least in some areas of agricultural policy. I think the future President of the Commission has us to thank that this Commission will have considerably more staff available for carrying out new tasks than the old Commission ever had.</p>
<p class="contents">The large majority of my group will approve the interinstitutional agreement on medium‐term financial planning and we will of course give our assent to those parts of Agenda 2000 that require such assent.</p>
<p class="contents">As we declared back in November 1998: we, the Parliament, will do all we can to ensure that the Agenda 2000 package is adopted before Parliament is re‐elected and we want to get this Agenda 2000 under way now. It makes a vital contribution to the Union"s ability to act during a difficult period. With our decisions on Agenda 2000 we will make the European Union more able to move into the future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hatzidakis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (EL)</span> Mr President, in an era when the dogma that you can implement policies, especially social policies, without money is increasingly gaining ground, I continue to insist on the need for a substantive policy of economic and social cohesion within the framework of the European Union. Social and economic cohesion is one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty on European Union and I think that all the institutions of the European Union must remain firmly committed to this fundamental principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that, within this framework, the Commission proposals on Agenda 2000 were a step in the right direction. I would like, on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party, to congratulate Mrs Wulf‐Mathies, Mr Fischler and Mr Flynn on their position throughout the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the European Parliament formalised its proposals as far back as November, and I believe that it went much further than the Commission proposals. What it set out to do was to bring together two objectives: on the one hand to have effective fund management and, on the other, to place the emphasis where it was needed. This is why we asked from the outset that three quarters of the funds went to Objective 1 regions, which are the poorest.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking this a step further, Mr President, negotiations took place and then we had the European Council meeting in Berlin, until which time there had been a certain indecisiveness. Fortunately, however, the European Council in Berlin reached a compromise, which was followed by negotiations between Parliament, the Council and, of course, the Commission. This brought about three constructive changes: the first change concerned the Community initiative, URBAN; the second was the European Regional Development Fund relating to actions for culture and tourism, and the third concerned the special emphasis given, again under the European Regional Development Fund, to islands.</p>
<p class="contents">As with all compromises, the compromise reached at Berlin does not give cause for celebration, even less so for my country – and I must speak as a Greek – since the Greek Government accepted reforms which place us in the same category as Spain, Ireland and Portugal, countries which are less poor than ours and which are already participating in the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, if Parliament were to reject this compromise, all our efforts would go up in smoke, and it would prevent the timely onset of programmes within the third Community support framework on 1 January 2000. I move therefore that the regulation be adopted, especially now that most of the opinions expressed by Parliament as far back as November have been accepted, and that we achieved positive changes during the negotiations we had with the Council last month.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about the pre‐accession funds. It is sad that Cyprus has been excluded by the Council. Cyprus is the only applicant country that has been excluded from pre‐accession funding. I hope that Mr van den Broek will fulfil his commitment to examine the possibility of a special budget line to fund Cyprus, as we cannot have double standards. Such exclusions give rise to doubts as to whether there is indeed the will to admit Cyprus into the European Union, and these doubts must be dispelled as quickly as possible.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, when the European Council in Berlin reached an agreement, the most important thing was that there was a political agreement. At that time it was unacceptable for Parliament. But at this historic moment we will hopefully agree to an interinstitutional agreement. It is historic in that never before has the European Council position been changed by Parliament and it reflects our new position. We see in front of us three of the resigning Commissioners, and I should like to say on this point that the original proposals on Agenda 2000 showed courage and vision on the part of the Commission. The results of the European Council were not satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved major results. Above all, for the first time we now have new rights in terms of non‐compulsory expenditure on agriculture. That must surely be something positive for Commissioner Fischler. We have received new guarantees of new flexibility. We are not very satisfied by the fact that the Council has cut down enormously in an area where this Parliament has major rights – Category 3. At least we have achieved within the current constraints the possibility of a further adjustment by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In Category 4 – external policy – there is an agreement that we will have the possibility of review. The hypocrisy of the European Council can best be demonstrated by the fact that no less than EUR 250 m had to be decided within two weeks on Kosovo, thereby taking more than three‐fifths of the overall basis for seven years. It shows therefore that Berlin is already outdated. But voting against an interinstitutional agreement at this moment would be a major mistake. It is on that basis that the Liberal Group will vote for the interinstitutional agreement because it will achieve not simply more money but more rights and more parity. It is on that basis that the European Community can move forwards. If we vote against it, with all the other difficulties, we would throw the European Union into a major phase of uncertainty at the time that the challenges for the new century are about to come.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Baggioni </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the islanders of the European Union were pleased to see on the evening of 2 October 1997 that the Treaty of Amsterdam signed by the 15 Member States contained the first explicit references officially recognising the permanent and structural handicaps suffered by the island regions and the need to remedy this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, less than two years later and with the Treaty having entered into force last Saturday, it is important to note that the reform of the Structural Funds for the 2000‐2006 period does not follow the same logic as the new Treaty. Although a solid legal basis allowed us to implement a truly integrated policy to help the island regions, particularly by means of the Structural Funds, the Council and the Commission decided otherwise, paying no heed to the European Parliament"s recommendations in this matter. The island regions saw all the possibilities of special, specific treatment being categorically and methodically rejected. Even the modest request for a special section for cooperation with and between the islands in the Interreg III programme was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">On reading the regulations that will be adopted tomorrow, it would seem that the cause of the island regions will not have made any significant advances with this reform of the Structural Funds. Moreover, it is worrying to note that, from the year 2000, very few islands will be considered to be in need of support as a result of their slow development. Does this mean that the Council and the Commission believe that the Union"s island regions have experienced enough economic development to call into question the political will – set out a year and a half earlier at the Amsterdam Council – to give real consideration to the islands" problems? Does this mean that the permanent and structural handicaps that were expressly recognised have disappeared as if by magic in only 18 months? Only the regulation concerning the ERDF refers to the need to help certain islands, and even then it only contains a very vague reference.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Varela, and the members of the Committee on Regional Policy for their understanding and their support throughout this parliamentary term. Faced with such an inadequate outcome for the cause of the islands, there is no doubt that all efforts must now be made to ensure that the specific characteristics of the Union"s island regions are considered not only in theoretical terms, but also in practical terms. But I trust that the European Parliament will continue along the path it has followed for several years. The Council and the Commission will not be able to pretend for ever that they do not hear us.</p>

This is probably not due so much to the amounts earmarked for or requested from each of our countries, but more to the generally restrictive solution adopted and its precariousness. Nevertheless, all the countries and governments declared that they were winners after the summit. But we should be objective. With such a financial framework, there will be no enlargement until 2006. In order to achieve this before then, the perspective will have to be extensively reweighted, as well as the respective amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">This medium‐term financial framework does not respond to such important issues as the consolidation of the euro and, in particular, any asymmetric shocks or other shocks which may result from the next WTO negotiations. In this context, although we are happy to unconditionally support and encourage the new interinstitutional agreement as a matter of principle and in order to guarantee stability and allow planning, the resulting compromise of the financial framework adopted with these characteristics gives us cause for concern. This will increase even more due to the absence of an in‐depth reform of the CAP, which we recommend, and due to the undeniably restrictive content of the rules which will govern some of the cohesion‐related instruments. However, other members of my group will talk about these aspects.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schroedter </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me turn to the positive aspects. It is vitally important to economic and social cohesion and therefore to the very core of the European social model that the new regulation was adopted in good time, before the end of the European Parliament"s electoral term. That guarantees the continuation of the funding. However, the price is very high. The regions will now have to compensate for the financial cuts at the very heart of European integration by putting forward more intelligent plans. In this regard I call on the Commission to apply its control function really seriously and genuinely to pursue in its programmes the objectives formulated in the new regulation – sustainable development, promotion of employment, promotion of equal opportunities for women and men, environmental improvement, support for small and medium‐sized undertakings – and not to shy away from them again in face of the Member States. The result of Berlin, as has already been said today, is not quite the reform we hoped for. After Parliament increased the rights of the people of Europe by incorporating a comprehensive principle of participation in the draft regulation – and this is the only basis for sustainable planning – the Council is now leaving this common concern to the discretion of the Member States. I regard that as the main problem with the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">When the funds are used for integrated development plans, the traditional way of thinking in terms of resources must be overcome. The regulation does offer possibilities, but I have since become aware of the resistance at Member State level. What this means is that local development initiatives must obtain ESF and ERDF funds if they really are to be able to combat unemployment. Under the new Structural Funds regulation it has proved possible to continue the cohesion policy. But that is not a reform! Efficiency, administrative simplification and concentration have fallen by the wayside. They were sacrificed to the confessional procedure and the favours handed out there.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude from this that if we do not finally manage to place the European interest above national interests we will not manage to achieve a genuinely progressive economic and social cohesion policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barthet‐Mayer </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a consensus within Parliament as regards the enlargement of the EU to include the CEECs and the need to reform the CAP, and I would like to look at this aspect of Agenda 2000. Parliament, which represents the people of Europe, stated that it was in favour of the European agricultural model, greater equity, balanced rural development, improved quality and the protection of the environment. This was highlighted in the Cunha report.</p>
<p class="contents">This political position is clear and it totally opposes the ever‐increasing standardisation, the ever‐increasing homogenisation, and the ever‐increasing relentless competition, which pushes farmers" prices and incomes down. This is the ultra‐liberal position of the Cairns Group and the United States. Thanks to Parliament"s firm stance, which has meant that the Commission has had to take up a less intransigent position, and thanks to the perseverance and persistence of certain Member States, we have a satisfactory compromise for the short‐term in terms of abandoning cofinancing, in terms of a more moderate fall than expected in guaranteed agricultural prices and in terms of the status quo on quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">But what will happen in the future? Does the reform enable us to respond to the Commission"s plans for sustainable agriculture, which contradict its amended proposal on the agricultural section of Agenda 2000? Is cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries enhanced? Has rural development, which involves 80 % of the Union"s territory, been given the role it deserves? Is it promoted in the island regions and allocated greater resources in the budget? Are the issues of the obvious social and environmental imbalances in the CAP and the division of agriculture into two categories truly resolved? Is aid to agriculture better distributed and does it better protect the environment? No, no, no and no.</p>
<p class="contents">By moving away from the policy of supporting agriculture through prices, by shrinking into ourselves and encouraging nationalisation, by undermining this sector through a further increase in direct income aid, Europe is moving further and further away from its mission and the founding principles of the common agricultural market. What is even more serious is that it is eroding the foundations of its culture, its countryside, its gastronomy, and therefore a major part of its identity. How will the agricultural Europe, reformed in this way, be able to defend its political project for agriculture and rural development in the future WTO negotiations? This gives rise to great concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Those negotiating on behalf of Europe in the WTO will have to prepare for battle and put our minds at rest: the European Union must never have a political agricultural objective of bringing the Community"s regulations into line with the rules of play of the global market. For the time being, since it is the present we must deal with, my group will vote in favour of the current compromise, but it urges the Commission to defend the European agricultural model at the next WTO negotiations.</p>

<p class="contents">How could we be pleased with an agreement that leads to a significant reduction in European farmers" incomes, through a partially compensated reduction in prices, before totally eliminating them to satisfy the requirements of the WTO? You will be aware, Mr President, that certain agricultural products are essential for the environmental balance and for the utilisation of EU territory. Unfortunately, a serious decline will be experienced as far as certain products are concerned. I am thinking, in particular, of oil protein crops, which, I would remind you, are ideal rotation crops to produce quality cereals, something we are increasingly trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">When I drafted the two opinions of the Committee on Agriculture on Agenda 2000, I warned all my colleagues about the budget difficulties we would encounter. In this connection, I am for the most part satisfied with the Berlin agreement with respect to its aim to support, if need be, the agricultural guideline as and when the successive enlargements take place, taking into consideration an automatic annual technical adjustment in the financial perspective to account for inflation. We only hope that the principle of compulsory expenditure will not be called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from its repercussions on farmers" incomes, this agreement in no way prepares for the next WTO negotiations, or perhaps, without saying so, it prepares for them too well. All the proposed reforms will be given a pounding. The only <span class="italic">acquis </span> that our partners will accept is the reduction of prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, our partners are also going to try to dismantle compensation aid. We all know that the motto in these types of negotiations is that everything that has been established has been established while the rest is up for negotiation. European agriculture must not disappear. Besides the economic and financial role that farmers play, they also have a social, cultural and environmental role that must be given top priority. On listening to Mr Prodi"s speeches, I noticed that he plans to use his position to enhance the role of the European Union in urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">So allow me to ask one question: in this context, where does the future of the countryside lie with the development of the Structural Funds to benefit urban areas, with the new WTO negotiations and with a CAP that contradicts our European identity?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McCarthy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, above all we need to be aware here today of our responsibilities in Parliament's final part‐session, not only our legislative function but our commitment to deliver this new round of European funds for our regions and local communities in a timely manner. As rapporteur I would like to tell you why I am recommending that Parliament gives a resounding ‘Yes" vote to the Council regulation on structural funds as amended. Our objective has been to emphasise Parliament's priorities in the reform process through a succession of informal contacts. This informal procedure is an ongoing exchange of information, a fruitful dialogue which has resulted in Parliament's priorities being incorporated into the final Berlin text while some demands remain to be negotiated in post‐Berlin meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be satisfied that key priorities have been met. Parliament requested that concentration must ensure that Objective 1 regions, the poorest in the Union, continue to receive priority assistance. This is the case in areas such as my own in Merseyside with a GDP of less than 75 % of the EU average which will continue to receive priority funds. I have to say that even if some financial special cases were made alongside Objective 1, this was of course the price to pay for a package and financial deal. We have to have the realism and pragmatism in this Parliament to recognise that consensus and compromise are the lifeblood of European politics.</p>
<p class="contents">New Objective 2 regions will continue to benefit from a sustained European commitment and sustained investment. Again, if I look to my own region of the North‐West, it has benefited from European funding. There is still a lot to do and we are glad to see the flexibility of a six‐year potential phasing‐out programme rather than four years in the Commission's original proposal. I would like to invite the Commission at the end of our mandate to take up the offer from Manchester City Council to come and see how European funds are making a difference to local communities there.</p>
<p class="contents">We supported a safety net proposal. This we believe was a success. In addition, Parliament very much welcomes the request, that was met, for the Union to play an active role in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. This was met with a special peace package.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have liked to have gone further on partnership but we hope that Member States will have the vision to ensure wide and deeper partnership in the drafting of programmes and in the implementing of those programmes. Most importantly, for me personally, the jewel in the crown achieved as a result of informal post‐Berlin negotiations in Strasbourg was that the Council agreed to the European Parliament's request to modify the Berlin Summit decision to add a new URBAN initiative with 0.35 % of funds added to the Community pot. I hope Mr Flynn does not think we are plundering Article 10 because we will be using those funds for social and employment initiatives as well.</p>
<p class="contents">URBAN has been popular with the public in some of our most deprived neighbourhoods and I believe we can help those communities on the path to regeneration. The rapporteurs therefore recommend that we now see a balance of interest between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. I would warn any political group that is thinking of playing party politics with this vote that blocking these proposals would mean a newly elected Parliament would be unable to vote until autumn, and this would put at risk over 200 billion of resources and involve interminable delays to local communities and projects.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us be clear about what we are voting for today. This is not just a 112‐page document of Eurospeak and technical details, although you can find plenty of Eurojargon in it. It is a package of funding to launch our regions into the new millennium, seven years of support for our most marginalised communities and areas who need our European commitment and solidarity, for the young, the long‐term unemployed and women returners: people who want to play an active role and part in economic regeneration in Europe. This is a European Union package for jobs, for regeneration. It is an employment and regeneration pact and it is a product of a consensus and compromise between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, we believe we have made very positive improvements with the addition of a fourth Community initiative, a new URBAN initiative, which Parliament supported and campaigned for. For all the above reasons I urge members today to use their vote to give a unanimous ‘Yes" vote to this funding package. Let us give our EU citizens the visible sign that we are backing the solidarity and support needed for the jobs and regeneration programmes for the new millennium</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, it gives me pleasure to present the recommendation and the report on the Cohesion Fund, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">When I presented this report for a first reading last November I spoke about the need for social and economic cohesion to remain one of the central pillars of the Community. The Cohesion Fund has been one of the clearest examples of this solidarity and action and what it can achieve. In approving this report on that occasion this House endorsed that view of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, and indeed up to the Berlin Summit, there have been a number of meetings with the Council on the future of the Cohesion Fund. I was adamant to negotiate the retention of the Cohesion Fund and that it be maintained in its current form. The final agreement at Berlin upheld Parliament's views in relation to the Fund and points raised during the informal conciliation period were taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's priorities in relation to the Cohesion Fund were easily identifiable. The first priority was to ensure the continuation of the Fund and the Council was able to agree with Parliament's view that the basic objectives of the Cohesion Fund are as relevant today as they were in 1992. Therefore the eligibility criterion of 90 % of the Union average wealth had to remain unchanged, allowing Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece to continue to qualify for the fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The view shared by Parliament and the Commission that the four current cohesion countries should continue to be eligible was agreed to by Council. The countries concerned need to continue the convergence process, and the continuation of the Fund is a vital ingredient in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The retention of the fund under the same conditions means that the infrastructure gap between the four cohesion countries and the rest of the Community can gradually be closed. It is vital that the current imbalance in this area be redressed so as to allow for a harmonised level of economic development across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point on which Parliament's views were taken on board, relates to the amount of an advance for projects and Parliament believed that the 10 % on account proposed by the Commission was insufficient. It would have exerted too heavy a burden on less‐favoured regions trying to get a project off the ground, and the 20 % agreed at Berlin, I believe, recognised this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">A further issue which Parliament had deemed unsatisfactory was the application of the ‘polluter pays" principle. While we naturally supported the idea, the Commission proposal remained unclear as to what was meant by ‘a project's capacity to generate revenue". Clear guidelines were needed as to the practical implementation of the principle. In this respect I welcome the Commission's declaration attached to the Berlin conclusions that the implementation would have to take account of national, social sensitivities.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of what Parliament set out to achieve for the Cohesion Fund from 2000 to 2006, the Berlin agreement is highly satisfactory. For this reason I believe there is no need for any further adjustments. I will just outline some of the main features of the Cohesion Fund as it will be under the amended regulation from the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be an overall amount of EUR 18 billion available to the four cohesion countries for the seven year period. The allocation of the total resources between the four countries was made on the basis of precise and objective criteria, principally population size and GNP per capita. Account was taken of the improvement and national prosperity attained over the previous period as well as of surface area. Other factors, such as deficiencies and transport infrastructure were also considered. And halfway through the funding period a review of progress will take place to see which countries will continue to qualify on the basis of continuing to meet the 90 % criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already mentioned, the ‘polluter pays" principle is included in the amended regulation and other environmental considerations also feature. In this way Parliament's view that infrastructure development must take serious account of environmental obligations is clearly evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, we all took a very close interest in the Berlin Summit and are all well aware that the final agreement did not come easily. The question of the Cohesion Fund was frequently controversial and, against this background, Parliament can be satisfied that it was taken seriously by the other institutions and that our recommendations were taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the final text of the regulation as one that reflects very clearly Parliament's views and I recommend that colleagues give this report their assent. This will consolidate many months of dedicated effort from Parliament's side to secure the best deal possible for the balanced development of our regions and the furthering of economic and social cohesion of the European Union. Parliament's assent will mean that the funding timetable can be adhered to in vital projects in Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal, enabling them to call down the necessary funding. These projects will make a real and tangible difference to the lives of millions of our citizens living in the Community's more remote and under‐developed regions.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Cohesion Fund is more than this. Its benefits are not limited to four Member States. In building the Union into a more cohesive, economic Union we are consolidating the single market and reinforcing the euro. We are allowing the Union to face up to not only these current projects but also the future ambition of enlargement. It is true that the Cohesion Fund is limited as to its sectors of operation, geographical focus and indeed amounts. However, it has proven to be an excellently focused instrument recording excellent expenditure levels and results which are of benefit to all.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, on a personal note, I should like to sincerely thank Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies for her very positive role in this area. She has always been most open at all times to discussion and debate, always understanding, always courteous to Parliament's members of the Committee on Regional Policy. Her commitment to the European Union and to her area of responsibility is an inspiration to us all.</p>

Firstly, Parliament has the chance to approve tomorrow in the House our recommendation at second reading concerning the ERDF. This has important legal and political implications since, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the ERDF now comes under the codecision procedure. We have had the novel experience of negotiating with the Council and the Commission in order to find a consensus between Parliament"s position, that of the 15 Member States and the Commission"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">One slip by Parliament, or simply one occasion where we do not exercise our powers responsibly, could result in us approving certain amendments that might prevent us from concluding this important regulation tomorrow, thereby preventing the regions of Europe from planning their activities for 1 January 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased as rapporteur because of the content of the document we have drawn up. It was not easy to fully explain our colleagues" ideas, but through four compromise amendments we succeeded in obtaining the agreement of the majority to withdraw other amendments, while also managing to preserve the spirit of our committee"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these four amendments refers to the inclusion of the concept of land‐use planning in the ERDF, which is something Parliament has been fighting for for quite some time. We need to link regional development with spatial development. Or, if you prefer, we need to unite economic and social cohesion with the territorial cohesion of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second compromise amendment is very closely related to land‐use planning and calls on the ERDF to help establish the necessary links with regions suffering from permanent, geographical disadvantages because of their peripheral or insular status. The aim here is to promote exchanges between Europe"s peripheral areas and the Community"s central regions. In its three‐yearly report on cohesion, the Commission has highlighted the fact that this situation is one of the main reasons for the backwardness of these regions and a factor in any eventual recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third compromise amendment specifically brings tourism and culture under the scope of the ERDF. Not long ago, just before he unfortunately passed away, the artist and humanist Yehudi Menuhin wondered publicly what would happen to the European Union"s culture. Strangely, although 80 % of the Union"s spending on culture comes from the Structural Funds, only 3 % of its appropriations are allocated to cultural projects. Our report hopes to provide a response to these questions and we would ask that culture be given a greater presence in the Structural Funds, including our cultural and natural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in line with the report on the general regulation, we would ask that the URBAN initiative should be maintained alongside the Community"s Interreg initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by referring to a very special issue in which the European Parliament has played a very significant role: the structural aspects of fisheries. In my speech to the House at first reading, I called on the Commission to amend its proposal and put fisheries on an equal footing with agriculture. I am pleased to see today that our position – which was so strongly defended by our rapporteur, Mr Arias Cañete, under the firm and constant guidance of the Committee on Fisheries – has reached a satisfactory conclusion. The amendments Parliament had requested have been introduced and we have managed to end up with a report that is a significant improvement on the Commission"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank the Commission, the Council and all our colleagues who have supported us.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jöns </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it seems hard to believe: the Social Fund is our only labour market policy instrument at European level! It has very successfully introduced new labour market policy measures in the Member States. Yet in Berlin it was not provided with anything near the funding that this House and the Commission rightly called for. Precisely in the case of the Social Fund, which has repeatedly produced European added value, whether in regard to the policy for the handicapped, in regard to preventive labour market policy or, for instance, to promoting equal opportunities for women, much remained in dispute up the last minute. Surely that is a rather topsy‐turvy world! It was not our fault. We did not call for anything revolutionary. Basically we were concerned with five key points to effectively flank the common employment strategy. Right at the top of the list was a preventive labour market policy and specific measures for women. Preventing unemployment has to be the more humane approach and is also considerably cheaper. Surely it is not acceptable that people now speak of the feminisation of poverty Union‐wide! Nor is it acceptable that EU‐wide women only occupy 3 % of top jobs, and the rate is declining. Women still make up the majority of the population. And here, gentlemen of the Council, mainstreaming alone is not enough!</p>
<p class="contents">We were also concerned with doing more to combat social marginalisation, for in the long term it will pay off if these people can manage to support themselves again. We also wanted to make the positive experiences gained from the PEACE initiative accessible throughout the Union; under this initiative, NGOs provided small grants that did not involve any great administrative outlay to help people for whom access to public sector jobs represents an impossible threshold to cross.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fifth concern was to make the Member States more aware of the need to cover all the Social Fund intervention areas rather than just picking out their favourites again. And let me say again to the Council: you have been aware of these demands since the beginning of the year. But that did not stop you from deciding your common position with quite stubborn disregard for this. We may well ask ourselves in this House, what is the point then of these informal conciliation meetings? The fact that we now have compromises acceptable to both sides is thanks to us and us alone, because we openly came towards you with compromise proposals to prevent your stubborn attitude from driving us to the Conciliation Committee; for that would have meant having to stall many projects because the money would not have come from Brussels in time. That would have been irresponsible, which, I hope, is something nobody here in this House wants!</p>
<p class="contents">In the end you got round to it after all. Even if the percentages of the funding have not been fixed, we have agreed on a more preventive labour market policy and on more specific measures for women. Suddenly it did prove possible to enshrine in the regulation the objective of social integration in the labour market. In the end we even managed to reach a compromise on global subsidies, which now actually makes it possible to provide up to 100 % support for NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments we have now agreed with the Council are Amendments Nos 1, 8, 9 and 10. I would ask all Members to support these amendments so that the results of our negotiations are also reflected in the Social Fund regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been very little shift in the Council"s position on the five intervention areas. We will have to learn to live with that. But on no issue was the Council as inflexible and stubborn as on mainstreaming. So it is now up to the Commission to ensure that mainstreaming is incorporated in the national programmes. I hope we will also see a few women in the Council in seven years" time. It would certainly be a service to the cause!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Arias Cañete </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the first report I presented to the House on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the Council Regulation on structural measures in the fisheries sector, Parliament expressed its support for three basic ideas. The first was the need to guarantee sufficient resources in the Community budget to cover the sector"s needs in the context of the structural policy for the fisheries sector. The second was the need for a single legal framework, in the form of a horizontal regulation, that would bring together the various regulations. The third was the need for national programmes, and not only regional programmes, to guarantee that the structural policy was consistent with the fleets" multi‐annual guidance programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this strategy, at first reading Parliament brought together in a single regulation both the proposal for a Council Regulation on structural measures in the fisheries sector, which is included in Agenda 2000, and the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector. The vote in the House entirely endorsed the positions supported by the Committee on Fisheries. Subsequently, our committee, and particularly its chairman, Carmen Fraga, contacted the Council, the national administrations and the professional organisations to organise a public hearing, which confirmed that Parliament"s political position was widely supported.</p>
<p class="contents">With such support, Parliament held various informal meetings with the Council presidency which, I am very pleased to say, has agreed to most of what we wanted, and, since the Berlin European Council, a new proposal for a regulation has even been drawn up, which is at last known as the ‘Regulation on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance".</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, we will have a single structural basis for fisheries and will not have to finance structural measures under the EAGGF Guarantee Section. Equally, we will have horizontal programming in non‐Objective 1 regions. We will also have a full list of all the actions and measures involved, and on the basis of these concessions from the Council, the Committee on Fisheries has accepted that there will two separate regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Council and the Commission on the flexibility they demonstrated in reviewing the initial ideas we considered to be mistaken and looking for a satisfactory compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that we have made significant changes to the regulation on implementing measures: we have removed the additional 30 % requirement for capacity withdrawn and the arrangements linking joint enterprises to the fisheries agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with a general reference to the Structural Funds pillar of Agenda 2000. In my view, given the backdrop of budgetary rigour, the Council and the Commission have shown good sense in concentrating aid on Objective 1 regions. This will allow us to maintain the current levels of support in terms of per capita aid and to maintain the Cohesion Fund. Together, these elements will help us to speed up the structural recovery of the less prosperous countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that our structural policy lacks vital weight to overcome the regional imbalances in the short term. By the same token, however, there is no doubt that the European Union is continuing to preserve some extremely important solidarity mechanisms. Perhaps, against this backdrop of budgetary rigour, we can see the importance of the requirement set out in the Treaty that all Community policies – not only structural policies – must be considered from the perspective of economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that in a situation where the debate on net balances determines the solutions, it is somewhat utopian to demand that all Community policies should be aimed at achieving greater economic and social cohesion. But in the near future, when we tackle the question of enlargement, we will have to look at this idea in greater detail if we do not want to end up with an enlarged Europe with even greater regional disparities that put the entire system at risk.</p>

<p class="contents">Up until now, we have talked about how we are going to put our common house – the Union – in order. It is now time to look at enlargement. This report of mine which is now at second reading discusses the coordination of pre‐accession aid for enlargement. I feel that I should remind you briefly of the historical task and role of enlargement, not only in terms of Agenda 2000 but also for the European Union. The people of Central and Eastern Europe and of the Mediterranean, the majority of whom have only recently regained their freedom, want to take part in our common historic adventure.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning, Parliament has stated that, in its view, there should be a general process of negotiation involving inclusive criteria, without the creation of new barriers and new discriminations and with the possibility of a fairly competitive environment. In other words, we hoped that each and every one of these countries could make the collective effort to restore democracy, restructure their economies and learn to live in harmony with their neighbours that should enable them to participate fully in our future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have drawn up this report on behalf of Parliament and in close cooperation with my colleagues Mr Walter and Mr Sonneveld, and my aim has been to coordinate the aid and to also include Parliament"s criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, Mr President, that we have succeeded in a series of important objectives in this area. Firstly, the Commission itself mended its own ways: it amended its initial draft and even changed the title of the regulation as we had requested. Moreover, between the two readings, we held a series of meetings with the Council presidency which, in my view, were quite positive and enabled us to develop the criteria relating to the implementation of the PHARE programme, which is vitally important for organising and strengthening the institutions in these countries and including political criteria relating to democracy and strengthening civil society. In short, it is fundamental for helping to strengthen these societies. This is the first objective which, in my opinion, we have managed to modify and improve compared with the initial proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also made significant progress in other areas, such as respect for the existing comitology rules. We wanted to ensure that these rules were not changed by any underhand methods. Furthermore, we made progress in terms of Parliament"s participation, as there is now the possibility that we might be able to review this process every year. Overall, I feel that the solution is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, there are some issues that have yet to be resolved and I believe they should be mentioned. One of these, which relates to the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, is my belief – which did not receive the support of the House, but now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has entered into force it is assuming great importance – that we should look at this entire process as an overall strategy for the Union that should lead to joint measures. In my view, this would also allow us to integrate the policy that we need to develop in this area into our legal and constitutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another issue that should be mentioned, which it was not officially included but was incorporated in the procedures involving each of the countries. It relates to the importance we attach to social dialogue in relation to strengthening the system of production and industrial relations in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two other aspects of our approach that have yet to be resolved, although the Council confirms that they are being considered. One of these is the importance of restructuring the nuclear industry in most of the countries concerned. This is an extremely sensitive issue for most of the Union"s citizens. And the final aspect – which we hope will also be integrated in the future under the new Commission – relates to the behavioural criteria and the code of conduct that must follow. I hope that these two issues can be resolved as quickly as possible.</p>

In our first report we included a fundamental point concerning the conditions which the Commission proposed applicant countries should fulfill in order to qualify for EU farming subsidies. I am referring here to the condition that applicant countries must have drawn up a seven‐year rural development plan by 1 January 2000. The European Parliament amended this requirement, considering it much too demanding, and proposed a more practical procedure. The Council, however, decided to follow the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This point was repeatedly on the agenda at the subsequent trialogue meetings, and the Council presidency in particular expressed understanding for the European Parliament"s objections. Nevertheless, we did not succeed in convincing the Commission and Council that this condition would place an excessive administrative burden on the applicant countries. The Council was prepared, however, to abandon the date of 1 January, while maintaining the year 2000. As a result, the difference of opinion in principle with the European Parliament remained unchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament believes it is impossible for the applicant countries to develop a full seven‐year integrated rural development programme in a democratic manner within such a short space of time. The European Parliament raised the possibility of setting up a small group of experts on the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and the economic development problems facing the former Communist bloc countries, who would act in an advisory capacity in selecting measures and projects. At the same time work could continue on drawing up a rural development plan which would consequently be more realistic and of better quality.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, it was decided following the Berlin summit to set up a separate budget category for accession, Category 7, which will also cover the SAPARD support and under which stricter financial rules will apply for prefinancing and financial management and responsibility than would have been the case if Category 1, in other words agriculture, measures continued to apply as the Commission had proposed, or with Category 2, which would have applied if these countries had actually become members.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that a country in the pre‐accession phase must already meet very stringent administrative demands in order to benefit from the SAPARD pre‐accession support for agriculture. My conclusion is that all the EU bodies have the same desire to achieve successful accessions as soon as possible. But in my opinion the European Parliament has better grasped what the EU conditions mean in practice for political life in these countries. The other institutions are more focused on accountability and cost management. Time for further discussion is running out, however. This is why the European Parliament is today formally delivering its opinion, while at the same time expressing its concern at the demanding procedure.</p>

That will send out an important signal, both to the people of the Union and to the Central and Eastern European countries that are seeking EU membership. Europe is able to act!</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we can now take the definitive vote on Agenda 2000 is not just a matter of course. So I want to take this opportunity to specifically congratulate the presidencies of the Council and particularly the German Presidency of the Council on managing to establish a workable run‐up to the final spurt.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the structural pre‐accession instrument ISPA, the Commission, the Council and Parliament broadly followed the same track. Through constructive negotiations we have, in my view, achieved a successful overall result that sends out a clear signal of our solidarity with the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding is limited, especially when you look at the immense need for adjustment in the applicant countries. That makes it all the more right to concentrate ISPA on supporting projects in the environmental and transport sectors, which are central to economic development, and to interlink this aid closely with other forms of pre‐accession aid, in the framework also of PHARE.</p>
<p class="contents">But like the Structural Funds as a whole, and Parliament sees this as a key point, ISPA must make a lasting contribution to job creation. We also believe it is important that the recipient countries use this instrument as a means of becoming familiar with and learning to apply the rules and mechanisms of structural policy, which will make integration all the easier later on. So it is of the utmost importance for local and regional players to be involved wherever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also take this opportunity to say something about the EU"s future structural policy as a whole. We have no cause to jump for joy about the Structural Funds reform. However, we have found a workable compromise here that ensures that in future too we do more than just pay lip‐service to European solidarity. On the contrary! With the new Objectives 1, 2 and 3 and the Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, EQUAL and URBAN we now have powerful instruments at hand which allow us to make a major contribution to making the regions more competitive and creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">In concentrating on the most important aspects, it is of course inevitable that some regions will lose Objective 1 and 2 status in the medium term. So it is all the more important – and that too is a success achieved by Parliament – that we introduce generous transitional rules to ensure that the regions do not face an unreasonable and painful loss of support but have six years to adjust to the changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased and rather proud that the European Parliament managed through tough negotiations with the Commission and the Council to carry through a fourth Community initiative. It may be called URBAN but it is something more than the previous URBAN initiative, for in future it will also benefit smaller cities and urban neighbourhoods and will take a broader approach to social and economic regeneration.</p>
<p class="contents">That also largely covers what Parliament aimed to achieve with the fifth Community initiative which we demanded last year in plenary, which means that these possibilities can also be used. With this initiative we now have an important additional job‐creating instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity within the European Union and with the pre‐accession states, the concentrated use of resources, job creation, less bureaucracy and preparations for enlargement eastward have been the aims of the Structural Funds reform from the outset. We are now taking a decisive step forward. I thank all who have helped ensure this, whether in the Council or in the Commission – and quite particularly in the Commission – and who have given us such solid support over the past weeks, months and years. I thank them warmly. Europe may not be taking giant steps forward, but every step forward is a good step, and I think we are moving forward here.</p>

It is amending the regulation establishing the guarantee fund for external actions. Members will recall that this was in fact presented to the House and in November 1998 referred back to committee. As a result of it being referred back to committee we now have a situation in which we are today inviting the House to approve the Commission proposal in the form on which political agreement has already been reached in the Council. That political agreement was reached at the Vienna Summit and was annexed to the Vienna Summit decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, the amendments which have been put by Parliament, through its Committee on Budgets, to the original Commission proposal have been accepted. Our Amendment No 2 sought to oblige the Commission to review the parameters of the guarantee fund in its annual reports and now, following the political decision, the Commission must review the parameters of the guarantee fund at the time of each accession. Each one of our amendments of that type of technical nature has therefore been agreed and incorporated in the Vienna Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also decided to depart from the Commission's original proposal by increasing the target amount to 9 % instead of 8 %, as the Commission had proposed, for the ratio of the fund to the Community's total outstanding liabilities. The provisioning rate of the fund was thereby reduced to 9 % for each loan operation, down from the previous 14 %, but still higher than the rate of 6 % that the Commission itself had proposed. In total, we have a situation which I feel satisfies all the requirements of Parliament and on that basis I commend it to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the wider context, it is important to say today that despite all the misgivings there are about some of the details of the interinstitutional arrangement and the financial perspective, it is better to have something which is slightly inadequate in the view of some but is nevertheless agreed, than to go forward seeking perfection and actually get nothing. However there is a salutary lesson in this process for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament today has managed to gather less than 5 % of its Members. We have become a Parliament in which we merely deliver speeches to each other and there are precious few people here to listen. I really think this is a salutary lesson at the end of this Parliament, and the next Parliament has to take it seriously if it expects public opinion to take its debate seriously. This Parliament has got to start taking its debates seriously itself.</p>

That is not just because nine separate regulations have been turned into one clear regulation, which is good for transparency and certainly also has an impact on the management of resources, but because it represents the move to a new policy. Of course the picture painted by the Commission, of two strong pillars side by side, is a little over‐optimistic. One of the pillars is not as strong as the other yet, as you know, Commissioner Fischler; but there is still time. We must continue to seek, in future too, to make agricultural policy for rural areas a little more flexible, for the Member States and also for the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you of what Commissioner Fischler once said: this policy is so important because we always have to put the question: what will the brother and sister of a young farmer who takes over a farm do on the labour market? This is where it becomes quite clear what we will have to do for the rural areas in future. That is why we are still rather attached to our earlier demand that in future of course Parliament must have codecision power over the entire spectrum of the common agricultural policy. That is still lacking. As I said on another occasion this morning: it is a necessary part of perfecting parliamentary democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So you will understand why we agricultural politicians are strongly in favour of supporting the interinstitutional agreement. For if it becomes possible to include the accompanying measures, the expenditure on rural areas, under non‐compulsory expenditure – which obviously does not mean we do not feel obliged to spend it, but which would give Parliament more say over this increasingly important policy – you will understand our view. For the rest, it would have the advantage of allowing for transfers in the case of multiannual expenditure. We will have teething problems with this new policy in its early years. It would be a pity to lose money because of those teething troubles by not being able to transfer it.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall this is a good start. We have not grown a real tree yet, but this little sapling that we have planted together can – if the Commission and the Council nurture it just as carefully – grow into a strong and healthy tree to support rural development policy.</p>

<p class="contents">There are obviously a number of differences between the original proposal of Parliament"s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was adopted in January, and the outcome of the Berlin summit. This was bound to be the case. I do not believe anyone can ever be 100 % right in these complex negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">What we welcome is the fact that for the first time rural policy is a clear component of European agricultural policy, as Mr Görlach also said. We also believe it important – and this is also in line with my report – that the Berlin conclusions clearly state that Europe must pay more attention to European food quality, safety, environmental protection, animal welfare, and the rest. This must be developed further, and it must also be given emphasis at the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As many people have already said, it is also to be welcomed that rural expenditure and accompanying measures are non‐compulsory expenditure. As guarantee expenditure is fixed, I should like to ask Mr Fischler whether this means that money will be refunded to the Member States if there is a surplus for a particular year? There was some discussion in my committee about whether or not a reserve fund should be set up. There was no mention of this in Berlin, and I therefore assume that it cannot go through. Could he confirm whether my assumption is correct that the EUR 200 million and 0.03 % flexibility it includes applies to all categories including Category 1, in other words guarantee expenditure for agriculture?</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns accompanying measures and rural development, where different rules apply. If the money is not all used in one year my assumption is that it can be carried over to the next year. Would it be possible for the Commission to give a clear statement on how these funds can be used?</p>
<p class="contents">Little has been said about monitoring agricultural expenditure. In its January report Parliament paid particular attention to monitoring, combating fraud and that type of thing. Although this is not mentioned in the conclusions of the Berlin summit, I can assure you that Parliament will keep a very close eye on such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">One last question Commissioner Fischler: in our parliamentary resolution we also asked for the hectare subsidies, all income subsidies, to be paid before 31 October of each year. Is this possible?</p>

We had a Commission proposal seeking to establish social and environmental criteria for a sliding scale of premium payments. Little remains of those criteria. Parliament had made proposals that were more distinct; the Commission checked the figures and decided they could ensure that the premiums were distributed sensibly. Now none of that is left and I will tell you some of the results.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr Fischler, we have not reduced the over‐compensation from 1992. As in the past, 4 % of holdings will receive 40 % of the premiums, or 20 % of holdings 80 % of the premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">Second point: we have not fully offset the Agenda 2000 price reductions through the premium payments. For rationalised holdings, that means full price compensation. But smaller farms will suffer from this lower compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Third point: we are concerned here not with money in the sense of fairness or unfairness or envy but with the fact that the price pressure exerted by holdings that continue to draw on high premium payments through over‐compensation will hit the smaller farms and put their survival at risk. That takes me to the fourth point. The money that will now flow from Brussels and from the national treasuries into the large‐scale rationalised holdings will be used by them for further rationalisation and growth. In these farms, that means job cuts, but it also means jobs losses because of the further destruction of farms in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Five: we have sent out wrong signals in this respect, namely that we will continue to concentrate on intervention, in the Central and Eastern European states too, instead of educating them for the market, possibly also for the world market, Mr Fischler! Anyone who wants to produce for the world market is free to do so, but should not then receive public funding. Here again we did not take the bold step we should have taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Six: we have maintained the support for maize but not managed to obtain support for pasture land. So premiums are being paid for basic fodder production, which is already favoured by natural conditions, and the maintenance of pasture land that is so urgently needed for the ecological survival of entire regions is not eligible for any support or any premium.</p>
<p class="contents">Seven: in reallocating the funds which, in your view too, we are to do from the EAGGF Guarantee section into the second pillar, only a small amount of the funds that would have been available if we had applied the degressive scale have gone to this second pillar. The 14 billion that were earmarked for the second pillar in Berlin are not in the funding proposal either.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, this is a negative assessment, as it must also be for the Commission, for otherwise you would retrospectively have to revise all the documents you have written to justify Agenda 2000. Basically all I have done is quote from them.</p>

<p class="contents">As rapporteur for this issue, I must point out that in its initial proposal, the Commission had favoured a reform based on a substantial reduction in prices with the aim of increasing our share of the export market in the context of the restrictions imposed by the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, Parliament supported the proposal in my report: it rejected the Commission"s recommendation and voted in favour of limiting the reduction in prices to 15 % rather than the 30 % advocated by the Commission. The Council of Ministers finally opted for a reduction of 20 % in three stages.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission had also recommended granting livestock farmers partial financial compensation for this new reduction in prices. Contrary to my recommendations, Parliament did not vote in favour of a substantial increase in the premiums for herds of suckler cows, which actually have a positive effect on our land. But the Council has done so and it is duly noted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the management of the market, Parliament voted to maintain public intervention and increase controls over production. This was contrary to the Commission"s wishes, since it proposed to balance the markets through the reduction in production prices and the introduction of private storage in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council agreed with the Commission"s reasoning but it retained the concept of ad hoc public intervention where necessary and the plan to introduce a ‘security net" of EUR 1 560 per tonne. It is on this point that I am proposing that Parliament vote in favour of an additional amendment to my report which has the support of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the Council"s position on market intervention needs to be clarified because, on the one hand, it accepts the option of private storage, yet on the other, it is in favour of maintaining ad hoc public intervention. What exactly does this mean? I do not actually believe in the virtues of private storage for managing production with a structural surplus. For proof of this, we need look no further than the results this system has produced in the pigmeat sector. Furthermore, since I believe that it is equally vital to reach a compromise with the Council and the Commission, I simply proposed a compromise amendment to Parliament"s Committee on Agriculture – which it accepted – that involved strengthening the ‘security net" by increasing it from EUR 1 560 per tonne to EUR 2 000 per tonne.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, we could continue along the same lines as our vote in Parliament in January and, at the same time, ensure greater security for our livestock farmers, that is, if the Council and the Commission have the good sense to support us.</p>

You know that. With the introduction of rural development measures and the strengthening of the accompanying measures that have existed since the 1992 reform, we have taken a further step towards a global agricultural policy for rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view the following aspects of this agricultural reform give rise to considerable doubts. The European agricultural model sketched out at the Cork conference has only been implemented in fragmentary form. While the measures relating to market organisations, price reductions and so forth are to be applied on a strictly central basis, the implementation of most rural development measures will be left to the discretion of the Member States. Or if you like, it will be a purely political decision. Why? The rural development measures are financed as non‐compulsory expenditure under Category 1. The ceiling of EUR 4.3 billion a year can be regarded on the one hand as safeguarding rural development appropriations but on the other hand there is the risk that because the Member States would have to cofinance these measures they will not apply them or will do so only to a limited extent. Here I am thinking, for instance, of measure 2078, concerning environmentally compatible farming.</p>
<p class="contents">The direct compensation payments intended to offset the price reductions are not sufficient to make up for income losses. The additional expenditure for rural development measures is discretionary in terms of amount and use and is no substitute for the loss of purchasing power resulting from the price reductions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was requested to submit an interim report on most of the market organisation regulations in the year 2002. We will see how things turn out. We greet the postponement of the reduction in milk prices to the year 2005, primarily for reasons of economy, with a certain joy. But it will not be nearly enough and we will still have a quota up to the year 2008. That is something that we can in fact live with quite easily and which at least enables us to offer our farmers some security, production security, in this area. I believe that in addition to optional set‐aside, that is the key result we in Parliament have managed to achieve.</p>

I would like to express my support for his report, and particularly the proposal that aid to the sunflower sector be staggered in line with the amendment approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">We have today come to the end of our debate on the Agenda 2000 agricultural reform, a reform which, in my view, has partially lost its common European focus and been distorted by the plans of various Member States. I would even go so far as to say that, in handling these proposed reforms, the European Commission – which is the driving force for action in the European Union – has given the impression that it was not very sure where it was heading.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with some initial radical proposals aimed at encouraging European agriculture to give greater consideration to market indications and international references, it was finally agreed that the terms involved should be clarified and even that some of the sectors to be reformed should be excluded, such as the milk products sector. Its reform is being postponed until 2005 and there is no doubt that in the meantime the imbalances it suffers will become more marked.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the initial proposals to strengthen the link between agriculture and the environment in order to put an end to certain problems that have emerged, such as soil and water deterioration, attacks on biodiversity and so on, the Commission is proposing in the horizontal regulation that it should be the Member States who define the compulsory and general environmental standards and determine the penalties to be applied, thereby avoiding any Community focus.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the criteria for shaping an agricultural policy that focuses more on the structural nature of certain problems through a rural development policy that is capable of resolving some of the problems facing the countryside – the need for diversification, the need to provide the people with new opportunities and the need to prevent the constant depopulation – a minimal rural development policy has instead been chosen that lacks any real weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with a situation where the agricultural policy must also respond to the principles of economic and social cohesion and correct certain excesses, such as the concentration of aid in the hands of a few, the Commission"s response is to say that the Member States will be responsible for reducing imports, thereby rejecting an essential Community focus and the inclusion of general principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you recently stated in Madrid that we might have to start talking about a new reform in 2003. I think that this message is dangerous for two reasons. Firstly, coming from the lips of the very author of the reform, it highlights the fact that the current measures will not be effective enough, and this is even before we apply them. Secondly, it is impossible for European farmers and stockbreeders to continue to work and plan their future without even a basic stable framework. We cannot add uncertainties resulting from political decisions to the uncertainties that already exist because of the climate.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the agreement may satisfy one or more of the Member States, but I do not believe that it rises to the challenges set out in Agenda 2000, including even that of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">And to those of my fellow countrymen who are enthusiastic about what has been decided, I would simply suggest that they should do their sums not only in absolute but also in relative terms.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR COT<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martin, Philippe </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the common organisation of the market in wine is undoubtedly the most complex of all the COMs. Apart from the aspects involved in regulating the vineyards and the conditions for producing grapes, we also need to take account of all the rules on oenological practices, that is, the processing of wine, as well as the rules on labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">Wine‐growing in Europe is indeed very specific. Every region has its own characteristics. Every vineyard is different in terms of its product and its quality. This clearly demonstrates that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product and that it must be treated as such. The land is also different and this diversity must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">My report focused on this aspect. That is what those involved in the industry wanted and it is what we voted for. I am pleased that, after several meetings and discussions, our proposals now reflect the Council"s position on many different aspects. At a structural level, the principle of the right of expansion has been accepted. Vineyards with a developing market will be able to obtain additional planting rights and the duration of these planting rights has been extended so as to allow for the rest period needed by the land between plantings. Moreover, structural measures have been introduced to support the renewal of vineyards, and we have managed to obtain support for this aspect. Few changes have been made in relation to the producer organisations, apart from an agreement allowing us to do away with the measures on the extension of their powers and to preserve, for their members alone, the tasks they are entrusted with. In terms of the recognition of interbranch organisations, these organisations have been granted a specific legal status in Community law in order to prevent them from being challenged by non‐producing Member States. As regards oenological practices, the preservation of traditional methods has been recognised, while as regards labelling, a direct labelling system has been adopted. Finally, Parliament was satisfied with the measures approved by the Council in relation to musts imported from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, the Council"s compromise very closely reflects Parliament"s proposals and we welcome that. However, it is not completely perfect. Some new decisions by the Council are of great concern and, in my view, are inadmissible, particularly the desire to include in the wine‐growing zone new Member States that are not traditionally wine‐producing nations, that is, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden. If this decision were implemented, it would undermine the content of our compromise and the spirit in which we reached agreement, that is, in the belief that our European wines were recognised as agricultural rather than industrial products, grown in traditional regions and produced using traditional methods. This decision would go against that spirit since we might eventually see in these new wine‐producing countries a shift towards using grape musts from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in order to stave off this threat, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of an amendment that excludes the possibility of extending the wine‐growing zone to include any Member State other than those set out in the amendment. Finally, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believe that it is vital to establish an action and information programme to make consumers aware, in particular, of the positive effects of vine products on their health. As a result, we are tabling an amendment to this end, which I will refer to as ‘vine products and health". Do not forget, Commissioner, that wine‐growing plays an important role in Europe, it costs very little and it has a high return.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Colom i Naval </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the aim of my report is to provide the European Union with the financial and budgetary framework it needs to enable it to meet the challenges of the next few years. This is the question we considered and I will admit that there is no easy answer to it; note the use of present tense here.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been thinking about and working on this for a long time: the Committee on Budgets spent many hours debating, 22 working documents were discussed and a resolution was drawn up, which was approved by the House a few months ago. I would like to take this opportunity to mention the excellent work of the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, which was always available to help me, and to thank my colleagues for their contributions and their patience.</p>
<p class="contents">I was involved in establishing the method for the financial perspective at the time of the 1987‐1988 budgetary crisis, which led to the so‐called ‘Delors I package". I was also Parliament"s rapporteur for the 1993 Agreement. As a result, I am very aware of the difference between dealing with a budget with a financial perspective and without a financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Interinstitutional Agreements and their financial perspectives have represented an important step forward for the Community. They have enabled us to develop the European budget in a calm and organised fashion and to fulfill a broad range of political objectives. For example, we have been able to control the unchecked increase in agricultural expenditure, consolidate and develop the cohesion policy, which is essential for economic convergence and political solidarity, integrate events such as the reunification of Germany into the Community budget, and make progress in reducing the Council"s powers in the area of compulsory expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, faced with the challenges of the launch of the euro, enlargement to include the CEECs, and the essential reforms of the CAP and the structural policies, I recommended at the time that we should try to conclude a new interinstitutional agreement, even if it was against a backdrop of even greater austerity, if possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would remind you that between 1988 and 1999, we approved and implemented Community budgets totalling just under EUR 110 000 million below the own resources ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the restrictive financial perspective proposed by the now caretaker Commission, Parliament"s offer was clear and logical: flexibility and political progress. This was summed up in the resolution we approved in Brussels on 4 December 1997. To achieve this, we stepped up our contacts with the Commission and the Council, organised more tripartite talks and even held an informal seminar in Vienna with the presidency and the Commission to look at the issue of flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We also decided in December that we wanted to withdraw the so‐called ‘strategic amendments" to the 1999 budget, and just before the Berlin European Council, our chairman, Mr Samland, sent a letter to the 15 Finance Ministers informing them of the figures the European Parliament considered to be the absolute minimum requirements, the so‐called ‘<span class="italic">minima minimorum</span> ".</p>
<p class="contents">The results can be presented in many ways, Mr President‐in‐Office. In its resolution of 14 April, the European Parliament did not share the idyllic version set out by the Council this morning. Any expectations we had of cuts were surpassed in Berlin. Agricultural spending was frozen, the structural policy was cut by 20 %, and internal policies were cut by 54 %, if we exclude the framework programme for research. We were then given a mandate to negotiate. We did not touch the figures for Categories 1 and 2 as we took over those from the committees responsible for the relevant legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it was stated that the agreements reached in Berlin could not be changed, we have managed to obtain a further EUR 1 480 million for Category 3, which would remain – so to speak – at the 1999 level in terms of constant prices, and a further EUR 1.1 billion for administrative expenditure. The allocations for the flexibility instrument agreed on in Berlin have increased sevenfold.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as political progress is concerned, I would like to mention some of the more important and innovative advances. A series of preexisting detailed agreements were consolidated. A permanent solution is being proposed for the dispute over the classification of compulsory and non‐compulsory expenditure, which goes back to 1982. Moreover, part of the CAP expenditure is being transferred to non‐compulsory expenditure. Perhaps the final say still rests with the Council, which approves the regulations, but this is an extremely symbolic step and it opens a door to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a brief summary of the basic points that convinced the Committee on Budgets to change its mind on Monday night about rejecting the Interinstitutional Agreement and to call on the House to accept it along with the corresponding financial perspective. And this is also the position of the Socialist Group, which I am now representing, as I have changed hats.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have noticed that my three minutes" speaking time as rapporteur has run out. Up until now, I have fulfilled my institutional role. Now, if you will allow me, I should like to briefly set out my own personal view. I would like to thank my group, and particularly my colleague Mr Samland, who has allowed me to use his speaking time in the knowledge that I am going to speak against the majority position.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, each of our governments went to Berlin to see what was in it for them, and very few, if any, looked to see what was in it for Europe. As far as I am concerned, that was a step backwards for European integration. I would like to know what Mr Prodi honestly thinks of all this. Does he believe that he will be able to do what he announced yesterday in this very House with these appropriations? The Council told us this morning, for example, about a possible method for combating unemployment, yet it is cutting the budgetary framework for such measures. I want an agreement, but not just any agreement. And as far as I can see, this agreement would be of less use to us than the strict application of Article 272 of the Treaty. Moreover, when push comes to shove any flexibility we achieve is made rigid and open to criticism by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Between the 1.27 % – which we criticised in December 1997 – and the 0.97 % agreed in Berlin, there was enough room for manoeuvre to reach an agreement which would have been rigorous yet better for Europe. I am prepared to accept a figure of 1.13 % if we add enlargement, although who knows when enlargement will take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that the two previous Interinstitutional Agreements entered into force five and seven months respectively after the budget period being planned. There are no funds in this package for essential policies. We are freezing Category 3. In Category 4, there is only a statement in case the crisis in Kosovo calls for a review of the financial perspective. And we are told that the Council would be prepared to accept such a review before the entry into force of the financial perspective it wants us to adopt today.</p>
<p class="contents">When Spain and Portugal joined the Community, Parliament raised the ceilings for budgetary increases that were established in the MRI. But now the applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe are being offered a pittance and told that, if they join, they will be treated with kid gloves.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about powers yet, in my view, we are only looking at things in terms of their face value. With this Interinstitutional Agreement, the Council would <span class="italic">de facto</span> approve the budget for seven years. Parliament has no political leeway. Therefore, since I am in favour of more Europe, although with the same budget – and I do not believe we can achieve it with any less – I cannot in all conscience recommend that the House approve this agreement.</p>

His report already includes budget amendments on technical assistance. However, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I must ask the House not to support Amendments 5, 53 and 54, which do not follow the principles of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to my second reading recommendation for Community financial aid in the field of trans‐European networks, this work is being carried out under the old Treaty and now recognises the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty. There have been many meetings and the Commission and Council have moved a long way to converge around the European Parliament's position. I would like to thank the Commission and the hard‐working German presidency of the Council for their cooperation in this codecision‐type procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets have supported the proposal to involve private capital in financing network projects and has raised the possibility of increasing this from 1 % to 2 %. We have supported Galileo, the proposed European global positioning technology, and we have supported the Committee on Transport in its wish to have 55 % of the funding ring‐fenced for railways and a maximum of 25 % for roads.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this report strengthens Community involvement in the construction of networks. The funding is a contribution to the projects. It will act as an economic multiplier and provide many jobs. Peripheral regions will benefit and business will have reduced costs in the global markets. However, the total amount has been in doubt. The figure in the first reading, which the House voted yesterday, was EUR 5.5 billion. Following Dresden, Berlin and intensive negotiations I am recommending that the figure be EUR 4.6 billion. Unfortunately, the Council is unable to rise as far as this. Its sticking‐point was EUR 4.5 billion, and it was starting from a very low base of 3.2. It was up to the Council to agree our figure or start the whole process of codecision once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to report to the House that the Council agreed to 4.6 billion at its meeting this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I commend this report and its 21 amendments to the House.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wulf‐Mathies, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission submitted its proposals on the reform of the Structural Funds in March 1998, there was some doubt as to whether a genuine reform could be achieved and whether the regulations could be adopted early enough to enable the new programmes to begin according to plan early in 2000. Today I most particularly thank the rapporteurs Mrs McCarthy, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Collins, Mr Walter, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Arias Cañete, in his capacity also as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy. I believe that together with Council we have managed actually to achieve what many people considered unlikely.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier on I set out the basic principles of the Structural Funds reform, so I will not bore you now with my specific position on each amendment, because according to my understanding of all your contributions to the discussion, you want to follow the procedure we agreed. Certainly you would have liked to see better results in one or other respect, as we would too, but it is our joint understanding that we have now gone as far as we could and really do want to transpose this into concrete legislative acts.</p>
<p class="contents">So I just want to go into a few very specific questions. On the subject of islands: I have noted during many of our discussions in this Chamber how many islanders belong to this Parliament, and I am indeed all in favour of that. But I think that islanders also agree with the broad majority of Parliament and the Commission that the principle of economic and social cohesion primarily applies to the poorest and structurally weakest regions, which is indeed why we want to allocate 70 % of all funding to these regions, regardless of whether their inhabitants live on the mainland or on an island.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are honest with each other we know that there is no point in making insularity as such a criterion for support, for as it says in the Treaty, structural aid is granted to compensate for the disadvantages of certain regions and social groups, and in their interests we should adhere to that principle. For if we do not, we will end up harming precisely those whom we all want to help most. Incidentally, the same applies to a number of other requests for Structural Funds aid. These funds are not a pot of money that people can freely dip into if they need more money for something; they are the means to a quite specific end, namely to promote the economic and social cohesion of this Union and to give practical application to the principle that solidarity is one of the vital foundations of the continued existence of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">And that is why we do not have a cultural fund as such either but finance cultural measures in exactly the same way as tourism measures if, firstly, they serve to create jobs and, secondly, they promote regional development; but we are not an institute of culture pure and simple. As for the transitional rules discussed here, or the fact that some assistance has to be phased out, we are not trying to be mean but are taking account of the fact that some regions have made progress and that we always care for the poorest first and cannot give further support to the rich, who will then slowly move closer to the average.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter brought up the famous list of favours again. I think it is important to note that in all this accounts for no more than 2 % of total funding and that one could say it has no influence at all on the structural decisions of the Funds. I also want to point out quite clearly that such important initiatives as the PEACE initiative also come under it.</p>
<p class="contents">To prevent any misunderstanding, let me say to Mr Arias Cañete in regard to the fisheries measures that there are some amendments that the Commission does not accept because they relate to measures that require a Council decision which we cannot simply anticipate at this point. Moreover, we want to see the measures relating to the fishing fleet reformed and do not agree with your proposals in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise I think it is clear that on the whole Parliament has been most successful. I thank you all for your very close and trusting cooperation. I forgot to thank the rapporteurs Mr Varela and Mrs Jöns so let me do so now. I am glad that with the new code of conduct, which adjusts past procedures to the new legal situation, this close cooperation will continue in future too and I hope that it will also be carried over to the new Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flynn, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> I would like to say a few words about the Social Fund. Here in particular Parliament has codecision, and your concerns are clearly evident in the new text. In fact Parliament's support for and contribution to the reform has been crucial. I would like particularly to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, for her excellent work here.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be proud of the results in four particular areas: the universal agreement on the overarching priority of employment and the Social Fund's mission to underpin the European employment strategy; secondly, the confirmation of the thematic structure of the funds regulation and the scope of the five policy fields, extending from active labour market policies, through social inclusion, lifelong learning and adaptability, to positive action for women; thirdly, we have maintained and strengthened the commitment to support non‐governmental organisations and the combating of social exclusion – we share the view that the regulation must oblige Member States to provide for small grants with special access arrangements for non‐governmental organisations and local partnerships: fourthly, again with the support of Parliament, we have strengthened the equal opportunities provisions and the mainstreaming principle of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's plenary session provides the opportunity for Parliament to influence the final shape of the regulation, now as co‐legislator. The Commission would be very happy to recommend the compromise amendments put forward by the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, covering: the addition of social integration into the labour market to Article 1, namely Amendment No 1; the new wording on the social economy third system in Article 2, namely Amendment No 8; the importance which both the Commission and Parliament feel needs to be attached to the principles of equal opportunity and adaptability, namely Amendment No 9; and the better arrangements that you are proposing for the operation of small grants with special access arrangements for non‐governmental organisations, namely Amendment No 10.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the mainstreaming amendment I agree that the principle is essential but it is already covered both in the general regulation and in Article 2 of the regulation itself. So given the problems which it might cause in the Council I would incline, as the rapporteur does, to agree, and to argue against acceptance. Once the structural funds regulations for the new period are in place the Social Fund will enjoy a new lease of life in view of the increased emphasis given to the employment dimension in all Community policies and in the Structural Funds in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We would all be proud of the ongoing success of the European employment strategy, which is the European Union's chief response to the need for more and better jobs. We have intentionally defined the scope of the fund to allow it to respond to developments in the economy and the labour market over the next seven years, always with a view to encouraging and enabling more people to participate actively in the labour market. To do this we must focus more strongly than ever on activation instruments which help people to become more employable, rather than passive policies. At the same time we should make every effort to strengthen the element of prevention to stop people becoming unemployed in the first place, a point very effectively made by the rapporteur. It is only through this flexible, forward‐looking and, above all, inclusive approach that Europe will be able to meet the economic and social challenges of the new millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Fund is the one Structural Fund directed exclusively at the individual person. It is about enabling individuals to progress into the new millennium; about letting people themselves make that progress through training and education, by increasing their chances of getting a job, about helping them to move forward over time to a better job and to a better standard of living. This is why the Social Fund, acting alongside the employment strategy, is so important for the future of Europe. Employment still largely defines a person's standard of life and weighs heavily on their expectations of what they can contribute to society and what society can offer to them. Increasing people's chances of keeping their jobs, getting a job or a better job is what we can do with the support of the European Social Fund. I believe that as a result of the work that has taken place between the institutions and taking on the amendments that I mentioned earlier, we have made the text as good as it can be got at this time. I commend it to you and ask you to support it and to support the rapporteur in her proposals too.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischler, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has of course been a great deal of discussion about the Berlin decisions in the agriculture sector over the last few weeks. Very different views have also been expressed in today"s debate. Let me make my position clear. The reform certainly does not go quite as far as we had hoped, which gives rise to a degree of uncertainty as also of risk. But at the same time we should not underestimate what we have achieved. The Berlin agreement, following the Agriculture Council"s compromise, provides for a reduction of only 15 % in cereal prices and the approximation of oilseed aid to the reduced cereal aid, and provides that the reform of the milk sector will not begin until the year 2000. Nevertheless this remains without doubt the most far‐reaching reform the Union has ever undertaken in the agriculture sector.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more true in that even in the run‐up to it the tobacco and olive oil sector were also reformed. But above all there is one thing we should not forget, namely that the Heads of State and Government decided these reforms unanimously and that the direction agricultural policy was to follow in the coming years was therefore determined unanimously. That gives us a distinctly stronger position in the coming international discussions and negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly outline the main reasons for the reform and the central elements of the overall agreement reached. In the cereal sector and the beef and veal sector in particular, the analyses carried out by the Commission showed that there is a serious risk of production surpluses increasing again soon after the year 2000. In view of that situation, in principle we were faced with the choice of two courses: either we could choose the increasingly rigid control of supply and make that the core of the common agricultural policy, or we could adjust our policy in such a way as to enable us to sell to new, additional markets.</p>
<p class="contents">It was decided in Berlin that in the longer term we want to choose the second course, which means we have to make European agriculture more competitive. We must also take greater account of justified consumer concerns. This stronger market orientation will be counterbalanced by higher direct payments and additional opportunities to open up new income sources within and outside farming. In Berlin we also made significant progress towards sustainable agriculture by managing to incorporate environmental concerns more firmly than before in market policy and rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Agenda decisions created a second pillar of the common agricultural policy. It is true that this second pillar is still a little less solid than the first. But we have laid the foundation stone for it and in principle that pillar now exists. In future we shall probably have to consider how to consolidate it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the budget, we will in future have two sub‐ceilings for agricultural expenditure. This subdivision into compulsory expenditure and non‐compulsory expenditure was decided in Berlin and confirmed here in Parliament. It means we now have one upper limit for traditional guarantee expenditure and a second upper limit for rural development. That will of course make everything rather more rigid, and also to some extent less flexible. I can understand why Parliament insists on this aspect, in its capacity as budgetary authority, and I hope that budgetary discipline does not mean inflexibility. For that would tend to weaken this second pillar, the more innovative part of the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the reform that was agreed in Berlin represents an important step forward. Yet certain risks and imponderables remain. In particular, nobody can tell today whether the lower price guarantee reductions agreed in the final compromise will be enough to really achieve market balance. In the preparations for the new WTO negotiations and the enlargement negotiations we will have to take due account of these constraints, as we will do when we implement the organisation of the market in coming years. But there are certainly also some grounds for confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">We will enter into the WTO negotiations with very clear ideas about the kind of agriculture we want in Europe: a competitive and sustainable agriculture that supplies the consumer with high‐quality products. And that is also the agricultural model that we want to offer our partners in Eastern Europe, together with the new, second CAP pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with a few comments on the amendments. First, I do agree that we should strengthen rural development policy, but to strengthen the measures for the disadvantaged regions without increasing the funding would mean having to divert these funds from other rural development measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the Commission"s view intervention buying at higher prices in the beef and veal sector would lead to new, unmarketable surpluses and exert considerable pressure on the budget, as also on our market prices. If the cuts in oilseed payments were extended over a four‐year period that would postpone the lifting of the Blair House restrictions by another year and also require more budget funds that are not covered.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Mulder"s question about transferability: I too think we should discuss this matter further. I consider it most important that, over and above the time span, we manage to develop enough flexibility in relation to that part of rural development to make it possible actually to use the available resources. As for the payment deadline of 31 October, I am prepared to give further consideration to this question, though with the reservation that this must not lead to any shift in the financial year for compulsory expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf I would point out that the new agricultural policy certainly will bring about a shift in this 80: 20 ratio and that under the reform the smaller farmers will in fact have distinctly greater opportunities than they used to. For the rest I would also point out that the Commission never proposed aiming at full price equalisation. We never spoke of anything more than income equalisation, which does not automatically mean the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me give warm thanks to all the rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation. My special thanks today go to the long‐standing chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Colino Salamanca.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">This is the last debate on the future of the common agricultural policy in which you will be taking part in this House. I thank you on behalf of the Commission, but also very much on my own behalf, for the important work you have done for the benefit of European agriculture. I also wish you all the best for the future!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> The financial perspectives for 2000‐2006 and the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and improving the budgetary procedure are an integral part of the package of Agenda 2000. I understand from the reports and intervention of Mr Colom i Naval that there are different views in the European Parliament on this item.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me for that reason point out some of the principal reasons why the Commission supports the agreement. It is true that the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin with regard to the financial perspectives for 2000‐2006 remain below the Commission proposal. But the subsequent negotiations, under pressure from the European Parliament delegation, achieved substantial improvements. For internal policies the proposal in front of you exceeds the conclusions of Berlin by EUR 1.5 billion. These will permit the financing of the multiannual priority programmes, for example, trans‐European networks. And it safeguards a significant margin for new policy initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">For external actions there is a clear commitment from the Council to finance additional needs arising from the situation in the Balkans, if necessary, by means of a revision of the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to administrative expenditure, the agreement would permit the financing of some 1000 new posts for the Community institutions and also finance the new Statute of the Members of the European Parliament, even though a solution on that issue is not yet clear as you know.</p>
<p class="contents">The new interinstitutional agreement also marks significant progress on key questions of the budget procedure. The agreement clarifies the classification of expenditure which defines the budgetary powers of Council and Parliament. This removes a perpetual source of conflict. In the process, Parliament has widened its budgetary powers in the field of agriculture expenditure. Furthermore, the agreement provides for full cooperation between both branches of the budgetary authority on all parts of the budget, which Parliament has long fought for.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, without the agreement these procedural gains would be lost. There would be a high risk of an annual budget confrontation. This would not be in the interests of the Union and its policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I want to reply to Lord Tomlinson on his report. Firstly, the Commission is pleased with the agreement by the Council because that takes into account the major part of the preoccupations of the European Parliament. On the amendments proposed in Lord Tomlinson's report, the Commission is ready to accept Amendments 1 and 2. As far as Amendments 3 and 4 are concerned, the Commission has accepted a joint declaration in the regulation according to which the Commission will give all oral information to the Council and Parliament on the economic situation of the beneficiary countries which are receiving loans and on the risks which I have explained when the annual report is presented. For that reason the Commission does not find it necessary to introduce these Amendments 3 and 4 into the regulation of the Guarantee Fund.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> I should like to begin by welcoming the agreement between the Council and Parliament on the trans‐European networks financial regulation. This vital component of the Agenda 2000 package has the twin distinctions of being the first legal text arising from Agenda 2000 that achieved a common position in the Council and yet the last to be agreed by the Council and the European Parliament. It also is one of the first legal acts to be adopted under the codecision procedure set down in the Amsterdam Treaty. I hope that the amicable and productive precedent shown here will be followed on many other occasions. It may be that I am displaying an excess of optimism in my old age!</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the credit for achieving the agreement goes to the rapporteur, Mr Kellett‐Bowman, whom I am glad to see in the House. He has shown a real understanding of the financing requirements of the trans‐European networks and a determination to put in place a stable long‐term framework for the financing of major TENs projects. His colleagues like Mr Samland and others – whom I am also glad to see in the House – have helped produce a very productive and effective package.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the most important issue is the overall financial envelope of EUR 4.6 bn over the 2000‐2006 period. That sum is more modest than the Commission's opening bid. But I am glad to say that it represents a real increase of around 10 % and is fully consistent with the lower ceiling for internal policies that was agreed at the Berlin Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the useful increase in funding, the new financial regulation is a major step forward as an appropriate instrument for providing long‐term finance for long‐term projects because it includes multiannual programming, which means that project promoters will be able to plan with unprecedented certainty about the finance they can expect from the trans‐European networks budget. That is particularly important for the development and encouragement of public/private partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Other important elements of the revised regulation include, first, a truly new facility for the investment of TENs money in risk capital funds with the aim of gaining access to the potentially very large resources of long‐term funding available from insurance companies and pension funds for the financing of public infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the regulation provides for the possibility of financing up to 20 % of the Galileo satellite navigation project – around EUR 500 m – and doing so from the TENs budget. That component is essential in order to demonstrate that this vital project can be financed and also to ensure that it develops as a genuinely European project. I hope that any discussion of European Union finance for innovative TENs projects at the current European Council will confirm the importance of Galileo for European producers and for European users.</p>
<p class="contents">With the news today, from COREPER that the Council can accept the compromise reflected in the amendments before us today. I can also confirm full support from the Commission for Parliament's position. I therefore look forward to early adoption of the revised regulation in good time for the implementation of multiannual programming that will commence in the year 2000. I express gratitude – not just from the Commission but much more widely from the general public in the Community and from industry – for the foresight and the commitment demonstrated by Parliament on this issue.</p>

<p class="contents">We have perhaps come to the end of a long task which started with an own‐initiative report by the European Parliament on the European Social Fund. We must acknowledge the fact that the Commission has accepted the European Parliament"s position on objectives and priorities, as well as on procedures. Here I want to stress an important point: the close link between the European Social Fund priorities and the employment guidelines. The European Social Fund is certainly the basic Community instrument for applying the four pillars, especially employability, and the regulation we are discussing today is consistent with the objectives of social integration and non‐discrimination. Considering work as both an economic opportunity and a way of achieving one"s potential means more and better education lifelong. It means combatting material inequalities and the modern inequalities which affect an individual"s ability to plan his own future freely. All that makes the European Social Fund a fundamental instrument, and likewise makes it fundamentally important for the NGOs and the third sector to be involved right from the planning stage, principally through a policy of practical integration. That will certainly be the responsibility of the Member States, but it will also be up to the Commission to monitor and control it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by taking up a point already mentioned by Mrs Jöns: the Council"s unwillingness to become explicitly involved in gender mainstreaming, one of the four pillars of European employment strategy, is incomprehensible – and it is especially incomprehensible now the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into force, enshrining equal opportunities as a fundamental principle of the Union. I hope the Council will be willing to accept the amendments from the European Parliament to complete this journey in rapid time and to the satisfaction of all the European institutions.</p>

This is because I was the draftsman of the opinion on this for the Committee on External Economic Relations. Social promotion is naturally determined in the first instance by meeting the basic needs of our citizens and there is clearly much to do in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this must be achieved if we are to maintain the European social model we can be proud of. However, we must remember that this must be a realistic model where the improvement in working conditions reflects the improvement in productivity. This is where Agenda 2000 has to come in, by providing the resources which are essential for the continuation of this model together with the infrastructures cofinanced by the ERDF, the EAGGF Guidance Section or the Cohesion Fund. It must also provide training or reassign the workforce with the support of the Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current state of globalisation, it would be unacceptable to aim to compete with less‐developed countries by reducing wages or allowing a deterioration in working conditions in our continent. However, we also cannot accept a protectionist approach such as the strategy where we were digging our own grave and running away from our responsibilities towards the rest of the world, particularly the less‐developed areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In everyone"s interest, we must move towards a strategy of openness in which we and others clearly respect the rules of traditional trade. In this way, Europe surely has an important role to play through competition conditions which depend largely on the training of individuals.</p>

<p class="contents">This improved economic and social cohesion should bring with it the creation of jobs and thereby attack the European Union"s main problem: unemployment. In my view, Commissioner, an excellent and positive reform of the Structural Funds has been concluded, with projects aimed at concentration and simplification and with an effective partnership as a result of the contribution of regional and local authorities, which may lead to increased efficiency in the actual implementation of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also taken an important step with the reduction of Community initiatives, and you have been particularly keen to ensure that only the Community initiatives with a European dimension are accepted. A final decision by the Council, at the request of Parliament, has included a fourth Community initiative which will also have very specific advantages for certain sections of the European Union"s population, although it does not have the Community dimension that the other three initiatives have.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret that the Berlin European Council agreed to significantly reduce the funding to be allocated both to the Structural Funds and to the Cohesion Fund, but we understand that these will be implemented in a positive manner over the next seven years. We also need to take account of the fact that the Structural Funds are practically the last to apply to the 15 Member States, since the prospect of enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will change the regional action policies for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to thank the Commissioner for the efficient work she has done, which will ensure that the new regional policy for the 2000‐2007 period will always be linked to her because of the enormous importance of her contribution.</p>

Personally, I am not going to say yes to Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">My impression is that the agreement that has been reached is an agreement based not on the Union"s needs but on the negotiation of national interests. That is the only explanation for the fact that the Commission"s initial proposal was further diminished through the final agreement reached at the Berlin European Council, despite the fact that it already involved reducing the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund below their existing levels.</p>
<p class="contents">For those of us who believe in a federal Europe based on social and economic cohesion, a golden opportunity has been lost to increase equality between the various regions of Europe. Furthermore, if we are getting involved in this idea of defending territorial interests, as the Berlin European Council did, I would still not be able to vote in favour of Agenda 2000. I was elected by the people of a specific European region – the region of Aragon – and this agreement would put the people I represent at a serious disadvantage compared with their current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would point out that the agreement contains serious contradictions. To give you an example, Commissioner, one single problem – that of depopulation – is dealt with in three different ways in Agenda 2000. Firstly, the underpopulated regions of Northern Europe are granted Objective 1 status, that is, they have access to the main Structural Funds. Secondly, the Scottish Highlands are only granted special funding in the form of compensation. Finally – and this is the third way in which depopulation is tackled – other regions that suffer from the same problem, such as Aragon, are excluded from this aid altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">A single problem cannot be dealt with in three different ways if we want Europe"s structural policy to be consistent. As a result, I must say once again that I am not going to vote in favour of Agenda 2000.</p>
