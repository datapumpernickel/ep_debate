<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liese (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is at issue here is the transplantation of cells and tissues, a fast-growing branch of medicine. Although it will not cure all the things that people are currently promising it will, the transplantation of cells and tissues will, in future, be able to help many people who suffer from hitherto incurable illnesses. Even today, people can survive them by means of the transplantation of bone marrow, heart valves and skin, and the new biotechnological discipline of tissue engineering will certainly lead to new triumphs in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It does have its risks, though, such as, for example, the transmission of pathogens or the uncontrolled growth of cells, which can result in cancer, and the ethical problems associated with it must always, of course, be considered. We must make use of the opportunities presented by this technology, while limiting its risks. I believe that Parliament’s amendments to the Common Position, which are before you, make an important contribution in this regard. In the course of the past week, we have succeeded in coming to an agreement with the Italian Presidency of the Council on a whole range of amendments, which means that, what you will be voting on tomorrow at midday is a package of compromises to which the Council has already agreed with the permanent representatives, and if this House adopts it, we can avoid a conciliation procedure. I am grateful to all those who have helped to bring this agreement about, especially to the Italian Council Presidency, and most particularly to the Minister of Health, Professor Sirchia, who has personally committed himself to it. My thanks go also to the Commission’s staff and, of course, to my fellow-Members as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all else, Parliament aimed to prevent the donation of cells and tissues being commercialised, and, to a large extent, we have succeeded in achieving this important objective. In contrast to the vague wording proposed by the Council and the Commission, the agreement we now have makes provision for unambiguous rules. We draw a distinction between payment for the donation of cells and tissues, which is to be prohibited, and compensation for costs incurred by a donor, which is perfectly permissible. We want the compensation to be clearly defined and the Member States to shoulder their responsibility in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">It was at this point that great controversy erupted, with the Council and the Commission initially contending that Parliament’s demands lacked any basis in law. We were, however, able to persuade them both that a non-commercial approach was called for not only in terms of considerations of ethics, but also of health protection. It is quite simply unthinkable, for example, that one should offer a great deal of money for the donation of cells and tissues and only then ask the donor whether he is at any sort of medical risk. The possibility of medical risks being concealed is always a factor when large amounts of money are involved, and this presents dangers not only for the donor but also for the recipient.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also made it clear that there is to be no trading in cells and tissues as such, but that there is no objection to trading in medicines manufactured from them. As is made clear in one of the recitals, industry has an important part to play in this.</p>
<p class="contents">This House takes the view that a ban on commercialisation is an absolute necessity, being something that is not merely included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also a requirement on which Parliament has insisted on repeated occasions, both within Europe and outside it. Let me take this opportunity to mention a visit to this House on Wednesday by a Ukrainian woman who campaigns for human rights, who will, on that occasion, be describing instances in which new-born children are taken away from their parents, the suspected purpose of this being the transplantation of their organs or tissues. Even outside Europe, I believe, we have to keep a watchful eye on this.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, this House also called for a comprehensive ban on the cloning of human beings, which we have not been able to persuade the Council to accept. The Council of Ministers firmly refused to accept this amendment, and, in the negotiations, I no longer insisted on it in order to avoid the need for a conciliation procedure. This does not, however, mean that Parliament has changed its opinion about this. I believe this to be another area in which safety considerations demand that we be very careful, and we will continue to keep a watchful eye on this in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, we have also managed to bring about a whole range of further improvements, with better-framed provisions on anonymity, reinforcement of Parliament’s rights in the event of the directive being amended, and a series of clarifications on, among other things, the import of cells and tissues. The cumulative effect of these small improvements in these areas is to clarify the Common Position and to make it more precise, and the non-commercialisation aspect has been greatly improved. I can therefore recommend that the Members of this House, tomorrow morning, vote to adopt the compromise amendments, which have been submitted by several groups and negotiated with the Council, and to do so in the interests of unambiguous regulation and an improved Common Position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, eight months have passed since I had the pleasure of addressing you on the Commission’s proposal for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells. Since that occasion in April 2003 there has been a considerable amount of effort, discussion and negotiation on the part of Parliament and the Council in order to arrive at the compromise before you today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware of the tremendous work that these institutions have undertaken with the Commission over the recent months. Let me specifically express my appreciation to the rapporteur and to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work on this important proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise package will ensure that the increasing number of patients in Europe who are treated with human tissues and cells can trust that these substances are not only safe but also of good quality. It constitutes another step forward in the regulatory framework on substances of human origin under Article 152 that we initiated a couple of years ago with the blood directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the main concerns of the European Parliament have been successfully addressed in the compromise – and that is very much down to your rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to some of the key concerns. I appreciate the difficult issues the Environment Committee had to address – in particular regarding ethics and other related issues. The Commission is willing to accept the compromise position that strikes a balance between Parliament’s wish to 'ensure' voluntary and unpaid donations, and the current proposal, which 'encourages' such donations. This amendment would introduce the wording 'endeavours to ensure' voluntary and unpaid donations and the idea of compensation in specific cases, leaving the responsibility of defining such compensation to the Member States themselves. I must, however, make it clear that this compromise solution goes to the very limit of what the Commission believes to be legally acceptable, given the restrictions of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Europe and the European Group on Ethics have stressed the principle of not-for-profit procurement of tissues and cells. The directive should therefore accord with this principle. However, I must draw a distinction between the act of procurement, to which the 'not-for-profit' principle should apply, and the secondary activities, such as the further processing, manipulation, testing, or the manufacturing of products, to which it should not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, whilst it might be considered unacceptable to take heart valves from a deceased donor and sell them, heart valves need to be treated to ensure the absence of infectious agents and preserved so that they can be stored for a longer period. These and other processes that have served to improve the quality and usefulness of the heart valve should not be constrained by the 'not-for-profit' principle. This point has been clarified in the compromise package.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments refer to prohibition of the use of 'cells derived from cloned embryos' for 'transplantation' – so-called 'therapeutic cloning'. Such applications remain highly controversial with no consistent opinion amongst the Member States as to either their ethical legitimacy or their safety. I would add that there is no likelihood of any such opinion emerging in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore consider it necessary to refrain from interference regarding decisions to be made by individual Member States on the use or non-use of any specific type of human cells or tissues.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the best solution is to set a Community framework on safety and quality requirements with sufficient scope to cover the use of such cells in those Member States where it is permitted. The compromise package reinforces the thrust of the Commission proposal in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Anonymity is another important issue. It is generally accepted that tissue and cell donation should respect the anonymity of both donors and recipients. This principle aims first to respect the confidentiality of the donor and the recipient, and second, to encourage altruistic donations.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position introduces the possibility for Member States to maintain or adopt different legislation in exceptional circumstances, such as the right of a child to know the genetic parents in case of the donation of gametes. I can accept further clarification of the rights of Member States to make exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on organs. While the quality and safety of organs is indeed important, priority at this stage should be given to addressing the serious shortages of organs and the prevention of organ trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to reflect on how it could best address the concerns of Parliament in this sensitive area. We need first to get the overall framework right before proposing specific solutions. To this end, the Commission is willing to present a declaration as follows: 'The important differences between organ transplantation and the use of other human substances such as blood, tissues and cells mean that a specific approach for organs in order to ensure safety and quality is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an approach in the current situation characterised by shortages of organs has to balance two factors: the need for organ transplantation, which is usually a matter of life and death, with the need to ensure high standards of quality and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that before considering any proposal it is necessary to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation regarding organ transplantation. The Commission will present a report on the conclusions of the analysis it undertakes as soon as possible.'</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I look forward to your endorsement of the orientation presented in the compromise package. I believe that if Parliament and the Council can endorse the amendments, so too can the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be very disappointed if we cannot reach agreement. Discussions on the 70 amendments would be very complicated, and I very much doubt whether we would arrive at a better solution than that offered by this compromise package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wanted to safeguard the voluntary and unpaid donation of cells and tissues and ban the trade in unmodified cells and tissues, while at the same time protecting industrial activity in this area. The Council wanted to abrogate Parliament’s position on non-payment, suggesting it was an ethical question outside the competence of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion it would be a big mistake to exclude ethical issues from EU decision-making, especially when we talk about a Community which likes to call itself a community of values. Besides, ethical issues rarely arise in isolation in some moral vacuum. They are ethical for the very reason that they have an effect on people’s health, for example, as in this case. Here we arrive at a key policy issue in which Parliament’s work, under the leadership of my colleague, Peter Liese, is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">A certain Italian film director – if in honour of Italy’s presidential term, coming to its end as it is, I may return once again in this House to the subject of Italian films – said that the way you define the angle of view is an ethical choice. Ethical issues cannot be passed over, because that in itself is an ethical choice. I, who had an education in philosophy, feel compelled to say this.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a responsibility for how the rest of the world imitates our practices. If we allow trade in human body parts we have to bear in mind that the developing countries will follow Europe’s example. This sort of commercialisation will lead to exploitation, and, moreover, to increased risk. The approach chosen by the Council also risks accusations of inconsistency. Several Member States of the European Union have signed a Convention on bioethics which categorically prohibits the financial exploitation of the human body and its parts.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur’s conclusion is well argued. The legal basis of the Directive is Article 152 of the Treaty on European Union, which deals with health matters, but all the ‘ethical issues’ addressed by Parliament are also linked to protecting the health of donors and recipients. Any donation made in dubious circumstances, for example in response to financial pressure, is also a danger for the recipient of cells and tissues. This view is also widely shared within the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason I can confirm that, although the Socialists did not sign the compromise package of amendments, we will support them as we favour most of them and do not wish to hinder bringing them into law.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need this legislation on the quality and safety of tissues and cells across Europe. This is a growing sector, with many new opportunities for the relief of pain and suffering and we do not want to stop anyone taking advantage of it. Many of the diseases and ailments from which people are currently suffering can be cured by various therapies that can be derived from this sector. It is important that, whilst human need is met, standards of health and safety and quality be maintained. Ethical standards on donation, confidentiality, freedom of choice and other issues of concern to individual Member States need to be respected and addressed. I am glad the Commission has recognised that in terms of the amendments it has accepted from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">New technologies, such as embryo stem cell research, cannot be ruled out as sources of future therapies for either medical or ethical reasons. We have gone as far as we can to satisfy those people with specific ethical concerns on those issues and with regard to other new technologies. We must recognise that our primary duty here today is to ensure the quality and safety of tissues and cells that are going to be used for the relief of human suffering, as they move around the single market to various destinations. That is our duty: to give the people of Europe common choice, common opportunities and common relief from many of the diseases and ailments from which they currently suffer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been said that it is a public health directive, as Commissioner Byrne mentioned just now. Furthermore, if it is true – and I am answering Mrs Korhola – that ethical principles are at the heart, and form the basis, of the majority of our decisions, then it is not for Europe to regulate and, even less so, to harmonise in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, concentrate on the amendments that, in practice, meet the needs of potential recipients. The report has made much progress along these lines, even in this House, thanks to the tireless work of Mr Liese whom I thank. Let us take note that the progress includes effective traceability at all times; the possibility of authorising, in exceptional circumstances, the lifting of anonymity for gamete donations – this was crucial for thousands of infertile couples waiting for the gift of life; and adding to the text an amendment, which I tabled, on information campaigns designed to raise living citizens’ awareness concerning the donation of tissue and cells.</p>
<p class="contents">To move on now to the controversial issue of voluntary and unpaid donation, the liberal group is satisfied with the compromise that was reached, a better compromise than the one reached for directive 100. The text specifies that the donation must be made of the donor’s free will without payment, with the exception of possible compensation, for which detailed rules are to be laid down by Member States on the basis of subsidiarity. All the same, I am sorry to see that amendments that explicitly encouraged the donation of umbilical cord blood and the registration of potential bone marrow donors were refused.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards organs, the Commission has been promising us a legislative initiative since this was first an issue, because this is a considerable problem taking various forms: organised trafficking, shortage etc. It does not, however – and this is understandable – want to act with great haste and it puts forward<span class="bold"> </span>the<span class="bold"> </span>statement discussed in detail by the Commissioner. So be it! Having said that, and on this issue of the difficulty of finding compatible organs, we could perhaps suggest the inclusion of a proposal, within the framework of this declaration, to encourage European cooperation through the Retransplant consortium. Currently, only six countries are involved in it and that is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I welcome the fact that, as regards this issue, which, as we can see, is complex and sensitive, the European law that we are in the process of drawing up in this House establishes first and foremost general principles and rules, which must be flexible and progressive in the interests of putting patients first. It was both important and vital not to close the door on genetic research, in particular for stem cells. We achieved this and, therefore, I recommend, on behalf of the liberal group, that we adopt, without modification, the overall compromise reached between Mr Liese, the shadow rapporteurs and the Italian Presidency. The objective sought with this text, and I would remind you of this, is to resolutely combat shortage and trafficking, and to promote solidarity and quality. This is the only message that Europe should send out to the hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for heart valve transplants, corneas, bone cells, donated sperm and oocyte, or simply for reparatory transplants for severe burns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On that occasion I mentioned three principles, which led me to reject many amendments. The first principle was that the draft directive had a scope that should not, above all, be extended, in particular so as not to reopen the debate on embryonic stem cell research, or even on voluntary abortion. The second principle: although, of course, there have to be strict ethical rules, there should not be any religious or sectarian bans of whatever origin. The third principle: the human body is not for sale, not to be bought and not to be stolen.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, the European Parliament broadly followed these principles when voting, thus leaving authors of amendments that could be described as reactionary in the objective sense of the word in the minority.</p>
<p class="contents">During the preparation for the second reading, the rapporteur, Mr Liese, true to his ideas and as pugnacious as ever, once again tried to extend the scope of the draft directive to reopen other debates and perhaps, one day, win the battle that he has regularly lost since the adoption of the sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development. I was therefore getting ready, this evening, for a new attack on behalf of a large majority of our fellow citizens, on behalf of many researchers, on behalf of public health and, above all, on behalf of the patients who are waiting for treatments and for transplants. Some amendments, which were, moreover, adopted in the committee, seemed to me in fact to be inappropriate, even dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that this evening – and perhaps this is a Christmas present – the rapporteur is tabling 21 more or less satisfactory compromise amendments. Fortunately they clarify some provisions of the text. They clearly set down principles to which we attach importance: that donations are made voluntarily and without payment, although compensation is possible; Member States guarantee these donations; respect for anonymity is confirmed, with the exception of what is stated in Articles 8 and 16 which leave the matter to Member States’ legislation on the basis of subsidiarity; traceability was officially sanctioned and validated.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the removal of two amendments: 35, which related to abortion, and 38, which did not distinguish between therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, on behalf of my group, I can support the 21 compromise amendments with the Council, accompanied moreover, by some assessments of their legality, which I heard from Commissioner Byrne, and I am glad that common sense largely prevailed. I too would, therefore, like to thank the rapporteur Mr Liese, since once is not the norm here, who undoubtedly played a very positive role in drafting these compromise amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow we will vote on a compromise package of 21 amendments. The fact that an agreement was struck between Parliament and the Council is, in no small measure, due to the unstinting efforts of the rapporteur, who made every effort to keep all the political groups on side and who vigorously defended the views of Parliament with the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position was totally unacceptable from Parliament's point of view. The Council gave scant regard to over 50 amendments adopted by this House in the first reading. The final deal before us this week is far more reflective of the reality of the Council and Parliament being equal legislators in this area. Through our perseverance Parliament has clearly improved on the original proposal. As far as ethical principles are concerned, I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary unpaid donations of cells and tissues.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased with the new wording in relation to the protection of the anonymity of the donor. The wording is now clearer in terms of many crucial aspects: the basic principle that human body parts, be they tissues or cells, must not be treated like some commercially tradable product.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards organs, Parliament has accepted that this directive is not the appropriate place in which to deal with organ transplants. Nevertheless, we look forward to a proposal from the Commission on the subject, which is of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the issue of cloning, I would have been happier with the original Amendment No 38, but there are sufficient safeguards included in this compromise. Member States have an explicit right to put stringent public health rules in place, including a total exclusion of cloned human material or human animal hybrids, as transplantable material. Apart from the clear health risks involved in transplanting cloned material when so much is unknown about the future consequences, I oppose the creation of human life as raw material for tissues and cells. I believe this to be a serious violation of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning and is committed to a universal ban on human cloning.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, my Group supports the compromise and tabled the full set of amendments involved. This is an important directive that will, I am sure, be a vital contribution to public health in the European Union by ensuring a high quality of tissues and cells for transplantation, while at the same time respecting fundamental ethical considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Important points, such as unpaid and voluntary donations, reference to fundamental ethical principles and the request for a directive applying also to organs, have been brushed off the table. This is why we have supported the re-submission of these amendments at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid a stalemate between Parliament and the Council, with a long conciliation procedure to follow, the rapporteur has pulled out all the stops to look for compromises, and, thanks to his considerable efforts, there is now a package of compromise amendments before us. Most of these compromises receive our support, even though not everything is exactly as we would like it, but that is one of the essential characteristics of a compromise. The compromise on unpaid donations causes us a dilemma. Amendment No 31, which clearly states that Member States shall ensure voluntary and unpaid donations, is being traded for a text which states that Member States shall take the necessary measures to encourage voluntary and unpaid donations. Paid or involuntary donations within the European Union should be rejected unequivocally. Quite apart from the fact that this should be considered unethical, it can also present risks to public health. The inclusion of the recital is merely a pretext.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, we will support the compromise package, but with precious little enthusiasm. The statement that Commissioner Byrne made a moment ago about a directive for organ transplantation only partly meets this House’s wishes as expressed at first reading. Nevertheless, I should like to thank him for this, because this has made it clear that this is an area to which priority should be given. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, we are both sincere in our views, opposing though they may be. As Mr Bowe said, this is a very good and much-needed proposal and I welcome it. I also welcome the way in which Mr Liese has been flexible - finally - about the amendments and we now have a chance of getting this legislation on to the statute book as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this issue of tissues and cells and how we deal with it has raised an interesting question about subsidiarity. One of the reasons why I have been so stirred up about all this is that I have been on the receiving end of a large number of letters from people in my own country who suffer from Parkinson's Disease, chronic heart disease or diabetes, or from their carers in the case of Alzheimer's Disease. People who suffer from these diseases have a life sentence: they do not die, they stay alive and their condition degenerates. They know it is degenerating and they know that research that might help them is being carried on, often involving stem cells. It is their only ray of hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me quote from a letter I received from a constituent in Cornwall. Mr Alan Cole from Liskeard suffers from Parkinson's Disease. He states: 'Rightly or wrongly, each day I listen to the TV or radio hoping to hear that a cure for Parkinson's Disease is on the way. I then become aware of stem cell research and how this might lead to a breakthrough for sufferers like me. A ray of hope - albeit a long way off - could be my miracle. I then discover that people are opposed to this type of research. Who are these people? They cannot possibly suffer with Parkinson's Disease or any other disability.'</p>
<p class="contents">Who are these people? Well, they are <span class="italic">us</span> here, sitting in the rather remote European Parliament. The decision of whether or not stem cell research should go forward and the kind of research which Mr Liese was dealing with in his report would be much better dealt with in the national context than in some rather remote European one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that one of the ironies of the situation is that those who suffer from Parkinson's Disease in countries which do not allow this research to be done with stem cells may well benefit from research being done in countries where it is allowed and may, in the end, be very grateful for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue that came up between us was the question of the payment of donors. There is a particular situation in the United Kingdom regarding the payment of donors. We need to have subsidiarity here so that some countries may go ahead and continue to pay them. We now have a compromise. Mr Blokland has rightly observed that it is a bit of a fudge. However, the text as agreed in Amendment No 69 is an acceptable compromise. That is the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that we have given the impression in this Parliament that we are against stem cell research. In fact we voted for stem cell research to be financed from the EU budget at the last part-session. That has now being reversed by the Council of Ministers. Let us show that in this debate we are very much in favour of a sensible proposal from the Commission on the safety of tissues and cells and we can all agree, including Mr Liese and myself, in wishing this proposal well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fact that tissues and cells help on a daily basis to restore health, which is why we need to lay down a specific European framework which will guarantee supply and sufficiency and, at the same time, safeguard the physical integrity of those who receive them, of the recipients. The demand for tissues and cells in Europe is far greater than the supply; thus the imports necessarily being made from third countries must respect the same legislative framework, because this is the only way to prevent the illegal trade.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the codes of conduct with which we are so preoccupied, everyone agrees that the new technologies must respect human dignity and the non-commercialisation of the human body. At the same time, human tissue and cell donations must be based on the free will of the donor, not the fee. The human body, as has been emphasised on numerous occasions, is inviolable and inalienable and must not therefore be turned into a source of financial gain.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise reached during negotiations satisfactorily covers the above principles. The addendum, whereby donors may receive compensation which is severely restricted to compensating the expenses and procedure connected with the donation, does not violate the principle of voluntary donation and allows the Member States to lay down the preconditions under which compensation may be granted. It is also a good thing that under this directive, as with blood, the data needed to ensure traceability at all stages are kept for at least thirty years after clinical use. Full and in-depth information for the donor, from a trained person, on the purpose, nature, consequences and risks involved in the donation is a necessary precondition to free consent. Protection of the donor's details and medical secrecy are, I think, satisfactorily protected by the corresponding points in the annex.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention that, even if the package of compromise amendments does not include other important points approved by the relevant committee of the European Union, I shall ultimately agree, considering that the priority is to get the present directive applied as quickly as possible. Of course we are waiting directly for the Commission proposal on the preconditions for organ transplants, as you yourself promised us Commissioner.</p>

It is good news for patients that we will soon have Community legislation on tissues and cells.</p>
<p class="contents">It also achieves an optimum solution for the updating of technical standards, maintaining all the political issues under the codecision procedure, while leaving the technical details for comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that many of you, including Dr Liese, are not entirely satisfied that the Commission has not offered to go further on the so-called ethical issues. This is not because we do not consider ethical standards to be important. Quite the contrary: it is precisely because ethical standards are so important to our citizens that we must not overstep the mark. I refer to what Mrs Jackson said in relation to subsidiarity, with which I agree.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty. We have to respect the advice of our Legal Service – advice echoed by the Legal Service of the Council. A satisfactory compromise is proposed today on voluntary and unpaid donation and the non-profit character of the procurement of tissues and cells as such, which reflects the goodwill on all sides. A series of amendments aims to limit the use of certain types of cells, such as cells derived from cloning or abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">With this proposal we seek neither to mandate nor to prohibit the use of specific types of cells. If, however, any particular use of such cells is authorised in a Member State, then the directive will apply, to require the application of all provisions necessary to protect public health. The quality and safety of organs is a major concern of the European Parliament. The Commission is acutely aware of the importance of this matter and we have taken concrete steps to address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission statement on organs proposed as part of this compromise is a real commitment to continue work in this area and to find the best approach to the current situation, which is characterised by a shortage of organs. As I have already said, any approach needs to balance two factors: the need for the transplantation of organs - which is usually a matter of life or death - and the need to ensure high standards of quality and safety of such organs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission statement is complemented by the Council statement that it intends to intensify efforts to combat organ trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am very pleased to be able to accept the compromise package on the table today.</p>
