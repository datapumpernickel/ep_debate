<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, of course I should not like to confine my comments to the work of the Conciliation Committee, because this would surely not go far enough. I think that we should also use this second reading once again to hold a general debate on education in the Europe of the future. At the end I will come back to the outcome of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of education in the Europe of the future is also the issue of the future of Europe itself. This is actually a fact which the members of the Council ought finally to take on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can only continue to grow together if the people of Europe accept this process and are prepared to play an active part in it. This is particularly important in the light of the enlargement of the EU towards which we are working. Our hopes are centred first and foremost on the young generation in our countries. They are the ones who will shape the future of Europe. That is why we need to win over young people to the European project. That is why we need to meet them, at least to some extent, where they already are in terms of their present knowledge and expectations. Many of them think in much more global terms and often have considerably more personal experience of being abroad than we had when we were young. But, of course, there are many others who lack this personal experience, who – like their parents – are frightened of this large Europe because they do not understand it, and who have never had the opportunity to spend time with people from other countries. This is why I believe that the European education policy is one of the key tasks within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As more aspects of European society become intertwined, communication and therefore mastering foreign languages will become increasingly important. Economic integration owing to the internal market makes mobility a key factor. Closer integration inevitably forces us to confront different views. The pluralism of cultures and world views means, however, that greater mutual understanding and thus more knowledge about others is required, which means that information needs to be exchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">Imparting all this knowledge and experience needs to start early on. That is how the first comprehensive European programme for cooperation in all spheres of education came about in 1995; it was called Socrates. Since then, I have been the rapporteur and am glad that this programme has been really extremely successful. Now we are launching the Socrates II programme for 2000 to 2007. This programme consists, firstly, of the opportunities offered to schools under Comenius, which encourages school classes from different countries throughout Europe to work together on projects. Its second part is Erasmus, which addresses student mobility, and then the third component – called Gruntvig – is adult education, an initiative which has finally led to progress being made in an area where action had been necessary in the European Union for some considerable time. Adult education became part of the Socrates I programme in 1995 by a circuitous route, through an amendment which I tabled. In the course of the year, this led to people throughout Europe developing a desire for adult education and lifelong learning and we believe that the response to this in the shape of the Gruntvig part of Socrates is the right response. I am proud that we have achieved this. It is precisely this incorporation of Gruntvig in the Socrates programme which actually shows how Europe works.</p>
<p class="contents">This was an idea which had always had a foothold in the northern countries – in Austria, in the Scandinavian countries, in Germany; in England too the concept of adult education has always existed – but in the southern countries it had not taken root to such an extent. In Europe we managed to establish this everywhere. I am proud of this. That is why I believe that here too, we have achieved something important precisely for the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the subject which concerns us all, namely the result of the Conciliation Committee's deliberations. In terms of content, we have achieved all that we set out to achieve. I should like very much to welcome the fact that the Council has agreed that when we award mobility grants we can at long last, consider the possibility of only giving them to those who really need them, so that those who might not otherwise be able to take part for financial reasons can perhaps also take part after all, because the money is made available to them in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the Council has agreed to step up support for learning our neighbours' languages. I very much regret that the Council was not in a position to join us in including the term "European educational area". They hummed and hawed as if this European educational area did not yet exist. It does exist, but in the end for the sake of keeping the peace we gave in, so that there will continue to be a European dimension in education.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the budget is concerned, Mr President – you were there, but I must repeat this – I am not happy. We wanted EUR 2.5 billion, which is the amount which we would have required for this major undertaking. Unfortunately, we only obtained EUR 1.85 billion, but with an assurance that a review clause would be incorporated after two years. I believe that we can be satisfied with this. I hope that this programme is just as successful as Socrates I.</p>

I do not, however, wish to congratulate the Council because I feel that there has been no response from the Council in terms of the generosity needed for future programmes. Therefore, I would like to congratulate the two main protagonists though because they have furthermore ensured that everything will function normally in January and the budgets are ready for the start of the meetings. </p>
<p class="contents">In this context however, I would like to say a few words which should be included in the Minutes rather than disappear into thin air. I would like to talk about a problem that I observed throughout the negotiation: that of the difficult, complex and rather vague concept of culture and education that most of the European Union’s institutions seem to hold. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall highlight some of the contradictions. Strangely, the educational and cultural programmes tend to be fully agreed on, to be voted for most enthusiastically by all parties, and yet, these are, nevertheless, the programmes that receive the worst treatment in budgetary terms. This is the first contradiction. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the cultural programmes, and specifically “Socrates”, are the ones that benefit the most people and, moreover, involve few intermediaries. “Socrates” directly reaches those who gain from it. We are not talking about lobbies here, but about people who are benefiting from something that is by no means a subsidy, but a life-long investment. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, this is a budget that accumulates and attracts broad cooperation from all countries. For the “Socrates” programme for example, the European Union only pays 10% in my country, Spain. The rest is made up by the institutions, the Spanish State and the families themselves. We can see then that there is an 80% increase in all educational programmes in general. What do I mean by this? Simply that we have wasted a great deal of money on education. If the Council had been more generous, many institutions and individuals would have put money on the table. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something else that I think is important: education cannot be guided by the principle of subsidiarity alone. Does the exchange of educational methods affect the principle of subsidiarity? Can getting to know another country, understanding it and experiencing it be considered an attack on the principle of subsidiarity? Countries will never be able to implement the Socrates programme on their own. This is a programme that transcends and surpasses the stature of individual nations. That is its greatness, its power and its strength, and that is why everyone believes in it to the extent that we can speak of thousands of good results. Above all though, there is one result that must never be forgotten: the capability for cohesion and unity that this programme gives us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe, however, that we have fully discharged our responsibilities here for the near future. Precisely the opposite is true. Now the countries, but also the European Union, are asked to implement this programme so that we can see, above all, how it develops over the next two to two and a half years and so that we can make adjustments to it and alter or reassess various aspects where it proves to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that it provides an opportunity for young people in Europe and that it is proof that Europe must not only be a Europe of figures and economics, but that education and culture actually form the foundation stone on the basis of which we understand each other and regions – as diverse as their cultures are – complement each other and are tolerant of any differences between them. In turn, this teaches us to show solidarity with people who are different, who are less well-off and who, above all, have a harder time of it than we do.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to call on all those who have the opportunity to take advantage of the Socrates programme, who are able to use educational opportunities, who are going to be able to continue their education in the future, who contribute to Europe growing together, also to recognise in the course of their education that we are setting a fast pace at the moment in our process of development and in all our programmes, that there are those who cannot match this pace, and that we should take them by the hand and take them with us because quality, standards and education also require us not to sideline those who are weaker than ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This well-known [Dutch] expression perfectly embodies the spirit of the Socrates programme. Europe is the future and in order to achieve this future, we need the young. They need to get to know each other and gain an understanding of each other’s cultures and how better can this be achieved than by studying together, having fun together and by learning each other’s languages. In this way, we can achieve more understanding and solidarity among the young within the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is important now but this will certainly be important in the future too, with a view to enlargement. I would therefore like to touch upon two additional aspects which have been highlighted in a conciliation. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I am delighted that we have finally managed to convince the Council of the fact that more funding should be made available for such an important and successful programme. This is mainly thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, who I could not praise enough for her commitment and tenacity, in particular, and also you, of course, Mrs Reding, for the intelligent and frank remarks you contributed. It was not easy to make the Council see that, in view of the pending enlargement, this programme will be used a great deal more. But governing is all about anticipation and this means that, if necessary, the programme should be able to be adapted sooner if more countries would like to take part in it. I would hate to exclude the young from candidate countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am pleased that the selection procedures for the projects too have been somewhat simplified, but there is more room for improvement. I hear many complaints about the fact that the application procedure is both complicated and lengthy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My personal thanks go in particular to Mrs Pack, who has been the driving force behind the fight for our cause in the Conciliation Committee. In Germany we have a proverb which says that you live and learn. I am glad that a few years ago this concept was enshrined in the policy: now we call it lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of education, whether it be quantitative or qualitative, general or subject-specific, is sufficiently well known to us all. We are also now laying the foundation stones for the future of Europe. In my opinion, Socrates is one of the most important building blocks. I only need to mention mobility and European educational policy. With your permission, I will draw your attention to one module which caters for cultural diversity: Action 4 or "Lingua". Here, I should like to place particular emphasis on less widely spoken and less widely taught languages. I call on the Council to take on this responsibility and not to confine its support for attractive policies of culture or lifelong learning to election campaigns, but to assume full responsibility for this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the whole of the European Parliament delegation which, with a lot of patience and determination, secured an increase in the financial provision of at least EUR 300 million. This is a valuable resource for our young people, who have great confidence in the educational and training potential of this programme. </p>
<p class="contents">I will take this opportunity though, to remind the House that whether or not Socrates will be completely successful depends largely on the publicity this programme will be given within the individual Member States and the speed of the selection process. Indeed, many European young people often complain of the difficulty of finding timely information on the programmes that concern them. More widespread information and less red tape will certainly ensure real equal opportunities and more democratic access to the programme. In this way, young people, above all, those least well-off and most disadvantaged will be able to consider Socrates as a chance for integration, for cultural enrichment and professional training, but above all, as a chance to have personal experiences and life experiences, in order to gain the flexibility and open-mindedness necessary to address, in the best way, employment challenges in the world of work: this is why SOCRATES is an important investment for the young people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all, 500 000 students have spent time studying in another Member State as part of their course. 110 000 young people have taken part in exchanges. Overall, 1 500 universities and over 10 000 schools throughout the European Union have participated in this programme over the last four years. Parliament and the Commission wanted to build on this success for the years 2000 to 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The younger generation should have the opportunity not only to continue being involved in Europe but to become more involved. Above all though, young people in the applicant countries should have the opportunity to take part in the new programme on an equal footing from the very beginning. It is certainly hard to understand why the Council – which extended such a warm invitation a few days ago in Helsinki – denied the young people of Europe the funding which we considered necessary in the Conciliation Committee. That is why my particular thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, and Commissioner Reding, who together with the Conciliation Committee have squeezed EUR 300 million out of the Council. I think that the Council can be sure that over the next few years the Commission and Parliament will continue to fight for young people in this way so as to obtain sufficient funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all agree that Socrates I has provided us with a vital building block in the lives of young Europeans. I have seen young people in areas of particular social exclusion in my own Member State, who did not know very much about the south-east of England, let alone the south-east of France or Spain, blossom and come forth in terms in confidence and educational capacity as a result of their interactions with other students from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the ability of the programme to spearhead the values of Parliament, it is a tremendous success. Socrates is vital to the expansion of the educational capacity of our young people, not only in terms of their cultural capacity but in terms of their economic foundation as well. We have seen that it is very much at the frontline when it comes to providing a future for a solid European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We will benefit from the experience of Socrates I and the new coherent and comprehensive approach that we will see in Socrates II. However, our job does not finish there. In the next few years we have a vital role to play in examining the financial framework and the framework with a view to the enlargement, because that is when we will see the strains on Socrates II and its ability to deal with a new enlarged European Union. We must provide for those incoming Member States the tremendous opportunities it is currently providing for our students. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Negotiating with the Council into the early hours of the morning is not always too exciting, but it was worth it this time. Throughout the process, Mrs Pack has done a lot of good work, and I want to take the opportunity to thank her, just as I want to thank Commissioner Reding for her collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">We have obtained a good Socrates programme containing some sensible initiatives which take account of the fact that the EU is on the brink of enlargement. As a Dane, I cannot help but comment, in particular, on the Grundtvig initiative. In Denmark, we have had a distinguished tradition of lifelong learning since the nineteenth century, and it is precisely the poet, priest and co-author of the Danish constitution, N.F.S. Grundtvig, who stands out as one of the founders of the entire folk high school movement in Denmark, a movement which helped educate ordinary people at a time when this was unusual. The Danish folk high schools also play an important role in offering education to people of all ages. It is good that we have got ourselves a scheme designed to give a boost to lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that, when we insisted to the bitter end in Parliament that the Directive should include a review clause, this was in order to ensure that the programme would also be able to function properly following any enlargement of the European Union. Mr President, all I can do is warmly recommend people to vote in favour of this report. In fact, I cannot imagine anyone voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I would have liked to have seen the Council move a lot closer to Parliament's figure of EUR 2,500 million. I nevertheless welcome the increase on the common position of EUR 300 million. This means that a total of EUR 1,850 million will be made available over the seven year period of the new programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like most of my colleagues, am an ardent supporter of the aims of the Socrates programme and have witnessed its benefits to education and to local communities. Education must always be a priority of spending programmes as it is the way in which we build the future. If we want the next generation to be enthusiastic European as well as national citizens we must be prepared to put our money where our mouth is and invest in high-quality education.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that the second phase of Socrates places such an emphasis upon promoting knowledge of EU languages. As a Member of Parliament representing the largest part of Ireland's Irish-speaking Gaeltacht region I am very pleased to see that this extends to the Irish language which is a Treaty language. I firmly believe that the granting of financial support for the teaching and learning of Irish and also Luxembourgish sends out the right signals that Parliament clearly and positively supports minority languages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is excellent that we can now adopt this programme, which is so important for the citizens of Europe. At the same time, I would like to draw attention to the flaws I observed in the handling of multiannual programmes to be approved by means of the codecision procedure. There was no official cooperation between the Special Committee and the Committee on Budgets with regard to the second reading and conciliation. This weakens Parliament’s negotiating position, as agreement on the demands of Parliament for the financial perspectives can be called into question.

We have managed to secure an additional EUR 300 million for Socrates. A further achievement is a review clause which means that in 2004 at the latest, the financial implications of the future accession of applicant countries will be reassessed, and that the Commission will have to submit a report. Thirdly, we have ensured that the procedure for selecting projects is simplified and shortened.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been said that we wanted more money because we believe that education and continuing education are particularly important for reducing unemployment, creating new jobs and making Europe more attractive to business in terms of its economy, labour market and social conditions, as well as for an effective internal market, a prerequisite for which is a European educational area. For us, the European Parliament, the creation of a European consciousness – a European identity – and respect for the diversity of cultures, languages, ideas and religions in a unified area are inextricably linked to a proactive educational policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, the Socrates programme is a means to add a European dimension to the education on offer in the many different kinds of schools, universities and adult education institutions. We believe that the mobility measures contained in the Socrates programme foster social skills, language skills and understanding for other cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme, though improved in the negotiations, also has weaknesses of course. One weakness is the low level of funding provided by the European Union, which means that the Member States have to make a significant contribution from national funds if they are to take part. Applicant countries may take part but often they lack the resources to do so. Other sources of criticism are the high administrative costs and the lengthy application and selection procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">We will make every effort to ensure that more and more young people are able to participate in the Socrates programme, because this programme is an investment in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, you heard me correctly. This was not my idea but the idea of Whitfield Primary School in Dundee, Scotland. These people came up with a "Soups in Europe" project, working with partner schools in Austria, Denmark, Italy and France. Their idea was that soup is a common food amongst people and that soup transcends boundaries. Through this project, which was directly related to the Scottish curriculum, they organised a parents' soup day and, with their other partners, produced a book with 25 soup recipes. Through soup and the support of Socrates the outcome of this project was more motivated pupils and staff, a greater awareness of their own environment as well as other places, and increased understanding of information communication technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the next Socrates programme produces more projects like that of Whitfield Primary School and maybe the next time you tuck into a bowl of soup, you will remember the educational value Socrates has across the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Mrs Pack explained so well in her speech, we have arrived at an agreement which is for all of us, as the Members of Parliament have said so clearly, a cornerstone in the construction of the citizens’ Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement between Parliament and the Council was reached following a difficult, and indeed, even arduous, conciliation procedure, but, problems aside, it can be said that a successful outcome was reached and that is what counts. In this respect, I am pleased to see the constructive spirit in which negotiations on this programme were held. We have come a very long way since the Commission presented its initial proposal in May 1998. I would like to express my thanks for all this work. First and foremost to your rapporteur, Mrs Pack, of course. The quality of her work is widely acknowledged, especially among those who have had seats in this Parliament for any length of time, and indeed this is not her first report on Socrates, which is her baby to some extent. She was actually the rapporteur in 1994 on the first Socrates programme, and also on the budget review in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no exaggeration to say that thanks to you, Mrs Pack, thanks to your own personal commitment, Community education policy has been able to make extraordinary progress over the last five years. I feel that it is not the Members of Parliament or the Commission who should be thanking you, but rather that the young people, the youth of Europe will thank you, and their thanks will be the greatest you can receive.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should also like to thank your fellow Member, Vice-President Imbeni, who headed the Parliament delegation during the conciliation process, and that was not always an easy assignment with discussions lasting until half past three in the morning. It was no picnic, but Mr Imbeni managed, in his own inimitable, elegant Italian style, to stop the project being scuppered, and for this I am grateful to him.</p>
<p class="contents">I would next like to tell the PPE-DE Group that my thanks go to the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mr Gargani, who contributed greatly to the positive outcome of the conciliation process. I should also like to thank Mrs Prets for the quality of her work as shadow rapporteur. I should finally like to address the Council Presidency, since my fellow Minister who was Council President had no easy task. She would have gone further herself, but unfortunately she was surrounded by ministers who did not wish to do so. So please express my thanks to her for her courage and commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the two action programmes – grouping together Socrates and Leonardo which was approved last April – constitute an integrated package of measures intended to promote lifelong training. These two programmes will be resourced by a total of EUR 3,000 million for the period 2000 to 2006. I prefer to group the two programmes together so as to increase the total appropriation somewhat. Our intentions have quite simply been frustrated: we would have liked to allocate more money to young people, but with reality, or <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> being what it is, we have still managed to obtain, as the Members of Parliament have stated so clearly, a perceptible advance.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental objective shared by both programmes is to contribute to the gradual construction of a Europe of knowledge, capable of enabling young people and adults to gain the qualifications and skills they need to enter the labour market and, just as importantly but something which is sometimes forgotten, to be integrated into society. A person with little training is not able to integrate himself into society, whatever his hidden or visible skills, and I think this is a loss not only for the labour market but also to society in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the two programmes form an integral part of the citizens’ Europe since they enable the young people of Europe to gain experiences which make Europe a practical proposition and which engender their confidence. Indeed, when one is in contact with schools, whether primary schools or universities, it can be seen that the European educational area is a reality, whatever some ministers say. There is thus no need to quibble about terms, since reality tells us that this European educational area already exists in practical everyday terms. And there is something I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen. This morning, I attended the opening of the academic year at the University of Turin. Well, I was impressed. Every year, 600 students from the University of Turin are enabled to travel. Since Socrates does not allocate sufficient funds, it is the University of Turin itself, even though it has scarcely adequate resources, Mr President, which subsidises their travel. All this is achieved because there are intelligent men and women who have quite simply understood that we shall not build the Europe of tomorrow without the contribution of young people who have had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with other cultures and other educational systems. As I said in Turin, a city which is built on two rivers crossed by many bridges, I see myself as a builder of bridges.</p>
<p class="contents">May I request your assistance so that together we may manage to build bridges between the educational systems of our various countries, as well as between these and the systems of other nations, so that many more students than in the past may cross these bridges and enter into the Europe of knowledge? Mr President, and this will be my final remark as I know that you are very quick to wield the gavel, it should not be forgotten that education is not the only issue involved. Culture is important as well. Culture requires knowledge, and knowledge of others means not being afraid. The lack of fear forms an extraordinary defence against exclusion, xenophobia, and the rejection of aliens. What we are involved in here is a truly European endeavour, perhaps the finest and greatest in terms of the success it may achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact, ladies and gentlemen, that we have not obtained all the money we wanted, is not, I feel, so important. The important thing is to replace the lack of money with intelligence and innovation, with fresh ideas. If you have ideas, please help me out and pass them on to me. We are going to endeavour to include new ideas in this new programme available to us and available to the youth of Europe, so that young people may become what we all would like to see: the Europeans of tomorrow.</p>
