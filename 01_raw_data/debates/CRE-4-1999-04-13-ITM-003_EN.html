<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Prodi, </span>  <span class="italic">nominee for President of the Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I decided personally to force the pace of Italian politics so as to participate from the outset in the building of European monetary union, I was conscious of my country's long‐standing commitment and contribution to the European venture during the previous decades. But I was even more conscious that solid links with Europe were the only means of guaranteeing every individual country and every individual citizen a future of peace and progress in the world of globalisation. For this reason, I staked on that objective all the political capital which I had so far accumulated. Today I am happy to be here before you, not only to assure you that I intend to apply the same determination to this new phase of the European venture, but also to assure you of my personal commitment and that of the future Commission to guiding Europe towards a great age of reform and change; I repeat, a great age of reform and change.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions – all the institutions – are in need of renewal and reform, both externally in respect of their policies and internally as regards their forms and methods of organisation. It is an age of reform which, as I have said, must affect all the European institutions: the Commission first and foremost, but also the Council and even Parliament. I am not here to conserve but to reform. Today's challenge, on which the credibility of the entire European undertaking now turns, is to prevent the recent economic and political differences from stalling our process of integration. I not only fear delays, as such, in the realisation of our project; above all, I fear missing the opportunity to make a vital contribution to solving the grave problems afflicting neighbouring countries. Therefore, even at this very early stage of my relationship with the European Union, and at my very first encounter with Parliament in plenary sitting, it is legitimate that I should set out my vision of the European venture.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic sphere, the single market in goods and factors of production was the theme of the 1980s; the single currency that of the 1990s. We must now face the difficult task of moving towards a single economy and political unity. Despite the diverse models of social organisation adopted by our countries, they have all taken pains to lay the foundations for coexistence in fairness and solidarity. This tradition must be upheld, but reformed to bring it into line with the new international circumstances; the welfare state model so far constructed by the countries of Western Europe, bringing about a high degree of social cohesion, is in great need of reform. The individual Member States will be the main players in this process of reform, but Parliament and the Commission must play a driving and coordinating role to ensure that national reforms lead to a more efficiently organised labour market which promotes social mobility and mobility between Europe's large regional areas. Even though competition is not the sole objective of the new Europe, I am nevertheless aware that a high degree of competition is a necessary tool to reduce our excessive pockets of inefficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The incentive to act along these lines comes from the fact that Europe, the largest area in the world, must be the first to tackle the problem of population ageing. Population ageing not only has social policy implications; it also calls for a response in terms of productivity of the entire economic system, so as to fulfil the difficult pact between the different generations with less social conflict. The establishment of a broad‐based, efficient European market in venture capital is a necessary condition for achieving higher levels of productivity. Such a market is also the instrument through which we can reposition ourselves to manufacture more highly developed, innovative products. More direct action is needed from the governments and the Commission to promote investment in research and development, especially in the new electronic, information and communication technologies, but also in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and more generally in the life sciences.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of our continent, not only that of its industry and finance but of European society as a whole, depends on high‐tech, research‐intensive, knowledge‐based industries. One need only think of a simple fact: the Internet can change the very way in which production is organised. One need only think of the reduction in stocks or the dematerialisation of products. Direct access to information by the people must therefore be developed further. We still have much ground to cover to catch up with the United States; a good deal of my work will focus on reducing this gap. I have a plan which I should like to see converted into a commitment for the Commission, Parliament and Europe's governments: my plan is that, five years from now, young Europeans finishing their secondary education will be as capable as the best of their contemporaries, throughout the world, of using the technologies of the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has a great cultural tradition; it has a great wealth of scientific knowledge stored in its universities and research centres. Where Europe falls down is in the ability to convert this tradition, this knowledge, into opportunities for growth, above all by improving the links between the academic world and the world of production.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to macro‐economic policy, the abandonment of monetary sovereignty has increased the significance of fiscal policies. These must be better coordinated in order, on the one hand, to play an effective role of stabilisation in response to events or situations occurring in the different countries – the dangerous asymmetric shocks which could occur in Europe – and, on the other, in the longer term, to achieve real harmonisation of our national economies. Economic policy coordination is rendered all the more necessary by the possibility that regional economic divergences could emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">Shocks of international origin, arising in Asia, Russia and Brazil, have prevented European monetary union from unleashing all the growth potential generated in the second half of the 1980s by the prospect of the single market and which the establishment of the single currency prepared for the end of this century. Confidence in the future on the part of businesses and households appears to have been dented, and unfortunately this effect is being compounded by the events of the war in Yugoslavia. This analysis, now shared by all the relevant bodies, has led the European Central Bank to assume with a great sense of responsibility its task of managing monetary policy. Better coordination between national budgetary authorities is now needed so that, within the bounds of the Maastricht Treaty and the stability and growth pact, everything possible is done to underpin the growth of Europe's economies. It will fall to the Commission to endeavour to implement as rapidly as possible the agreements reached in Berlin on Agenda 2000 and, within the limits of the budget, to launch high‐profile European schemes which not only boost internal demand in Europe but make the Union's actions visible to the people. By the same token, it will also be up to the Commission to seek to defuse tension in international trade between Europe and the United States, thereby reassuring our producers. Growth is the necessary condition for Europe's economic policy to help reduce unemployment. But there is no guarantee that growth will be sufficient; therefore the Commission should make itself the driving force for early action to review the rules governing the labour market and the occupations, so as to lower the barriers to entry and increase the possibilities of individualised working practices – all with the aim of making employment more responsive to economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The new financial and monetary stability introduced through the establishment of the single currency can help to address this urgent requirement with success. We must be all the more determined to pursue this aim, because high unemployment is the main cause of the anxiety which seems to be spreading among the European people. Demographic decline, mass emigration and doubts as to whether the European model of social protection can be preserved intact are the other major fears casting shadows over the continent's future. Unless they are handled properly, not least on a continental scale, the links between the various generations and the various population groups will begin to unravel bit by bit. A new phase of more intense economic growth is needed to achieve this aim. But that will only come about if the presence of public administrations is made more lightweight and the micro‐economic reforms to which I referred a moment ago are introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">On a political level, the Union has never had greater potential in the international arena. From EU enlargement to the universal affirmation of the principles of freedom and democracy, I feel a moral and political duty to interpret the desire for Europe and its presence. Europe can therefore stand as a model of development and social cohesion, internally, and it has a growing presence on the international stage. I shall therefore do my utmost to bring the enlargement process to a successful conclusion, for which the terms and exact timetable must be established swiftly. In view of the war in the Balkans, the completion of enlargement becomes a top political priority because of the message it can send to those peoples by preparing them for closer ties with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the confines of its specific responsibilities in this field, the new Commission must strive for rapid implementation of the process. The European Union's growing responsibilities in the world derive in fact from the strength it has now achieved, its tradition of safeguarding peace and human rights, and its concern to see a stable international environment for its commercial activities and its political presence. To this end, on the basis of the Maastricht and Amsterdam principles, the European Union must equip itself with an independent defence capability whilst at the same time rationalising, as of now, its use of industrial resources and military infrastructure. By strengthening the link between economic prosperity and trade, on the one hand, and political stability on the other, the European Union must continue along the road of multinational liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. We must reject all attempts at protectionism, not least so as to allow developing regions access to markets, such access being the greatest possible contribution to their growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Europe must pursue its policy of partnership and cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet Union and the Balkans, above all those bordering on the Mediterranean, so as to create a large area of stability and a free market in which the European Union can prosper and invest. For all of us – not just for me, a man of the Mediterranean, but for all of us, and not only in the southern part of our continent – the Mediterranean must be the other face of Europe: naturally not as a balance to enlargement, but to create an area of peace and development in the most difficult and high‐risk region that exists on Europe's borders, or rather – if I may say so – the most difficult and high‐risk region in the world. Indeed, our future life will be determined by our relations with the Islamic world. It is a choice which requires intelligence, political initiative and great confidence in our strengths and in the prospects for peaceful coexistence among peoples. I do not believe that these relations can be built by a single country in isolation; no European country can do that: either such relations exist at European level or they will be unable to generate hope and change.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has grown a good deal and must grow still more. Its new mission necessitates stronger, more cohesive institutions, closer dialogue and a more democratic environment. In the affairs of the Union and in its institutional philosophy, the three main institutions must achieve close harmonisation: a stronger leading, guiding role for Parliament and the Council; a Commission which is increasingly capable of spearheading EU growth. An equally dominant role must fall to the individual national governments and, within them, to the bodies and institutions representing the local authorities, which have thus far been badly neglected in the building of Europe. It is difficult to speak of subsidiarity without also speaking of the bodies which are its most tangible expression. The united Europe will be strong only if the independence of its component parts is strong. To this end, the Commission has a twofold task ahead of it: the first is to assist in planning the future; the second is to ensure that the Union as a whole has an efficient administrative apparatus. I have already had occasion to state that the Commission must be the guardian of the Treaties, but only if relations between the Commission, Parliament and Council are productive, honest and transparent will Europe grow ever closer to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The highly ambitious tasks which I have outlined for Europe in the future certainly cannot be pursued with the existing Community institutions, which the Amsterdam Treaty has only begun to reform. Moreover, enlargement in itself makes reform vital, given that institutions designed for six Member States and which are already now proving inadequate are definitely not suited to managing a Union of 20 or 25 countries. For this purpose the Commission must be thoroughly overhauled, reorganising the portfolios according to the main new political priorities and the changes in its tasks. However, the democratic legitimacy of increasingly important European institutions and the effectiveness of EU policies create the need for a more ambitious blueprint, based on a strengthening of Parliament's powers of codecision, greater use of majority voting in the Council and proper implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty in respect of the Commission President's role in selecting the Commissioners and sharing out responsibilities among them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am likewise well aware of the fact that not only this House, but also the national governments and more generally European public opinion as a whole, have very great expectations concerning the reforms I am to make to the internal workings of the Commission. These reforms, which will be a cornerstone of the new Commission's programme, will require the implementation of at least three principles: greater efficiency, absolute transparency and full responsibility, or what is usually defined as accountability. I can assure Parliament as of now that I will not tolerate corruption in any form, that I will ensure increasing transparency and account for my work without reserve, and that both the College and the individual Commissioners will take full responsibility for our work.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the Member States and the European Union as a whole have grown tremendously, in quality and quantity, to such an extent that the interests of the individual countries depend, to a not insignificant degree, on the smooth running of Europe's supranational institutions. I shall not forget this, acting first and foremost as a good administrator of collective resources. Yet I realise that, for the commitment on which I am about to embark, it is not enough to be a good administrator; I am about to devote myself to an immense political commitment, bringing to it a background ranging from my personal education to my experience at the head of a government utterly dedicated to European reform. On the subject of this commitment, I wish to clarify here and now a matter which has drawn attention from many of you as well as from the media in the past few days: I am referring to my possible candidature at the forthcoming European elections. I shall be involved in these elections, championing the ideas to which I have always committed myself and supporting the women and men with whom I have been working, but I have decided not to stand myself.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">From a legal point of view, there is nothing to prevent me from standing; indeed, my candidature could and would represent a step towards that resolutely democratic Europe in which the members of Europe's government will also be subject to popular scrutiny. I hope that this will soon happen, and I believe that the battle of principle which I have waged will serve this purpose. At this current stage of European politics, however, I acknowledge that my candidature could constitute not a stimulus but a cause of division. And I am not here to divide, I am here to unite.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I have stated on several occasions that, in one sense, the search for a European soul appears increasingly to be the dominant problem for the future of our continent. It is without doubt a sign of weakness to believe that Europe's institutions will have a future – a strengthened Parliament, the right of veto confined to exceptional cases, a reorganisation of the Commission and its powers – unless common European feelings can gradually be fostered.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no dominant culture in Europe, and I believe this to be a good thing: Europe would not have been what it was in the past or be what it is now if its individual, diverse and great national cultures had not flourished down the centuries and were not flourishing today. But – and this strikes me as less positive – nor are there any contemporary philosophers, thinkers or opinion‐formers with a resonance throughout our continent. The risk therefore is that what is happening on the financial markets could happen to our culture and values: the euro is bringing together many diverse forces into a single market, but in these first few months this unifying function is mainly being performed by American commercial banks and investment funds. The strength of American culture, in the broad sense of the term, is symbolically expressed through the mass media; indeed, some go so far as to deem it the single reference‐point for a Europe in search of its soul. There is nothing outrageous about this hypothesis, not least because the world's equilibrium will in future depend on ever closer cooperation between Europe and the United States in the fields of politics, economics and defence, which presupposes a certain degree of affinity regarding basic models of society. I nevertheless believe that Europe can draw on a great historical heritage, the richest store of culture and knowledge ever accumulated by humanity. Unfortunately, there is no ready solution or quick fix to help us achieve our aims; all we can do is start from the confusion of today and attempt to overcome the dispersion of knowledge and culture, to conquer the Babel of languages in search of a common tongue and an ever more necessary dialogue. We cannot remain in the past; the remedies found in the last century are not enough. Europe gives us an ideal opportunity to revisit this past, to compare it with the experience of others and to cast off once and for all the legacy of the past which should have united us but instead divided us. No ruler, no people can single‐handedly cast off the past and build the future; but the European peoples and governments can do so by working all together. That is why we need Europe: as individuals we cannot find the new road; as individuals we are unable to tackle even the most straightforward problems of the present, beginning with the greatest one, namely our relations with the peoples of surrounding countries who are looking to us to build their political and economic future. No single country can respond to them; only Europe can do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as our economic goals are suffering interference from international shocks, so too could Europe's political venture be jeopardised by the serious events of the war in Yugoslavia. The pace of this venture must now be stepped up if it is to survive. The tragedy of Kosovo makes it tragically obvious that the European Union has a duty to assume an increasingly important role in guaranteeing security and democracy in areas crucial to our future. This future must be built by us, with the power of our institutions, creating the common defence and foreign policy structures which the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties have promised to the European people. The Commission will assume to the full its responsibility for letting the EU citizens know what reforms are needed to achieve this future. Such an initiative can, however, only be successful with active, enthusiastic support from Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Green </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I wish to welcome Mr Prodi here today. His nomination by the European Council came swiftly and decisively in the wake of the resignation of the present Commission, and my Group welcomed the speed with which the Council responded. We had urged the Heads of Government in Berlin to act quickly to end the uncertainty and confusion which followed the unprecedented resignation of the 20 present Commissioners. We welcomed the Council's clear understanding of the political nature of the moment and of the opportunity it offered to create a new relationship between the European Union institutions and its citizens. It could not have acted more quickly and, it has to be said, that it acted with uncharacteristic speed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi's statement to us here this morning is the beginning of our ratification process of the new Commission. My Group wants the new European Commission to come into office as soon as possible. It must be said that the timetable which the European Council has set us is not an easy one. Given the European elections in June, given the imminent introduction of the Amsterdam Treaty and given the convergence of general elections in two of our Member States on the same day as the European elections, the timetable presents us with a logistic headache of monumental proportions. However, we must find a way around the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us in this House want to see the present Commission leave office as soon as possible. To be fair to them, they too have expressed a desire to leave as soon as possible. They remain in office only as a caretaker Commission, as the Treaty obliges them to do. It is a situation unloved by them and grossly unsatisfactory to us.</p>
<p class="contents">To carry out our role now with regard to the next Commission, we may have to put our own parliamentary calendar and personal diaries under considerable strain. So be it.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the Berlin Summit asked this Parliament to deal with the nomination of Mr Prodi and the new Parliament to deal with the ratification of the entire new Commission. We insist, however, that the ratification of the next President of the Commission must be done rigorously, seriously and properly by this Parliament. I welcome very much Mr Prodi's consent to come here today and begin that process in that spirit. The role of this Parliament in recent events has been fundamental. It is important that we now demonstrate our maturity and see the process through to its conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group believes that now, together with the Council and a reforming Commission, we can set up a structure and decision‐making process which is more appropriate, more in tune with modern governance. First and foremost, we want a strong Commission. The new Commission must have clear direction, a firm political leadership which is open, it must practise genuine transparency and partnership with the European Parliament and not just pay lip‐service to those values.</p>
<p class="contents">None of us here underestimate the problems and challenges of creating such a European Commission. However, I want to make clear to Mr Prodi today, on behalf of my Group, that if the next Commission makes a genuine attempt to reform with the courage and vigour which he has expressed this morning, then it will receive the support of my Group.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group will not play toy‐town politics with this process. We would not do it in January of this year and we will not do it now.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Some in this House welcomed Mr Prodi to Parliament; some in this House seem determined to play solely national electoral politics with this issue, ignoring the importance of the moment for Europe, for its policies and for its people.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Those concerned for the evolution of this House as the real democratic voice of Europe's people will work together to enhance its role and its rights, which is what our citizens are waiting and watching for. My experience during the last few weeks campaigning in Britain has been that, for the first time ever, people know that the European Parliament exists as a force to be reckoned with – not just the subject of myths about curly cucumbers and curved bananas – but a body which has delivered objective evidence through the report of the Committee of Independent Experts and then acted on it. My Group takes considerable pride in our role over recent months.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we have acted in the best traditions of parliamentarians: responsible, exercising leadership and acting with integrity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you have come to this House today as the Council's designated candidate. You come with excellent credentials as a good European and a proven track record of personal integrity, the authority of having held the highest office of the land in one of the largest Member States of the European Union and one of the founding states at that. You have demonstrated your ability to put together a reforming government and develop a consensus with all sectors of Italian society, to ensure that Italy was able and ready to enter the first wave of the single currency. In this you have confounded the sceptics.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopes in this Parliament of just what you could achieve with those formidable skills as President of the European Commission are high. I believe, therefore, that when you come to this Parliament next month, we would like to hear some clear idea of the direction you will take on two fronts. It must be said that you began that statement in a very clear and very strong way here this morning, and we very much welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, given the trauma which led to the collapse of the present Commission, we expect to hear a clear commitment – not just to implementing the programme of reforms already agreed by this Parliament and the current Commission in January and the subsequent agreement on the independent investigatory body OLAF – but to further and deeper reforms of substance, in particular (and I was glad to hear you mention it) with regard to the acceptance of political and personal responsibility for work done by officials at whatever level in the European Commission. We also expect that you will give due account to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts and work with us in Parliament to examine, assess and implement the necessary reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for my Group, the real substance of the programme of the European Commission is political. We understand that, if your appointment is ratified, you will not be able to present a full political programme until you have negotiated with the governments on their nominations to the Commission under the new rights given to the President of the Commission by the Amsterdam Treaty. We understand from various interviews which you have given, that you intend to use those rights to the full. We would not only support you in doing so but would also encourage you to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission must act like a college and not like 20 fiefdoms and the moulding of such a Commission will lie in the hands of the new President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for my Group the political content of the programme which will be produced by the new Commission is crucial. Last week when you visited my Group, I presented you with our objectives for the next five years in the form of our manifesto for the European elections. From this you will see that our agenda is for jobs, training for jobs, protection of the environment, the fight against social exclusion, the need to protect the health and safety of our citizens in a world now having to deal with issues like BSE and genetically modified foods, the struggle against cross‐border crime, working together for a stronger Europe in the world and carrying out the necessary reforms to ensure that we can enlarge the Union at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We will judge the European Commission to be established in the coming weeks on both its political programme and its programme for reform. I for one welcome your human and intelligent development of your thinking here this morning – economic, cultural, social, based on peace. I think all of us here very much welcome that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to touch on the issue you raised at the end of your speech. Many in my Group feel a strong democratic affinity with the proposals of Jacques Delors that we move in the future to a position where the President of the European Commission should derive his or her credibility from the electoral process. For this to happen there has to be agreement between the Council and Parliament on the process. The sensitive balance between Member States and the institutions of the Union cannot be jeopardised by precipitous action which could damage the process of European integration, in which respect for differing political cultures and democratic practices are paramount. In this respect, you, Mr Prodi, have already been unanimously nominated for the office of President of the European Commission by all the Heads of State and Government in the European Union. You do not come to this nomination through any defining electoral process. However, one of your great strengths is that you bring with you a great experience of success at consensus building. It is in that context that my Group very much welcomes the statement you made today that, whilst, of course, you will engage with those with whom you are politically aligned – as we and the Commissioners have always done – we welcome your clear statement this morning that you will not stand as a candidate to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We might have expected that, with just over three weeks of the life of this Parliament left to go, we might be on the gentle slope towards an election. Usually parliaments ease their way out or drift away as legislation peters out and parliamentary life comes to an end. In the last week of the last parliamentary term, in 1994, we had to mobilise all outgoing Members to vote on the enlargement of the Union. On this occasion not only do we have Agenda 2000 but also we have to face the consequences of a resigned Commission and a new President of the European Commission. This is a serious process. Mr Prodi, the programme you develop after this debate and your discussion tomorrow evening with the European Council represent an important step in the development of European democracy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martens </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, president‐designate Romano Prodi was nominated by the European Union Heads of Government just as NATO began its bombing of Yugoslavia. Because of the very complicated timetable, it will be months before the European Union gets a new executive. This is why Parliament has pressed for it to happen as speedily as possible, and we shall support any measure which expedites the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, we are very pleased by your appointment as new president of the European Commission. After your investiture by Parliament in May you will, in the parlance of the House, be the <span class="italic">formateur</span> , the <span class="italic">co‐formateur</span> , of the new Commission. We are strongly and unequivocally in favour of your candidacy and, I should add, we attach no political strings. We are convinced that you possess the political and professional skills to overcome the deep crisis in which the Commission finds itself. And this crisis must prompt us to carry out some historic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">You must reform the Commission and its services. As the present Commission too has said, there has to be a new European political and administrative culture. The problems began ten years ago, as the report of the independent experts shows us, with chapter and verse – from 1990 onwards tourism, from 1992 onwards the programmes for the Mediterranean area, humanitarian aid, the security services. The Wise Men tell us that the supervisory bodies within the Commission are a mess and that procedures take too long. Staff policy is a machine running out of control.</p>
<p class="contents">More than a year ago, in March 1998, our colleagues in the Committee on Budgetary Control, at the instigation of James Elles, called for measures to be taken by the middle of September 1998. In October 1998, Parliament called for an independent anti‐fraud office to succeed UCLAF. We did not obtain satisfaction in December last year. Our group put forward an action programme to modernise the Commission by 1 January 2000, with codes of conduct for Commissioners, on relations between Commissioners and their private offices and services, and codes of conduct for officials, with a reform of the Staff Regulations involving transparency and good faith in the recruitment of officials and clear rules and restrictions on outside appointments. Clear rules too for budgetary management, more specifically regarding technical assistance offices, and reform of the Financial Regulation. All this awaits you, especially once the second report by the Wise Men comes out this September.</p>
<p class="contents">But numerous political challenges also await you, very clearly formulated in documents of this Parliament, reports by our colleagues Mr Herman and Mr Brok. Fernand Herman"s report will be debated this week. It concerns institutional reforms, not least in the Commission, which can be carried out without amending the Treaty: reducing the number of portfolios and a rational make‐up of the Commission, a proper balance between collective and individual responsibility. As you know, this is a central problem. Mrs Cresson, who was not prepared to accept her own personal political responsibility, dragged the entire Commission down with her.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The PPE and we as the PPE Group have said that we can no longer work with her. My question to you is this: where do you stand on this relationship between collective and individual responsibility? We are in favour of interinstitutional cooperation. In 1994, I took the initiative as PPE Group president to call for reform of the <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> governing the relationship between the Commission and the European Parliament. This <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> needs to be revised and expanded again. New agreements have been reached and it needs, I think, to be approved and accepted before the new Commission takes up its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok spoke in his report, with the resolution that was adopted on 13 January, of the consequences of the Commission President"s investiture and the independence of members of the Commission. This report is particularly instructive and informative, not least on the subject of the procedure to be followed now for the investiture of the Commission under the Amsterdam Treaty. It advocates independence for the members of the Commission, and that the European Commission must remain the guardian of the Treaties and work for the general interest. The report also calls for a political balance in the membership of the Commission. I would add: a new Commission comprising both men and women. This report urges, and I too urge, that this new Commission should have the support of a clear majority of the new Parliament, because one of the lessons of recent events and the recent crisis is that if the Commission does not have the backing of a large majority of the new Parliament, we are in for a period of guerrilla warfare. And that is the last thing we need between Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But you, Mr Prodi, will be able to demonstrate your political leadership once your appointment has been ratified by Parliament, in the appointment of the new Commissioners. I hope that your legitimate authority as president will be a factor in their approval, in the giving of your agreement. Once you have approved the new Commissioners, on the basis of your legitimate authority as president, duly ratified by Parliament, then and only then will hearings be held here in Parliament. We may wish to speed up the procedure, but it is not acceptable for the Member State governments to have three months in which to nominate their Commissioners and for Parliament to have just three days in which to hold the hearings.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, we are very impressed by what you have said. You have said in your statements to the press, but to Parliament too, that you want to impart new momentum to the European Union, that political union is a major objective of yours. Above all, you have said that you attach importance to further democratisation and transparency and to cooperation with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that once the period of bureaucracy is over, not to mention fraud or nepotism, a very important new task and new responsibility will be to ensure that the Commissioners put in an appearance in this House and in our committees. Like Michel Rocard and many others, I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. How often have we been able to hold a political debate in this committee? How often have we had to make do with talks with officials? There has to be someone with political responsibility there. Happily there were exceptions to the rule even in the present Commission, Commissioners who cooperated actively, but this has to be the norm for the whole of the new Commission and then we can impart a new momentum to the institutions, to your new Commission and to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the hope I express on behalf of my group, given the prospects you have offered for a new momentum. Not just for the Europe of markets, of banks, but for Europe with its cultural and spiritual dimension. This is what you advocate. We are convinced that you will realise these prospects and this is why we were so positive in welcoming your nomination by the Member States" Heads of Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of the people who, as prime minister, took part in the negotiations on the single market and the Maastricht Treaty. We laid the foundations at that time for a new relationship between the institutions. We hoped to achieve a true government which would be answerable and accountable to Parliament, and would work together with Parliament. I venture to hope that you will bring this about, with your new Commission, with people who are aware of this aim and eager to play this pre‐eminently political role.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cox </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, as I listened to Mrs Green's speech I felt the need to apply a brief reality check to it and to the procedures of this House. Is this the Pauline Green who, in December, recommended that we vote confidence without even thinking?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause ) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Is this the Pauline Green who, in January, defended collegiality? Is this the Pauline Green today who promotes individual accountability? I salute her for being one of the few genuine revolutionaries in this House since, on this issue, she has never stopped spinning.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Sustained applause ) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Prodi how welcome he is here today. He is a European of the first rank. The ELDR Group looks forward to deepening our engagement and dialogue with him, and to a very productive period for the future. But is not for this Parliament, in this mandate, to appoint the president of the Millennium Commission. That is the moral, political and legal responsibility of the next mandate. Recent events have established, through the work of this House, the need to establish ethical and normative rules for the conduct of European affairs. But this is also representative of a significant maturing in the European democratic process, with major institutional and constitutional implications. This House will no longer be the junior partner. We do not need to be first among equals, but we assert the right to be treated as an equal among equals. That is why I welcome the presence of Mr Prodi at this early stage and the dialogue we start.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to you, Mr Prodi, directly on behalf of my group, not as advice nor as an instruction but as a suggestion that you might like to think about, that you should seek in the coming days – and especially tomorrow in your dialogue with the European Council – to assert your own independence, not just of the needs of this House, but of some of the parameters of the Council itself. I believe you are your own man. You should assert that from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe you should explain to the Council that it is not appropriate that we should, in a procedure in May, elect you as the legitimate head of what would be an illegitimate Commission. I believe you should not launch your project in such a sea of political and institutional ambiguity. I would like to think that in May we could give you a political mandate to act as <span class="italic">formateur, </span> to go from this House in May to begin to explore in substance, as <span class="italic">formateur</span> with a political mandate, what you might do. It would be most unfortunate if you should start in a procedure where you are legitimate in the context of a Commission as college – I speak not of individuals but of a college – which itself is discredited.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of being your own man it is also correct that you should consider getting your project right rather than getting it early. What you are dealing with is vitally important for all of us. I note your political discretion in saying you will step down from running in the European Parliament election. That discretion is your choice and I respect it. But I would say to you: be engaged in that election; maintain your political conviction; and fight the cause with those colleagues whose list you will not now head. In doing that you will establish that you, Romano Prodi, come to us not as a bureaucrat, not as a technician, but as someone dedicated to European politics, as a politician, and that as a politician you will lead a strong, independent political Commission. If you decide to be your own man, to be political, then you will do us all a great favour.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pasty </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today beginning the process, itself completely new, of appointing a new Commission. This will have the task of completing the term of office of the previous Commission which was forced to resign <span class="italic">en masse</span> in order to avoid a motion of censure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two consequences of this unusual situation. Firstly, a new College must be established as quickly as possible. This is because it is detrimental to leave in office for too long a weakened body which under the Treaties can only deal with current business, the limits of which are rather vague. The various governments must appoint their Commissioners as quickly as possible so that the European Parliament can, in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty, confirm the appointment of the new College. This could take place, in the best‐case scenario, during an extension of the constitutive sitting after the June elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would not be right for the process to appoint the new Commission, whose term of office will end at the end of the year, to overlap with the process initiated to establish the Commission which must be appointed to complete a normal term of five years from the year 2000. This overlap would have the major disadvantage of obscuring the deep‐seated reasons currently prompting us to establish a new team, namely the need for large‐scale and profound internal reform of the structures, procedures and working methods of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This is perhaps not an exciting task for the nominee for President but it meets an immediate and unavoidable need. The actions of the European Parliament which led to the resignation of the Santer team would seem senseless if this priority of sorting out the Commission institution was not fully understood by the new College.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter requires in‐depth examination. The Commission must refocus solely on those powers expressly conferred on it by the Treaties, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity reaffirmed by the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must once again become what it was originally, namely an administration with a mission, responsible for making proposals to the political authorities of the Council and Parliament and for explaining their choices. It must not represent the beginning of a European government invested with many poorly fulfilled management tasks. The management of common policies must be extensively decentralised. This requires both substantial reinforcement of the control bodies and the establishment of a central anti‐fraud office which is independent and has the resources needed to fulfil its mission.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the conclusions to be announced by the Committee of Independent Experts, which should be available in September, the Commission must establish real internal financial control. It must also introduce professional and totally transparent procedures for awarding public contracts together with procedures for recruiting and managing staff which finally put an end to the nepotism and favouritism which recently have unfairly stained the reputation of an administration whose powers and availability are otherwise acknowledged. Finally, a shake‐up is required together with the pruning of any dead wood following the disciplinary and legal proceedings which are now in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we expect from you, Mr Prodi, in the coming months. Your vision of the future of European construction is all very interesting but you must, as a priority, return to working order the institution for which you will be required to assume responsibility when your appointment has been confirmed by the European Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">In our view, the political implications are clear. Mr Prodi does not wish to be simply the Council"s nominee for President or the governments" President. Rather, he wishes to become the President of the people of Europe through a close relationship with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The new President will be appointed at a critical stage in the construction of Europe. Over and above the institutional crisis, we are faced with a crisis in the wider Europe. As Mr Prodi himself pointed out, war has come to Yugoslavia 42 years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome and 10 years after the end of the cold war. Human rights are being infringed in the Balkans, most particularly in Kosovo. NATO has initiated military intervention. Yet the European institutions and a sense of European identity have been absent.</p>
<p class="contents">Could we ever envisage managing the euro if the European Central Bank were not fully operational? How then can we expect European policies to operate effectively under what is merely a caretaker Commission and with Parliament almost at the end of its fourth term since 1979?</p>
<p class="contents">There is plenty of scope for debate on whether we should be aiming at more Europe or less Europe. Personally, I am in favour of more Europe. However, I think we all agree that we would like the existing European powers to be imbued with greater democracy, and hope that the sectoral policies will be managed more efficiently. That is our message to the nominee and I am sure there is consensus on this.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, this new era in the history of the European Commission must be defined by four conditions or characteristics: a sound democratic basis, transparency, the Commissioners" individual and collective political responsibility to Parliament, and effectiveness in fulfilling objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I am referring to political responsibility to a Parliament that has come of age, and this should be made abundantly clear. Parliament is now a mature institution and will soon be embarking on its fifth term. It certainly has not transferred its powers and responsibilities to any committee of experts. It simply asked for a report to be prepared to clarify certain situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to concentrate on the responsible attitude my group has shown throughout this crisis. After all, as the old Latin saying goes, <span class="italic"> excusatio non petita, accusatio manifesta</span> . I would merely remind the House of the events and our response to them.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to make it clear to Mr Prodi that we are keeping an open mind on his investiture. We are of course already aware of his record in Italian and European politics, and we shall doubtless learn more about it. Nevertheless, our vote will be based on the programmes and objectives he presents at the investiture sitting, on the credibility of his desire for change and of the necessary proposals for reform, and on his political strategy for dealing with the difficult challenges facing European society.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned about the timetable for his appointment and the appointment of the Commission, and would like to set out our position on two issues. Our group hopes for a swift procedure and a clear presentation of the Commissioners in line with the Treaty of Amsterdam. We are no longer concerned about Mr Prodi"s possible candidature in the Italian elections. He has clarified the situation very well and in a responsible manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall finish by pointing out that in view of the serious problems concerning enlargement and our social and economic policies, our group feels that what we need is not just a President of the institutions, but a President of all the people of Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Aelvoet </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr Prodi, your achievements in Italy unquestionably make you a most worthy candidate, because you have done things there which no one thought possible and in the European Union you will face tasks which are every bit as difficult, if not more so. Vaclav Havel once said ‘what use are the most beautiful of buildings if they serve no purpose?" You have made statements in recent weeks to the effect that the European Union needs a purpose. But what does that mean exactly? We think that what matters most is that you should make the Union, which is currently so remote from its people and has fallen into such disrepute as a result of mismanagement and fraud, into a democratic and transparent Union which demonstrates that it can take responsibility and is willing to answer to the people and to the elected Parliament. Your appointment has been swift, and that is a good thing. But the problem is that the whole of the outgoing Commission, which no longer has the confidence of Parliament and which has truly been discredited, will be staying put until September. This, ladies and gentlemen, gives rise to a situation which is politically untenable for us and unworthy of the European Parliament. At a time when the Union needs to be forceful, when we have a major political catastrophe in Yugoslavia and beyond, we have a lame‐duck Commission. So we are urging you, Mr Prodi, to make every effort to come before Parliament with a capable and forceful Commission as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it most important that you should put forward sound proposals for reform of the European Commission which will enable it to exercise collective responsibility in a real and proper way and will also determine the individual responsibility of Commissioners and the responsibility of directors‐general, because things have to change in this respect as well. We should have liked to hear in your statement a reference to the need for radical adjustments to the European Union"s economic policy, because belief in unqualified growth ignores the absolute need to restructure our economies to take account of environmental imperatives. We trust you will take on board Parliament"s proposal that more women should be appointed as European Commissioners, that they should be able to play their proper part in developing further something which is a part of our <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we find it splendid that you have said here today that you will not be standing in the elections. This is a political decision, worthy of a good European. In conclusion, we would say that we are looking for a strong Commission, but a strong Commission which is happy to be accountable to a strong Parliament. Only then can we have a new basis for trust.</p>

Our group thanks you for coming here.</p>
<p class="contents">During your meetings with the Members of this House, you must have realised the expectations and I would say the high hopes resting on the new Commission, in terms of both the interim Commission and, later on, the permanent Commission to be established in January 2000. Naturally, these hopes primarily concern the new Commission President whose role will be absolutely vital.</p>
<p class="contents">We are hoping for and indeed we demand a strong Commission. This firstly requires a strong President. The current crisis and the resignation of the outgoing Commission under pressure from Parliament have primarily been caused by the Commission"s gradual loss of authority. Even though important work has been achieved over the last five years, for example with the single currency, this loss of authority is serious because the European Union needs a politically strong Commission. The Commission must be strong faced with the national governments, all the more so if the number of countries increases following enlargement. It must be strong faced with Parliament, as one of the elements of this strength is precisely its political responsibility before this House. It must be strong faced with public opinion because the Commission, whether it likes it or not, is the very personification of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this political strength is our main demand for the future Commission, we also have other demands, particularly regarding the internal working of this Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though there are other deep‐rooted causes for this situation, as I have just mentioned, the immediate cause of the crisis which prompted the outgoing Commission to resign was the problems in the organisation and working of the College of Commissioners and also in the organisation and working of the services under the authority of the Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions must also be asked about the increasing number of powers entrusted to the Commission. This increase in the number of tasks seems paradoxically to have weakened its prestige and certainly has not helped, which speaks volumes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐designate, your work, I should say your mission, will be immense. You have already shown in Italy that you are capable of taking it on. I have also noted everything you have just said in your introductory speech and your concern that the democratic link between the members of the Commission and universal suffrage should be reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I hope that you will be courageous and enjoy every success!</p>

We regard you, Mr Prodi, as a centralist and super‐federalist in favour of a United States of Europe, and we are therefore going to vote against your appointment. We regard you as Jacques Delors the Second. The Europe of Nations Group promises you critical and constructive opposition. We shall be critical every time you propose a step in the direction of more Union. We shall be constructive every time there is even the slightest chance of having greater openness in the corridors of the Commission. What we need now is not a new Commission, but a spring clean by independent individuals who can dispense with any Commission work which is not transnational in nature and introduce complete openness for what remains. We need a modern law on public administration, with decentralised responsibility and consequences for those who do not fulfil their responsibilities. There should be an end to 50 years of secrecy and privilege. Officials who came to Parliament with revelations of fraud should be reinstated on full pay, and those who obstruct investigations should be fired. It is scandalous that the current Commission, after its resignation, has decided that Mr Van Buitenen is not allowed to help the Belgian police to investigate any of the matters which led to the Commission's downfall. Officials at the Commission should be servants of democracy in our countries and not new overlords. To personal friendship and political enmity: ‘<span class="italic">Benvenuto, Signor Prodi!</span> '</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Muscardini </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr Prodi, Alleanza Nazionale endorses the formal commitments which you are to make concerning institutional reform in the Union – which the Amsterdam Treaty unfortunately deals with in insufficient detail – and the launch of political union.</p>
<p class="contents">If ever proof were needed, the tragic events in Kosovo and NATO's military intervention there demonstrate the pressing need for the European Union to adopt a common foreign and defence policy, without which it is as though Europe did not exist. Developments over the past few days have confirmed the absence of Europe as an independent entity. What we are experiencing now proves conclusively, as never before, the urgent need for a European political identity and a recognisable presence on the international stage, with due regard for the alliances to which we belong.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council stated a long time ago that it would nominate the new Commission President before the elections. What displeases us is that your decisions on the Italian front might have been influenced by the European left, which is seeking, somewhat surreptitiously, to prevent you from standing at the elections. But in our opinion – turning now to Europe – a sound democratic foundation for the next Commission should enable the political groups to propose to the European Parliament their candidates for Commission President, rather than always having to react to proposals from the governments. Therefore, Mr Prodi, we look forward to the ‘age of reform and change' which you announced in your speech, but the reforms should be real ones and not just vague proposals: a political union to reinforce the economic union, so as to have a foreign policy, to address ourselves to the Mediterranean, as you said, but also to deal with immigration and crime, as well as humanitarian aid – and here I include the agricultural products which Europe is still throwing away or not producing, to the great detriment of our economy. GATT must be overhauled too, since despite our good relations with the United States, we cannot be held to ransom over the safeguarding of our manufactured products and our production system, while being compelled to import – duty‐free – products from third countries which obviously result from dumping practices.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr Prodi, one aspect of planning the future is to demand explicit social clauses of the countries to which the EU gives aid: third countries, or indeed fourth countries, including the republics of the former Soviet Union. In this way, enlargement will not just mean a rise in poverty and unemployment, but will be based on a revival of Europe's economy driven by quality production; obviously, since we cannot compete on price, we must do so on quality. The idea, then, is that the Commission and Parliament should plan the future together, reminding the Council that it cannot take all the decisions; otherwise the European people will feel that they count for nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">That is how to begin planning the future!</p>

I fear that your attitude will only contribute to the ultimate disappearance of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">You start by accepting that the provisions of the Treaty are not being correctly applied. Article 159 requires new Commissioners to be appointed as quickly as possible. It also requires the European Parliament to approve one Commission, which will be in place for six months, before a new Parliament approves another Commission which will remain in office for five years.</p>
<p class="contents">You are also preparing yourself to take on the responsibilities of the Commission President without learning the lessons from what has just happened. The Commission – and you are surrounded by outgoing Commissioners – was challenged initially by a majority in this House which refused to grant discharge for 1996. The accounts for 1996 have therefore not been closed. Whatever Mrs Green may say about ‘toy‐town politics" – and actually this is just what she has been playing at throughout this year – the whole College of Commissioners, and not just one particular Commissioner, was censured by 232 votes. The Committee of Experts was extremely severe in its report and comments, stating that none of the Commissioners should be reappointed.</p>
<p class="contents">If you really want a strong Europe, you must therefore be responsible for ensuring that a new Commission is established very quickly. This Commission must implement a shake‐up, it must provide a cure as far‐reaching as the diagnosis and it must permanently change its working methods, without which the whole European Union will die.</p>
