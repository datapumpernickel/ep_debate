<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lisi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. –<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting to the House the recommendation for second reading on the regulation concerning assistance and compensation to air passengers in the event of denied boarding, long delays and cancellations.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be useful briefly to summarise the developments relating to this proposal since its presentation last year. The first reading was adopted in this House last year and it had already highlighted the weaknesses of the initial proposal by the Commission. The main objective of the 39 amendments adopted by Parliament was to bring the regulation into line with the real needs of passengers and to make it more practicable for airlines. Subsequently, the Council’s common position, although it significantly changed the initial form of the regulation, nevertheless incorporated a large number of concerns raised by Parliament: the Council has achieved a significant amount, but a few points remain unclear, particularly given the objective which we set ourselves, which is to draw up clear, transparent rules for passengers that are, at the same time, sustainable by airlines, which, as we all know, are passing through a very difficult period.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering that perhaps the most thorny issue – the total amount of compensation – has been, we may say at this point, resolved to the satisfaction of almost all the Members, I will merely point out the issues that remain open which are the subject of this second recommendation. The first concerns tour operators<span class="italic"> </span>and their right of redress. The outcome of the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism was not, in my view, completely satisfactory, and now we have a recommendation which is partly contradictory on the subject of tour operators. In fact, in my opinion, minimal changes are needed with regard to the definition of tourist operators and reciprocity of the right of redress – Amendments Nos 5 and 16 – but, on the whole, the Council's position has, from this point of view, put the problem in the right perspective, since it has placed overall, general responsibility on the carrier operating the service. It is for this reason, therefore, that I cannot support Amendments Nos 1 and 9, or the second part of Amendment No 17, for which a split vote has been requested<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the distance bands. At first reading Parliament opted for a single distance criterion, in other words division into three bands of distance expressed in kilometres for compensation, delay and the placing of passengers in a higher or lower class. In its common position, however, the Council adopted three different criteria for division, and even introduced a new criterion (inside or outside the European Union) with no clear justification. The disparity introduced does not serve to make the legislative text clearer and certainly does not help passengers to understand their exact rights. That is why, in this case too, we propose to combine in a single criterion these three different proposals from the Council: a single criterion, that is three distance bands for all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We then come to the subject of cancellations. I feel that the Council's proposal, which is the result of a laborious compromise, does not offer us the necessary clarity in this case either and runs the risk of considerably complicating communication with passengers. On this matter, I take the liberty of proposing a single compromise amendment to define clearly when passengers have the right to assistance, particularly with regard to cancellation, and to lay down a single time limit – five days before the expected departure – after which passengers may benefit from financial compensation. I would ask the House to support this position, which, as I said, attempts to make what we are trying to say clearer and easier to communicate to passengers and airlines too. As regards delays, it is necessary to guarantee immediate assistance in the event of long delays, namely information, assistance, refreshments and possibly accommodation, whereas we believe that re-routing and reimbursement of air fares – fully justified for cancellations and denied boarding – would represent an incredible complication in the case of delays and would set off a chain reaction of delays which would paralyse air traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, an amendment has been presented concerning the entry into force, which I think ought to be accepted because it makes sense: we give airlines time to get ready, and what we propose is 12 months. In conclusion, apart from a few other minor observations on amendments which are not significant, I believe that, at this point, if we succeed in adopting this proposal, the Council may adopt a rather more constructive attitude, and this makes me confident that it will be possible to bring this <span class="italic">dossier</span> to a close shortly, in the interests of passengers and of the air transport sector as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted that Parliament largely accepts the Council's common position, since it is a balanced text which has the objective of protecting passengers without, as a result, forgetting the interests of the industry, an industry which we know is not experiencing the best of times. The Commission therefore supported the common position, although we would have preferred higher compensation sums, as the honourable Members are well aware.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, Parliament is not proposing a reduction of this compensation since we believe they are at the minimum level necessary to provide air companies with the incentive to seek volunteers rather than directly preventing passengers from boarding against their will.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to inform you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 8, 10 and 11, relating to cancellations and delays, which simplify the text and eliminate possible application problems while at the same time offering passengers a global level of protection similar to that contained in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Will also accept Amendments Nos 12 and 14, which contribute to increasing the clarity and coherence of the text by harmonising the kilometre bands, as well as No 13 in part, and Nos 16, 19 and 20.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, accept Amendments Nos 1 to 7, 9, 15, 17, 18 and 21. Specifically, I would like to say that Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 9 would mean excluding passengers on package tours from the scope of the regulation. The directive on package tourism does not offer this level of protection and to exclude package tours would lead to two different levels of protection for passengers who are facing the same difficulties and who might well be sitting next to each other. It would be difficult to explain this to the citizens and to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that, apart from the issue of package tours, Parliament and the Council largely share the same points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank Mr Lisi for the work he has done and for having achieved these compromise amendments, which I believe will mean that this conciliation can be completed quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, to say that passengers, thunderstruck to learn that they cannot travel even though they have a ticket or whose flight is cancelled at the last minute, obviously need adequate legal protection from the European Union and from our legal framework. We are taking numerous steps in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, the European Parliament took an overall position, looking at this need but also not ignoring the individual interests of the airlines and tour operators, especially at this crucial stage for both air transport and tourism. The Council then proceeded to adopt a common position which, to some degree, takes account of the position of the European Parliament, which is why, at second reading, as the rapporteur rightly said, we are concentrating on three essential issues: first, the right to claim compensation, not only by the operating air carrier towards the tour operators or other person, but also, similarly, by anyone who has incurred expenses or suffered losses towards the operating air carrier; secondly, the deadline for notifying passengers and, thirdly, the issue of frequent flyer programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also, however, the issue, to which the rapporteur referred, of Amendments Nos 1 and, especially 9, relating to tour operators; in other words, as to whether they are included within the framework of the directive or are treated separately. My position on this is that, at this stage, it is better for us not to accept these amendments as passed by the Commission, because we also need to take account of the feelings of consumers, of travellers. We cannot ignore them and I do not think that it is easy for us to explain to them why, in this particular instance, people travelling by this means should be treated differently from, that is, worse than other passengers. Consequently, I totally agree with the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is that, in future, passengers will have greater legal certainty. When these things happen, they will get substantially better assistance and twice as much by way of compensation, not only on regular services but also on charter flights and in respect of various services offered by travel operators.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, unfortunately, only next summer that this good news for passengers will be for real. While this is, on the one hand, attributable to the difficult situation in which airlines currently find themselves, it also represents an opportunity – an opportunity to supply all passengers, in good time, with comprehensive information, comparable, for example, to the charter of passengers’ rights displayed at all airports. Perhaps the airlines will get together and set up a desk at each airport, one that would be readily recognisable and at which passengers could make claims. After all, the best laws are of no use if they are not known about and if they cannot be implemented in a consumer-friendly way.</p>
<p class="contents">We are grateful to the rapporteur for the work he has done. He has always sought compromise, and has worked well with all the political groups. We nonetheless have two points of disagreement with him. One has to do with package flights, where it is not quite clear what he really wants. We are convinced that they do not belong in the regulation, as they are covered by their own directive. The second has to do with how compensation for cancellations is to be handled, where we will endorse the Council’s approach, which is more consumer-friendly than what the rapporteur has proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount paid by way of compensation should depend on the time of notification and on the extent to which the alternative flights offered differ from the original travel contract. What might the side-effects of the regulation be? The best thing would of course be if the cases described were to be drastically reduced in future. If they are caused by unforeseen circumstances, additional competition between airlines might help to make them more user-friendly. This might also mean that, in addition to the areas already referred to, indicators could also show the reliability of baggage handling and the subjective perceptions of the quality of the service that the airlines provide. For that reason, there is a need in Europe for a ranking of user-friendliness, such as exists in the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">As a number of Members have said, it is indeed the case that we could do with comparable rules for all carriers, but the fact that we have not yet been able to come up with rules for other carriers is not a reason for dispensing with them in air travel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I have had considerable reservations about this proposal for a long time now. I have endeavoured to translate these into amendments, both now and at first reading. It does indeed signify a great improvement for the European air passenger, but this is not the whole story. I do not think that it wins any prizes as a model for clear legislation. The thing that causes me great concern is that the whole aviation sector is being lumped together. No account is taken of the differences and the business practices of the various aviation niches in the European market. Line carriers, regional airlines, tour operators and low-cost airlines are all boxed together.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I find it particularly regrettable that the European Commission has not carried out any serious feasibility study into the implications of the measures to be introduced. This is very strange given that the administrative burden will be enormous. As a Liberal, I am very much in favour of liberalisation of the internal market. Most of the companies participating in this are low-cost carriers, and it is precisely these that this regime will probably hit the hardest. Passengers do not deserve that – as it is they that will ultimately foot the bill. The sum of compensation ought to be proportional to the final amount paid for the ticket.</p>
<p class="contents">Compensation must be paid where flights are cancelled. The extent seems to me to be particularly limited: only 10% of cancelled fights are eligible for compensation in actual fact. I hope that we will be able to give consumers crystal-clear information, so that they know who is responsible for which compensation. In the event of flight cancellations, passengers have the right to know when they are entitled to compensation and when they are not. That is my main objection at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many passengers find themselves in confrontation with the system, and that is what is making them fed up. Each year, in Europe alone, 250 000 people are victims of overbooking. That is no longer acceptable, however. In future, the loss will be subject to compensation not only in the event of denied boarding, but also in the case of cancellation and long delays, and we think that this is a very good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is even more important, however, that passengers can feel assured of their flight, and the contributions must therefore be sufficiently high to act as an incentive for companies to opt for good service instead of compensation. We want all of this to apply not only to scheduled flights, but also to ‘non-scheduled’ flights.</p>
<p class="contents">Compensation does not apply in the case of <span class="italic">force</span> <span class="italic">majeure</span>. Unfortunately, we find this a very vague concept. We would have liked to link it to a definition, for example by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, so as to give it more concrete substance. Invoking <span class="italic">force</span> <span class="italic">majeure</span> must not, after all, be a convenient way of abandoning passengers to their fate without compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, passengers would often consider it more important that a solution be found than compensation be paid. In fact, similar rules should apply to all providers of transport services, then we would see a great deal fewer dissatisfied passengers on public transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Booth (EDD).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to address an issue that is of direct concern to my constituents. The helicopter shuttle to the Isles of Scilly provides an essential public service and is the mainstay of the islands' economy. There is no reasonable alternative, and at times it is the only link to the mainland for such essential needs as hospital appointments, education and business. I am sure that there must be similar operations in Europe that might be termed 'social carriers'. I am equally sure that these regulations cannot have been intended to apply to them with the same rigour as to fully-fledged airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem lies with mechanical breakdown. Being a shuttle service – for which it is not economically viable to keep spare aircraft – if a breakdown occurs early in the day, all subsequent flights are affected. The cost of compensation and assistance is expected to be so excessive that it would prejudice the economic viability of the service, which might have to be discontinued. If this happened, it would of course have a devastating effect on all Scillonians, whether or not they actually use the service.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event of mechanical breakdown, there appears to be some relief afforded by Article 5, in the exemption provided for extraordinary circumstances. However, it is not clear whether an aircraft becoming unavailable for technical reasons qualifies as an extraordinary circumstance. I would ask the Commissioner, therefore, to make it clear that technical reasons – that is, mechanical breakdowns – which affect operational safety, qualify as extraordinary circumstances where they affect what I have termed 'social carriers': shuttle services to islands and peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proviso, of course, is that routine statutory maintenance should have been fully carried out. To that effect, I ask that a suitable definition be inserted into or attached to the regulations so as to ensure that this lifeline, along with many others, is not forced out of business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I thank God that the passengers are not going to have to bear the brunt of the great disputes that I can foresee, on the basis of the current rules, when it comes to defining whether an airline should or should not bear responsibility for a delay. Early this evening, we discussed the Single European Sky. If there are problems with the infrastructure, we are going to have disputes between the airlines, the air traffic controllers and also the companies that manage airports. I hope that we will come up with some workable solutions. Thank God this is not the passengers’ problem, but what I can see coming is that it will be a major problem for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to mention package tours and tour operators. Ever since 1990, these have been covered by a relevant directive, which offers consumers comprehensive protection, and the question arises of whether or not somebody who has booked not merely a flight, but also, and at the same time, a holiday trip, overnight stays or rooms in a hotel, needs additional protection. I take the view that they do not need it, and I am glad that there is support for this position in this House. Having tidied up the rules thirteen years ago, we do not need to add to them now.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me urge you, Commissioner, to take our experience of this lawmaking process as the basis for getting to grips with the international agreement on delays on railways, which is a disaster in terms of its practical application and is also appallingly badly transposed in the Member States, and to propose European rules for compensation payments when trains are delayed. This is where action is urgently needed! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The days of waiting helplessly while airlines cancelled, delayed and overbooked flights will soon be over. After years of letting the airlines make the rules, passengers will finally have a legal right to the standard of customer service they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the amendments, I urge colleagues to vote against Amendment No 21 from the Liberals. They seek to cut compensation, but compensation surely recognises the level of inconvenience, not the level of the fare.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope colleagues will support Amendment No 2. This extends the provision to other modes. I thank the Commissioner for her recent letter to me confirming that she will be taking similar action for high-speed international rail journeys. But what about international ferry journeys and international coach journeys? Will you, Commissioner, support Amendment No 2?</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 18 – league tables – airlines should be named and shamed for poor performance. Commissioner, will you support that Amendment?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to join my southern colleague Mr Booth and speak up for the Isles of Scilly helicopter service. It is an example of a vital link to a group of islands, of which, of course, there are many others throughout the Community. Can we have an assurance, Commissioner, that they will not be penalised for the inevitable technical problems that they encounter from time to time? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very much awaited too, as the fierce competition between companies means the quality of services is still, it has to be said, a cause for considerable criticism. I understand that this is not about over-regulating, but providing a clear framework for dealing with claims and compensation, because passengers are generally ill-informed of their rights in relation to powerful and influential companies, and I support the many speakers who have expressed that point of view. I also know that those same companies are going through a difficult period, particularly since 11 September 2001. However, I would like to ask one or two questions on the problem of refusing boarding. Overbooking is a more correct term, even if it is not very French, because it describes the actual cause, or even the strategy of the companies in some cases, and not just the consequence. But that is a semantic aside.</p>
<p class="contents">During the plenary debate at first reading, the Commission stated that this overbooking was a marginal phenomenon compared with the general flow of air passengers. I would like to know whether we are really certain of that. The Commission says it has figures close to 250 000 passengers refused in 1999, that is, 1.1 per thousand. I am simply wondering about the reliability of these statistics as they are, I suppose, provided by the companies themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason I am asking these questions is that I had a problem less than a month ago on a Nice to Brussels flight with SN Brussels Airlines. Without going into details, as this is not the place, there were six of us on the flight – a regular flight – who were overbooked, while my husband and my 7-year old son, who had the same tickets and booked at the same time with the same agency, boarded the plane. One case among 250 000 others, I imagine. That this is a company strategy – and, of course, it is not the only company to do this – was confirmed to me by the ground staff at the airport and by many consumer associations. I am therefore not so certain that this phenomenon is as marginal as that and I can only welcome, like other speakers before me, the increase, in this new regulation, in the protection of passengers’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal we are debating, however, does not fully comply with that objective, and the amendments tabled weaken the Council common position, which was already, in some ways, a retrograde step in relation to the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the transitory problems currently being experienced by air carriers, and for that reason we feel we must find a balanced solution. We do not feel, however, that those problems justify excluding passengers on package tours from the scope of the protection provided by this regulation, or reducing the protection offered them in the event of cancellation of flights, or removing the opportunity for passengers to exercise their right to reimbursement or re-routing in the event of long delay of flights.</p>
<p class="contents">We realise that there are ‘extraordinary circumstances’ under which one may be led to conclude that air carriers are not always responsible for delayed or cancelled flights.
