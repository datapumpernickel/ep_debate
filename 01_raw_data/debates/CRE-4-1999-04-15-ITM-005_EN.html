<p class="contents">I should indeed like to believe that our practice leads to the annex being adopted by a single majority, but I do not think that this complies with the Rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Rule 135 states that the powers of committees are to be recorded in an annex, but it does not in any way rule out the use of an absolute majority. What is more, as this text defines the powers of the parliamentary committees, it would be something of a paradox if, as has recently been the case, the composition of a relevant committee in a key area – in this case immunities – were to be determined by a difference of just a few votes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like us to look at this matter more closely, as it seems to me that an absolute majority is needed, given that it relates to an amendment of a core element of our Rules of Procedure.</p>

It is a view to which we can give due consideration. However, I have to tell you that I answered very quickly in order to gain time, and also because I had looked into this question before entering the Chamber. Besides this Rule, there is also the tradition in this House that such questions are always decided in the way we currently decide them. If you think there is another issue, we can look at that. However, at this time, I have no reason to change this practice and the way we implement this Rule.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to point out to Mr Fabre‐Aubrespy that he has a strange way of interpreting the Rules of Procedure. In cases where an absolute majority suits him but a simple majority would suffice, he protests; then, where the Rules of Procedure provide for an absolute majority, as in the case of the discharge, he wants a simple majority. We cannot evidently have Rules of Procedure to suit everyone, according to their particular interests.</p>

It goes without saying that these committees cannot be responsible for those forms of discrimination that are a matter for the Committee on Women's Rights. Unfortunately, a number of colleagues have intervened to prevent the adoption of this reasonable motion. I believe that my honourable colleagues were unable to grasp what was at stake here.</p>

<p class="contents">You did not see me, although I was asking to speak in order to make that clear to you before you all took the floor. Since we are now voting about the Committee on Women's Rights, let me spell out that Amendments Nos 1 and 2, which relate to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, naturally cannot and do not in any way imply that these committees should be responsible for the forms of sex discrimination that fall within the remit of the Committee on Women's Rights.</p>

As you are all aware, it is not a matter of making radical changes, rather, as we understand it, of putting things in their place. In other words, according to the initial proposal, this committee would be called the ‘Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism". We propose – and this seems quite natural – that it firstly be called the ‘Committee on Regional Policy", without detracting from the importance of the other two areas. This gives it a more global dimension, which is why I am asking you to vote in favour of this amendment.</p>

I simply want to say that one of the main aims of the Union is to promote economic and social progress by strengthening economic and social cohesion, among other policies. In this respect, we recently voted in favour of bringing Community regional policy and economic and social cohesion under the remit of this committee. Here we are dealing with a horizontal policy as opposed to a sectoral policy and, what is more, one of the tasks recently assigned to this committee is ‘relations with regional and local authorities and with the Committee of the Regions". Parliament, in my opinion, needs to demonstrate the priority it gives to relations with regional and local authorities, which represent the intermediate levels of any power and any institutional political structure. In short, we share our elective nature them. I am therefore calling on the House to vote in favour of keeping the Committee on Regional Policy as the first name of this committee.</p>

We are all in favour of social cohesion. It is a matter of the Rules of Procedure and what they prescribe. We have just unanimously adopted the catalogue of responsibilities: number one is transport, and number two is regional policy. It makes no sense to reverse that decision ten minutes after taking it.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more important is the fact that the wise ladies and gentlemen of this House have justified the amalgamation of the committees by saying that no major legislation would be necessary in the field of regional policy for the next two years.

As usual, when a debate becomes so intense, the great principles put forward to fuel such debate actually have nothing to do with the basic reason for it. Here we have two committees, one for regional action and one for transport, which are due to merge. As a consequence, each is seeking to impose the name of the original committee. There is nothing else at stake in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I should simply like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, following the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, almost all our powers relating to transport will come under the codecision procedure, which seems reason enough to retain the name of the ‘Committee on Transport" as the first name.</p>

I simply wanted to point out that my question was not motivated by personal interest. There are some amendments that were adopted without an absolute majority that I favoured. My question relates solely to Article 142 of the Treaty that states that ‘the European Parliament shall adopt its Rules of Procedure, acting by a majority of its Members". I therefore think that given this vital issue, it would be appropriate to refer this matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, so that it can decide whether or not the annex relating to the powers of the committees can be adopted with a single majority.</p>

<p class="contents">Agreements must be negotiated on a more equitable basis, so that both the EU and the third country derive equivalent benefits. Among the improvements which are needed is a regional approach to fisheries management, which would involve all the coastal states and distant water fishing nations which fish for tuna in the Indian Ocean. The recently‐created Indian Ocean Tuna Commission is a step in the right direction but has not yet begun to assume its management role. The UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which will apply to the tuna and other highly migratory fish stocks, sets out other conditions, including a detailed description of the precautionary approach. This is completely lacking in the Seychelles agreement (we also urge the Member States to speedily ratify this convention – thus far only Italy has done so). The EU must also assume greater responsibility for the activities of its vessels. While this agreement will involve a satellite monitoring system, which is a welcome improvement, such systems by themselves are no guarantee that fishermen will respect the rules. There are important questions of access to the resulting data in real time by the Seychelles. Finally, tuna fishing can involve considerable incidental catch of non‐target fish species, and the EU needs to develop techniques of tuna fishing which do not result in so much discarding.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Liberal amendment, which would serve to eliminate the effective subsidy that these agreements provided to fishermen, the Greens supported it as we feel that distant water fleets should not be so heavily subsidised, especially when there are so many problems with the terms of the agreements under which they operate.</p>

I believe that NATO has basically ignored international law in the action it has taken and that proper efforts were not made to find a peaceful solution. This is not a humanitarian effort, especially when you see what happened last night, when civilians were killed as a result of NATO activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, Parliament was reluctant to address the fact that NATO is hitting civilian targets in Yugoslavia and the fact that it is using cluster‐bombs and depleted uranium in its ammunition. These issues have to be raised. We have to look at respect for all human life. All human life is valuable. We cannot put one human life above another.</p>
<p class="contents">Today in Parliament we voted against supporting the German peace proposal that has been put forward. I also think the British are blocking this proposal. If we can find a peaceful solution, nobody should be pushing for the right to war and to bomb. Two wrongs do not make a right. Parliament has a duty to express its discontent at some of the actions of NATO, in particular the bombing of civilian targets and the use of weapons that are considered by some people as weapons of mass destruction.</p>

Nevertheless, I abstained because of the adoption of the Greens' amendment which sought to tie us down to a solution whereby Kosovo would be autonomous within the Yugoslav borders. Several weeks and months ago, such formulas could certainly have provided a basis for discussion. But they have now been overtaken by developments. Unless the Milosevic regime is removed, such a solution can never be an option. And even if it were removed, the prospects for such a solution would still be slim. It is impossible to force people to live in the same place, in the same state, as the murderers of their families. That is why I believe that this approach is totally divorced from reality. We should not have committed ourselves to a specific solution.</p>
<p class="contents">What is good is that the House has unreservedly supported the military action by NATO, which is necessary, appropriate and justified, as well as the aim of bolstering Serbia's neighbours. One thing, however, seems to be missing from the resolution: it is high time we also sent a strong signal to Croatia, which is a major stabilising factor in the region but has been the victim of what amounts to blinkered disregard on our part. I earnestly appeal for the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Croatia.</p>

<p class="contents">We denounce in the strongest possible terms the policy of ethnic cleansing and the violation of human rights that is being carried out by the Milosevic regime. We express our solidarity, without exception, with all the populations of the region who are suffering the trials and tribulations of a senseless war.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are equally opposed to the logic of the continued and increased use of violence, which not only will not lead to a solution but, on the contrary, stands in the way of resolving the problem. Furthermore, it is clear that not only have the bombardments not prevented ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, they have helped to create a huge wave of refugees and have contributed to the overall destabilisation of the area. It is doubtful whether the military action has thus far had any positive outcome, and it is therefore imperative that a political solution to the problem should be found as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The leading role in this effort must be assumed by the European Union which, together with the United Nations Secretary‐General and the United Nations Security Council, must take the necessary actions to resolve the deadlock. We also believe that a basic condition to finding a solution to the problem is to respect existing borders and the territorial integrity of the states in the region. Only in this way can we prevent a new Balkan crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to finding a political solution to the problem, we regard it as expedient that a new political, economic and humanitarian initiative should be undertaken immediately in relation to the Balkans. Finally, in the present tragic circumstances, it is imperative that an international conference should be convened for the purpose of improving the coordination of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The MEPs of PASOK represent a country which is suffering the direct consequences of the war and which, from the outset of the crisis, has steadfastly come to the aid of the Kosovar Albanians who have been forced to abandon their homes.</p>

His policy of repression, separation, persecution and ethnic cleansing is contrary to all the humanitarian principles, ethical conditions and fundamental liberties which underpin democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU"s highly regrettable inability to present a united front, using its own resources, including military resources, is demonstrated by the antecedents of the present conflict: the break‐up of the former Yugoslavia; unilateral recognition of Croatia and Slovenia; ‘ethnic cleansing" and atrocities by Serbs against Croats and Bosnians and then by Croats against Serbs and so forth; and Milosevic"s success in staying in power. But this intervention by NATO, which was decided without full UN backing and has inadequate means to achieve the declared objectives of neutralising the Serbian military"s capacity to continue with so‐called ‘ethnic cleansing", has not only failed to resolve the issue, it has also aggravated all the problems. Furthermore, the doctrine of the ‘right to humanitarian intervention" – which is making headway but has not been recognised by the United Nations – cannot be imposed by force by a powerful and sophisticated military machine destroying not only military targets but also all the economic infrastructure of a country. At the same time, the creation of a new international legal order with appropriate means for ‘humanitarian intervention" is coming up against the implacable opposition of the major powers, including the United States, with regard to reforming the UN, and the opposition of the United States, Russia, France and China to the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the NATO offensive, instead of isolating the dictator Milosevic and his regime, is in fact having the undesirable effect of building up nationalist unity around him against foreign intervention. To make things worse, this is also having the effect of humiliating Russia, which is a dangerous mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">If the public felt sure that there would only be missile and air‐based attacks, but no ground‐based military forces involving the risk of casualties, it would be able to support the bombing for a certain period as a means of condemning Milosevic"s unjust and abominable regime and his atrocities against the Kosovars. However, even leaving aside the question of dual standards – why not intervene in Turkey, Indonesia, Chechnya, and so on? – this is not the right approach to solving problems of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from extricating ourselves from this situation without damaging the authority of NATO and the EU, and without condoning the atrocities committed by Milosevic, which call for a diplomatic solution involving the UN and Russia, we above all need to stabilise the entire region. That is why I have to say that – as has already been demonstrated – the solution was not to enlarge NATO eastwards, but rather to enlarge the EU and adopt a policy of association and economic support which would promote economic and political integration and combat irredentist nationalism. What is the logic of fighting ETA, Corsican terrorists and the IRA and then supporting the KLA? The EU needs to be able to apply to the Balkans, and to the CEECs in general, the same approach that within its borders has prevented war between Germany and France and has guaranteed peace for over half a century: economic and political integration. That is the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, but no less important, the decision to launch military attacks with predominantly American forces simply highlights the United States" hegemony and the subordinate role of the EU, which if it continues down this road will never have a common foreign and security policy or common defence. Accepting this US hegemony represents a serious attack on the European Union, the consolidation of the euro, and the possibility of the EU being on an equal footing with the US within the World Trade Organisation, as demonstrated by the ‘banana war" at present. Instead of this foolish policy, what we need is to lay the foundations for a partnership of equals with the US, which implies the EU being politically autonomous in its dealings with the US.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I voted against the compromise resolution adopted on Kosovo, and in particular against the immensely hypocritical recital H – which blames the UN for the fact that NATO violated the United Nations Charter – and against paragraph 2, which tries to legitimise the bombing by pretending that it has nothing to do with us. I did this although I approve of the specific points condemning the Milosevic regime and those on aid for refugees and measures designed to stabilise the region. I also voted against despite several positive amendments tabled by the Greens and by Mrs Theorin.</p>

<p class="contents">Without going over the past, to see who started what, I should personally like to take four lessons from the situation for tomorrow"s Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I do not know whether the idea of a multi‐ethnic Kosovo ever had any basis in reality, but I am sure that any such idea is dead today, wiped out by NATO"s bombing campaign. It is difficult to imagine how the Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo will be able to live together in the near future. I do not therefore see how it will be possible to prevent the province from being divided. After all, this will only make us resort to the oldest solution in the world for restoring peace: placing borders between peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, tomorrow"s Europe must show respect for national sovereignty. Some may indeed claim that as a system sovereignty is flawed, but the fact is that throughout history it has proved the only system capable of preventing chaos and arbitrary power that are even greater than those that can be attributed, where possible, to a particular form of sovereignty. Europe, which has a tendency to forget such things, will rediscover this with some bitterness. Incidentally, we will remember that the Serb regime, however much it might be criticised, had never attacked any of its neighbours or any of our allies, unlike the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, if Europe wants to impose the rule of law, it must respect it too. Let us not forget that NATO intervened in the situation without a mandate from the United Nations Security Council, and that the French Parliament was presented with a <span class="italic">fait accompli. </span> These procedures may prove too tedious for some but they would undoubtedly have slowed the process down and enabled more dialogue to take place. They would have also made people realise that in this case the bombings were a simplistic response. They were also a costly response in moral, human and financial terms as well as in terms of the collateral damage that we ourselves will suffer – on top of everything else – without even having come up with a viable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must express our doubts concerning the very principle of a European defence which would involve institutionalising, in military terms, all the operations involving all the Member States. In fact, this is what has just happened to a certain extent with the intervention in Yugoslavia. Have the results of this intervention been so successful that we feel that this approach should become the rule? I do not think so. Rather, each people must retain its free will out of respect for the sovereignty and rule of law that I referred to earlier. If Europe is attacked, then a collective response will take place automatically. However, if it is not attacked, why should countries allow themselves to become recruited in advance into battles they would not have chosen?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to forge alliances and foster cooperation that will generate a joint defence but certainly not a united common defence.</p>

At Rambouillet in fact, according for example to what was said by a number of influential participants, the kind of political circumstances were established that would have allowed other, in my view effective measures which could have prevented the deaths of so many innocent people and the distressing deportation of hundreds of thousands of Kosovars, the victims of Milosevic's crazed nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand that there is a political duty and a duty on the institutions to intervene as matters now stand, and for that reason, while confirming my own position on the conflict, I now support any initiative designed to seek a positive solution from a political, moral and legal standpoint, focusing particularly on the role that the UN, the EU, NATO and Russia can and must fulfil.</p>

For me, war always represents a failure of the spirit, of human spirit and intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I know, and should like to point out, that we have to know how to wage war when the ‘interlocutor/enemy" only understands force and especially if we want to quickly provide diplomacy with the greatest possibility of succeeding.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us never forget that diplomacy actually means using dialogue to persuade one of the sides in a conflict to agree to give up some its initial aims, demands and even rights. The side concerned will only agree to do so if it thinks it might be the target of an attack in the event of a negotiated refusal of this agreement on its part.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, in the case of Serbia and Kosovo, after 10 years of negotiations that were punctuated by human rights violations, rapes, massacres, destruction and deportation – which were always instigated by Milosevic – there was unfortunately no alternative to the use of force to put an end to these crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence, I approve of NATO"s military action. I also approve of the governmental, non‐governmental and European humanitarian activities. I naturally hope that a European diplomatic solution can be found with the support of the United States and Russia, but it must not allow the principles of democracy and human rights to be abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this way, and this way alone, that we will be able to guarantee a lasting and just peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by congratulating the German Presidency on the action it has taken in this crisis, and finally, I should also like to congratulate Emma Bonino, the European Commissioner, on her personal and courageous commitment and her humanitarian passion. The speech she gave at the end of the debate on Wednesday afternoon was one of the high points of the day.</p>

However, it should not prevent us from questioning the absence of a genuine ‘common foreign and security policy" (CFSP) in Europe, which is becoming more regrettable by the day. Nor should it stop us from questioning, in particular, our inability to support the democrats who fought against the barbarous policies of Radovan Karadzic in the past and who are fighting against those of Slobodan Milosevic today.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of all of its promises, Europe did not provide financial and moral support for the democrats in Belgrade when they most needed it, when they were fighting against Milosevic"s domestic and foreign policy, and today they are forced to remain silent and hidden. I am very dismayed to see that at a time when all political parties, with the exception of the extreme right, recognise the new virtues of international law in Pinochet"s arrest, we have continued to hold talks with Milosevic, who has more blood on his hands and more ‘crimes against humanity" on his conscience. It is understandable why the International Criminal Court set up in The Hague is unable to judge all the crimes committed in our time after the event has taken place. But was it necessary to overlook Milosevic"s crimes so soon when the Dayton agreements on Bosnia were signed in 1995?</p>
<p class="contents">Can we negotiate with Milosevic today when the International Criminal Court has itself just accused him – although not publicly – of crimes against humanity? It is because the Hague Court is dealing with the crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia that Karadzic is out of the running and forced into hiding. I was shocked by the publicity‐grabbing handshakes between Mr Primakov and Mgr Tauron, the Vatican envoy, with the criminal Milosevic, while thousands of Kosovars were being expelled from their homes and expatriated by force.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution makes five or six references to Milosevic, but does not say a single word about Ibrahim Rugova, the head of the Democratic League of Kosovo, winner of the European Parliament"s Sakharov Prize in 1998 and one of the Rambouillet negotiators. On three occasions Yugoslav television cameras have shown him in the process of ‘negotiating" with Milosevic. On seeing these pictures, everyone wondered what freedom Rugova enjoyed, while ‘protected" by the Serb police, in a country that has been emptied of its inhabitants. I should like to have seen our resolution invite Rugova to Brussels or Berlin so that he could freely put across his point of view on the present situation and the solutions he envisages.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned about the situation which, through our inaction, is developing on the border between Albania and Kosovo, where the KLA and the Serb army are engaged in repeated clashes which risk spilling over into the countries surrounding Kosovo and eventually into the entire Balkan region. Can NATO retain its credibility if, on the one hand, it bombs Serb military and economic infrastructures, and on the other hand, lets one of the sides in the conflict recruit freely? NATO cannot play a leading role in the conflict and, according to <span class="italic">Le Monde </span> newspaper, be a partner to the KLA, which supplies it with information concerning the Serb positions to be destroyed, be a new international police force with a duty to intervene, and be a humanitarian body. It needs to decides what it wants to be and stick to that decision.</p>

<p class="contents">Of course, we did not seize the opportunity offered by the fall of the Berlin Wall to begin to build a wider political and democratic Europe. Of course, we must regret the failures of the diplomatic efforts made in Rambouillet and in Paris. However, with the best will in the world, we cannot change the past.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the values on which the intervention was based. We support the rights of humans against the rights of a barbaric and totalitarian state which is forcing a terrorised population into exile, destroying houses, and threatening and killing women and children. We support freedom and hope that the criminals will be punished. That is why we give our unreserved support to the courageous decision taken by the European Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">We nonetheless regret that a European presence on the ground was not planned at the same time as the air offensive and that large‐scale humanitarian action was not envisaged to cope with the floods of destitute refugees thrown out onto the streets.

<p class="contents">Never has a state that is a signatory to the United Nations Charter experienced an act of aggression by the international community such as the one perpetrated for eight years against Yugoslavia at the instigation of the United States and Germany. A flood of unprecedented media propaganda has undeniably created a completely false impression of the Balkan crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of integrating the former Yugoslavia into the Union and thus promoting its process of political democratisation and economic progress, the European Union, with the European Parliament leading the way, has encouraged its break‐up and created – at least indirectly – the conditions for the wars in Croatia and Bosnia in the past and in Serbia today.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made Bosnia"s borders sacred and prevented the Bosnian Serbs from establishing links once again with Serbia. Now we are waging war on Serbia to allow the Kosovar Albanians to establish links once again with Albania. Make of this what you will.</p>
<p class="contents">We wanted international society to be subject to the rule of law, and now, in the most humiliating fashion, we are giving our consent to a strike by the Americans who have received no mandate from the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">By playing with international borders – Yugoslavia"s since 1991, and Macedonia"s and Albania"s in the future – by disregarding the lessons of the past, by pretending to ignore Russia"s role in the region, by seeking a military knock‐out instead of a political solution, and by trying, in particular, to cut the Serbian people off from Europe, which they have done so much for, we will undoubtedly provoke the very conflagration we claim we want to avoid. When the time comes, those who are consciously involved in this undertaking will have to face up to their responsibilities.</p>

They simply express regret at the loss of human life and the ‘collateral damage".</p>
<p class="contents">This majority does not seem to be interested in re‐establishing peace to pave the way for political negotiations or an immediate end to military aggression against a sovereign state. No, this majority prefers to justify NATO"s intervention, the subservience of the EU and its Member States in the face of American strategic interests and a lack of respect for order, for international rights and for the United Nations Charter. These Members prefer to defend the escalation of the war and the approval of a political approach which is bound to jeopardise negotiated solutions and the resolution of key issues concerning autonomous regions and their ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">This majority seems to be blind to the fact that NATO"s military aggression is the cause of the dramatic deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the Balkans, that it is putting the political future of that region at risk and seriously endangering world peace. They prefer to insist on agreements which have never been accepted by the negotiators, but have simply been imposed by NATO and are jeopardising sovereignty, borders and ancestral facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution adopted by Parliament today will go down in the political history of this House as the centrepiece of a total failure of political memory, typical of the political hysteria now being generated by media manipulation in the interests of those who gain from war and aggression, and ignoring the values of peace, justice and the sovereignty of nations.</p>

The opinions and proposals it contains do very little to help find a peaceful, political and viable solution to the crisis or even to the particularly tragic problem of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the motion for a resolution claims that the UN and the Security Council ‘could not" (!) be involved in the NATO decision to carry out aerial sorties, whilst it is clear that this decision was taken in violation of the principles of the UN which, in this case, was irreparably shamed and humiliated. The claim that this treatment of the UN occurred because two Members of the Security Council blocked NATO activities (as they have the right to do under the UN charter) is a monument to high‐handedness and a dangerous example of a totalitarian notion: that the UN is useful only when it agrees with NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this background, any reference to the idea of an ‘international community" is superfluous and unacceptable. Reference to an Atlantic community suffices. It is verging on the ridiculous for the motion for a resolution (paragraph 3) to call for the implementation of UN resolutions or (paragraph 4) to welcome the ‘initiative taken by UN Secretary‐General Kofi Annan", without making a single reference to the content of this initiative!</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution calls for priority to be given to human rights over national sovereignty concerns. Who will interpret this just principle and who will implement it? Will it be NATO, with the same lack of credibility and the same self‐interest with which it interpreted and ‘implemented" the principles of the UN? Perhaps it will be done by each state according to its own intermittent needs and aspirations? These are the dangerous posturings of hair‐brained advisors who, in drafting the motion for a resolution, have trivialised any serious effort to construct a real international order and community that is capable of implementing such principles in a credible and viable way, without selective interventions and the irrational use of violence. For NATO interventions and the preferences of the authors of the motion for a resolution are indeed selective. If they were not, upon reading the motion for a resolution, fear and terror would have enveloped Turkey, Indonesia, Latin America and Africa.</p>

Taking a terrifyingly superficial approach and showing a lack of historical understanding and disregard for detail, the European Union governments have taken our countries into this war from which we cannot now withdraw.</p>
<p class="contents">It is most distressing that, dancing to the tune of the national governments, the European Parliament too should be acquiescing in this highly dangerous enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">The war unleashed by NATO cannot rely on justification. There is no legal justification for it. International rules have been ignored and the international institutions have been sidelined. And so this is ethical warfare. If the intention was to invent the principle of selective humanitarian intervention, why strike at Milosevic for ethnic cleansing but ignore the Kurdish question in Turkey and open the door to disturbing scenarios in Europe's trouble spots: Corsica, Ireland and the Basque country?</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a ‘humanitarian" war, the effect of which has simply been to achieve anti‐humanitarian objectives by encouraging the campaign of ethnic cleansing and the slaughter of defenceless civilians in Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">’Collateral damage" – that is the language NATO uses to describe the loss of civilian life: for centuries to come, the Balkans will have to endure this so‐called collateral damage, given that the depleted uranium contained in NATO weapons has already contaminated Yugoslav territory, thereby automatically preventing the Kosovars from returning to their country unless they want to risk sickness, deformity and death from radioactive contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">From that point of view, no European country is safe: if the wind gets up, the ultra‐fine uranium powder will be transported to Italy, Germany, Hungary and the whole of Europe, with the same deadly effects that occurred in Saudi Arabia as a result of the pollution caused in Iraq during the Gulf War.</p>

<p class="contents">Some claim that it amounts to a failure on the part of ‘Europe" and it would certainly appear that unleashing a war under NATO command suggests an ‘absence of Europe". These people solely lay the blame for the situation on ‘American imperialism" which they believe has forced the allies into action and is set to keep them under its iron rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, US military intervention is not without its ulterior motives. We are well aware of Washington"s desire to establish the Alliance"s credibility following the disappearance of the common enemy that gave rise to it. What is more, the way in which the Americans behaved at the Rambouillet talks gives the impression that they did not do everything possible to help the parties reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to merely focus on this issue would be to forget the fact that NATO"s military action against Yugoslavia is first of all the result of a unanimous European will, which was apparent at the Berlin summit and which was welcomed and hailed by federalists as the veritable birth of the CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">Waging war under the guise of NATO does not therefore reveal an absence of European policy, but rather a flawed European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not an isolated action. This political error is entrenched in a rationale that goes back to the choices made by an entire generation of European leaders following the fall of the Berlin Wall. They chose a small western Europe that is rigid and inaccessible, and whose characteristics were defined by the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties. They rejected the idea of a wider, flexible and welcoming Europe that could hope to include all those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that had just regained their sovereignty after decades of totalitarianism.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of inventing a Europe with variable geometry that offered new opportunities to all of the continent"s states to coexist through cooperation, these European leaders stubbornly pursued the Monnet method, with its established dogma, without realising that it was no longer the most appropriate way of uniting the very diverse countries of the new European continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Union, there has been considerable reluctance to admit that we needed to seriously reconsider the objectives and methods of European integration. The ‘Monnet method" has been adhered to in the belief that our economies must be united in order to allow us to imperceptibly abandon our political sovereignty. When applied to the countries of Eastern Europe, this boils down to postponing indefinitely their membership of the club. All we have done is merely offer the countries of Central and Eastern Europe a waiting room and a timetable for admission which is constantly pushed further into the distance like a mirage, leading to exclusion, discrimination, frustration and humiliation. The promotion of this outmoded notion of Europe has discouraged, weakened and marginalised the leaders in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, who have emerged as a result of dissidence, and the reformers who now look to us for answers. It has also restored prestige in men who have emerged from totalitarian regimes, of which Milosevic is the archetype.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure to create the permanent forum for a wider Europe, that would have enabled us to immediately engage in open cooperation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe on such key issues as security and foreign policy, shows that our continent is once again becoming divided.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in Yugoslavia is the tragic symbol of this new division in Europe: it embodies it and accentuates it. We are actually seeing a Slavonic Europe seeking to organise itself without us, a Ukraine that has decided to become a nuclear power after it initially decided against doing so, and a Yugoslavia that has adopted a draft Slavonic union with Russia and Belarus. We are also seeing Serbs rallying round Milosevic in the name of their violated homeland – in spite of the fact that most of them once rejected him – and the manifestation of an orthodox sense of solidarity in their disapproval of the Atlantic military action.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the fruits of NATO"s military intervention are particularly bitter. The Slavonic and orthodox worlds are moving further away, whereas they should constitute a vital component of the continental Europe we must build today. The legitimacy of borders is being called into question. The Balkans are at each other"s throats and we are seeing two Europes re‐emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put an end to this spiral of destabilisation at all costs and as quickly as possible. This does not simply mean stopping the bombs that give rise to hatred; we also have to develop a new concept of Europe, one that is applicable to the whole of the continent. This should involve a family of nations called on to live side by side in a spirit of trust, with their identities restored and recognised, and with mutual respect. This vital redefinition of our concept of Europe will be the best possible preventive policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite containing a number of useful recommendations, the motion for a resolution tabled by various groups does not look at the situation in this context, although it is essential. Indeed, by proposing in recital J to weaken and exclude the notion of national sovereignty which, however flawed it may be, still constitutes the fundamental regulatory principle of our international community, it introduces an element that would only have extremely destabilising and disturbing consequences for international life. That is why we were unable to vote in favour of the resolution.</p>

It is essential that internationally accepted standards of human rights take precedence over national sovereignty. That will entail changes in international law. Some of this change must come about within the United Nations, but the permanent members of the Security Council have yet to address such an option. The international community itself must function in full compliance with the provisions of international law. We cannot therefore support a motion advocating endorsement of the NATO bombardments. This would create a precedent, with serious consequences for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has stumbled into a war which has produced a million refugees, and there is no evidence of any policy to extricate ourselves from the crisis. The EU"s prime agenda now must be to work for a political solution; to put a end to ethnic cleansing; to support the refugees; to stop the bloodbath; and to provide realistic possibilities for the refugees to return. It is not enough for the EU to be welcoming Kofi Annan"s offer to mediate and bring an end to this conflict. The EU also has a duty to reinstate the UN as the paramount body for overseeing the rule of law in the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union should call for a peace‐keeping force under UN auspices, involving Russian peace‐keeping troops, so that the ethnic Albanians can return to their homeland.</p>
