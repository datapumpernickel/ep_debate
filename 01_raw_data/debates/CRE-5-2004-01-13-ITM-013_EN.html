Yet, with the vote tomorrow and the conclusion of the second reading, we can say that the process is essentially concluded with the agreement of all those concerned. It must be said that the initial Commission text radically reformed the provisions in question, yet the amendments made to the original text were not at all minor. The definition of ‘surfactant’, additional tests, the derogation from authorisation, labelling, more and better information for consumers, are all aspects that genuinely broaden environmental protection and human health protection and that take into consideration the well-being of animals within the context of research for the development of products.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be stressed that the text in question considers the difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the procedures have been simplified, without disregarding the necessary protection. I will not expand any further my explanation of the text that I hope Parliament will tomorrow be able to adopt with a large majority. Instead, I would like to thank all the groups and their shadow rapporteurs who, during this long phase, drew up the text in question after very effective dialogue. I feel that everyone can find reason to be satisfied with aspects or sections of the text in terms of what was constructively contributed and that they will, therefore, find they can agree with the overall text in terms of the afore-mentioned assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to thank the Commission for being willing to reconsider its proposals and for the commitment there was to harmonise a text, which is certainly not easy, to make it satisfactory in view of all the respective points of view. I must add that, even when faced with a continuous exchange of proposals and with understanding everyone’s demands, we also prepared a legislative product with the Commission that met with broad satisfaction. It is true that an important contribution was also made to this text by the Council, which, faced with the immense commitment of the Italian Presidency that has just come to an end, effectively followed the text’s progress and intervened at once, just when it seemed that the common position, which was aimed precisely at opening a second reading, would be delayed; nor do I want to forget the commitment and interest shown by the Irish Government delegation long before it assumed the current Presidency, thus showing a real desire to best define the text in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, as a signal of the long road together, I refuse to believe that the only point on which there seem to be differences can really be a reason to start the conciliation procedure. I am referring to the provision for revision where the Commission commits to providing Parliament and the Council with a report on the anaerobic biodegradation of surfactants and on the biodegradation of other components within five years, and to put forward proposals on phosphates within three years. The problem, however, does not seem to be so much this, but the possibility of this happening in the next parliamentary term, and this because the standard phrase on the entry into force of the current regulation would, in fact, prevent the afore-mentioned commitment being made good within the next parliamentary term. As we know, compromise texts have been presented on which there is, as has been said, general agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution to the problem that I have just explained is contained in the afore-mentioned texts. I am sure that all of the groups will be happy with this solution and, appealing to the Commission, I would like to hope that the matter could be happily resolved so as to conclude a somewhat problematic procedure in a generally satisfactory manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The second reading has proceeded very rapidly despite the number of issues that remained to be resolved. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Nobilia, for the special effort he has made, personally, in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is pleased that this proposal is now entering its final stages. The proposal was made with two broad aims in mind: to improve the protection provided to the environment and to consumers while, at the same time, maintaining and improving the single market in detergents.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal modernises the legislation on detergents in three major respects. Firstly, it introduces more stringent tests for the biodegradability of surfactants. Secondly, it extends the scope of the legislation to include all types of surfactants. Thirdly, it introduces labelling requirements for the benefit of consumer health.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be recalled that this proposal simplifies EU legislation by replacing five directives and one Commission recommendation by a single regulation. It is therefore genuine simplification; there is a lot of talk in this field, but not much action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does, however, regret that Parliament has chosen to emphasise national measures on detergents in a proposal for Community legislation one of the aims of which was to expand the harmonised area and promote the single market. The proposed regulation nevertheless represents a significant step forward in terms of stricter testing and extending the legislative scope regarding surfactants, as well as better information for the consumer. These aspects are what we should concentrate on at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the Commission's and Parliament's joint interest that the text should be definitively adopted before the end of the current parliamentary term. The prospects of doing so are good if we can agree to put aside minor issues and concentrate on securing the main benefits. The Commission therefore supports the compromise package that the rapporteur has proposed; this means Amendments 30 to 37. Consequently, the Commission cannot accept any of the other amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that in this final phase, we have been able to reach agreement on seven important compromise amendments, and I can tell you that after critical appraisal, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will support all seven amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am very pleased that we are able to maintain national measures on detergents. In your country, for example, there are already substantial bans in place on the use of phosphates, as there are in mine. I think this is the right approach, because it means that countries wishing to take this further will not now be prevented from doing so; nor will they actually have to turn the clock back. Instead, they can retain their current successful standards. I think this sends out a positive signal for environmental policy, and an especially positive signal for the enlargement of the European Union. The amendment with the five-year period – the experts know what this is – will remain, but on the whole, my group will support the three years in the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important that this regulation genuinely strikes the right balance as regards derogations, and I am pleased that there are virtually no derogations on the implementing obligations. I am also pleased that in other areas where, knowing that derogations are necessary, we have been courageous enough to provide them, namely for smaller manufacturers of specialised detergents for industrial use, which after all have had to seek out a niche market where general detergents are not used, such as hospitals and industrial kitchens. I think that we have been successful here in weighing up all the various aspects of sustainability – environmental, economic and social.</p>
<p class="contents">About ten years ago, the mountains of foam on our rivers were the trigger for amending the legislation on phosphates in water. We have genuinely moved a step forward. I am very pleased that we are no longer adopting an ‘end of pipe’ approach by focussing on water purification processes but are establishing innovative rules in Europe on the initial discharge of substances. What is more, we are doing so not only with the heavy hand of the law, Alexander, but by adopting innovative approaches in order to encourage our companies to continue their work here. I think this approach has been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">One point that applies to us all remains unresolved. The legislator can impose conditions only on quantities and products; he cannot regulate the use of washing powders and detergents. If the same amount of washing powder is used for one kilo of laundry as for five kilos, this is where the real environmental pollution arises. There is still a great deal of work to be done here to raise awareness among Europe’s consumers, and I include myself in that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council common position offers the basis for an acceptable compromise and yet sufficient account was not taken of some of the areas that were debated and adopted by Parliament at first reading. Therefore, I too believe that this balance should be improved upon, in light of the fundamental objectives of this regulation: health, consumer safety and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that were re-tabled by my group, with the agreement of the rapporteur, seek to guarantee that these objectives are achieved, in the interests of the key principles of the environmental strategy: the precautionary principle, the ‘polluter pays’ principle and the substitution principle. Limiting the scope of the regulation to just the biodegradation of surfactants contained in detergents does not run counter to these principles. In fact, I believe that anaerobic biodegradation, biodegradation of main non-surfactant organic ingredients and the use of phosphates – this in particular – should be subject to special control as a substance that is subsidiary to the detergents regulation. The committee is almost unanimous in its call for a new legislative proposal to be presented that seeks to gradually ban these substances or to limit specific use to three years from the publication of the current regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what has been agreed in advance by the representatives of Parliament and the Council in view of the attempt to conclude the legislative process at second reading, a package that I consider to be reasonable, above all for swift adoption of the regulation. I therefore believe that adopting any other amendment that moves away from this compromise offers a rather narrow margin for improvement, if it does not jeopardise the entire regulation. I therefore agree that Parliament must not deviate from this balance, and it would be ironic if it were to do so when reviewing the environmental significance of the provision.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains for me to do, finally, is to congratulate the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups for their willingness and their commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Proposals to enable individual Member States to retain and introduce stricter rules in this area, as quite a few Member States have already done, are particularly important to us. One of the main issues is that of the need to cease using phosphates. There are sound arguments for stopping using them immediately. We know that phosphates lead to serious eutrophication. In the marine environment, for example, they give rise to major environmental problems. We know that there are perfectly satisfactory substitutes and that countries have in practice phased out the use of phosphates.</p>
<p class="contents">In politics, there is sometimes a conflict between what is politically possible and what is desirable. We have therefore chosen to support a compromise that is politically feasible, that is to say to phase out phosphates over three years. Ideally, they should be phased out straight away. We shall try to choose both routes. We shall vote in favour of the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to phase phosphates out immediately, but we believe that it will be the political compromise that will be adopted in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I only have one minute, I shall have to be brief. There is, in fact, only one major problem left, namely that of phosphates. Phosphate-free detergents are compulsory in a number of countries; this may be on the basis of a voluntary agreement with the producers, or, sometimes on the basis of legislation. However, in some countries of the old Fifteen, such as Spain, there are still detergents available that contain phosphates. In a whole host of new countries that are soon to join, sometimes two-thirds of the detergents still contain them. It would be very simple to replace these, and this is, in actual fact, what the Commission should have suggested a long time ago. I also understand that the Commission has prepared a proposal to that effect. What, then, is stopping the Commission from producing this proposal now rather than waiting for three years?</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a question for the Commission. Is it true that one country, namely France, has blocked the compromise? Had it not done so, this entire sitting would have been unnecessary and we would have reached a compromise a long time ago. I should like to have an answer to this question. Is it only France that has blocked the compromise? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the assessment of detergents, this legislation takes the environmental and health effects sufficiently into consideration. Agreement has been reached on exemptions, phosphates and labelling, and I have shown my support by co-signing the compromise amendments. Particularly with regard to phosphates, it is to be welcomed that Member States can ban these, as a few have already done. A ban on phosphates also has the positive effect that it limits the spreading of harmful cadmium into the environment, since cadmium is released when phosphates are extracted.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent conclusion reached by the scientific committee on toxicology, ecotoxicology and the environment, however, has sparked a reconsideration of an EU-wide ban on phosphates. The scientific committee has demonstrated the harmful environmental effects of phosphates and rubberstamped the alternatives. I should like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am pleased that agreement has been reached on labelling. It should be enough to display simple texts on products approved following thorough evaluation. If consumers are curious to know more, they should consult the manufacturers via their websites and telephone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal is a consolidation and modernisation of five existing directives, as the Commissioner has told us, to form one regulation concerning the biodegradability of surfactants, which are essential substances used in detergents as catalysts to break down the surface tension of the liquid in which they are dissolved, for example oil or grease floating on top of a washing-up bowl. The focus is on solving the problem of foam caused by surfactants in our water systems. A major error in the installation of dishwashers and washing machines over the years – certainly in my country and, I suspect, elsewhere – has contributed greatly to this problem of foam in water systems. These appliances are often wrongly connected by householders to surface-water drains leading directly to rivers rather than to so-called foul drains, which channel the run-off to water treatment plants, thereby causing unnecessary pollution in water courses.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonisation of detergents legislation across the Community in this regulation will ensure a level playing field and is in line with the Lisbon proposals. It will also take into account the principles of sustainable or environmentally friendly development set out in the Gothenburg strategy. The costs of a cleaner environment and water supply are difficult to quantify, however. This integrated two-pronged approach, which marries environmental and economic concerns, is a positive departure.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this proposal both because it provides greater information for consumers – particularly those who suffer from allergies – and because it lays down a high level of product safety through increased transparency and producer responsibility enforced by a system of national sanctions for non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">All concerned – manufacturers, national authorities, consumers – hold a stake in the process and stand to benefit from the regulation. In addition, as well as the rightful emphasis on biodegradability of surfactants, I welcome the change in the review clause in the compromise package to give priority to exploring possible needs for phosphates legislation within three years rather than five. There is a need for phosphate-free detergents.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies in my country have established a statistically robust cause-effect link between eutrophication, or algal bloom, which has an enormous detrimental effect on water quality and aquatic ecosystems, and phosphorous concentration. A recent survey in Ireland showed that, while Irish freshwaters are still markedly less polluted than the European average, up to 30% of river length has been contaminated by phosphates. Our government regulations were introduced in 1999 to counter this trend, which has been cited repeatedly since the 1980s as the main problem in Irish freshwaters. However, this problem must be examined at European level in line with the directive on dangerous substances in water and under the EU water framework directive launched in October 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to echo the support expressed by the Irish presidency for the compromise package agreed by the Italian presidency, the Commission and the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank the rapporteur for the work he has done on this. The process for reaching a compromise has been very useful and speedy. However, like so many others, I endorse it with some reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years we have seen, at least in Western Europe, the levels of phosphate in drinking water fall by between 50% and 80%. It has dropped steadily since the 1980s. One of the biggest reasons for that has been the control of detergents. Now we are opting for even tougher laws, I hope. We are going to see them applied over a wider area, from Limerick – which Mrs Doyle knows very well – to new places such as Latvia, Nicosia and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. We can expect that all the rivers that drain into the Baltic and the North Sea will become cleaner. There will be far fewer bubbles in the rivers of Europe than Europeans have in their baths.</p>
<p class="contents">These new measures, in terms of labelling of detergents and ensuring that they break down into safe components when they are discharged in the water, are not quite enough. This issue could quite simply be resolved and in many ways improved by the removal of phosphates from our laundry wash. This is something that we have not managed to do in this proposal. I believe that it is something that Parliament would like to see happen and something which we feel the Commission still has to address.</p>
<p class="contents">Something not mentioned by other colleagues is the continued use of animal tests to assess detergents. The practice cannot be accepted for much longer. The Commission must set out a clear timescale for the development of replacement tests. It is long overdue. The Commission appears to have missed its chance yet again. Nevertheless I, like everyone else, will support the compromise tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that a surprisingly sound piece of work has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an important report for the environment, but it also addresses a major and important consumer issue because detergents are important items of daily use. Consumers need to be given full and adequate information so that they can direct developments in the market by choosing environmentally friendly products.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to phosphates, it is argued in Sweden, where we still have a number of detergents containing phosphates, that, firstly, we have sewage treatment works to deal with the phosphates and, secondly, that the alternatives are not entirely free from problems. I have accepted these arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendments Nos 40-46, now being tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we take as our starting point the Scientific Committee’s statement that phosphates cause major problems and that the existing alternatives do not cause these problems. That being said, I believe it is time genuinely to ban phosphates if they are so dangerous and if they pollute the Mediterranean etc. Let us not wait for that to happen. I should therefore like us to vote in favour of these amendments so that the Commission can put forward a proposal concerning the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are indeed moving towards the welcome modernisation of the legal framework concerning monitoring the biodegradability of detergents, which dates back to the early 1970s. Please allow me, however, to register my disappointment as regards two points that I consider to be especially relevant and sensitive.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is about the need to harmonise legislation on additional labelling, especially the banning of images likely to increase the risk of detergents being ingested, such as images of fruit or other food products. These images are particularly dangerous for children, because their eye-catching nature increases the risk of children ingesting them. The system currently in force only bans dangerous substances and preparations, which is clearly inadequate. I therefore suggest that we go further to protect consumers, especially the most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to express my incomprehension at the imposition in the regulation of national, non-harmonised testing methods, without any timetable for their publication being built into the regulation. I feel that in all of these aspects the solutions we have found are far from ideal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to come back to the issue of phosphates, which was raised by a number of Members. We must remember that fertilisers are a very important source of phosphates: about 50% come from fertilisers. Years ago, in the country which I know well, I proposed taxation on fertilisers high in phosphates. That solved the problem to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="contents">In many countries the authorities have acted. The use of phosphates in detergents is effectively banned by means of national legislation or voluntary agreements in Member States that have deemed such measures necessary. National measures currently exist in the majority of Member States and, in some cases, they have been in place for many years. That is why the Commission will now concentrate on ensuring that any proposal in this area has a secure scientific basis and that it has an added value at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scientific Committee found that the consultants' report on phosphates was seriously lacking in some respects – for example concerning the impact of alternatives – and it is has identified a number of other areas for which data is still lacking. I want to assure you that the Commission is fully committed to filling these data gaps as rapidly as possible and to proposing whatever measures may be justified on that basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
