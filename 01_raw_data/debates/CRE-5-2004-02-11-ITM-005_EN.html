I shall have to be frank and say that prospects for progress in the short term are not overly encouraging. Nevertheless, the European Union continues to attach great importance to this issue and as presidency we shall play an active role in international peace efforts and in particular as a member of the international Quartet comprising the European Union, Russia, the United States and the United Nations, we will be energetic in pursuing this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Foreign Minister, in his capacity as President of the Council, visited Israel and Egypt on 14-18 January 2004. He met the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Israel and paid a courtesy call to the President of Israel. In his meetings, Minister Cowen pointed out that the status quo was not sustainable and that progress must be made on the implementation of the roadmap. He suggested that if initial steps envisaged in phase one of the roadmap are proving too great, then perhaps smaller steps might be taken as a means of building confidence in the region. The Israeli side showed some interest in these ideas. Similar suggestions had been made to the Palestinian Foreign Minister, Dr Nabil Sha'ath, during the course of a visit to Dublin on 9 January. These ideas also attracted support from the President and Foreign Minister of Egypt, and the Secretary General of the Arab League.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr Qurei, visited Dublin last Monday and his discussions with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister included further discussions of these ideas. The meetings were conducted in a very cordial atmosphere and the discussions were wide-ranging and frank. The Palestinian Prime Minister briefed his Irish interlocutors on the preparations being made for a meeting with the Prime Minister of Israel. He said that he is willing to meet Prime Minister Sharon at a mutually convenient time. He also announced a number of positive measures which the Palestinian Government is taking, or will shortly take. These included the continued return of Palestinian police to the streets; firm action to end incitement; and an unequivocal statement reaffirming the stated Palestinian position on Israel's right to exist in peace and in security.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Qurei also outlined the work of the Palestinian Elections Commission, which is preparing for elections in the Palestinian Territory in the coming months. He also urged that the Quartet have the Israeli Government stop the building of the wall, because continuing construction would lead to the undermining of the roadmap and the two-state solution, in addition to the human catastrophe for the Palestinian people's way of life that the wall entails.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that the construction by Israel of a separation wall which extends deep into Palestinian territories is a major obstacle to progress and peace in that region. This has been the subject of statements by the European Union and others who have urged Israel to consider the long-term consequences of this construction. I need hardly say that the wall figured prominently in the discussions which the President of the Council had in Israel two weeks ago and that the Israeli attitude was regrettably uncompromising.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 October 2003, the Member States of the European Union and the acceding states co-sponsored a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly. That resolution called on Israel to stop and reverse construction of the wall and asked the United Nations Secretary-General to report on Israeli compliance. When at the end of November the Secretary-General reported that there was no evidence of Israeli compliance, the General Assembly adopted a resolution asking the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in occupied Palestinian territory. This resolution was adopted on 8 December 2003. On that occasion the European Union abstained in the vote. The decision to abstain was taken after intense consultations and was based on the conviction of many Member States that transferring the matter of the wall to a legal forum would do nothing to advance the political process necessary for peace. Abstention did not in any way suggest that the European Union's position that the wall was in contravention of international law had changed – quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">On receiving the resolution of the General Assembly, the Court invited Member States of the United Nations to submit statements or information to the Court which might be of assistance in its deliberations. Some Member States of the European Union felt that it would be desirable for a common position to be submitted to the Court. Other states had a strong preference for individual national submissions to the Court. After considerable discussion – including at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 26 January – it was agreed that there would be a presidency submission on behalf of the Union and that individual Member States might make national submissions based on established European Union positions. The presidency had forwarded the texts of presidency statements to the United Nations General Assembly on 20 October and 8 December. These were transmitted to the Registrar of the International Court of Justice in The Hague by the Irish Ambassador on 30 January. The written submissions of all interested parties – including the Israelis and the Palestinians – have now been received by the Court. It is expected that oral submissions will commence on 23 February and that the Court will deliver its advisory opinion to the General Assembly sometime between late May and late July.</p>
<p class="contents">Amid the gloom prevalent in the region, there have been some small signs of hope. The Geneva Initiative promoted by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abed Rabo is a welcome indication that rational discussion between senior people on both sides is possible. This plan points to some ways in which the difficult final status issues – such as Jerusalem and the right of return of refugees – might be addressed. I was pleased to see that the authors were recently in Brussels to brief the European Union's High Representative, Dr Solana. Other initiatives among civil society representatives are also in train involving academics, political figures and former military and intelligence officers. This will serve to show that dialogue is possible, even on very difficult and emotional issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also encouraged by suggestions that the Arab League may move to reiterate its initiative adopted at the Beirut Summit almost two years ago. This idea, advanced by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, was that, in return for Israel’s withdrawal to the 1967 boundaries, relations with all Arab neighbours would be normalised. Normalisation would involve de jure recognition of Israel by the entire membership of the Arab League, the establishment of diplomatic relations, the establishment of trade links and the opening of possibilities for technical and investment exchanges in all sectors. At the time this proposal received insufficient attention in Israel, but with the roadmap on the table this initiative could prove to be complementary. It might also serve to reassure Israel as to the wisdom of proceeding towards a peace agreement with its neighbours, Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the leaders of the Arab League to use the opportunity of their forthcoming summit meeting to advance the prospect of normalisation to Israel once again. They should emphasise their desire for a comprehensive peace, which can only be of benefit to all the countries of the region. I would also urge the Israeli leadership to consider carefully the benefits and advantages which they could reap from a normal relationship with their wider neighbourhood and assuming their proper role in their natural economic and political region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to assure this House that the search for a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, based on the well-established positions of the European Union, is a priority of the Irish presidency and that we shall make every attempt to take the roadmap forward and to convince the parties to the conflict to make the necessary efforts to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for the benefit of all the peoples and States of the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament has on various occasions adopted opinions on this subject – on the political appropriateness of this wall, on its legality, on the new scenario it has created in terms of potential future arrangements on the part of the Israelis, on the hardship that it involves for many Palestinians, and on the illusion of security that the wall creates for Israel. We have already made our views clear on all these aspects, and I do not wish to cover the same ground again here.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue we need to resolve today is where we stand as regards the hearing in the International Court of Justice on the Israeli wall. I would first like to thank the Irish Presidency for their observations and for clarifying what the EU's position has been, on what occasions and for what reasons. Let us look at the United Nations General Assembly resolution for which the legal basis was the 'Uniting for Peace' formula. I in fact believe that from a legal point of view this was not an appropriate legal basis, because the Security Council was indeed in a position to deal with this and in fact did so, and I therefore think that it was right for the EU to abstain in the vote on this, no doubt for legal reasons. However, the statement issued by the presidency at that time also had a political flavour. If you will permit me, I shall quote the relevant sentence in English: 'The EU believes that the proposed request for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice will not help the efforts of the two parties to relaunch a political dialogue and is therefore inappropriate.' So the consequence was that the EU of 15 abstained. It is my belief that we should not underestimate this issue in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">We should take political steps towards reviving talks between the Israelis and Palestinians and reactivating the roadmap, which is moribund, so that we do not completely lose sight of the consequences of this security wall and also the resolution of the main issue. I can see little point in our having a debate on legal issues here if it runs counter to the ruling of the International Court of Justice. The ruling of the International Court of Justice is that there can be no trial if a state involved in a dispute before the Court does not accept its jurisdiction. And Israel has specifically stated that it does not wish to appear before the International Court of Justice with regard to this. I therefore believe that political initiatives are far more important, and that the only way we can get the security wall removed or even, as a first step, make it easier for people to cross, is for us to really put pressure on everyone involved to assume their responsibilities and to honour the commitments which they have after all entered into in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the presidency to the extent that it is holding the line followed by the European Union up to now. I welcome the fact that the presidency intends to hold intensive talks and that we – although the European Union has unfortunately not so far really played a leading role or a truly pivotal one – will in practice be able to bring our influence to bear on everyone involved in the process, by adopting a balanced stance, a stance whereby both sides will see us as an honest broker. However, if that is not the case, and if we continue to play a merely ancillary role, I believe that the parties will not have the confidence in us that we need if we are in all honesty to play a role here. The money that we are making available to the region will not by itself win us influence. We need to speak with a single political voice and endeavour to make a contribution in that way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, this barrier is a moral outrage and a political mistake. I fear, however, we are running the risk of putting up a different kind of barrier. I feel we are creating a smokescreen by spending our time on this matter instead of exerting the pressure, force and political will required to really push the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This notorious barrier certainly does hinder the creation of a Palestinian state. Nevertheless, the existence of the settlements also makes the establishment of a viable state impossible. Further, the absence of any political will to act appropriately represents a far greater impediment to the creation of such a state.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to point out that a number of other significant smokescreens are also emerging. There is, for example, the recent announcement made by the Bush administration that it is preparing a grand plan to restructure the Arab-Islamic world and to bring it under the umbrella of Western security. Now it seems that extreme right-wingers in the US are referring to a great restructured Middle East as their main foreign policy priority. This, they say, will facilitate the ending of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">To be frank, I cannot take seriously a plan claiming to bring about democracy and prosperity from Morocco to Pakistan overnight. Rather, I think this plan is another attempt to distract public opinion in the run up to the November presidential elections. This same public opinion has now realised that President Bush’s electoral imperatives take priority over the supposed intentions to advance the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this supposed grand plan for the Middle East could make the Israel-Palestinian conflict appear less central. There seems to be a suggestion that the European Union be involved in the plan. It should be remembered that the European Union is a key player in the Barcelona process. This process will not succeed, at least not fully, until there is an end to the confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p class="contents">The other smokescreen is the one currently being created by Prime Minister Sharon. The latter is forever announcing painful concessions he never implements. He has proved unable to remove the illegal settlements in the West Bank. I have in mind the small number of caravans scattered across a few hills on the West Bank. He is now saying that the Gaza townships will be abandoned. I am quite prepared to give Prime Minister Sharon the benefit of the doubt for the time being. It is to be hoped, however, that this grand plan does not turn out to involve relocating the Gaza settlers in the West Bank enclaves. The latter constitute the real impediment to the viability of the Palestinian State the Quartet hopes will be established. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the security threat to Israel is also very serious. It is fair to ask why, if the only point of the barrier is to stop suicide bombers, the barrier is not on the 'green line'? Why does it make such incursions into Palestinian territory and create such hardship? I do at least welcome the announcement two days ago that the barrier will be moved closer to the green line. I also welcome Prime Minister Sharon's intention to withdraw from the Gaza settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">A senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, Henry Siegman, wrote recently that support for the cause of Palestinian nationhood does not require denial of Jews to live in their own state. That is precisely my position: two states side by side, with the right of return of Palestinians largely to a state in the West Bank and Gaza. But it must be a viable state.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the achievement of this does not rest just on Israeli shoulders. Palestinians have to want peace and avoid terrorism. It is very difficult to contest Israel's right to make itself secure, when Palestinian leaders seem unable to stop suicide bombers. There are desperate people, but I am not convinced that desperation is the only basis for suicide bombers – they are also recruited and exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian Authority is in crisis, not only because of Israeli hostility – although that is a strong factor – but also because of corruption and criminal lawlessness. I note that 350 activists resigned in protest last weekend from Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement. Perhaps this parallels the case taken by Israeli NGOs to the Israeli Supreme Court in protest against the barrier.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial priority is to get back to political negotiations. I am not convinced that the International Court of Justice case helps, because it diverts from that. What would help is grassroots democratic pressure, both in Israel and in Palestine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sister Dominique runs the Casa di Nostra Signora dei Dolori in Abu Dis, a village near Jerusalem, cut in two by the segregation and annexation wall, as it is known by Palestinians and peaceful Israelis, or by a security fence, as it is called by the Israeli authorities. This is Sister Dominique’s message: ‘On 11 January the construction of the new separation wall, nine metres high, was begun. It replaces another much lower wall built in August 2002 which people could climb over when they were no longer permitted to go to Jerusalem. Thousands of people have climbed over that first wall: children, students, mothers, old people; many have fallen, one person even died. Two months ago we had to call an ambulance for a 65 year-old man who fell and banged his head. The ambulance arrived much later. On the road the army searched the ambulance, made the injured man’s wife get out and on arrival at the hospital it was too late for him.</p>
<p class="contents">The things that happen around this wall are intolerable. For months hundreds of people have passed through our property every day to avoid military controls because they do not have the required permits. People round about us live in fear of being arrested, beaten and humiliated, as too often happens. There is constant tension and living conditions are becoming increasingly miserable.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with general apathy we feel isolated and helpless. We want to speak out on behalf of those people without a voice who every day, for the last two years, have struggled to reach their place of work and their schools or die through lack of medical treatment. In attempting to carry out our mission, we have also encountered difficulties with soldiers when we have taken people in because the ambulance was forbidden to pass. The same problem arises when somebody dies: the cemetery is on the other side of the wall. Even the shops are on the other side. Many of our patients are alone, their families are no longer able to visit them. We do not know what will happen when the wall is finished. The majority of our old people and employees come from the West Bank. Only three of our eighteen employees have a Jerusalem identity card; for two years they have had to climb over the wall and change their route in order to avoid the checkpoints because, even with a pass, the soldiers would make them turn back.</p>
<p class="contents">This nine metre high wall will make it necessary for us to sack most of our staff and refuse to accept old people from the West Bank, in other words those who are the poorest. We are worried and more isolated than before as a result of the wall and because the surrounding area has been turned into a military zone. Help us!’</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the words of Sister Dominique, but far worse, in fact, is the situation of the inhabitants of Qalqilya who are prevented by the wall even from seeing the sunrise. The sole exit from the city has an iron gate, for 50 000 people, which the Israeli army opens and closes as it pleases. At 5 p.m. it is locked and nobody can enter or leave the city after that time. In addition, what is to be said about the inhabitants of Budrus who have attempted, together with many Israeli pacifists, to use non-violent means to oppose the uprooting of their trees and the destruction of their homes? They have been brutally beaten by soldiers; one Israeli boy is still in hospital.</p>
<p class="contents">The wall and the barriers under construction are, in fact, forcing the Palestinians to live in ghettoes. It is for security, says Sharon, it is to prevent terrorist activities, not wanting to understand that security cannot be based on the construction of a wall and camps, but on the Palestinians having the possibility of living in freedom in their State in coexistence with the State of Israel. The wall is not merely a prison: it amounts yet again to the confiscation of land, yet again it amounts to annexation. It does not follow the 1967 borders but instead penetrates into and divides Palestinian territory. Meanwhile, the propaganda to have the wall accepted has intensified. Concerned at the negative reaction of the international community, the Israeli authorities are attempting to make the wall appear less monstrous. The proposal published in the Israeli daily newspaper <span class="italic">Maariv</span>, made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ team responsible for public relations, stating that, ‘If the wall were painted in bright colours it would be more aesthetic reducing the damage to public relations’ is unfortunately not a joke.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has condemned the construction of the wall calling for building to be halted. Walls, as we saw with the Berlin Wall, destroy freedom. The UN General Assembly has voted for the International Court of Justice in The Hague to deliver an opinion on its legitimacy. The President of the European Council of Ministers has stated, most inopportunely, that he considers the referral of the matter to the International Court of Justice ill-timed. Why is it, where the Israeli authorities are concerned, that international law and human rights violations must always be put to one side in the name of negotiations that do not exist, and the Quartet, instead of applying pressure in favour of the roadmap, allow time to pass by and the dying to continue in Palestine and Israel? This smacks of complicity because this wall is not about security; this wall amounts to territorial annexation, colonial conquest. The European Union cannot throw international law overboard. Let us take diplomatic action, relaunch the roadmap, do our utmost to prevent acts that can kill Israeli civilians, but let us also put economic and political pressure on Israel so that Sharon does not take unilateral action and returns to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President-in-Office of the Council said, the international community is heeding and giving its backing to the Geneva initiative, non-violent Palestinian resistance against military occupation, soldiers who refuse to carry out bombardments and be the instruments of repression in the occupied territories, the Palestinian and Israeli parents who have had their loved ones killed by the army, by Israeli settlers or by Palestinian assassins/suicide attackers and who reject the idea of vendetta. All those things prove that coexistence and security are possible whilst affirming the right of all to live in peace with dignity and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all in favour of putting international relations on a legal footing. It is for us to create the international law that we all desire. That is why I consider the request to the International Court of Justice to produce a report on how it views the reality of this wall to be justified. We basically want a clear statement about what the wall implies. One very simple outcome, as I see it – and you do not have to be clairvoyant here – is that the Court could rule that a wall built on the 1967 borders recognised by the UN might not be to our liking, but would be in accordance with international law. Whether we like it or not, the Israelis are entitled to build a wall on their own territory. We might well regard it as being wrong politically speaking, but the issue of security is not one that we can just brush aside.</p>
<p class="contents">The key factor is that building this wall amounts to annexation. Under international law it is an extension of the State of Israel, and an illegal extension at that. It has not been negotiated – force has been used to appropriate part of the land. That being the case, I believe that it would be appropriate for the International Court of Justice to give its opinion. I consider that the European Union, which fought, against the Americans for example, for this court to be established – and we have always said that we want international law – was ill-advised to abstain on this. This is not about opposing Israel. It is about opposing any state arrogating to itself the right to annex land. That is the keystone of international law. It is permissible to exchange land by means of negotiations, but not – and this is also at the heart of the UN Charter – to annex land.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the same would apply if an opinion were being sought on the content of the programmes of the Palestinian organisations. The programmes of Palestinian organisations that do not recognise the State of Israel are also illegal and should be identified as such. The issue of the PLO Charter is a complicated one. It would also be possible to determine as a matter of law whether or not it refers to recognition of the State of Israel. That means that it would also be possible to examine the constitution of groups and parties that defend the Palestinian state and Palestinian autonomy. The end result would be that it would no longer be possible for one side or the other to claim a right for itself while refusing to recognise the rights of the other side. That is the key factor in this conflict. The Palestinians have to recognise Israel and any terrorist attacks in Israel contradict that. And the Israelis have to recognise the Palestinian State, and this wall amounts to a rejection of the Palestinian State. That can be legally established. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He related a short anecdote about an American who, in a Moscow zoo, had, to his great surprise, seen a cage containing a wolf together with a lamb. It emerged that a new lamb was taken into the cage for the wolf every day. Mr Peled then compared Israel with the lamb and the Palestinians with the wolf, which, from my point of view, was certainly a case of turning matters on their head, because, to my knowledge, it is Israel that has occupied the West Bank and Gaza, that has nuclear weapons and one of the strongest armies in the world and that is backed by the United States. Nonetheless, this is very typical of Israelis’ self-image and behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">If the world does not put the strongest pressure conceivable upon Israel to tear down this completely disastrous wall, whatever the decision arrived at by the International Court, there will never be peace in the Middle East. At the same time, Sharon needs to know that he cannot replace the roadmap for peace with his own unilateral delineation of frontiers. I was, in actual fact, pleased to hear that Sharon wanted to remove the settlements in Gaza, until the moment it became clear that he only wanted to move them to the West Bank and that this was a stage in his now wanting to abandon the roadmap for peace and, in point of fact, to begin acting unilaterally. That is, of course, completely unacceptable. The settlements both on the West Bank and in Gaza are illegal and the biggest obstacles of all to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The allies went to war to force Saddam Hussein to comply with the UN resolutions. When has the international community contemplated forcing Sharon to do the same, with his being given a deadline for when all of Israel’s illegal settlements in the occupied territories must be removed? Once that has been done, Israel will, if appropriate, be able to build a protective wall along the Green Line, but, by then, that will be unnecessary because the Palestinian Authority will have been provided with the basis for effectively putting a stop itself to all the suicide bombings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an old story: there is a Europe – that of Mrs Sandbæk – which 60 years ago, for substantially the same reasons, wanted to knock down the Maginot Line. Reference has been made to the Berlin Wall. That infamous wall was constructed and supported by those who today want to knock down the Israeli wall. That is what is happening, have no doubt, even if this evening, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you have said some reasonable things. It is such a rare occurrence that I will not waste time – yours and mine – responding to your remarks. I repeat: my compliments for saying something reasonable!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Roche, the thing which interests me most at the moment is a news item that continues to elude us: our fellow MEP, or better, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi, will in the next few hours submit to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union a proposal, discussed again yesterday in Toledo, made specifically by or put forward by Shimon Perez, with the full and total support of the Minister for Palestinian Affairs, Nabil Sha’ath. I would ask her to take note of it because only <span class="italic">the Financial Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Norte de Castilla </span>have done so. It is the news item of today: the Minister for Palestinian Affairs gives his backing to the procedure for Israel’s accession to the European Union so that the Palestinian State may do likewise when it becomes a reality, in the context of a federation of both States, and not that shameful ragbag of a nation State that we are offering the Palestinians in 3004: a small sovereign State, crafted out of lies, thieves, corrupt and violent individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you listen to Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi’s proposal: the proposals that we have been making in this chamber for the last 20 years – to change the historical context – and the proposals yet to be written, roadmap or no roadmap, are a waste of time, suicidal and not worthy of being proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I hope the argument that Israel must become a member of the European Union, supported by a large number of Members, is pursued with the utmost conviction because that is a contribution we can make in response to the events of 1939 in Europe and also in favour of the Palestinians, on whom you want to bestow instead a Middle East that is fascist, Nazi, communist and undemocratic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I abhor terrorism and would support the right of any government to take appropriate measures to defend the lives of its citizens. However, the strategy of building this wall is morally wrong, as well as being counter-productive. Like many of Mr Sharon's other counter-terrorist strategies, this fails to tackle the root causes of terrorism. Palestinian land has been confiscated to build the barrier; thousands of Palestinian farmers and traders are cut off from their land and means of economic survival. If the wall is completed, it is estimated that approximately 380 000 Palestinians will be trapped between the wall and Israel's 1967 pre-occupation border, the so-called 'green line'. Furthermore, 160 000 of these would be trapped in 'double walled' ghettos or enclaves. Palestinian communities would be effectively isolated from one another. They would also be cut off, in certain instances, from centres such as Jerusalem, which have been the focus of their economic, social and religious life. Recent proposed modifications will not prevent this.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the restrictions on the freedom of movement of goods and services will intensify the problems for an already weakened Palestinian economy. The consequences of this ill-conceived security strategy on the part of the Israeli Government will provide a fertile breeding ground for creating another generation of terrorists rather than effectively tackling the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the legality of the wall has now moved centre stage. The refusal of Israel to comply with the resolution adopted at the October General Assembly of the United Nations to stop and reverse the construction of the wall led to the General Assembly decision of 8 December to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel should pause and reflect on the consequences of its actions. The wall violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, specifically in the two areas of prohibition of the use of collective punishment and prohibition of annexation, which cannot be abrogated by invoking military necessity. It also violates the Oslo Agreement in respect of the obligation to preserve the territorial integrity of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the prohibition against restricting freedom of movement. When one also considers the continued refusal by Israel to comply with UN resolutions, it begs the question: 'where does Israel think it is going?'. Does it want to be a pariah state, regarded in the same light as rogue states that are in constant defiance of their international obligations? Or instead, will it work with the international community to create peace in the Middle East?</p>
<p class="contents">With progress on the so-called roadmap slow or virtually non-existent, one has to question the merit of imposing such a controversial measure on the Palestinian people. If the Israelis are serious about making real progress in the peace process and putting the 'roadmap' back on track, the building work on the security wall should not only stop, it should be reversed. The Israelis and the Palestinians should instead be working together to take down barriers and to build confidence between the two communities if an agreed settlement is ever to be reached. The recent declaration by Sharon that he plans to dismantle most of the 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip is a step in the right direction. However, building yet more security walls and crippling the already impoverished Palestinian economy serves only to make it more difficult to achieve peace in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We did not even have a subdued voice – we had no voice at all.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we do? We abstained on a highly important issue where legality is very much at stake. Because it is not – and I totally agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit on this – as if we are talking about a wall running along a clearly defined border. That is something you can either support or oppose. But you, Mr President-in-Office, have said yourself that the wall has been built deep into Palestinian territory, and the European Union has said the same. Just when it comes to such a step, to an annexation of this kind, and when consideration is being given to whether such border fortification can be the subject of a legal judgment, we simply say ‘sorry, we do not have a view, each state can do whatever it likes’. So what is the point of working towards a Common Foreign and Security Policy if when it comes to the most important questions we just say that we do not have a view? That is the slogan, the motto if you like, of the Common Foreign and Security Policy on this issue. I think it is shameful.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking about condemning Israel in a one-sided way. Once again, I totally agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit: anyone who condemns and criticises this wall should equally not only condemn any kind of terrorist activity, but also endeavour to combat it.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not, however, achieve anything by adopting a position like this. By taking the position of actually not saying anything at all on this important question, we alienate the Palestinians, but that does not mean that in return we will win over the Israelis, because although Israel has of course brought pressure to bear for us not to adopt a position on this, that does not mean that they will involve us more closely in the peace process. And I find it sad that Europe's foreign ministers and Heads of State have not recognised that and grasped the implications. You were left with no alternative today but to present the situation to us as you have, Mr Roche.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two further questions for you, for the presidency that is. The first question relates to Mr Sharon's plans to remove the majority – not all so far, but the majority – of settlements in the Gaza Strip. What does that really mean? Removing the settlements – excellent, well done Mr Sharon, I hear you say. But does it mean that other areas, particularly in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, will be extended? My question to you, Mr President-in-Office, is this: has the European Union at least adopted a clear position on this? Support for clearing settlements from these areas is fine, but we should in no way be offering our support or agreement if it means that other areas in the West Bank are to be annexed.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question for you relates to the Americans' big talk about a new Middle East plan in the widest sense of the term. Joschka Fischer expressed his opinion on this at the NATO security conference in Munich. Does the European Union know anything about this plan? Does the European Union have anything to say about this plan, and does it also include concrete measures to tackle the heart of the problem – Israel and Palestine? It would be interesting if the European Union and the Council could say something about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can understand Israel’s desire to protect itself, but the wall is inappropriate in this case. A UN report last September condemned the wall as illegal and charged Israel with unlawful annexation. You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are of the opinion that the hearings and decisions of the International Court of Justice will disturb the peace process. I do not share this view. Like Mr Cohn-Bendit, I believe it would be useful to verify to what extent international law is being violated here, and that we should not make an exception for Israel, nor, in this context, for Palestine when it makes mistakes. At present, we are talking about approximately 21 000 people who live in the area between the wall and Israel and who are being cut off from social amenities, schools and jobs. This will lead to renewed hatred and a new generation of refugees. How do you explain – I am a member of the Palestine delegation – to a group of people in Qalqilya, which was once known as the West Bank’s fruit basket and which is located near a small loophole in the wall, that everything is being closed off on three sides? That they are being cut off from two major water sources and from all the farms that should provide for the area? The town, with 40 000 inhabitants, is accessible via one single Israeli checkpoint. As I see it, something of this nature should be brought before the court. I share the view of all those who have said that the conflict between Israel and Palestine should be solved, but tolerating a wall and waiting until the conflict is over is not the right way to go about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a hugely wasted opportunity. Opposition to a hearing at the ICJ, because it is a legal – not a political – forum, misses the point. The ICJ is probably the last available instrument of pressure on Tel Aviv, and we should be grasping it with both hands. Those people who say that instead we should be relying on European pressure on Israel should tell me when European pressure alone on Israel has ever yielded any results – it has not. Yet, when there is an international multilateral forum that exists to address this issue, we turn our backs upon it.</p>
<p class="contents">Palestinians rightly point to the inconsistency of our position of urging them to give up violence, while simultaneously denying them the chance to seek redress through international legal institutions. A Palestinian negotiator observed that the US, the UK and Germany asked the Palestinians not to have recourse to violence, but when the Palestinians have recourse to diplomacy the door is slammed on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there are compelling humanitarian reasons to act. I visited the Occupied Territories last month and saw for myself how the wall is destroying thousands of acres of farmland and trees, demolishing homes and shops and leaving thousands of families landless, jobless, hungry and hopeless. As a result, according to studies by the World Bank and the UN, the Palestinian people have been reduced to the poverty and malnutrition levels of sub-Saharan Africa. The Israeli claim that this is something to do with security is completely undermined by the fact that the wall does not follow the 1967 'green line'. Instead, as people have said, it cuts deep into Palestinian land.</p>
<p class="contents">This wall is intolerable, illegal and immoral, and by failing to support the ICJ as a forum to consider it, the Council has been reckless and irresponsible. The Council has also not been transparent, and I would like a copy of the letter that contains the presidency's submission to the ICJ to be made widely available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is to the German Foreign Minister’s credit that he recently sanctioned this last-ditch measure. There is no doubt that opinions on the precise course of this division vary, even in Israel itself; hence the present hearings before the Israeli Supreme Court. I should also like to make it clear that the general interests of the Palestinian population on the West Bank should not suffer unnecessarily as a result of the extremely contentious security barrier. The UN General Assembly is not, however, serving their interests by asking the International Court of Justice to intervene in such a basic political issue as this dividing line between the Israelis and the Palestinians. This only prejudices the pressing need for the resumption of the political dialogue between the parties involved. In short, I endorse in this context the position adopted by my country, the Netherlands, and that of the European Union, which is one of rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, with regard to the legal proceedings that have been brought before the International Court of Justice, Palestine’s special observer status – in other words, that of the Palestinian Authority – is extremely odd, and amounts to a clear case of discrimination against the Jewish State. These lopsided relations have the opposite effect politically speaking. This is just as much a failing of the European Parliament, as next week, the Palestine Prime Minister will be visiting the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, whereas the Israeli Prime Minister will not. In the Israeli-Palestine conflict, we should adhere to the tried and tested principle that both sides should be heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This barrier is in fact only a subsection of a much wider plan called disengagement, which is only an adjunct to an even wider process, which is the roadmap for peace talks. All the interconnections between these different levels are very complex. It would therefore be inappropriate to want to judge a small subsection separately without attempting to consider the role it plays in the whole process. Especially if we are wanting to look at it from a strictly legal angle when it is a component of the whole of a peace process that is obviously political in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why those European countries that were against taking the problem before the International Court of Justice on the grounds that it would hamper the peace efforts were perfectly right. We must not look at this problem through the small end of the telescope because that would risk calling into question a peace process that everyone would want to support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must make the distinction between the principle of the security barrier and the line it takes. I believe I have detected some confusion about that in this debate. Just as the line of the barrier can be a matter for negotiation and, like any matter for negotiation, subject to change, so its principle is a matter of the sovereign right of a state – and, moreover, a state whose survival is constantly threatened – to ensure the safety of its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can make speeches here in the European Parliament that are best suited to satisfying our own electorates at home in Great Britain or France or, as in my own case, in Sweden. As the European Union and as the European Parliament, what contribution are we prepared to make to the Middle East issue, to a peaceful future there and to coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians?</p>
<p class="contents">Two and a half years ago, I visited Nicosia and saw how that city was divided. As a 25 year-old, I travelled to Belfast and saw how that city too is divided, with, in more recent times, barricades and barriers now having been built to separate Unionists and Republicans, the two population groups. In Ceuta, which is situated in North Africa but belongs to Spain, there is barbed wire to separate this Spanish city of Ceuta from Morocco. The United States has built a barrier between itself and Mexico. An electric fence is almost complete between Zimbabwe and Botswana. Am I saying this in order in some way to excuse what is happening in the Middle East? No, not at all but, rather, to show that similar situations exist in many other places.</p>
<p class="contents">In the year 2000 and with UN approval, Israel constructed a security fence between itself and Lebanon, involving electronic and other surveillance using sensors. This was applauded by the European Union and Russia and seen as a clever way for Israel unilaterally to withdraw its troops from Lebanese land in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I would hope and believe that the wall and the barrier that have been built are interim solutions or measures. I would hope and believe that these are not permanent fixtures, and I would hope and believe that it will be possible for the peace talks to begin again. I wish to think well of both sides. The fact that the Israeli public pressed for the construction of this wall has to do, of course, with the large number of suicide attacks suffered by the Israeli public. One hundred and twenty suicide bombers have caused almost 900 deaths and getting on for 6 000 injured Israelis.</p>
<p class="contents">As good Europeans, and as good Swedes, let us try to see this issue from both sides. Let us hope that we achieve a peaceful solution in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Well, in any parliamentary democracy, faced with such a vast and firm opinion of Parliament, a government resigns. Although the concept of resigning is not provided for in the European institutions, I would ask the Council to take into consideration the opinion given in this House, which is not denouncing the wall because it causes a hazard and slows down the peace process, but is denouncing the wall as such.</p>
<p class="contents">This wall, Mr President – as you well know and as many Members have stressed – is primarily a dividing wall because it does not follow the 1967 green line but it enters into Palestinian territory, dividing the Palestinian community, pupils from schools, children from parents, farmers from fields, ill people from doctors. This is a wall that takes territory away from the Palestinian community: it goes up to 25km within the West Bank; the first section, of 150km, has already been constructed and has shut out 50 000 Palestinians from their territory. When it is completed, that figure will be 130 000.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures, Mr President, were not made up by this Parliament but they were provided for us by the Israeli civil society and by Israeli non-governmental organisations, which remind us that 670 000 Palestinians risk being seriously affected by the construction of this wall and that 14% of Palestinian territory will be taken away from the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this reality, we believe that it is the wall itself that provokes anger, desperation and hatred. It is our duty to recognise this, Mr President, and we should not be surprised if this anger, desperation and hatred – God forbid – turns into violence. The day when we find ourselves counting the victims and the figures of such violence, we should also remember how much we contributed to the desperation, hatred and anger of these people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I too would like to see the security barrier come down and, once some of these elements have been repainted, see it end up as souvenirs and trinkets, just like other barriers. Let it disappear then, yes, but when it has no more reason to be there – for it is not there on a whim. This barrier is a response, a response to kamikaze terrorism. Having said that, once again, even if it is justified from the point of view of defence, there are things about it that can be challenged, that is true. But nothing is final, it is not a border, it does not signify an annexation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cohn-Bendit, you like talking about the 1967 borders, but may I remind you that they were only ever cease-fire lines and they only began to be recognised when they were no longer effective. Everything out there is really provisional. Do not forget that. Of course I want the barrier to disappear, but unlike some barriers which kill, it is a barrier that saves. You have to remember the attacks that have not taken place, if I can put it that way. Think of the innocent people who would have been killed by the kamikaze attacks that these controls have thwarted. The real question about this barrier, Mr President, is this: should we stop it preventing deaths? I think not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears that Israel will be shortening the wall, or partition, so that it does not cut as much into Palestinian territory. In that way, Mr Sharon is trying to turn the international tide that is opposed to his policy, but he will try to use the dismantling of the colonies in Gaza as compensation for the colonies within the wall on the West Bank. In that way, he can retain the largest settlements there after all and abandon the problematic Gaza Strip. He will thus once again foster goodwill in Washington and can quietly carry on with the annexation of the Palestinian territory, even though he thereby undermines the roadmap and makes his own plan the only viable one. He does not recognise the Green Line. This is unacceptable to the United Nations and, as Kofi Annan stated in November, this is very counterproductive for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, too, should find this unacceptable, and I regret the Council’s attitude. A viable Palestinian state needs the agricultural land and the water sources, which are now being closed off. We must therefore maintain our international protest against the wall. Besides, Israel has the right to look for protection against terrorism behind the Green Line, but a new iron curtain will provide no answers in the long run. Where I come from, anyone who builds a wall has to build it on their own land; if not, the neighbour will call in the justice of the peace. This will shortly also happen in The Hague, where the International Court of Justice will rule on this wall’s legitimacy. Mr Sharon is now trying to create a smoke screen to mislead the world and make people forget the Geneva peace initiative. The question is now whether the International Court of Justice can act as justice of the peace in this case. In any event, the problem has now attracted much attention worldwide, and international pressure is being brought to bear – even in Israel, where the Supreme Court is now looking into the case. I hope that they will take the right decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many of the points made correspond with the position of the Council, which I sought to summarise earlier. It must be clear from my previous statement that the Irish presidency will strongly hold to the view that the current situation is unacceptable. Members of this House know that I come from a small island where we know something about divides and walls and separation. We will continue actively to explore with all parties the possibility of resuming forward movement – even if through modest steps at the outset – in a process that has repeatedly stalled.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to refer to a number of the points made during the course of the debate. As for the wider approach to the Middle East region, the effort to promote peace, progress and prosperity should in the first place have strong local ownership on the part of those in the region. Also, it must have an appropriately strong focus on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After all, the continuation of the conflict is a central security reality for many people who live in the region. The renewed EU focus on the wider region would not bypass or set aside the benefits of existing mechanisms, including the Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda suggested that the European Union's voice was not being heard on the illegality of the wall. Let me reiterate where the Union stands in relation to the extension of the wall. It cannot accept that a fence or wall built on Palestinian land would best serve Israel's long-term security, nor did anything I have said suggest that this would be the case. The European Council has expressed its concern about the route envisaged for the security fence and the departure of the route from the green line in the West Bank. The appropriation of land in the West Bank or Gaza is illegal, it is contrary to international law and it fuels tension. Furthermore, the restrictions associated with the security fence have resulted in unnecessary suffering for the Palestinian people and the deterioration of the economy of the Occupied Territories.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union's voice on this has been absolutely clear in all international fora. The construction of the fence, or the wall, was also the subject of a United Nations General Assembly resolution on 21 October, which all EU Member States and the accession states co-sponsored.</p>
<p class="contents">Another speaker, Mrs Lucas, called on the presidency to publish the submission to the International Court of Justice. She may not be aware, but the rules of procedure of the ICJ specifically preclude our making the submission publicly available. Indeed, the Court of Justice itself will not be publishing statements received, for the very same reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, speaking recently in the Irish Senate, pointed out that the Israeli people need not live in a fortress, surrounded by hostile neighbours, where they are in danger when walking the streets or driving on the roads; where young soldiers – mere boys or girls – are placed at constant risk; and where a great part of their national resources are consumed by the burden of defence. Equally, the people of Palestine need not live in hopelessness and indignity; where young people are encouraged to blow themselves up; where homes are bulldozed and destroyed; where employment is scarce or non-existent; where people are not free to travel around their country; where immigration seems to offer the only escape route.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all help the people of Israel and of Palestine to find the courage and wisdom to build a new peace; the courage to face down those who would reject compromise; the wisdom to understand that putting an end to the insecurity and suffering of their neighbours is in their own long-term interest. We can achieve this, and if we do achieve this, the Holy Land may become a land of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I thank all Members for their constructive support and concern in this matter. I believe that the approach adopted by the Council is an appropriate approach. No Member of this House need have any concern or doubt as to the interest of this presidency in helping to resolve this issue.
