By approving the Treaty of Nice with a large majority, the Irish people have clearly indicated their support for the ideals and projects of the European Union. I wish to express my thanks to the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and to President Cox for their work. With this result under our belts, we can embark even more confidently on the final stretch of the road to Copenhagen and final endorsement of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with pleasure, with great pleasure that I accepted your invitation to come to Parliament today together with Commissioner Solbes, who will give you an overview of the measures taken by the Commission and the current state of the economy. I am very pleased to be here today to discuss with you the coordination of economic policies and the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have to say is simple. Economic and Monetary Union needs rules that are clear, effective and, above all, respected. To achieve this, we need an authority that can act to protect the common good with due regard for the rules defined in the context of interinstitutional cooperation by adjusting economic policy to changing circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact has been and remains extremely important for Economic and Monetary Union. The Commission, as the true, faithful guardian of the Treaties, has carefully monitored its implementation and will continue to do so in the future. As the Italian Prime Minister who promoted and approved the Stability and Growth Pact and led the country into the single currency, and now as President of the Commission, I am a committed, firm believer in the value of the rules that underpin Economic and Monetary Union and the Stability and Growth Pact. I am a staunch defender of these rules, this Union and this Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and Monetary Union has brought tremendous benefits both for the countries subscribing to it and for the other European Union Member States. Gone are the days of the huge deficits common in the 1990s. Gone are the days when national currencies were exposed to the ups and downs of speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with these benefits, however, Economic and Monetary Union brings specific responsibilities. Responsibilities for everyone – Member States, European institutions and ordinary citizens. With a single currency, the euro, each Member State's growth and jobs will depend not only on what is now our common monetary policy but on their own fiscal policies too.</p>
<p class="contents">Stability is the prerequisite for growth and employment in Economic and Monetary Union. The Stability and Growth Pact has been the cornerstone for promoting and managing the culture of stability so successfully introduced with the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, awareness of the extraordinary things the Pact has already brought about and will continue to bring about in the future should not blind us to the limitations of the institutional framework in which we have to apply it. Still less does it mean enforcing the Pact inflexibly and dogmatically, regardless of changing circumstances. That is what I called – and still call – ‘stupid’.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that it is the role of the Commission or of myself as President of the Commission to apply rules in that way. Neither the Commission nor myself have been appointed to enforce rules blindly, ignoring their limitations. The European citizens have a right to be informed, and we have a duty to tell them what we think is right, what we think works, and what, on the other hand, we think could and should be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians like yourselves, economists, bankers and businessmen, with whom I have discussed this matter a thousand times, have been saying for months and continue to say in private and in their everyday conversations the same things that I said openly and frankly in the interests of our institutions' credibility. It is therefore time that we started to say in public what we say amongst ourselves in private.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The public mistrusts us and our institutions not least because they suspect that that only minor matters are aired in public and that the truly important decisions are taken behind closed doors. I am therefore pleased and proud that Parliament should be at the heart of this debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pact is, as it should be, simple, but the situations to which the Pact applies are complex. One of the responsibilities of the European institutions is therefore to be aware of the complexity and diversity of the economies of the Member States – applying the same criteria to large and small alike – just as we have the responsibility to keep track of developments here in Europe and in the rest of the world. Indeed, we could hardly be unaware of the downturn in the economic cycle in Europe and worldwide. This downturn is so marked that a substantial part of the global economy could be in danger of experiencing the kind of deflation that we thought we had put behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we realised that the Pact had not prevented some Member States from adopting fiscal policies incompatible with the objective of stability. What were we meant to do in the circumstances? Were we meant to adopt an inflexible approach, trying to force the countries with the biggest deficits to stick to their budgetary targets regardless of the changing economic situation? Should we have made a further mistake, so compounding the mistakes made in the past when countries that had not balanced their budgets missed the chance offered by growth to balance the books?</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, would have been the wrong way to implement the Pact. Taking that approach could have jeopardised the economic prospects not just of the countries concerned but of the whole of Europe too, for we are bound together by the single currency. If the European institutions had tried to impose objectives that were no longer realistic, they would now be accused of endangering growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I, however, want Europe to win both battles - stability and growth. What a tragedy it would be if, in our endeavours to win the stability battle, we lost the trust and backing of our citizens, the trust and backing that are the foundations of the European democracy you represent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is why, last month, we floated ideas for making adjustments and introducing more sophisticated criteria for applying the Pact with a view to making it an increasingly valuable instrument for promoting stability and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We suggested setting objectives that would restore balance and creating instruments to track progress. To bridge the gap at this critical moment, we also suggested giving countries in need of adjustment more breathing space, setting out a more realistic course of action for consolidating deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about criteria that will ensure both stability and growth. Indeed, they will allow stability and growth to boost each other. We are talking about criteria that apply to all the Member States, both large and small, to the benefit of all the countries of the Union. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, these ideas are completely in line with what we have been saying for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, in our communication on strengthening the coordination of economic policies, we proposed a number of major improvements within the present institutional framework. As you will doubtless recall, we proposed developing information and economic analysis concerning the eurozone, improving the system of statistics we use, clarifying the principles common to fiscal and structural policies and, lastly, making our decision-making system more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking specifically at the recent case of Portugal, which was obliged to revise its own statistics substantially, I should like, in particular, to highlight the obvious importance of a proper system of controls on budget-related statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall act in line with this approach when, as required by the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council, we put forward proposals shortly for improving both the transparency and the discipline of the Pact together. We shall do so by trying to clarify both the underlying principles of the Pact and the basic principles that should underpin national budgetary policies, thus taking the reality of European economic integration fully into account.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, we shall show that the need for clear rules can be made compatible with recognition of the fact that the Pact's rules apply to different countries in different situations as regards levels of debt, financial burdens arising from the ageing of the population and the urgent public investment requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">If we apply the Stability and Growth Pact like this, it will truly come into its own as an instrument for coordinating economic policies, above and beyond its purely disciplinary aspects. It will, at last, become an instrument that is fully compatible with the growth and employment strategy adopted by the European Council at Lisbon two years ago, a strategy that Parliament has always supported wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="contents">New and better rules are not enough, however. In order to protect the European Union’s common interest, once such rules are approved, we will need the capacity to implement them too. If we really want to solve the problems of growth and employment in Europe, we must achieve more intelligent – and more effective – coordination of economic policies, including the necessary structural reforms, coordination which is more easily implemented.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The distribution of responsibilities for coordination of economic policies must be clearly defined. Europe's citizens must be sure that the system is in safe hands, hands that are capable of supervising the system and ensuring consistency, both in quiet periods and, even more so, in times of difficulty and crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, I raised this issue before you and I have come back to it on several occasions since then. We need an authority that has the power to supervise the system in a way that is both rigorous and intelligent with due regard for the complexity of our economies, an authority that is capable of intervening in defence of the common good, so that each Member State can adopt the economic-policy measures necessary to prevent its economy from having adverse effects on the economies of the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a strong authority can both apply the rules strictly to prevent behaviour that is off-course and adapt the rules to changing circumstances, where necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make this point even clearer. Budgetary policy is the responsibility of the authorities of the Member States. That is true today and it will continue to be so in future. For its part, the Commission is an institution whose sole mandate is to work for the common interest of Europe while respecting the full equality of all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">By its very nature, the Commission is therefore naturally suited to the role of steering, on the basis of the mandate and the rules established by the Council and subject to Parliament's control, the system that must ensure the coordination of economic policies on a Europe-wide scale.</p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of examples to support the idea of giving responsibility to an independent, impartial referee such as the Commission. Today, I will mention only one, and the case in question is relevant precisely because it is very controversial. It concerns the early warning the Commission proposed to the Council a few months ago. As you will all remember, the proposal was not taken up, despite the fact that both the Council and the Member State directly concerned agreed on the substance of the Commission's proposed measure and, in fact, appropriated it.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the shortcomings of the decision-making mechanism are still there for all to see. That is why the Commission's first formal contribution to the work of the Convention included proposals to prevent such situations from recurring in the future, suggesting that the responsibility of the authority to issue such early warnings should be enshrined in the Treaty. The Commission also proposed that the Treaty be amended to incorporate the coordination of economic policies more fully within the framework of interinstitutional cooperation guaranteed by the Community method. Lastly, the Commission put forward proposals for addressing in full the need for unitary representation of the euro in international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Those, ladies and gentlemen, are the proposals we put forward within the Convention. However, there is nothing to stop us adopting some of those proposals as of today. Indeed, the changes are of great importance now and they will become even more important with the impending enlargement of the Union. We therefore call upon the Council to consider these proposals as a matter of urgency. In the meantime, we will continue to uphold the Pact's current rules staunchly, fulfilling our responsibility to propose the improvements we regard as appropriate when and where this proves necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I am especially grateful to Parliament for giving me the opportunity today to discuss an issue of such vital importance before the representatives of the peoples of Europe. European monetary and economic policies cannot and must not be discussed behind closed doors. A democratic Europe, the democratic Europe we all want must be a Europe where the policies that affect wealth, employment, growth and development are an essential part of open political debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Convention, the Commission has made every endeavour – and will continue to do so – to point out intelligent ways of establishing a centre of responsibility and authority in the system for the coordination of European economic policy. I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support these efforts.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to say firstly that this is a very appropriate time to discuss the framework for fiscal policy within our Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I share President Prodi’s conviction that the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential regulatory framework within the Union’s institutional system, which provides the Member States with rigorous but flexible rules so that the Union can confront the challenges in store in the short, medium and long terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last four years, the Commission has reiterated that respect for the medium-term budgetary balance rule is the best way for fiscal policy to play its stabilising role within the economic cycle. Of course, we must place more emphasis on cyclically adjusted balances when we analyse fiscal positions, and this is the approach our work has been taking. By acting in this way, it will be easier to prevent expansive fiscal policies when the economy’s growth is strong and therefore we will be able to implement non-restrictive fiscal policies in periods of low growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pact has also provided us with an appropriate framework to confront the challenges of fiscal policy in the medium term. We all agree that tax and spending reforms are essential in order to increase potential growth in the Union, and the Commission has stressed that a correct interpretation of the rules of the Pact provides an appropriate reference for assessing whether these reforms really improve the quality of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Pact has also demonstrated that it is able to incorporate our long-term challenges, especially those relating to the ageing of the population. A majority of Member States are now in a good position to allow fiscal policy to play an anticyclical role in the current economic situation, in which the forecasts suggest a slower growth than that foreseen at the beginning of the year. The average growth in the eurozone in 2002 will be less than 2% and next year we hope to achieve average potential growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In this economic situation, the unexpectedly low growth can be explained, only in part, by the deviation from the budgetary objectives set at the beginning of the year. In some countries, excessively optimistic forecasts of revenue and expenditure trends have had an influence, but also certain deviations from the intended policies. Consequently, this year the budgetary deficits in the zone will be equivalent to more than 2% of GDP, instead of the 0.9% forecast.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with this thinking, and in accordance with the vision of the Pact which I have just described, President Prodi and myself presented a strategy on how to confront the current budgetary challenges at the end of September. In order to improve the implementation of the Pact and at the same time take account of the complexity of economic reality, we proposed a strategy based on four points: firstly, the deficit limit of 3% of GDP is, and will continue to be, obligatory, and any violation of that threshold will require corrective measures on the part of the Member States concerned; secondly, the objective established by the Pact of a budgetary situation close to the balance of the surplus in the medium term, as well as adjustments aimed at the same thing, must be interpreted in terms of an adjustment of the cycle; thirdly, the countries that have not yet achieved the objective of a budget close to balance must achieve a reduction of their structural deficits of half a point of GDP per year, as a minimum; and, finally, in years of strong growth, any procyclical flexibilisation of the budgets, which may lead to non-compliance with the rule of budgetary balance, must be considered a violation of the provisions of the Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">These four principles strengthen the application of the Pact and explicitly incorporate the effects of cyclical development into budgetary monitoring. I am pleased that two weeks ago, in Luxembourg, the Ministers of the Eurogroup adopted a similar position and supported this proposal. Except for France, all the countries, including those in a situation of deficit, have accepted this approach and are making efforts to implement it from 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary situation is particularly difficult in four countries which were not able to consolidate their public finances during the period of strong growth: Portugal, Germany, France and Italy. The deficits in some of these countries are dangerously close to, if not above, 3%. I am aware that an adjustment is required in these countries in order to achieve a situation of substantial budgetary balance, but I also believe that carrying out this adjustment is crucial so that each country can create sufficient room for manoeuvre for the automatic stabilisers to operate fully.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Portugal, last week the Commission took a series of important decisions in relation to the excessive deficit procedure and, in our opinion to the Council, we concluded that such a deficit exists in Portugal. There are indications that Germany will exceed 3% deficit in terms of GDP. In France, the deficits in question are dangerously close to 3% and no significant change is expected next year. In Italy, leaving aside the significant departure from the objectives set, the apparent interruption in the reduction of the still very high levels of debt is cause for concern. If the official notifications or data in the possession of the Commission confirm those perspectives, as we agreed in the Amsterdam Declaration, the Commission will apply the provisions of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the comments I wanted to make on behalf of the Commission on the economic situation and the budgetary forecasts. I am delighted to share them with you, as representatives of the European citizens, as we have done on previous occasions and of course I am happy to reply to any of your questions or concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have had an incredible fight, with the support of many Members of this House, to all of whom I would like to express my gratitude. I would also like to thank the Irish members of my group and of Fine Gael, which is in Opposition, and whose sense of responsibility to Europe led them to decide unequivocally in favour of a Yes vote.

That is why an overwhelming majority in my group is of the definite opinion that something has happened that must not be allowed to repeat itself in the same way.</p>

<p class="contents">We were dumbfounded when we heard this. If you are talking about the authority that an institution needs, then I agree with you, but you will be granted it only if the authority of the Commission is not compromised still further. We call on you to do what has to be done to that end.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was with astonishment that we learned that Mr Prodi's spokesman reiterated on Friday of last week that the President of the Commission regretted not one word of what he had said.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Now anyone can make mistakes. But when you do, and if you come to realise it, you have to have the guts to say, ‘I was wrong, I regret having said that.’</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, I regret that you have not taken the opportunity today to correct that unspeakable sentence and to say, ‘I withdraw that sentence; it was a mistake.’ Commissioner Solbes himself contradicted you in his statement in Barcelona last Friday, in which he said, much as he has done today, that the Commission's various initiatives over the past three years have demonstrated that the Stability and Growth Pact is flexible enough to accommodate policies that make economic sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Solbes does not belong to our family of parties, and that is why we are not dealing with this issue in a party-political way, but in a manner befitting the matter in hand. He said quite clearly that he and the Commission – in its role as guardian of the Treaties – took responsibility for the Stability and Growth Pact being adhered to. For that, Commissioner Solbes, I would like to express my group's gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to make one thing clear here. Room for manoeuvre exists in the form of the 3% maximum deficit, which is reasonable when times are hard. When things are going well, however, we have to work towards a balanced budget, and Commissioner Solbes said as much. That is why it is quite simply wrong to say that the Pact, as it is today, is not flexible. I regret to have to say that the Commission President's judgment has given the impression that Europe's policies and thinking are leaving the door wide open to a deficit policy. If statements and developments like that become reality, we will declare our determined resistance. More debt means more inflation. More inflation means higher interest rates, and higher interest rates mean that business can invest less. The eventual result of a policy of more deficits will be a lack of money for investment, and the only winners will be the banks. That is not our vision of the social market economy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, what perturbs me most about this whole affair is the impression that the President of the Commission cast aspersions on current European law. He is the guardian of the Treaties and at the head of the Commission. It is for him and them to defend European law, rather than to cast doubt upon the Stability and Growth Pact in this way!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, I say these things with all my personal respect for you. What deals were done when you gave your undertakings? We find it intolerable that small countries such as Portugal should get the blue letter treatment. Yes, I know, that was decided by the Finance Ministers. Yet the big countries end up getting off scot free. The little fish get caught, and the big ones are allowed to get away.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If that is the principle on which Europe is run, then this Community is going down a perilous road by infringing Community law. I urge the Commission to act in such a way that we can again back it up wholeheartedly. But trust has been seriously damaged, and I hope that you will restore it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the President of the Commission, whose appearance was requested by my group on Friday morning having seen the statements he had made to the <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> newspaper, for having agreed to come to the appropriate place to explain his position; the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, two important things have happened: one, that a referendum has been won in Ireland – I think we should be happy about this; and the other, that the euro is remaining stable. In other words we are not on the brink of disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that we in my group have read the comments in <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> carefully and we believe that the President has made a series of observations on current issues which we largely agree with. We would have preferred him to have said these things here, instead of in a newspaper, but that is what happened.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is that we have a Pact which is not just a Stability and Growth Pact but also a Growth Pact and we have to fulfil the Stability and Growth Pact in order not to end up in the same situation as President Bush Senior, when he lost to Clinton, when he said to him: it is the economy, stupid.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the current situation. We have a strategy, the Lisbon Strategy, and it must be applied, and to this end our economic policy must be intelligent. The Stability and Growth Pact was created 10 years ago, last century, but it must now be applied in light of new circumstances in which we have monetary union, when ten years ago we did not have it. This is the decisive factor, and it must therefore be applied with intelligence and flexibility, as the Commissioner has quite rightly explained. I cannot defend Mr Solbes more than Mr Poettering, but at least I support him on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a question which he has not dealt with and which was raised at the EPP Congress in Lisbon. It is as follows. In the end they asked themselves: whose fault is all of this? And they concluded: the Socialists, who have led us to this situation. Well, now we have promises of fiscal reforms, as if they were a lottery for everybody, on the part of the parties of the Right in Europe, and not only in the small countries, Mr Poettering. I have heard Mr Solbes talk about France and Italy; if you think France is a small country, then you are making truly revolutionary proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to bring the Stability and Growth Pact up to date by insisting on growth. We must also – and there have been proposals in this regard from the President and the Commissioner today – improve an instrument which by definition is crude, if I can use the word ‘crude’ or ‘inflexible’, rather than stupid. And the Commission must present proposals which allow Parliament to carry out its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard the President and the Commission talk about their relations with the Council and in particular Ecofin, in its euro dimension, but it would be useful if they could tell us how they believe the European Parliament should participate in the taking of the important budgetary and economic decisions. I believe that is our obligation, and we must be there.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying that very specific proposals have been presented to the Convention in application of the early warning mechanism representing the euro. The broad guidelines for economic policy must also have a dimension which allows Parliament to participate. It is my understanding that in the Commission the governments are turning a deaf ear to this proposal. I believe that in this regard we must support the Commission and demand more capacity for initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commission President Mr Prodi described the Stability and Growth Pact last week as 'stupid, like all decisions which are rigid'. Commissioner Lamy is also on record as having described the pact as 'medieval'. Aside from the questionable wisdom of using such strong language, especially to a newspaper from the country which is doing the most damage to what remains of the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, one begins to wonder whether this is part of an orchestrated campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Commission President is this: in making your remarks to <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> – and you have said that you stand by every word – was it your intention to launch a debate on how to reform the Stability and Growth Pact? If so, that is a debate we welcome, but surely a debate which would better have been conducted some months ago. Had the Commission acted more firmly then, using the licence that we gave you when we invested you, its own authority and that of the Stability and Growth Pact might have suffered less damage.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current circumstances, no change is clearly not an option, but two principles must guide us. The first is that a well-run economy and a stable currency require taxes and spending to be in balance over the course of the business cycle. The second is that the rules are the same for all countries, large or small. Those principles are at the heart of the Stability and Growth Pact and my group expects them to be the starting point for any reform.</p>
<p class="contents">If today marks the beginning of a debate on how to improve and strengthen the Pact, what reforms do we need to give it renewed credibility? First of all let us be clear on what we should not do. We should not call into question the 3% limit for deficits as we hit hard economic times. If countries do not pay off their debts, then we will all pay the price in higher interest rates and a weaker currency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group agrees with Mr Prodi that the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied intelligently. That is why we supported the Commission's decision to allow two more years for countries to return their budgets to balance, because growth had been slower than expected. But we must not forget that postponement to 2006 came with strings attached in the form of a requirement to reduce structural deficits by 0.5% year on year. The Liberal Group believes that a new target for the structural deficit should be included in the Stability and Growth Pact. That would increase pressure on governments to reduce their deficits in their good times so that they can allow borrowing to take the strain when times are bad.</p>
<p class="contents">On that analysis, any intelligent interpretation would clearly conclude that France's recent budget makes no effort to reduce its structural deficit and is clearly in breach of the Stability and Growth Pact. France must therefore face an early warning. That is what we would like to hear from the Commission today. When the Commission brings forward a proposal for such an early warning, then it will help to restore credibility to the Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group agrees with you, Mr Prodi, that the Stability and Growth Pact needs authority behind it to apply it. That is why we call for the Commission to have the power to issue early warnings against countries which are breaching the rules, whether Finance Ministers agree or not. Only if the Pact has a strong policeman can Member States be forced into taking corrective action while they can afford to.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear. We will not support any reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact which undermine the basic principles of fiscal responsibility and equality before the law. The end point of reform must be a strengthened Stability and Growth Pact which punishes fiscal <span class="italic">largesse</span> and rewards countries which run their budgets responsibly. Judging by the warm welcome which Francis Mer, the French finance minister, gave to your remarks in that interview, I fear that France will feel empowered to flout the rules. If you wish to have the authority to enforce the Stability and Growth Pact, then you must earn that authority by acting promptly against France and any other countries which might be tempted to follow their example.</p>

It took courage to say that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid, and you have shown even more courage today in persevering and clearly defending your point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need to go further, and revise this Pact and set a new objective. The Pact is stupid when your house is on fire, and you are right, we must stop burying our heads in the sand. The financial crisis is even more serious in Europe than it is in the United States. We must be prepared for at least two difficult years of restructuring, with the inevitable social consequences that this will entail. And we will not be able to overcome this crisis without strong public initiatives, which will require use of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pact is also stupid when the Union is moving away from the Lisbon objectives, as you mentioned. It is stupid when enlargement would require a Pact for the countries joining the Union to bring their economies into line with those of the current Member States, with practical solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">A Stability and Growth Pact worthy of the name would protect public spending of general interest, put a stop to fiscal competition that scorns ethics and effectiveness, provide the Union with a real budget, and guarantee the Member States’ capacity for action, while maintaining a discipline of control over public debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you are demanding that the Commission be given real authority over the coordination of economic policies, but we want more than early warnings and the authority to take corrective action. What we want most of all is for the Union to adopt an economic policy that addresses the current economic situation and sustainable development, and although the Commission is in effect the only executive body designed to promote common interests, it does not yet have the necessary culture and legitimacy to implement an economic policy</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are protesting so that the future constitution of the Union clearly establishes a new legitimacy and political will. The Union would no longer be merely a marketplace but would participate in societal choices and concepts relating to the public economy. Its mandate would come from the people and the powers of civil society, and parliaments would be set up to draft and monitor decisions.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, thanks to your politically incorrect intervention – as shown by the reactions of some of those on the right – I felt we might actually be able to hold a real debate on the economic, social and environmental governance of Europe. Furthermore, Mr Herzog is right to say that the Commission’s responsibility for this very economic, social and environmental governance of Europe must be anchored in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us stop being so hypocritical! When governments get into debt by taking the wrong decisions, we must tell them they have taken the wrong decisions. When France is incapable of reforming its agriculture sector, following the Commission proposals for agricultural reform, we must say so. When Europe, or Member States, take the wrong decisions on energy, we must say so. There is, however, one thing we must put an end to if we want to avoid a situation where the citizens reject our Europe – which, let it be said in passing, has once again scraped a victory in Ireland – reforms cannot operate solely on the basis of the proposals of banks and employers, without considering those who, either now or in future, have to live with them. These reforms must be socially, environmentally and economically equitable throughout society.</p>
<p class="contents">That is exactly what is meant by saying that this Pact is stupid. Let us take the example of Germany, Mr Poettering. Your great candidate has called for Mr Prodi to resign. On behalf of whom or what would Mr Stoiber call for Mr Prodi to resign? Why did you not have the courage to repeat, here, in this House, in front of Mr Prodi, what your candidate said? I would have liked to hear you repeat the same thing. We could have laughed about it together.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to know whether a country like Germany, which spent 600 billion in transfers from West to East for the unification, should be treated in the same way as any other country, be it small or large? Should the fact of having carried out these transfers, of paying pensions to people who have never contributed to the pension scheme, be taken into account, yes or no?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us stop being hypocritical and, finally, let us thank Mr Prodi for having opened the debate. Let us continue! The dissident thinkers’ club will relaunch this debate in an even less stupid way than Mr Prodi.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pasqua (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today, then, the two pillars of the economic and monetary system, namely the Stability and Growth Pact on the one hand and the European Central Bank on the other, are being called into question, simultaneously, for the same reasons: intransigence on the part of those in charge and lack of flexibility with regard to means. The diagnosis is clear, however, and the remedies are within our reach.</p>
<p class="contents">The slowdown in growth has intensified over the past few months and the euro-zone deficit has risen from 0.2% of GDP in the year 2000 to 1.4% in 2001. While companies are desperately in need of funding, the directors of the European Central Bank, confronted with the threat of deflation, have shown themselves to be intransigent and blinkered, refusing to lower interest rates, as if inflation were the threat. It is true that the only mandate they have been given is to combat this threat. Economic development and social progress are not their concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Stability and Growth Pact – and I would put ‘growth’ in inverted commas – the supporters of a federal and bureaucratic Europe, faced with delays in the implementation of structural reforms at a time when there was growth but the governments were run by social democrats, aim to penalise governments that have inherited a difficult situation and intend to reduce taxes and charges to relaunch the economy and implement structural investments. This theoretical threshold, however, contrary to the powers granted to the European Central Bank or the rules on the euro, has never been the subject of popular consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Members of the Commission have suggested, we could easily postpone the reduction of the deficit by two or three years, as we all know it is easier to reduce the deficit during a period of growth. The defenders of the dogma, however, as we have seen once again today, are opposed to this because in the eyes of federalists, it is one of the main symbols of the supranational integration that has been achieved. I am telling you – I did not interrupt you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, please grant me the same courtesy, you have ample opportunity to speak – you are free to ignore these problems, to turn a blind eye. These problems foreshadow many others, as proof is currently being provided that here, as elsewhere, the freedom and responsibility of the Member States remain the building blocks of realistic European construction. That is what is at stake and that is what will have to be settled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hoped that this was a misunderstanding but unfortunately, President Prodi persists in his opinion and is repeating his statement, which is, to say the least, injudicious. Clearly, statements of this kind call into question the Commission's policy on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact..</p>
<p class="contents">We created this Stability and Growth Pact less than five years ago. The Pact's implementation benefits from clear and simple decision-making. Unambiguous sanctions are also required. Discussions about the Stability and Growth Pact and the possibility to improve the Pact are necessary, but these discussions should not put the Stability and Growth Pact's credibility on the line. Exposing a difference of opinion between the parties involved to the outside world spells, in fact, the end of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to hear from Commissioner Solbes how he will be discussing the Stability and Growth Pact's rules in a sensible manner, and in this framework, I should like to find out from the Commission what measures it intends to take in order to present the Member States' budgetary issues in an adequate manner. The European economy does not benefit from constant arguing between the parties involved about the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. If it continues in this vein, we are at risk of creating an instability pact, and surely this is not what we want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Either your statements are the result of collusion with individual Member States, in which case we can expect no transparency from the President of the Commission but rather what could be described as a Machiavellian approach to politics, not one advocated by the University of Bologna – if that is the case, tell us more – or else your actions and endeavours resemble those of a Pope informing us that, actually, the virgin birth is just the Church’s little joke. If your intention was to launch a debate, as Mr Watson has suggested, then tell us the whole story, tell us, admit that the European economy’s real problems are not the result of the Pact and its alleged rigidity but are caused by unresolved structural problems, by the inability to reduce current public spending, which serves merely to nourish bloated administrations, by the inability to reform the welfare state, particularly pension systems, to eliminate the excessive rigidity stifling the labour market and enterprise or to progress along the road of privatisation and liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence that the countries in the greatest difficulties are precisely those which have been most reluctant to adopt ambitious reform programmes in recent years.

A glance at history shows us that every currency union lacking the backup of political union failed. The EU is not yet a political union, and so the Stability and Growth Pact is what might be termed a stopgap, an imaginary European Finance Minister. Demolish it, and you imperil monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact is not stupid, but casting doubt upon it is irresponsible and indeed negligent. The Stability and Growth Pact is an effective tool to counteract budgetary folly, a workable substitute for the common EU budgetary policy that, for the foreseeable future, does not exist. The Stability and Growth Pact is neither complicated nor rigid; it is flexible and simple enough, with its rule of no new debts in good times and up to 3% of GDP room to manoeuvre in bad ones. Most of our States abide by the Stability and Growth Pact. Why, I wonder, are the majority in Europe taken to be the stupid ones, just because a few have problems and either have not done their homework or do not want to do it? As they say, people who do not take themselves seriously are not taken seriously by others. What are people, the public and the candidate countries to be guided by and be able to hold fast to, if the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, and Member States, declare constitutional principles to be optional and sacrifice them to convenience and to the opportunism entailed in making policy on a day-to-day basis. Running up debts may be opportune in the short term, but, in the long term, the debt trap jeopardises growth and employment, stability and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use this minute and this debate to express gratitude and congratulations to the Board of the ECB and its President, Wim Duisenberg for their steady hand and for being an anchor of stability. I would, though also like to tell the President of the European Central Bank that, when rain comes pouring in through the roof of a house, or water breaks into a ship, the caretaker or the captain must not go. I beg Mr Duisenberg to call off the early retirement he has already announced, and to stay put. I want to spare us a debate at the present time as to whether a country that openly defies the Stability and Growth Pact has any sort of moral right to propose a candidate as his successor.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, you said on Radio Europe 1, and repeated today, that you were calling for a central institution to coordinate the eurozone countries' economic policies. I do not believe that we need a new institution. We have one – the Commission! Your task is to strengthen it rather than weaken it. Your task is to implement the Treaty rather than to undermine it, and use enhanced coordination to make the objectives realities. Ladies and gentlemen, we need more trust and less troublemaking. My group is therefore showing the yellow card to all those who cast doubt upon the Stability and Growth Pact. If anyone misunderstands that, we will have to show them the red one!</p>

How long the Commission has taken to admit this! I would like to remind you that this Parliament took the view in 1997 that the Stability and Growth Pact had to be flexibly applied, and there was a majority across the group boundaries in support of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact is basically suited to being used as an instrument to coordinate European finance policies. The Economic and Monetary Union needs a regulatory framework, one that, when flexibly implemented, is able to take market trends into account. A rigid interpretation, on the contrary, would let budget deficits increase as a result of the ensuing more pronounced tendency to cyclical weakening and the associated reduction in revenues and increase in expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The automatic stabilisers must, though, be applied by all, and comprehensively, when the economy as a whole is going through a slack period. Their use should not be tied to good behaviour clauses that cannot be made good, or else the goals of the Lisbon process – competitiveness, full employment and social cohesion – will be out of our reach.</p>
<p class="contents">A balanced budget aims for the mid-point of a cycle, and this objective must always be considered against the background of the conditions of the economic climate. That is why neither the Treaty nor the Pact envisage permanent precision or provide for a binding timetable, nor would such a thing be compatible with any interpretation of the Pact that accorded with its purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">What is unsatisfactory about the application of the Pact is the fact that it puts too little emphasis on economic growth, which means that a distinction has to be drawn between deficits that result from current expenditure and those arising from productive capital expenditure. This could be done if European financial policy were to be guided by reference to the structural deficit. Only then will the Stability and Growth Pact be able to play its part as a positive instrument of coordination. That includes, however, efficient coordination of economic policies, with Parliament involved. On this also, Mr Prodi and Mr Solbes Mira, I look forward to the Commission coming up with an unambiguous initiative.</p>

This became clear at the first round table on social exclusion held by the Presidency and the Commission last week in the Danish city of Aarhus, and in which I took part in my capacity as rapporteur for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, following the statements made by Commissioner Lamy and the Commission President, Romano Prodi, I can say that we agree with these statements. This Pact is indeed stupid, as are all decisions that are rigid. This Pact is a clumsy tool for economic governance and must be replaced with something more intelligent, since the 3% rule is positively medieval.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these reasons prove that there is no sense in keeping the Stability and Growth Pact. It makes no sense that Commissioner Solbes Mira, on the one hand, confirms that the targets for the stability programmes will not be met in 2002 – and this could not be clearer in Germany, France and Italy – but on the other, where Portugal is concerned, opens an excessive-deficit procedure and applauds the implementation of measures for antisocial policies that create more unemployment and more poverty, precisely in the country that has the worst economic and social situation and the lowest level of development in the entire European Union. What is clear is that the Pact’s main function is to serve as a pretext, as a political cover-up for the most damaging, disastrous and revanchist government policies seen in Portugal since the revolution of 25 April in 1974.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask: is Commissioner Solbes Mira going to tender his resignation? Or is he going to opt for proposing the suspension of the Pact in order to hold a broad debate on the EU’s economic and social guidelines? And is he going to cancel the excessive-deficit procedure that he imposed on Portugal? Or is President Prodi going to do so in order to address the aims of sustainable economic development, of more jobs with rights and of greater social inclusion? I await your replies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree it was stupid to set in advance the date by which all the Member States simultaneously had to achieve a balanced budget. The budget deficit is a part of the economic policy, the short-term economic policy. What is more, it is the only part remaining after the European Central Bank’s display of irresponsibility. The level of deficit should, therefore, depend solely on the prevailing situation on a given date.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree it was stupid to set the same margin for manoeuvre – 3% – for all countries, as some are already in a great deal of debt, while others are not. Some only contribute marginally to European aggregate data, while others are the driving force of the common market. So why did the Amsterdam negotiators, who were not stupid either, adopt a stupid rule? And, first of all, was a rule necessary? Unlike the French Minister for the Economy, Mr Mer, I do not think a country can ignore its commitments on the pretext that it has other priorities, in this case, reducing taxes for the rich.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree we need rules that apply to all the countries of our Europe. If we want intelligent, flexible rules, however, a common economic authority must be able to take decisions according to the common situation. It is the short-sightedness of the Amsterdam negotiators, their rejection of a true federal Europe which led them to adopt a stupid rule, setting the same deficit limits, the same deadline for compliance, in advance, for all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">May your positive intervention, Mr President, convince the Convention, the European Council and Europe as a whole to choose intelligence over stupidity, to opt for a federal constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I would like to congratulate you on your political sense, as you have basically just instigated the only debate that matters to voters and to European public opinion: is Europe capable of providing these countries with growth, as well as just stability?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, I would like to encourage you not to stop this good work, and not to be lucid by halves. The Stability and Growth Pact is stupid, but, as Mr Solbes says, we need to keep it. The Treaty of Nice is stupid, but, thank God, says Mr Cox, it has been ratified. Enlargement is stupid, says Mr Barnier, because it multiplies the risk of blockages and therefore of weaknesses, but it will be ratified at the forthcoming Copenhagen Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr Prodi, since lucidity has struck you like Paul on the road to Damascus, do not stop there. What is stupid about the Stability and Growth Pact is not so much the form as the content. What is stupid is believing that different societies, which develop differently, can withstand being caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of the money rate and a tighter budget. What is stupid is believing that an ageing Germany, as Mr Eichel said only this morning, can impose this lifelong tenancy policy on nations which, like France, are experiencing natural demographic regeneration and must therefore invest in the future. It is growth that we need, Mr Prodi, growth, a term that your Pact – which, indeed, is no longer really your Pact – has forgotten along the way. How is growth achieved? It is achieved with interest rates that are lower, not higher than inflation, as your Central Bank, the most rigid and therefore, according to you, the most stupid of all the European institutions, insists on imposing on Euroland. Persisting with this policy, Mr Prodi, with the unemployment we are currently experiencing, will not only be stupid, but will soon, I believe, become criminal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The countries belonging to the European Community have at present a mountain of debt totalling EUR 4 700 billion. What that means is that, taken together, the countries belonging to the European Community owe EUR 4 700 billion. The annual interest payments alone, by which this debt is serviced, amount to EUR 230 billion per annum – more than double the European Union's Budget. I am sure that you, Mr President of the Commission, will agree with me when I say that it would be stupid and idiotic to open these floodgates even wider at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the Stability and Growth Pact, for which we have framed rules that are very clear. With the objective of balancing budgets, the deficit may not exceed 3%, and sanctions become operative if this 3% rule is not adhered to. That is the point at issue, and that is what we have to deal with now. It was an enormous help to your country's budget, at the time you were at the head of its government, that these rules create confidence. This confidence led to lower interest rates, and that took a great deal of pressure off your budget. My second point is that I believe it really would be stupid to gamble away these advantages now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, you said that there is a need in Europe for an authority that would have an undisputed role of economic governance. You may not have used those words, but what you meant is a European economic government. That is a view that I share. In my view, that can only be the Commission. What is required of such an economic government, though, is that it should lay down rules and see to it that they are adhered to, in order that they may send out the right messages. Mr President of the Commission, by your interview with <span class="italic">Le Monde,</span> you sent the wrong message. What we expect of you today is that you should make good that error and should do as Parliament demanded on 2 May 1997 and apply the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact – not flexibly, but strictly and consistently.</p>

Consequently, in spirit – not in letter but in spirit – the Stability and Growth Pact can be no better or worse than the Maastricht requirement in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people perhaps consider that the introduction and success of the euro are ex-post vindication of the inflation and excessive deficit limits, those all too restrictive limits. They are wrong! The strict limits imposed in Maastricht certainly succeeded in keeping prices under control, but they exacerbated unemployment in the European economy. Unemployment and recession have not strengthened the value of the euro, they have undermined it, witness the fact that the euro fell by nearly 20% against the dollar when it was introduced, at a time when budgetary deficits were under better control than they are now, while now that deficits are supposedly getting out of control, the euro is almost on a one-to-one parity with the dollar. Witness also the fact that every time the European Central Bank has raised interest rates, that is, every time it has tightened monetary policy, the value of the euro has fallen rather than risen, contrary to the expectations of those who decided to raise interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">The money markets will supposedly punish Europe for its governments' lack of budgetary discipline by depressing the value of the euro. Wrong! The money markets know full well how important economic activity is to the value of a currency and appear to have no intention of punishing a reasonable relaxation in this restrictive policy – reasonable of course in that no one is talking about excesses or irresponsibility – at a time when we are on the brink of another major recession. I think that this analysis justifies President Prodi's choice of words and analysis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here lies the crux of the situation we are in today. The best option for generating growth is to encourage demand by means of investments by governments, investments by enterprises and by private consumption. If, despite the European internal market, nation states continue to assume that they must gain for themselves advantageous positions within the European Union – and that is possible in the absence of an adequate harmonisation of economic, fiscal and social policy – then, quite simply, the fundamental conditions for sustainable growth in Europe are not there.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased domestic demand will not be achieved by reducing wages, which diminishes purchasing power, or by increasing the tax burden on small businesses, which create more jobs and apprenticeships than anyone else, and it will not be brought about by taking so much of the tax burden off big businesses that they no longer pay anything at all. Cutting investment rates during a slowdown, even though there is no inflation of any significance, has a procyclic effect and makes no economic sense.</p>
<p class="contents">There are marked differences between the budgets of the Member States. The fact that shadow budgets are the order of the day means that there is, even within the European Union, no comparable basis for the calculation and management of budgets. If this leads us to talk in terms of altering the Stability and Growth Pact, this must not be done because of the present complex economic situation, for that would be political opportunism; instead, discussion must be a consequence of the construct being fundamentally dysfunctional. Any reform of the Stability and Growth Pact must go hand in hand with greater coordination of European policies on the economy, social affairs, employment, tax and the environment, if there is to be any real upturn in investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We only have to look at today's debate to know what I mean. It appears to be a debate between the people who create the impression that they want to do away with the Stability and Growth Pact altogether, on the one hand, and, on the other, those who have apparently accorded the present Stability and Growth Pact the status of holy writ. This should not be what the discussion is about. What should it be about? In my view, it should be about striking the right balance between the need, recognised also by my own group, to reach a structural credit balance in the medium term and the equally important need to take into account the economic reality and cyclical movements. Is this now a licence, as some fellow MEPs call it, for every country to do as they like? No, indeed not. It is, however, an incentive to further refine the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact by, for example, drawing a distinction between necessary investments, infrastructure and by showing concern on the one hand, and – we might as well give all the details – irresponsible election promises, on the other. It is right in my view that countries experiencing an economic downturn, such as Germany for example, are given more time to get their budgetary position on track. However, in my view, countries that are intent on a structural deterioration of their deficit by, for example, making out bad cheques, like France, should, in my view, be given a yellow card in future, with good reason. Mr Prodi, if it was your intention to stir up a discussion about a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, then you can count on my support. I admire your courage when you say that you do not want to remain deaf and blind to the changing economy. If that is the case, I can forgive you for your bad timing. I can assure you: intelligent agitators invariably do well in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro can never become a dominant currency in the world, the sort we have set out to create, unless the aims of the Stability and Growth Pact are strictly adhered to. I do not really understand why you are now saying that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid. Before the articles in the Pact were signed and sealed you were an economist, a qualified economist, and you were influential in the debate on economic policy. Why did you not say these conditions were stupid before the Treaty of Amsterdam? We agreed this Pact for situations just like these: to make the work of politicians easier when there is a recession and it is difficult to balance public sector finances. This is no surprise. Economic boom periods do not last forever. It is certainly no surprise for any Minister of Finance, and it cannot be a surprise for the Commission. Booms are followed by recession. It is quite obvious that it is more difficult to achieve the aims of the Stability and Growth Pact in a slump than it is during a period of economic prosperity. These four Member States which are now in difficulties and which have promised their citizens something they cannot do are paying the price of not doing what they should have done when we had an economic boom.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members of Parliament would be prepared to increase the Commission’s responsibility and extend its role in coordinating economic policy. Unfortunately, however, remarks like these and the fact that they are being made by Members of the Commission at all, none of whose business this is in any way, do not in the least increase our faith in the notion that we should be giving the Commission a greater role in the coordination of economic policy in the Convention on the future of Europe. When Commissioner Lamy, for example, condemned the Pact as being medieval he was evidently representing more the French Socialist Party rather than the Commission’s view on trade policy. You really should withdraw remarks like these, and I am furthermore asking you to give more thought to what you say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Stupidity is a term that you seem to favour, as you use it two lines further on in the same article, saying that you are not stupid for wanting to throw out public services as France has done. So I think someone wanted to make you say more, or less, than what you wanted to say, and perhaps someone wanted to cover up what you were saying elsewhere in this article, that, for example, a monetary union without economic union would be pure madness.</p>
<p class="contents">If today we give up any coordination of economic policies, what will be left of our ability to use the euro? That is the problem we are facing. Today, the Member States are, quite rightly, demanding budgetary competence. But they are forgetting, or do not want to see, that this competence must be coordinated with economic policies. Today, however, we do not know how to coordinate these economic policies. Parliament has made its suggestions. They must be considered and developed so that finally the broad lines of economic policy have a purpose, namely that the Member States agree to make them their own when laying down their own guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Mr Prodi, you have opened a debate that I believe to be important. In order for it to take place intelligently, we must never give up on the serious nature of the budget. We must consider a more important role for the Commission in the early warning procedures, in defining the European general interest. Have we given enough consideration to what happened when the UMTS licences were granted? Perhaps it would have been better to have a stronger Commission then, in terms of its proposals, just as, in certain exceptional circumstances, the Member States need to feel guided by the Commission leadership. I am thinking, for example, of the oil crisis. On a day-to-day basis, however, the Commission must stand by the Member States, supporting them, not intervening like a policeman at critical moments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate that is about to take place, that you have launched and that we would like to have, we need to consider the proper coordination of the various criteria, and in particular, the criterion of debt sustainability. That is what I believe to be the most important thing in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is interesting that applause came at once from the wrong quarter. In every country, those who pursue inflationary policies suddenly felt themselves to be affirmed and encouraged by what the President of the Commission had to say. The truth of the matter is that, throughout the history of political economy, statistics prove that lasting growth can be achieved only by stability and a stable currency. Run up more debt, and what you get is not growth, but inflation and stagnation. It was Helmut Schmidt who said, ‘I would rather have 5% inflation than a 5% increase in unemployment.’ Afterwards, he ended up with higher inflation and more unemployment. Such is the demonstrable reality of our continent's economic history.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption)</span></p>
<p class="contents">How, then, Mr President of the Commission, are the rules to be adhered to if they are, at the same time, categorised as stupid? For God's sake, is it not enough to be in debt to the tune of EUR 4 700 billion? Getting into debt is the easy way out, incurring fewer debts and consolidating budgets the hard one, but we know from the Bible that easy is the way that leads to destruction. The hard way, by which I mean budget consolidation, is the right one, and, suddenly, we are unwilling to expect our governments to take it. No, that was a mistake, Mr President of the Commission! Such an elegant provocation ...</p>

The need, which I fully endorse, for flexible application of the Stability and Growth Pact and for coordination of economic, social and environmental policies, starting with the eurozone, has, however, been completely disregarded during the recent years of recession, not least because of the serious forecasting errors made by the European Commission and the European Central Bank, which actually discouraged any attempts to promote or coordinate an active, counter-cyclical economic policy shared by the Union’s governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is true that the flexible, selective management of the Stability and Growth Pact cannot be left to the discretion of the individual governments, for this could result in the weakening of social cohesion and, at worst, higher inflation. I therefore support the proposal to include the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, in other words the programming of public investment in the areas of research, lifelong training and environmental improvement and the creation of integrated European transport and telecommunications networks, as an additional objective of the Stability and Growth Pact, subtracting the sum of these investments from the total budgetary deficit of Member States’ governments.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision requires, of necessity, strong support from the European Community. Indeed, the Community must be able, through the Commission, to assess, <span class="italic">ex ante</span>, the compatibility and conformance of the investments with the objective of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic economy based on knowledge, full employment and sustainable development in the world by 2010, facilitating the coordination of these investments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a single currency but it does not have a genuine economic policy authority. It has a single currency but it does not have a genuine federal budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Until yesterday, the Union had the Stability and Growth Pact: the wonderful substitute – yes, a substitute – for a non-existent economic policy, for a non-existent proper redistributive budget, for a non-existent economic policy authority, while even the single currency and the monetary area are far from perfect. As you know, President Prodi, the credibility of the euro is linked, amongst other things – above all, I would say – to the Stability and Growth Pact and to its capacity to force the Member States to produce responsible budgetary policies: budgetary policies, I would point out, which they themselves have proposed and which are accepted by all their citizens. Of course the Stability and Growth Pact is subject to constraints – that is clear and we are all aware of it – particularly at a time of recession such as that the Union is currently experiencing. Nevertheless, Mr Prodi, it is one thing to find an intelligent way round these constraints, but it is quite another to actually remove them, to change the rules half way through the game, leaving a free-for-all.</p>
<p class="contents">What concerns me, President Prodi, are not the intelligent changes – which are always welcome – but the danger that budgetary policy will actually be renationalised. This, President Prodi, is the most serious matter, the most perilous danger of all, for we could end up endorsing the policies of the irresponsible countries and penalising countries which have implemented responsible policies, the countries which have placed their trust in us. Rewarding the grasshoppers and punishing the ants will not help the euro: it will do nothing to further European integration at this very sensitive point in its development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the European People’s Party will, through its members taking part in the Convention, acting in accordance with the mandate they received at the recent Estoril Congress, propose that the Convention should constitutionalise the basic principles of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>

If I understood correctly, the Commission has now made an intelligent start to a process of defending the Stability and Growth Pact, which will only be possible if it demonstrates political courage and if it is able to break with some of its current positions. We hope that the European Parliament, which is, by definition, the Community institution that is most open and most representative of the common citizen, understands and supports the positive process that President Prodi has set in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">Only those who have been going around with their heads completely in the clouds and divorced from Europe’s economic reality could be surprised today. It was clear from the earliest days that the Stability and Growth Pact was founded on rules that would work reasonably in times of economic growth but which could prove to be a hindrance when faced with certain unforeseen circumstances and with only moderate growth. The Europe of the Euro is founded on a framework of a single monetary policy and twelve separate budget policies. This justifies the existence of clear rules preventing undisciplined economies, especially the larger ones, from jeopardising the stability of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgetary rigour is the guarantee that today’s generation will not bequeath excessive debt to future generations. Forcing States to rationalise their spending and to make their services more efficient is crucial to a genuine development strategy. I am sure that we all agree on this. Nevertheless, the disciplinary rules must be understood by the markets and must not contravene national policies and the legitimate interests and commitments associated with them. This requires them to be worded flexibly, and adapted whenever this should prove necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the original sin of the Stability and Growth Pact and this is why more and more voices are calling for it to be amended. Closing our eyes to this new reality would be to reject out of hand all of our commitments, condemning the Pact and especially its aims, to total failure. A static interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact is beginning to look unsustainable, because it does not respond to the current economic situation and even less matches the aims that the European Union set for itself in Lisbon of becoming, in the short term, the most powerful economy in the world. Using the Stability and Growth Pact intelligently, emphasising the pillar of growth in the current economic situation is absolutely crucial for nature not to rebel and for the building that has been constructed so laboriously not to collapse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Stability and Growth Pact has to have a far more sophisticated interpretation. The background for this has to be sound public finances and a stable economy. Furthermore, as you have stated, it needs to take into account the economic cycle for budgetary policy. Also, further reforms have to be sustainable, measured against the country's debt profile. We must also allow for public investment, because that can lead to the growth that you referred to in the Lisbon Summit and not just deal with welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries like the United Kingdom for example after all those disastrous years of under-investment under Tory governments, need to catch up and we must be able to let them do that. But the fact is that, as the old joke says, 'if you line up all the economists around the world head to toe, you may never reach a conclusion'. What we do not want is to line up the Commission head to toe and find out that all that is left is inconsistency. Let us change the Stability and Growth Pact. Let us make it flexible – you can help do that – but let us recognise that it has to be a sophisticated instrument in a real economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A currency is as strong as its economy. If the economy is limping along, the currency will be weakened in the long term. The high level of tax in Europe weakens the economy and is not leaving private citizens enough room to manoeuvre or enough disposable income to boost consumer spending. Also, too much money is being poured into the grossly distended bureaucracy of the civil service. This must be changed. The euro needs not only a pact for stability, but also, primarily, for growth. Discussion of this issue is therefore both necessary and sensible, in order that the euro may in the long term become a strong rather than a weak currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this debate, which has not been purely academic, as it could have been, given its chance, idiosyncratic origins; it has been a weighty debate on the economy which I hope can be repeated in the future. The different positions – do not worry, Mr Poettering, I never mix personal relations with political opinions – which have emerged in this debate have revealed something important, namely that the system we are working with is unbalanced. There is an <span class="italic">ex post </span>coercive instrument to ensure that the necessary rigour is respected – although, thanks to the lack of authority, a genuine obligation is not always imposed: it is often an invitation rather than an obligation – but there is no <span class="italic">ex ante</span> instrument to create the conditions for balanced development, to help the countries which are bound together in the single currency to achieve balanced development in terms of healthy public finances and employment. We do not have an economic policy which we can evaluate and monitor together.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we will be in danger of breaking the code of Community living – and that really would be stupid – if we do not employ the political astuteness which we need to foresee disagreements and tension and to avoid a situation where we have to stand by, powerless, until the time comes to clamp down, with the risk, as we have heard, that the Member States will indulge in bargaining.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the direction the Commission wishes to take, so let us get started, as Commissioner Solbes said, and continue to exploit all the possibilities provided by the existing instruments, but we must ensure that European economic policy is no longer dictated purely by accounting instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of specific references have been made to the European Central Bank, but the European Central Bank is doing its job properly, you know. The problem is that we cannot leave it without support! We have a European economic policy in which, thank God, there is a Central Bank which has been successful from the start, and for this we must give it its due because it really did start from scratch. It has been a Herculean task to create a control and monitoring structure, an economic financial analysis structure, from scratch, with 12 different countries, and we must safeguard the independence of the Central Bank but not its isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are here today holding a debate, and the debate has revealed that the issue of an economic policy authority has not been resolved. Mr President, I would like a further debate to be held on this matter. Indeed, we share a single currency, and this means that we cannot devalue, it means that we cannot vary interest rates, it means that we really are tied to a system which is strong and rigid in many respects. Well then, if we want this system to work, we must establish an authoritative institution to help us coordinate economic policy headings. I am not pushing for the Commission to get the job here – I am putting us all forward as candidates. I have never said that this authority should necessarily be the Commission, of course not! This authority needs to be created, to be established, to be formed because we have to protect the single currency together, and we therefore have to move together towards the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that, in my interview – which, I would stress – was a long one – the word which has been the subject of so much criticism referred not to the Stability and Growth Pact, as has been reported, but to the fact that the Pact has been interpreted too literally. Reference has been made, for example by Mr Abitbol, just now, to Saint Paul: the problem is the difference between the spirit and the letter. We are enclosed, shut away in a corner, and we have to work according to the letter of the law, and it is the letter which is stupid. We have to have instruments, we have to use politics, we have to use the spirit of the law if we are to interpret our people’s problems. Remember that, when there are discrepancies between different countries’ economic policies, things could come to a head at any moment. In this sense, Mr Watson, it was not by chance that I brought the subject up. I gave the interview on purpose, although you are right – I could have discussed it with Parliament, and I will do so whenever you call upon me to discuss these matters, for they are the basis of our Community life. I broached the subject because of the work of the Convention. We need to debate these issues so that the Convention realises that we are experienced, that we are capable of addressing these issues.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Another reason why I raised the matter is that the European people are calling upon us to discuss economic affairs not just in terms of finance and balancing accounts<span class="bold"> </span>but in terms of things that affect their everyday lives, and I can assure you that this does not mean I have been lax or too flexible in economic matters. In the past, I have even had the courage to impose a Europe tax on my country – specifically labelled a Europe tax – because I feel that the citizens have to be given clear, accurate information. Clearly, we in this House have to discuss the issue of the spirit and the letter of the Pact, with due regard for the Pact and within the constraints of the current situation where we have to apply it to both large and small countries. This is another of the problems which have emerged during this debate: do you apply equal rigour in the event of deviation on the part of France, Germany or Italy, whose deficits are approaching or have already exceeded 3%? I can assure you that, if this information is confirmed by official notifications or Commission statistics, as agreed in the Amsterdam declaration, the Commission will apply the measures laid down in the Treaty and the Pact, it will discharge its duty towards all because that is its job.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said, however – and I reiterate it before the House – that this is not enough! It is not enough to ascertain the existence of the deficit, closing the stable door after the horse has bolted! Here, we have to develop a common economic policy – we owe it to our citizens! That is why the word I used may have appeared rather strong. My apologies to the academics, but I believe that this has served to show all of us what we must do in the future.</p>

Coming from the guardian of the Pact, these words are certainly likely to shock. This is not, however, a slip of the tongue. Mr Prodi is visibly trying, by means of desperate measures, to save the Stability and Growth Pact, which has now reached an impasse.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, by immediately adding that in order to have a flexible Pact, there would have to be an authority in Brussels with decision-making power, Mr Prodi clearly showed that he wants to move towards a super-State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear what is causing the block today: on the one hand, the Stability and Growth Pact is growing less relevant by the day; on the other, the Member States have no desire to hand over their economic and budgetary powers to Brussels, as shown by the stormy debates within the Convention’s Working Party on Economic Governance. Mr Prodi is, therefore, just trying to move in the direction that was the federalists’ plan all along when they wanted to introduce the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a clever move in the short term. In the long term, however, it will be a mistake. The economic super-State would be just another rigid system, following in the footsteps of the Stability and Growth Pact and, dare we say, the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
