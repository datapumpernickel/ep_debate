The Commission and the Council adopted most of what Parliament requested at first reading. Now, the user stage of the directive’s application is, for example, being included, and we have obtained a generic term so that we know what we are talking about. All products intended as animal nutrition are now defined by a common term in all animal feed legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very good that the important rules on, for example, the ban on dilution are now being implemented. This means that a batch containing unduly high levels of, for example, dioxin may not be taken and diluted with something else so that it comes within the limits. Personally, I think it is excellent that we have incorporated what are called action thresholds into the directive. That, ladies and gentlemen, is in practice the precautionary principle. It means that if, for example, a dairy discovers that the level of mycotoxin, a mould poison, is increasing in its milk, an investigation can be launched, in spite of the fact that the limit above which the substance becomes hazardous has not yet been exceeded. An investigation can then be begun into why the level of mycotoxin is increasing in the milk, and preventative measures can be adopted further back in the chain before the limit has been reached beyond which there is a danger of poisoning.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has accepted everything, except in relation to an issue which we in the committee have now been forced to re-address, namely that of whether or not unsuitable batches of feed should be returned to, for example, the Third World. The committee and I believe it is profoundly immoral simply to pass on in that way products which do not fulfil the requirements of the directive. We do not know in such cases where the products will end up, whether they will be used in the poorest areas or whether they will simply return to our own market in another guise. The committee therefore chose to table amendments which remove this option of re-export. We also chose to retain a transitional period of six months following the directive’s entry into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsequently, the Commission and the Council came and offered negotiations under the Belgian Presidency. We tried to reach a compromise and, in fact, did so. I would thank both the Belgian Presidency and the Commission for the excellent and constructive way in which they have cooperated with me and my co-rapporteurs on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We agreed on a compromise solution according to which re-export was to be regulated in the same way as in the general food law which we have today voted through Parliament with a very large majority. This solution is a technical way of plugging a time gap so that, when the general law comes into force, the provisions of this law will apply to re-export in accordance with this directive. It is not, then, a new proposal but is concerned with bridging a particular period of time. The compromise amendment we tabled has exactly the same wording as in the Whitehead report.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, when everything was ready, we learned however that the Council did not want to accept this compromise. I realise with deep regret that we have to withdraw our compromise proposal and are thus forced into a conciliation. I want to say to the Council of Ministers that this is purely and simply a misuse of the conciliation institute. This is not such a complex and serious dispute that we should need to go so far, but my co-rapporteurs and I find the situation such that Parliament is compelled to draw attention to it. When five political groups sign a compromise, then we are serious about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday, we discussed the circulation of compound feedingstuffs; today, at a second reading, we are back with undesirable substances in animal nutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Paulsen has confirmed that, in its common position of 17 September 2001, the Council shared Parliament's view that, in order to ensure a comprehensive level of protection, no mixing or dilution should be permitted and that, in addition, the Member States should be empowered to lay down action thresholds.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the practicality of these proposals will be shown when the time comes to implement them, and if there are problems then we must be ready to make more changes. We know that everything that is prescribed must be capable of being monitored, which does not mean that only the possibility of monitoring must exist, but that monitoring is actually carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are actually hoping for is that we can complete this document today. Our misgivings about the issues raised by Article 13(2) have been put forward, and we continue to hope that there will be a compromise, even if Mrs Paulsen has now cast doubt on it. The groups have come to an agreement among themselves. What is at issue is the re-exportation of products intended for animal nutrition produced outside the Community and not complying with this directive's requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough to simply say, ‘I do not want that, so I shall send it back’. We ask ourselves questions and we face responsibilities. What happens to feedingstuffs like that? Do they get destroyed, are they diluted, or do they reach us or other countries by other routes? ‘You shall not to others do/what they should not do to you’, we say in Germany, so we are actually in favour of requiring the destruction of produce bought as feedingstuff but not permissible as such under this directive, and of it being done on the spot. The objection now raised to that is that it means the European Union being misused as a disposal plant. I think we would have no problems with that if we could resolve the question of how the costs would be met. So it is not enough to simply send the stuff back, and does not do justice to our responsibility as politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to hope that the compromise that is taking shape, which we have brought in in Amendment No 4, will be supported by a majority in this House, and that we will be able to persuade the Council as well. It will make it possible to put abuses of the system on the record and to document them. The authorities in the exporting third country must give their express consent to the re-exportation. I would, though, see the next logical step as being for the exporting third country to also produce evidence of what has subsequently been done with the items taken back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The measures in the Council common position are a key element of the comprehensive strategy to improve the safety of feed. Prohibition of dilution will reduce the overall contamination load of animal feed. Operators across the production chain will also be obliged to put in place passive systems and good manufacturing practices to ensure that the feed materials and the feedstuffs they produce are safe.</p>
<p class="contents">The setting of action levels will act as an early warning system, triggering a proactive approach to identify sources and pathways of contamination and to take measures to eliminate them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment No 1, the Commission considers that the possibility of returning non-compliant products intended for animal feed to the country of origin has to be maintained. The Commission shares, however, Parliament's concerns in this regard and agrees, therefore, that this return can only happen under strict conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendments Nos 2 and 3 on the date of application, the Commission cannot accept the time period of six months. Instead, sufficient time is needed to transpose these far-reaching measures into national legislation. Serious efforts have to be made by the operators to apply the measures in practice. The Commission is therefore pleased that compromise Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6 have been tabled for this plenary session to replace Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="contents">I should confirm that the compromise amendments are – should you decide to keep them on the table – acceptable to the Commission. These compromise amendments address the Commission's reasons for non-acceptance of the first three amendments. Therefore the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6. The Commission will also try to persuade the Council to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish also to inform you that a revision of the maximum levels of the undesirable substances in Annex I is foreseen. The Commission has already requested the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition to provide updated scientific risk assessments. These assessments are the key scientific input to the revision of the Annex.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes to finalise this review as soon as possible. It should be available before this directive becomes applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I once again thank Mrs Paulsen for the excellent work she has done on this file. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
