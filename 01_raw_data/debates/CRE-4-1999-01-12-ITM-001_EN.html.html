<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischer, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, <span class="bold"> </span> on 1 January 1999 with the introduction of the euro, the common currency, by eleven Member States, Europe took a historic, perhaps even a revolutionary step which will lend a new dimension to the process of European integration. For the first time in the history of the European integration process, that all but miraculous response by the people of Europe to centuries of a precarious balance of power on this continent, of violent attempts to establish hegemony and of terrible wars, an essential component of national sovereignty, monetary sovereignty, has been transferred to a European institution. This act does indeed create a new political dimension. Currency, security and constitution, those are the three essential components of the sovereignty of modern nation states, and the introduction of the euro constituted the first move towards their communitarisation in the EU. The real significance of this step for Europe and international politics will probably only be understood with the passage of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of a common currency is not primarily an economic act, but above all a sovereign and thus eminently political act. With the communitarisation of its money, Europe has also opted for an autonomous path into the future and, in close association with our transatlantic partners, for an autonomous role in tomorrow"s world. To date, however, the EU has only partly been a political entity and therefore the introduction of a common currency at a time when there is still a political and democratic deficit in the Community will create a field of tension, the dynamic of which will radically change the current status quo in the not too distant future</p>
<p class="contents">Observers who pointed out at the time of the euro launch that the common currency offered great opportunities but harboured equally great risks for the EU, depending on the Member States" attitude to the process of further political communitarisation, will, I believe, be proved right. They expected the opportunities to be predominant if the introduction of the euro prompted further, substantial moves towards communitarisation, culminating in full political union. Its introduction would, however, turn out to be a huge risk if this bold step on the part of the EU was not logically followed by other equally bold steps toward full integration, which must include enlargement of the EU to Central and Eastern Europe as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Political wisdom, as also the national interests of all Member States, demand that we do not even let this alternative arise but that instead we jointly and vigorously grasp the opportunities afforded by the successful introduction of the euro. We must therefore strengthen the EU"s ability to take political action and gear its internal structures to the new tasks. Political union, with enlargement to include new Member States, must be our lodestar from now on; it is the logical follow‐up to economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">The main task of the German Presidency is to prepare the Union"s structures and procedures so as to turn it from a Union for western Europe into a Union for the whole of Europe and one that is also capable of global action. We have set ourselves four central aims for the next six months. Firstly, we want to bring the Agenda 2000 negotiations to a successful conclusion by 24/25 March, the date of the special summit in Brussels. That is not a random date. If we do not reach agreement by then, it will seriously call in question the Union"s ability to reform, which is crucial to the enlargement process. There are no two ways about it: the negotiations will be very, very difficult. A solution will only be found through a comprehensive balance of interests. The German Presidency will ensure that a balanced solution is found at the European Council at the end of March, not one that is at the expense of the weakest EU partners.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Even if positions still diverge on key questions, since my presidential trip I have become optimistic that we can agree. During that exploratory trip before Christmas, I felt all partner countries were ready to play a constructive role in the negotiations and strive for agreement by March. Everyone knows that we will only be successful if we treat Agenda 2000 as a single package and if everyone makes compromises. There must be no winners or losers. That means the German Presidency will have to perform a difficult balancing act. Here we also count on the support and understanding of the European Parliament, with whom we want to work together closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we must set about tackling the questions of substance as quickly as possible. In the field of structural policy, I think we must begin by concentrating on the regions with the weakest structures which are most in need of support. Aid must become simpler, less centralised, more environmentally friendly and create more jobs. The future viability and legitimacy of the EU depend on fair burden‐sharing. Let me say quite clearly at this point: as the strongest EU Member State economically speaking, Germany will continue to bear its European responsibility and remain the greatest net contributor. But injustices have crept into the burden‐sharing process, which must be rectified. This concern, which Germany shares with other Member States, has been recognised as legitimate by the Commission and in the meantime also by many partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement, as well as the next round of WTO talks, require a root and branch reform of the common agricultural policy and a reduction in agricultural spending. If we want to admit countries in Central and Eastern Europe which are still mainly agriculture‐based, we cannot carry on with European agricultural policy as it stands. European agriculture must become more competitive and environmentally sustainable. At the same time our farmers" interests must be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to make definite progress towards an effective employment policy. The fight against unemployment is the most urgent concern of the people of Europe. They expect, quite rightly, not just national governments to tackle unemployment but efforts to be made at European level too. Therefore we want to conclude a European employment pact at the Cologne European Council. The pact is to be the expression of an active labour market policy, which will now focus more than before on prevention, on reducing youth and long‐term unemployment and discrimination against women on the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want to and have to make progress on the enlargement of the EU as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the cold war is over, Europe cannot remain restricted to western Europe, for by its very nature the idea of European integration concerns the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the geo‐political situation leaves no real alternative. If this is true, then the events of 1989/90 have already decided the ‘if" question of enlargement to the east; only the ‘how" and ‘when" need to be identified and decided.</p>
<p class="contents">The southern enlargement of the EU was a great economic as well as political and democratic success. Economic prosperity and democratic stability were the fruits of southern enlargement for the countries that joined at the time and for Europe as a whole, and the EU must repeat this success with its eastern enlargement. Prosperity, peace and stability can only be guaranteed for the whole of Europe in the long term through the accession of the Central and Eastern European partners. And only by opening up towards the east can the EU claim to speak as a cultural area and community of values for the whole of Europe. In Germany we have not forgotten the invaluable contribution of the people of Central and Eastern Europe to ending the division of Germany and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be irresponsible politically to allow a zone of instability to emerge beyond the current EU borders, given our experience in the Balkans. In addition, it would be a breach of promise to the new democracies, with fatal consequences for Europe. Thus any deliberate attempt to delay let alone prevent EU enlargement would amount to a politically and economically dangerous and expensive detour, and at the end of the road enlargement would eventually still prove inevitable in view of these realities and risks. For all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, there is in my view no alternative to the enlargement of the EU with the accession of the next applicant states.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We need a strategic vision for the enlargement process, but also a great deal of pragmatism. We must now bring the enlargement negotiations to a successful and workable conclusion as quickly as possible. At this moment – and I emphasise at this moment – we ought to spare ourselves purely academic debates about deadlines. If we concentrate now on making the EU structures ready for enlargement – and the successful conclusion of Agenda 2000 is essential for this – that does not mean postponing enlargement. Quite the reverse in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Our ability to enlarge must go hand in hand with other countries" ability to accede. The sooner the EU tackles the necessary reforms and the more intensively the applicant states pursue their internal reforms, the quicker and smoother the progress of the enlargement process will be.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons Germany remains a strong advocate of early eastern enlargement of the European Union. We want to push ahead with the accession negotiations during our presidency. The applicant countries which still have to enter negotiations must be given a fair chance to catch up with the others; the fast lane must stay open. It is still too early to fix a date for accession. But if we can see light at the end of the negotiating tunnel, probably towards the end of 1999 or in 2000, following the likely progress of negotiations and the successful conclusion of Agenda 2000 in March, it will certainly become reasonable or even urgent to set a definite date to bring the negotiations to a speedy conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we want to enhance the EU"s ability to act in the foreign policy domain. Only a Union with an effective foreign policy can safeguard peace in Europe and bring its increasing weight to bear on the world stage. Even the large Member States of the EU will be less and less able to assert their interests and protect peace in an ever more globalised world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the multipolar world of the 21st century, the EU must therefore become an independent entity capable of political action. We must prepare ourselves for this task by creating a Common Foreign and Security Policy worthy of that name in good time. When the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force, by 1 June at the latest according to the current progress of the ratification process, we want to ensure that it will be applied in all areas immediately. In regard to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Treaty contains a package of new instruments which will enhance the Union"s ability to act in foreign policy matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of the CFSP High Representative will, we hope, bring significant progress. But this will only be the case if it is a man or woman with political weight who can get things done ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">... officials do exist who satisfy both those requirements – I deny that categorically.</p>
<p class="contents">During our presidency, the policy planning and early warning unit are to be set up and the new ‘common strategy" instrument introduced, and with it majority decisions in the CFSP. We want to apply this new instrument first to the EU"s neighbouring regions and adopt the first common strategy for Russia – and if possible also for Ukraine – at the Cologne European Council. The creation of a prosperous civil society in Russia in the long term is most important to the stability of the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time what we need is as much joint action as possible and the most intensive use of the new instruments in the CFSP. It is important that we identify fields of common European interest more clearly. This is also necessary in order to heighten public awareness of the common European approach to foreign and security policy issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next six months we have to turn political vision into tangible progress. But we must not narrow our view to operational day‐to‐day affairs. Europe has always drawn its strength from a constructive mixture of visions and their practical implementation. Particularly in the next six months, it will be important to keep an eye on the wider horizon, in view of the tasks that need to be resolved in practical terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The next target area after the conclusion of Agenda 2000 – and another reason why it is so important now to bring Agenda 2000 to a positive conclusion – will be the EU"s institutional reform. This reform is urgent with a view to enlargement to avoid institutional collapse. If the European Union is to maintain its ability to act with 21 or more members, the appropriate reforms must be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to an enlarged Union"s ability to act is the willingness to accept majority decisions in as many areas as possible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The new Federal Government advocates limiting the unanimity requirement in the EU in the longer term to questions of fundamental importance such as treaty amendments. At the Vienna European Council, it was agreed that the Cologne European Council should decide on how to deal with the institutional questions not resolved in Amsterdam. I would imagine that in Cologne we will give the green light to a new intergovernmental conference, which could meet around the year 2001.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">In the long term we have to face the question of the aims and methods of further integration. We have followed the inspired ‘Monnet method" in the European Union for more than 40 years: a step‐by‐step approach towards further integration with no blueprint of the ultimate goal. This method proved extremely successful. We have achieved the goals of no more wars, economic reconstruction and prosperity that were formulated in the 1950s.</p>
<p class="contents">War within the European Union has now become impossible from both political and military standpoints. This is the greatest achievement of the European integration process on our warring continent and we should never forget this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Economic and monetary integration is largely completed with the introduction of the euro. Only a few areas are still lacking, such as closer harmonisation of tax policies, which Germany advocates. So why do we want to carry on with integration? I see two central reasons for doing so: firstly, because in the age of globalisation no European nation state, not even the larger ones, will be able to act on their own. We Europeans can only meet the challenges of globalisation if we are united; and, secondly, because exporting stability to neighbouring regions is not just a historic and moral responsibility for Europe but also lies in our own best interests. Crisis prevention is always better, cheaper and above all more humane than acute crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The greatest deficits within the EU are to be found today in the fields of political integration and European democracy. How can we make headway in these areas? After Maastricht and Amsterdam, the call for a European constitution will be much louder than before. This public debate in the Member States will give new impetus to political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">For me this is initially more a question of substance and aims than of reappraising legal bases. The idea of a common European future, the ‘finality" of Europe, is hazy at present. A debate on what constitutes Europe could provide both direction and clarity in this area. Important questions about the future remain unanswered. What idea can rally people in favour of Europe? This is in my view a central issue because in the final analysis it concerns the soul of the future Europe. What should the balance of powers be in the triangle of Europe, nations and regions? Where do we need more or perhaps less Europe? Where are Europe"s external borders? How can we further the development of a European public and strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the EU and its institutions? People are right to look for answers to these questions. We will all have to consider them.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to turn the European Union into a strong and assertive entity, then we need to strengthen it in four key policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Europe needs more democracy. The decision‐making processes in the Union need to become more transparent and more comprehensible to the people. The citizens need to understand at long last who is deciding what in Brussels and with what legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty has bestowed new and important rights and powers on the European Parliament. This can only be an interim step, however. The greater the Union"s ability to act, the greater the democratic legitimacy of its actions must be.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The rights of the European Parliament must therefore be further extended – and I am saying that as a convinced European rather than fishing for compliments – and that should also be a focus of the next intergovernmental conference. Broader legitimacy means that the European Parliament enjoys equal co‐decision rights and an equal say in all areas where the Council can adopt legislation by majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament could also play a greater role in the election of the Commission than is provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty. Closer involvement of the national parliaments, as already provided in the Amsterdam Treaty, should also be considered. In order to strengthen citizens" rights, Germany is proposing the drafting of a European charter of fundamental rights in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We want to take the initiative here during our presidency. For us it is a question of consolidating the legitimacy and identity of the EU. The European Parliament, which has already done the groundwork with its 1994 draft, should be involved in drawing up the charter of fundamental rights, as should the national parliaments and as many social groups as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Common Foreign and Security Policy must be geared to the European values of peace and human rights and be capable of efficient crisis management. In the age of globalisation, human rights have a political and economic importance that goes over and above the humanitarian aspect, as demonstrated by the recent Asian crisis. Security of investment in the emerging markets is possible only if ecological sustainability and human rights are also assured, not if they are suppressed.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The development of free markets is only possible on a lasting basis if it is embedded in a wide culture of freedom based on human rights, the separation of powers, the rule of law, democratic parties, independent unions, a free press and a critical public. During our presidency we will work towards strengthening the EU"s human rights profile. The new EU human rights report aims to create transparency and at the same time to provide impetus for action in the European Union and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to efficient preventive and operational conflict resolution lies in greater use of majority decisions and presenting a united front to the outside world – in the G8, the international financial institutions and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amsterdam can only be one step along the way towards an enlarged Union that is capable of taking action in the foreign policy domain.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need a European security and defence identity to complete the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In recent times, a problematic trend towards unilateralism and away from multilateralism has been noticeable in international affairs. This tendency has already had very adverse effects at United Nations level, which must give cause for concern. Global peace‐keeping also needs to be legitimised by the multilateral organisations. But this also necessitates political entities that are willing and able to use their influence to shape the international political system as an order of peace through multilateral action based on international law and in conjunction with other partners. This is another important, central challenge for the Europe of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Collective defence will remain NATO"s remit. But the EU must also develop its own capabilities for military crisis management in cases where the EU sees a need for action in which its North American partners do not wish to become involved. This issue has received fresh impetus following Tony Blair"s initiative in Pörtschach and the Franco‐British meeting in St Malo. After the single market and economic and monetary union, the creation of a European security and defence identity, ESDI, could be of great importance to the further deepening of the EU. During our dual presidency of the EU and WEU, we will make every effort to harness the new momentum of Pörtschach. By the time of the Cologne European Council, we intend to draw up a report on the possible further development of the European security and defence identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in the field of justice and home affairs, the Amsterdam Treaty aims to create an area of freedom, security and justice. We want to attain this goal step by step. The special meeting of the European Council in Tampere in October is to take stock of the situation and establish further guidelines. During our presidency we also want to discuss asylum policy burden‐sharing as well as the humane handling of large refugee flows. Fighting international organised crime effectively is crucial to Europe"s ability to act and its acceptance by the people. To that end, we need to step up cross‐border cooperation between police forces and increase Europol"s operational capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues just mentioned point to the urgent need for the entry into force of a European charter of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during my presidential trip before Christmas, I met my Spanish colleague at the conference centre in Madrid where the Peace Implementation Conference for Bosnia was also being held. While we, the Spanish and German foreign ministers and delegations, prepared important EU decisions about the Europe of the 21st century, the Europe of integration, the conference also had to seek solutions to the Europe of the past, the Europe of nationalism and war. The history of European disunity was described graphically in Madrid on that day, while at the same time the historical challenge which lies before us was made clear. Both alternatives make up the current reality of Europe, but we, the Europe of integration, must not afford the Europe of the past any chance for the future because that would spell disaster for our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the Europe of integration is viable and only this Europe can peacefully put to rest the discord on our continent and make the EU into a political entity able to help shape the future of a dramatically changing world. Several generations have now worked on making the European house, the EU, a political success. Our generation has the challenge of completing this Europe of integration.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Santer, </span> <span class="italic">President of the Commission. – (FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President‐in‐Office, I shall be very brief today because I already had an opportunity to highlight the main points of the German Presidency when I spoke yesterday. Moreover, I agree entirely with the programme the President‐in‐Office has just set out for you.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday morning I was in Bonn with my whole team for the traditional meeting at the beginning of the presidency. The work was carried out in a most constructive climate. I was struck by the German Government"s determination to harness all its energy to the service of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Determination is certainly needed, because the Vienna strategy provides for a very heavy programme for the German Presidency. In fact, the first six months of this year will represent a pivotal stage in the development of the Union. At the same time, of course, Germany will also be presiding over the fortunes of the G7‐G8, the Western European Union and Schengen. This is a very heavy burden, but it is also a unique opportunity to move forward on major issues such as the introduction of the euro, the incorporation of Schengen into the Treaty, and the definition of a genuine defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Agenda 2000 will, of course, be the major challenge of the next six months. Everything, or almost everything, has already been said on this subject. Now we must negotiate, negotiate, negotiate! Agenda 2000 will undoubtedly be decisive for the future of the Union, because without a serious reform of the common agricultural policy, we would be facing unmanageable surpluses again in a few years" time. Without a reform of the Structural Funds, the vital efforts made to achieve economic and social cohesion would gradually run out of steam, and without an agreement on the future financial framework, the Union would end up making all the old mistakes with endless quarrels about the budget, and acrimonious disputes that harm the development of the Union. Of course, failure would seriously endanger the prospects of enlargement, which is undoubtedly the major goal of the beginning of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that, together, the presidency, Parliament and the Commission will succeed in taking up the challenge. The political will to do so exists in every country, as Mr Fischer has just mentioned. Everyone knows there will have to be compromises. That was clearly demonstrated in Vienna and was also confirmed by my own bilateral contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major theme of the presidency, as I see it, is the whole issue of growth and employment. The euro is here, of course, and now we must make it thrive. Internally, that means strengthening economic coordination from all angles, including – and I would stress this – taxation. Externally, be it in the context of the G7‐G8 or that of the international financial organisations, the Union must speak with one voice, one single voice, and make its presence felt. You know how much importance I have attached to the fight for jobs ever since the start of my mandate. We have come a long way recently and I am delighted with the Vienna decision to move towards a proper pact, which is what I have been calling for since 1996. The Cologne meeting will be important in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">During the German Presidency, the Amsterdam Treaty will come into force. Its success will depend on very close contacts with the European Parliament to ensure that decisions are taken smoothly, especially on issues where procedures will change with the new Treaty. Agenda 2000 is one of these.</p>
<p class="contents">A major innovation in the Treaty involves the creation of a real area of freedom, security and justice. I know how important this is to the German Presidency, and it is becoming urgent to coordinate our responses on immigration and asylum, for example. The fight against organised crime is a priority in all the Member States and we must tackle it together; that is what our citizens expect.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the German Presidency, we must make in‐depth preparations for the special summit in Tampere, which will be held under the Finnish Presidency. And as Mr Fischer has just said, the next institutional reform is already taking shape, with the Amsterdam Treaty only just coming into force. Life is like that in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Foreign affairs will occupy a special place during the German Presidency. I have often said that if there is one area where progress still needs to be made and where Europe must become stronger, then it is certainly in the field of foreign affairs. The political will to do so has sometimes been lacking in the past. That is no longer tolerable given the high degree of integration we have achieved, with the launch of the euro and the arrival of a multipolar world. Obviously I cannot go through the long list of our relations with all the world"s regions now, but I will just mention two or three examples. Our relations with the United States have assumed unparalleled importance and intensity. It is not unusual for differences to arise in such a relationship and the banana affair is one example. In fact, that issue has implications going well beyond the delicious fruit itself. This problem must be resolved by following our rules, which in this case are also those of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues like these must not poison relations that do, after all, have another dimension. I am thinking, amongst other things, of the area of defence, where we have worked hand‐in‐hand with our American partners for decades. It is up to Europeans to strengthen those relations in the mutual interest of bringing them closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">My second example is that of our relations with Russia, that great country which, despite its present difficulties, will always remain a great country. Recently, we have moved to a new level in terms of relations between the Union and Russia, and I am sure the German Presidency will continue along that path.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will stop there because I fully agree with the picture Mr Fischer has painted.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think this very brief statement from me is enough to highlight the importance of the German Presidency for the Union. I would like to strongly emphasise that over the next six months the Commission will be standing by the Presidency to fulfill its role under the Treaties and in time‐honoured tradition. Personally, I am sure that when we assess the outcome in June, the Union will have progressed to another stage, which will be a decisive stage in the unification of our Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Medina Ortega </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, although I very much regret the accident that has taken place, I am delighted to be the first to speak on behalf of the Socialist Group, and to extend a warm welcome to the new President‐in‐Office of the Council of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture, Germany is taking on not just one but five presidencies. It is to preside over the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the Group of Eight, the Schengen Group and the Western European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the German Foreign Secretary health and strength as he discharges these many responsibilities over the next six months. He can, of course, rely on the backing of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. We shall offer him every support.</p>
<p class="contents">The President‐in‐Office referred to resources. As he himself pointed out, Europe is being built in line with the vision of Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, on the basis of concrete achievements and economic achievements. In this Community, we certainly do emphasise the importance of economic matters. Only yesterday, for instance, we spent a whole day discussing issues of this nature. However, I must confess to feeling somewhat concerned: if we concentrate on analysing the resources, we may run the risk of becoming an accounting community. In other words, accounting may come to take precedence over economic realities. Having studied the relationship between the resources available and the objectives, I am of the opinion that this Community represents a good investment. We contribute a little over 1 % of GDP to the Community budget. This contribution of a little over 1 % of GDP has enabled us, over the last 50 years, to put an end to the wars that had been ravaging Europe. A single day of war between two European countries would absorb the whole Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also succeeded in turning Europe into an oasis of stability, progress, peace and democracy that is now the envy of the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In discussions on the resources, therefore, it will probably be necessary to study the relationship between the resources and the objectives, whilst not neglecting the importance of good accounting. An investigation should be carried out to establish the extent to which each of the Member States is receiving more from the Community than it apparently should. It could be the case that, having invested a small amount, a particular Member State is in receipt of benefits out of all proportion to its initial investment.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the key issue for the European Union at present is our cohesion. The Union is part of a dangerous and unstable world, yet we have important tasks to carry out. As the President‐in‐Office himself pointed out, priority must be given to combating unemployment. The fact that 10 % of our citizens are not currently in normal paid employment is a matter of concern. It has serious social and economic implications.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the kind of Europe we are trying to build must be united. It needs to be both socially and territorially united. Varying speeds of economic development should not be tolerated within it, nor should it be possible to accept different speeds of social development. I do not believe that the Europe we are trying to build should be a Europe that works for the rich and not for the poor. It must not become a Europe in which a privileged few enjoy a high standard of living, as is the case in other major modern industrial societies. It must become a Europe which is well balanced socially and in all other respects.</p>
<p class="contents">The other speakers from my group will explore some of the issues I have raised in greater depth, but I believe these are the ideas that form socialist expectations of the German Presidency.</p>

At first people derided this project as merely a vision, but thanks to resolute action it has become a reality. Monetary union is the achievement of many people. But at the beginning of this German Presidency I would like to give thanks on behalf of the PPE Group to a figure who took Germany through three presidencies, in 1983, 1988 and 1994. I want to thank Helmut Kohl, former Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and freeman of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, we wish this German Presidency the same resolve, the same dynamism, the same courage that Helmut Kohl displayed for Germany and in Europe. Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, we hope that in your words and your actions you will manage not just to maintain but to further strengthen our European partners" trust in Germany"s European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret the fact – and this is not a question of party politics – that the use of the term realism has given the impression that the accession process is to be delayed. Happily you expressed yourself in such a way today that we can endorse what you said; nevertheless this impression has been created. President Kwasniewski of Poland sounded the alarm when he spoke here in Parliament on 18 November of sending out a wrong signal that could discourage the people of Central Europe from pursuing their reform process. Let us encourage the people of Central Europe! We call on them to speed up the accession process!</p>
<p class="contents">We have a political and moral duty to do our utmost to ensure that the people of Central Europe can join the European Union"s community of values as quickly as possible. That is also a question of trust. What German policy accomplished over a period of 16 years, and of course before that too, must not come to nought! But that also means that we must not engage in any foolhardy debate about a changed North Atlantic Alliance strategy. That too is a question of the trust the people of Central Europe place in us.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we know it is difficult for our own people to accept the need for rapid accession. But politics is not about taking one"s cue from daily opinion surveys; it is about doing the right thing and winning the people of Europe over to it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, you said you want to submit proposals for institutional reform. We welcome that and call on you to give the European Parliament an equal say with the Commission in these deliberations. You want to adopt Agenda 2000 at the March summit. We welcome that and wish you success in that endeavour!</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of the German contribution. Certainly everyone will have to make their contribution so that a fair solution can be reached. Germany"s net contribution is certainly high. This needs rectifying. But we hope that during the internal German discussion the presidency of the Council and its highest representatives will also point out that in 1997, for instance, Germany had a balance of trade surplus of DEM 81 billion with its other European Union partners. That too is part of the truth and people must be told it!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions, heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">High unemployment is a pressing problem for us too. Here the European partners must learn from each other how to create more jobs. But we would warn anyone against giving the impression that simply by elevating employment policy to European Union level this problem can be overcome, and then holding Europe responsible if unemployment cannot be dealt with at national level. Europe must not be turned into a scapegoat! We will not allow any political alibis in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a final remark. The agreement reached by the Bonn coalition government – which is of European significance – provides that in the next European Commission both posts will be occupied by the government parties. We want to make it quite clear: we hope that is not the federal government"s last word, but if this German example sets a precedent and if the next European Commission is appointed on a one‐sided political basis, then the European People"s Party will not be able to give that Commission its vote of confidence. We would ask you to take that into account!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, we wish you success during your presidency, for your success is Europe"s success. It is our common success in achieving a strong, democratic European Union which is capable of action, that will make it possible to secure peace and freedom in our old, constantly changing European continent in the 21st century.</p>

Yet I must draw your attention to a discrepancy between what you have said today and the impression your Chancellor – who is after all a person of some importance to the European Union – is giving in all the debates in Germany and Europe, namely that the net contributor debate is the only real debate and that this is the crucial factor on which everything else depends!</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that because I believe that Europe is more than the sum of national interests and I felt a little nervous yesterday when on top of that your Chancellor emphasised that he would like to see a very open representation of German interests. We all represent national interests too. But I do not think that is a very suitable motto to choose for a presidency! That is why I believe that we must take a very cautious approach to the net contributor debate. It is quite clear that this debate is important. But I would ask you not to put it at the beginning of our reform debates but to take it last. First we must clarify the situation in regard to our aid systems. Then we have to establish our financial requirements and then, at the end, we must determine how to achieve a fair burden‐sharing. During that concluding debate, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, you will find that the liberals will speak very objectively and with all the necessary fairness.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the other points you made, I would highlight your statements on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and especially what you said about human rights and the constitution of the European Union. I wish you every success there. But take care that your net contributor debate does not land you in the same boat as those who try to persuade us that the future lies in what would appear to be a Europe of Fatherlands!

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, the German Government has assumed the presidency of the European Union at a challenging time. Many key European policies are being re‐evaluated in the context of the Agenda 2000 programme which is to be put into place to take account of the impending enlargement of the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The successful launch of the euro in recent days must clearly be an indication to the German Government that stability is the key to the success of European Union policies. The success of the single European currency was brought about by careful, consistent planning which is now going to bring economic benefits to the 290 million people in the eleven participating countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise that the German Government should approach the issues of the reform of the common agricultural policy and the reform of the Structural Funds as well as the future financing arrangements of the Union in a balanced and even‐handed manner. The partnership approach involving all European governments and all EU institutions in the formulation of key European Union policies must always be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to draw attention to the debate taking place in relation to the future financing of the European Union's annual budget. One option which must not be implemented is a possible renationalising of the financing of the common agricultural policy. This policy is a uniform European‐wide programme, and forcing national governments to contribute up to 25 % of the agricultural budget would clearly fragment and distort the workings of the CAP. The recent BSE crisis, as well as the collapse of the Russian market for EU agricultural produce, has severely affected the workings of many individual agricultural operations, most notably the beef sector, and renationalising part of the CAP would introduce even more uncertainty into an already difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there cannot be a reform of the EU Structural Fund programmes unless there is a continued commitment to financially supporting the four Cohesion Fund countries. The European Structural Funds have played a considerable role in helping less‐developed and peripheral nations to prepare the completion of the Single Market, and in the introduction of the European single currency. From an Irish perspective, while we are satisfied that economic progress has been made in recent years, there is need to underpin this progress. More work needs to be done in order to improve the Irish transport and environmental protection infrastructure and bring them up to European standards. It is in this way that the Irish economy can make a positive contribution towards generating growth in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the same situation applies in all of the peripheral countries and regions of the Union and it is vitally important for the success of both the euro and the single market that the good work of recent years should be consolidated through the continued availability of structural cohesion resources until these regions have reached European average levels.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Moreau </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, you raised many issues that our group is committed to, including democracy, fundamental human rights, peace, and a multipolar world.</p>
<p class="contents">But progress with the euro and integration cannot in themselves constitute the means, the only means, of achieving those aims. At the very least, they call for new guidelines that are different from those adopted up to now, which have led to an obvious social and democratic deficit. There can be no prosperous and peaceful Europe if unemployment and poverty continue to spread.</p>
<p class="contents">By giving priority to employment and growth, the Pörtschach Summit had marked a change in tone that we welcomed. Unfortunately, this was not reflected in the Vienna documents. The next summit in Cologne, which the German Presidency must prepare, must not end in further disappointment. The fight against unemployment is our citizens" primary concern, a concern sharpened by the predicted slowing down of growth, and it calls for substantial measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We say are in favour of the European employment pact, but a formula is not enough on its own. It is firstly essential to loosen the stranglehold of the stability pact so that internal demand, the foundation of a healthy economy, can be consolidated. The remit and powers of the European Central Bank must be reviewed because price stability cannot constitute the European Union"s main ideal, and because bankers must not have so much power whereby all that the democratically elected governments have left to do is heal the wounds of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group submitted 13 proposals to the Vienna Summit, on the basis of proposals from unions and associations, and I hope the German Presidency will take them into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the future financing of the Union, I think it is absolutely necessary to get away from narrow accounting assessments. Europe can only be built on solidarity and generosity, not on selfishness and meanness. Instead of planning a reduction in agricultural expenditure, which would be a blow to France and the southern countries, and which our group has opposed, why not look for new sources of financing, for example by taxing capital transactions?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to raise two foreign policy issues. The first is the Council"s role in supporting the Middle East peace process, which is running into so many difficulties. And the second is the Council"s commitment, at last, to the success of the peace plan for Western Sahara, where it is now putting pressure on the Moroccan Government to accept the proposals from the United Nations until a fair and free referendum on self‐determination can be organised.</p>

It is the highest point so far in the history of a generation which in 1968 embarked upon producing a radical upheaval in society, in Europe and in the world. This generated a number of movements, giving rise, among others, to the existence of Europe"s Green parties. Now here we are in the European institutions, a very different place, of course, exercising our powers to protest, to take decisions and to control. From your long experience you will naturally know not to expect us to behave as dutiful choristers concerned solely with celebrating the advent of the German Presidency. There will be water and fire, sun and storm, and they will make for an exciting debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating unemployment is a central concern of the presidency. If we succeed in getting European governments to pursue joint and coordinated action, then mass unemployment can be successfully tackled. After the Luxembourg summit it is absolutely vital to ensure a convincing follow‐up, with no postponing by Vienna until Cologne or Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the German initiative in an EU manifesto on basic rights as well as the commitment to an international strategy to combat human rights violations and their causes. As regards asylum policy and Schengen we are much less enthusiastic, but the model of dual nationality included in the German coalition agreement is innovative and could have a certain impact as a new model in and for Europe. It is significant that colleagues from the CDU find it necessary to lodge a petition in order to undermine this innovative initiative which grants political rights to fellow citizens. This certainly plays into the hands of the far right.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we hope that under your presidency steps can be taken towards introducing a European energy tax. This is desirable in order to eliminate labour taxes which are having such a lethal effect on jobs. But our greatest concern is for the future of Agenda 2000. Naturally the outmoded expenditure structure must be looked at and agricultural policy throughly reformed. There can be no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fair to say that the European Parliament is also finding it difficult to arrive at a coherent solution for these agricultural reforms. We have seen that this week. But the main point is: How is the debate on net contributors to be conducted? You are quite right when you say that we must review the way the burden is shared. But it would be nothing short of catastrophic if the Council allowed the debate on net contributors to overshadow the financing plans for enlargement. Europe cannot have everything at once: stability, no migration problems, and enlargement put on the back burner and costing as little as possible. But despite these critical comments, we wish you a very successful presidency and you can count on our critical but constructive cooperation.</p>

Your presidency, which is the last of our legislature, raises high hopes for many reasons and your excellent and constructive speech strengthens those hopes. You raise these hopes firstly because Germany is a big country, with the largest population in Europe, and it is also the most powerful country economically. This does not mean you should burden yourselves with excessive responsibilities, but this is a fact that is obvious to all. You also inspire hope and curiosity because your government has come to power after the long reign of Chancellor Kohl.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is obviously delighted with this new left‐wing majority and we hope that social problems, employment, social justice and citizens" rights – I am thinking, in particular, of the rules for acquiring German nationality – will receive more attention than before. But we also know that the previous Chancellor"s record on Europe was quite remarkable and it will not be easy to take up the torch. We have confidence in you, Mr President‐in‐Office. We know you have a very strong personal commitment to Europe. We have just heard you speak.</p>
<p class="contents">But everyone knows that policies are judged by deeds and not words, and we are anxious to see, particularly at the coming European Councils, if you will be able to break the deadlock on issues that are pending. I am thinking in particular of the whole financial and budgetary side of Agenda 2000. I am thinking of the future of the great policies of the Union, for instance, the common agricultural policy. I am also thinking of the reform of the Union"s institutions, which is essential, as you said, if we want to make a success of the coming enlargement. We are all committed to this and it must be achieved, whatever the difficulties that need to be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me return to the financial aspect of Agenda 2000. We know what problems this raises in Germany. German public opinion is increasingly expressing its discontent with a burden it considers excessive. This even led the German press recently to fuel all the criticism of the Commission about wastefulness, poor management, and even fraud and embezzlement. Little by little, concoctions are created, muddling up valid criticism with false accusations. What worries me is that all this might result in Germany disengaging and withdrawing from the spirit of solidarity, from solidarity with the less favoured regions of the Union, solidarity with the developing countries, and solidarity with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, your remarks just now are reassuring, but I want to stress that Germany needs to maintain the image it has had since the Second World War, the image of an efficient, powerful, rich country and, above all, a country that shows solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from various quarters) </span></p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berthu </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Fischer has just outlined the aim of a fully integrated Europe, where the nation states would be reduced to the status of large regions and all essential decisions taken by majority. We would regard that integrated Europe as a fundamental mistake, because by giving less importance to the nation states, the soul of Europe would be destroyed. My group will propose a more democratic alternative. For the time being, the German Presidency"s top priority is to establish a new financial framework for the Union by 25 March, which will set the conditions for enlargement, but also encapsulate our vision of Europe for the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as revenue is concerned, we think the idea of contributions from the states in proportion to GNP is the only simple, transparent and rational solution. Above all, it is the only solution that clearly demonstrates the nature of the Union – an association of states receiving annual contributions from its members – and it is also the only one that will allow the states to control expenditure properly. If we were to accept other forms of contributions that are less well controlled, for example, European taxes, we would be ignoring the possibility of future financial shifts.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as expenditure is concerned, we agree with the idea of a global ceiling on expenditure at current levels, which would lead to a reduction in real terms over time. Today, some European funds are useless, some are wasted and some are embezzled. To save what is left, we need more rigorous and honest management, and that can never be obtained unless we start by putting a ceiling on expenditure. In particular, our group has always expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the Structural Funds at their current levels and severe reductions should start there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the coming years, Europe"s finances will be characterised by a major inconsistency. The single currency will eliminate the automatic market‐based adjustments between the national economies and they will eventually have to be replaced by financial redistributions centralised in Brussels. So an adjustment mechanism that costs little in terms of taxes is going to be replaced by another that will cost a great deal in terms of taxes. It is time for the governments to be honest and tell their citizens that this decision is going to lead to a snowballing of the Community budget.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martinez </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Santer, Mr President‐in‐Office, under your presidency everything is now clear: we have a single currency, which Germany wanted, a central bank in Frankfurt, with senior executives straight from the Bundesbank, a foreign policy in the Balkans inspired by Germany, and an opening‐up towards the East, which will benefit Germany in terms of geopolitics. So it was quite natural for law to converge with fact and for Germany to preside over Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">Your presidency will therefore deal with employment, the CAP, and of course what interests Germany, namely, the financing of the European Union. This financing is, in fact, causing a problem. It is well‐known that there are winners in Europe, the cohesion countries, which receive up to EUR 300, even EUR 600, per head of population per year. Then there are the losers: the Netherlands and your country, Germany. And as a Frenchman, I understand exactly how you feel, because we have been losing up to EUR 4 billion a year, the equivalent of investing in a high‐speed train link, like the Paris‐Bordeaux train, in a single year. Of course, I know Europe must be based on solidarity. In fact, Mr Cohn‐Bendit even shows solidarity with terrorists, being one himself.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the current inequalities are going to get worse and become very obvious. How do you explain to the 6 million unemployed French people that they must make sacrifices for the Irish whose unemployment rate is proportionately lower? How do you explain that to the women and men who are victims of the budgetary rationing pact? How do you explain to the poor that they must become even poorer in the name of solidarity, especially when this poverty and solidarity are going to increase with the cost of enlargement towards the East?</p>
<p class="contents">I know that a compromise has to be found. You are going to apply yourselves to that, by renationalising the CAP, by restricting expenditure, etcetera. Perhaps your presidency could shed more light on this, given that Goethe"s last words were ‘more light, more light". Telling the truth would shed more light. We will not keep the ceiling of 1.27 % of GNP. And Mr Santer told the truth with great sincerity: you are thinking about a Community corporation tax, a Community income tax, and – in the context of your fiscal folly – why not a green tax?</p>
<p class="contents">That is the truth. Europe has a cost and that cost will mean higher taxes.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Anastassopoulos </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL) </span> Mr President, on the eve of the 21st century, a new German Presidency is trying to address the problems inherited from the past, the concerns felt today and the challenges of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, in a world that is changing at the speed of light and in which interdependence is paramount, one factor remains constant. Europe's citizens are worried about peace, employment, about their security, and about a European Union which they still feel is somewhat remote. The success of the euro is not enough to allay those concerns. Political union must really become our lodestar, but perhaps what we need is a federal political euro if we are ever to get there.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the German Presidency's programme propose to deal with these problems? Today, we heard a really fine speech, fine slogans and a lot said about the four key points and about the initiatives to be undertaken. But how much substance? We are not motivated by prejudice, Mr President‐in‐Office, but we do feel the need to point out that major problems call for major policies and for the wherewithal to put them into effect. They cannot be solved by words alone.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems a good idea in theory to make a pact on employment, but will that be enough to produce any significant reduction in unemployment, particularly among young people and women, which – though unemployment figures have recently fallen slightly – is still a scourge in Europe? We have serious doubts about that. Would that we were proved wrong. But we should not want the European Union also to become the scapegoat for that massive problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union could really get closer to its citizens if, instead of announcing initiatives and manifestos – I am not referring her to its idea for a Charter of Rights which deserves applause – the German Presidency were to establish an honest and sincere dialogue with everyone, without contradictions and without hypocrisy. But we cannot in the same breath speak about opening up Europe and on the other hand adopt as our prime aim the restriction of already meagre resources, expenditure and contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Is that the great problem about whose solution the German and other governments are agonising? But, we are told, Germany provides 60 % of the contributions. We do not question that. It is just that neither Germany nor the Commission has ever explained to us what the benefits are in exchange for those payments. They could be calculated in macro‐economic terms so that we could all see the complete picture, and then we would be able in good faith to examine the problem of distributing the burden fairly. Of course, renationalising the Common Agricultural Policy is no solution. That would not be a reform but a step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to enlargement towards the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus, which was recently called upon to provide painful proof of its intention to facilitate that course. How is it possible on the one hand to declare a lively interest in making very rapid progress towards enlargement and on the other hand to restrict the resources that would facilitate it? The programme we heard today contains many other contradictions too, and there are elements in it which have created much confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, despite our political disagreements, we are ready to cooperate with the German Presidency to further the common cause of Europe, to prepare the institutional reforms demanded by the times, and to begin to develop a common foreign and defence policy. As we draw closer to the European elections in June, does the German Presidency not think it ought to accept Parliament's proposals for a common electoral system? We heard nothing about that in Mr Fischer's speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, we sincerely wish you success in your task. But we must also give due warning: after your initial vagueness, conflicting statements and contradictions, many people in Europe started to miss Chancellor Kohl. Take care with your policies, so that by the end of your presidency there will not be far more people who miss Helmut Kohl.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischer, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was asked to speak again, although not at this point to respond directly – which, as a member of parliament myself, I am itching to do – to many of the statements I have heard here. I will do that at the end of the debate. I was asked as the representative of the presidency to say something about Kosovo, because it is a topical issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me to start with the current situation. We are watching developments with very, very great concern. In fact, the interim political settlement in Kosovo should not only have been found long ago, it should have already been implemented, as had been agreed between Richard Holbrooke and the Belgrade government. That agreement is of central, overwhelming significance to the future development of Kosovo, for without that interim agreement it will prove extremely difficult to move away from a process of non‐peace and eventually achieve a lasting process of peaceful agreement and peace itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably the military confrontation is becoming more acute, with abductions, attacks and killings. I hope that after yesterday"s serious degeneration of the situation, a solution will be found today, a solution that can be reached only through negotiation. Working together with our partners, Germany is fully committed to that. We are taking part both in the civil monitoring of the conflict under the OSCE and in the military unarmed airspace surveillance, which is a component not only of the general monitoring mission but also of the agreement between Mr Holbrooke and the Belgrade government and of the extraction force. The role of the extraction force is not to conduct the process of conflict monitoring in the framework of the OSCE; it is a genuine emergency force which will act in the event that the unarmed civilian OSCE personnel face a real emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to achieve an agreement that allows for peaceful development. The purpose of the NATO threat was to avert a humanitarian disaster among the Albanian civilian population in Kosovo. That proved successful, but now we have to make political headway, which is an infinitely difficult task. For instance, the Albanian side finds it is difficult to form a joint negotiating delegation, which is one important aspect. That is infinitely difficult, given also all the strategic differences between all the parties involved. The Albanian side wants independence, the alliance of western states does not want it, for carefully considered reasons. Nor does Belgrade want this independence, but the kind of approach it is taking, the serious violations of the human rights and minority rights of the majority in Kosovo, are unacceptable. There are also conflicting approaches within the western community of states, which further complicates the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet, the only alternatives I can see to a strategy of stabilisation – a strategy that must be based on the fulfilment of the agreement Mr Holbrooke reached with Belgrade – are quite terrible. That is why we shall now take a firmer approach within the Contact Group, after William Hill unfortunately failed in his shuttle diplomacy to bring about the three‐year interim political settlement before Christmas, as had in fact been provided in the agreement. Let me add in parenthesis what the important aspect of this interim political settlement is: we need a civil, legitimate authority in Kosovo. Without a civil, legitimate authority, that is to say a regional parliament, with an executive and a legislature, a police force, a judiciary, without this substantial, political, democratically legitimated authority in the province of Kosovo, there is simply no chance of establishing a sustainable peace process. That is why it is so paramount to achieve and implement the political agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to take this debate as an opportunity to appeal to all parties concerned, including the Albanians, not to shut themselves off from this process and above all to adhere strictly to the rules of non‐violence. Violence will not resolve the problems in Kosovo but would instead cause terrible harm. We are now endeavouring to make progress through the Contact Group. That is anything but easy. Following the kidnapping of the Serbian soldiers we must prevent a military confrontation and I very much hope we will be able to prevent it by reaching an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">By and large however, and I will conclude on that note, political agreement plays a central, a crucial role. We must not forget one thing, and I want to say this quite plainly here in the European Parliament: Kosovo is part of Europe. The problems there are our problems and the political solution of this conflict – which has considerably wider implications than the conflict in Kosovo alone – will do more to decide the development of a European foreign policy, a security and foreign policy identity, than any number of resolutions, of programmatic declarations and speeches. That is why we as the presidency, but also as a member of the Contact Group, will do all in our power to ensure that this process advances. But let me emphasise again: it will be anything but easy!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hänsch </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in the past there have been many differences and even quarrels between the Council and Parliament on the subject of Kosovo. The same will be true in future! But you know and can rely on the fact that the European Parliament is on your side on the Kosovo question and in seeking ways to resolve the conflict, as it must be resolved!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">To come back to Agenda 2000. First of all I am glad that rather than telling us about the book‐keeping for the next six months you have put the decisions facing the German Presidency of the Council in the longer‐term perspective of the development of the European Union. Agenda 2000 is an overall concept and you called for the timetable to be met. My group, as also, I am convinced, the majority in the European Parliament, wants the timetable for adopting Agenda 2000 to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">We have prepared for this and are in a position to take the necessary decisions in April‐May. But that also means that the Council must be prepared to discuss them, for a large part of the proposals you put forward at the March summit will also have to be endorsed by the European Parliament. So it is advisable for the Council to discuss them with the European Parliament beforehand rather than afterwards, since that could lead to confrontations.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is this. We regard the Agenda as a global package and I believe that the Commission"s proposals represent a good compromise that could be amended and perhaps even improved in some areas. But the global package as such must stand. That will have to be the basis on which Parliament and the Member States must reach agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, let me say a few words in regard to the discussions in our Member States and to the internal political debate in our own country. Here I am also addressing those Members who keep calling on Germany to show solidarity. You cannot call for a reform of agricultural policy while at the same time declaring that in internal political terms everything will remain as it is. That is simply not on!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">You cannot propose to reform the Structural Funds, to concentrate on combating unemployment and at the same time demand that all those who used to profit from the Structural Funds, i.e. 51 % of the population, should continue to profit! You cannot say we must keep to the financial framework while at the same time calling for more EU expenditure on eastern enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot try to rally the Union partners to eastern enlargement and at the same time call not just for fair contributions but for a massive cut in net contributions to the European Union. Much can be achieved, and much will still have to be achieved in the coming negotiations up to March. But there is one thing that Brussels cannot do, and that is to suspend the Community"s basic accounting methods. Not even someone familiar with dealing with fundamentalists could manage that. We are prepared to adopt the global package in April‐May. And, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, that means we are the only parliament that is taking the risk of adopting all the cruel decisions associated with Agenda 2000 before an election. We would like to be given some credit for showing such courage! So do give us a little help here.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the Agenda 2000 reforms, with a view also to the financial perspectives, if the European Union is to be able to enlarge to the east. That is not the only reason for the reform, let us be clear about that! The European Union would need to be reformed in any case; but we also need this reform so as to make the Union capable of enlargement, which will be the great historical task following the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 is only a part of the reform package. I am very glad that you also referred to the institutional reforms that will be needed in addition to Agenda 2000 in order to make the Union capable of enlargement and that you sketched out the broad lines of a general concept. Let me also say a few words on this institutional reform.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a mistake to believe that less Europe means a Europe closer to the people. On the contrary! A Union that is in a position to do the things the citizens expect of it is closer to the people than all the declarations by conferences of foreign ministers and all the declarations on subsidiarity in our Member States. The more consolidated the Union is, the more flexible its decisions and its institutions can be.</p>
<p class="contents">The stronger the Union institutions are, the more firmly they must be anchored in democracy. I am saying that also against the backdrop of the debate we will be holding this week. The more credible the institutions are, the greater their ability also to act at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the European idea mean? Yes, it is true that over the past 40 years we have built up Europe to prevent a return to the past. That was right, it was a good thing and it also remains a constant task. Against the background of a history spanning a thousand years of European wars, 50 years of peace in most of Europe is a very short time and there is no guarantee that it will continue if we do not make fresh efforts every day to seek agreement, to seek common institutions and common decisions in the European Union. That is a difficult process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see not only members of parliament and the European Parliament but also the Member State governments uphold the European policy they decide in Brussels during the working week – not just on Sundays, but on weekdays too. In our Member States, the same ministers – I am not referring to you personally, Mr Fischer, but this does need to be said in this kind of debate – who adopt a whole range of regulations and directives in Brussels from Monday to Friday, announce the following Saturday or Sunday that once again Brussels has decided some sort of nonsense. This has to stop!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">You cannot go on like that! You are leading the people, the citizens of Europe astray. Do not misunderstand me: this applies to the governments of all the Member States and, incidentally, of every party‐political persuasion.</p>
<p class="contents">So what do we mean by saying that we know that we must unite Europe not so much against a return to the past but far more to master the tasks of the future? It is not just a question of the success of the euro but also of mastering the consequences, the burdens, the risks facing the entire European Union as a result of the fact that we now have a common currency. That involves a fundamental idea; specifically it involves a charter of fundamental rights. I would like to see the European Parliament play a very decisive role in future in formulating these fundamental rights. That would be a real task for the newly elected Parliament!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly the European idea – it exists, all we have to do is formulate and clarify it – means that Europe represents a balance, one that is constantly under threat and must constantly be renewed, between economic performance, which we need, and social justice, which is the foundation of economic performance and not just a social addendum. Europe represents a balance that is constantly under threat and needs constant renewal between freedom for the individual, his search for truth and justice and his responsibility towards the whole, towards the community. That is the meaning of the term European, those are the foundations on which we build and on which we can construct a European Union that is capable of external action, that makes it clear that Europe plays a role in the world, not just for the sake of playing a role but in order to disseminate our principles, our great tradition of human rights and social rights in the world and to help establish them. It is a Europe that is able to win not just the minds but also the hearts of the people. Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, play your part in ensuring that we do so and achieve our aim!</p>

I do earnestly hope that we shall be able to respond appropriately to the issue raised by the motion of censure. I speak in all sincerity, as it is in no‐one"s interest to complicate matters further, and certainly not, I imagine, in the interests of the current presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I should begin by saying that I have no difficulty in agreeing with the priorities Mr Fischer set out this morning, namely, creating more jobs in a Europe which is a major competitor on the world market. The process of coordinating employment policies that began in Luxembourg must be carried through. A proactive policy for employment creation at European level should be launched, and you yourself referred to a European employment pact.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to strengthening the Union"s external relations, we unreservedly support the call for political union that you made this morning. We also support the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond Europe, I should like to stress the importance of developing cooperation with Mediterranean countries and with Latin America. Important meetings on this issue are scheduled for the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Agenda 2000, we share your determination to conclude negotiations during the first half of this year, and trust this will prove possible. Nevertheless, certain guidelines must be borne in mind to ensure success. First, all Member States must make a financial contribution to enlargement and to the costs involved. Second, the Union must pursue its efforts to provide itself with the necessary resources to develop its common policies. This means meeting the financial demands agreed in connection with cohesion. Third, a determined effort must be made to put in place a system of contributions that is more in line with the ability of Member States to pay. Fourth, arbitrary cuts in expenditure cannot be tolerated. Fifth, it should be borne in mind that there are limits to the negotiations on Agenda 2000, namely the provisions of the Treaty. Aim at genuine convergence, Mr Fischer, as it represents a good investment for Europe. I appreciate the spirit of your well‐balanced speech and wish you wise judgement and every success.</p>

The refugees who have sought shelter in the mountains have in many cases had their homes burned down and their wells poisoned. There is also reason to believe that the fighting in Kosovo will intensify with the approach of spring. Let us not forget the causes of the present situation: 90 % of the inhabitants of Kosovo have had to endure 20 years of Serb domination.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe remained silent while the Kosovans protested peacefully. Now we are asking them to agree to a peace settlement based on continued Serb rule. The Liberal Group is of the opinion that future peace talks should be unconditional. We should like to see an agreement reached on a truce with all possible speed, but we would not wish to dictate what a final settlement of the conflict should entail for the future of Kosovo and its people.</p>

<p class="contents">The Europe of yesteryear, of nationalism, division and anachronism has no geographical basis, it is not located just in certain countries, it is in the mind and in political acts all over Europe and the European Union, and that is where we must fight it by political means. The Europe of the future, of integration, as you very rightly said, must be open and must offer prospects for all its citizens and for all Europe's states and nations.</p>
<p class="contents">And when we speak of Kosovo and the Balkans more generally, let me say that this Europe of the future we are talking about offers no prospect, no proposal, no position to the states and nations of that area for the future. The enlargement policy excludes that part of Europe, even in the long term. It is precisely that omission which belongs to the Europe of the past, and I ask you to give it further consideration.</p>

Whether the Group of the European People"s Party is currently represented by two or three people or whether there are ten of us present here when the public sees pictures of this important debate – whatever excuses we make – there will be criticism of the European Parliament. We are always good at criticising the Commission and others, but we should also question our own behaviour in plenary. Let me just say that at the outset. For the rest Mr Poettering, who says such clever things, could take the names Schmidhuber and Bangemann as examples of other Commission appointments. I find it incredible that at a time like this, when there is so much discussion about the future of Europe, the Group of the European People"s Party and other groups are hardly present. But that is their problem, not mine!</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to offer the President‐in‐Office of the Council three small suggestions to help make the German Presidency as successful as he would wish. First, the debate on finalities is an important one and should also give rise to a social debate. But the European Union exists today and cannot just wait for the debate on finalities. That is why we need a decision in Cologne, a resolution, so that when we have another intergovernmental conference, in 2001, an EU charter of fundamental rights is adopted. There cannot be a new intergovernmental conference without a new charter of fundamental rights, otherwise Europe cannot and will not be seen to be more open.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is dangerous for the German Presidency – for whatever reasons – to say not one word about Mediterranean policy. For there are fears in Europe, however unjustified they may be, that Europe and Germany are only looking to the east now and forgetting the issue of relations with the south. So I think it is important that in our relations with the south, with the Mediterranean, we also focus discussion on the human rights question with partners such as Algeria. It is not just a question of combating terrorism but also of human rights, of how a state combats terrorism. That is the future of democracy and it should also be discussed with our Mediterranean partners and particularly with Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the famous sixty‐four thousand dollar question of net contributors and net contributions. One cannot simply assign more tasks to a political institution, of whatever kind, while at the same time constantly reducing its scope for action by financial cutbacks. After all, we have seen what that leads to over the last few days in regard to the Commission. The Commission said it did not have enough personnel to carry out its tasks. Then we find the kind of problems arise that we have seen. So we must give careful thought to this. What reforms are needed in agriculture? What problems from the past need dealing with? How much more should the United Kingdom pay? More equality, more equal rights. Yes, but we also have to ask how much more the Union as a whole has to pay in order to carry out its tasks.</p>

<p class="contents">In the international community today, there are over 100 countries which have <span class="italic">de facto</span> abolished the death penalty. That is a majority. So the conditions are there for the General Assembly of the United Nations to approve a universal moratorium on capital punishment this year. If possible, I would like the German Presidency to tell us if it intends to take any measures in this respect in the course of the next few weeks to prevent a flop like last year and to ensure that we do not miss this opportunity to create conditions that favour the adoption of a universal moratorium on capital punishment by the United Nations General Assembly in the year 2000.</p>

I would like to point out to you that any form of politics and any political action will fail and be meaningless from the outset if the question of principle, namely how to resolve the environmental issue, is not addressed. We are nearing the end of the 20th century and standing on the threshold of the 21st century. Consider for a moment: we cannot afford to repeat the 20th century in terms either of wasting resources or of destroying the environment.</p>

Or at least seemed to put an end to them, because when we look at the results of the Vienna summit we see that, although page after page is devoted to employment – a field of great concern to us all – no concrete decisions were taken and a great many tasks were in fact assigned to the current presidency. I naturally wish them every success in implementing them, and I hope that they are able to recapture the spirit of what was decided in Luxembourg. This means setting specific targets, with the aid of benchmarking, and not just at national level but at European level too. Luxembourg was a start, an important start, but a great deal remains to be done in order to broaden and deepen the process.</p>
<p class="contents">At present I detect a kind of weariness in which a bureaucratic process is being set in train to implement what was decided in Luxembourg, but with little regard for the innovation which was what Luxembourg was principally all about. Of the many tasks which fall to this presidency I can of course touch on no more than a couple. I think it is very important for the German Presidency to achieve effective coordination between economic and social policy. When they took office in their own country they expressed what I consider to be many very refreshing views on this subject. These were somewhat tempered as the presidency grew closer, but I hope that their policy is not solely for domestic consumption but also for European consumption. I am convinced that coordination of economic and social policy solely at national level has no meaning if you do not now also succeed in getting this underway at European level. In other words, I hope that your attempts at <span class="italic">Bündnis für Arbeit</span> – work or employment pacts<span class="italic"> – </span> can also be pursued very energetically, and hopefully successfully, throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Although employment policy is a subject of deep concern to me, I am gradually getting the feeling that people believe social policy as a whole is covered by employment and by labour market policy. But there is more to social policy than this. Our call has always been not for a pact for employment, but a pact for employment, sustainability and solidarity. This seems a little like searching for the third way, as if solidarity is taboo, but I would be very pleased if the German Government succeeded in putting solidarity firmly on the agenda. Europe"s internal cohesion is one of the most important tasks with which we are faced. In all the prattle about financial obligations, too little attention has also been paid, to my mind at least, to the subject of cohesion as a Union objective. I believe this presidency has made an excellent contribution in this respect. I am pleased that I am to be followed by Mr Brok and I hope that he points out in his speech that the limited presence of his group is not a problem in the way Mr Cohn‐Bendit sees it, but a problem for Parliament as a whole. It is a pity that a presidency is not viewed as representing Parliament as a whole rather than only one group.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We find ourselves at present in a special situation. Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, I hope you will appreciate that the situation looks a little confused.</p>
<p class="contents">The opposition in Germany, the CDU/CSU, will urge Germany to show continuity in its European policy here in Parliament too. I believe the statement you made today reflected that spirit of German continuity in its European policy and forms a basis for constructive cooperation on a number of issues in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we would also like to know whether you are the President of the Council for foreign affairs and the Chancellor is the Wilhelminian President of the Council for home affairs. The differences that sometimes arise must, of course, be resolved. Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, you will find it more difficult to achieve the necessary compromises at European level if the mood within Germany is different. I hope you will manage to sort all this out!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank you most particularly for your words on institutional reform. The Cologne summit must act as a mandate for more majority decisions and more co‐decisions, as also for the charter of fundamental rights. I believe that these matters must be carefully defined, with the participation of the European Parliament, so that in the next two years we can take the necessary steps to make the European Union capable of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">During your presidency of the Council you will have to implement a range of policies, such as the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I would ask you, when you appoint the High Representatives and set up the planning and analysis unit, to perhaps listen more closely to national parliaments and to the European Parliament than to your diplomats, so that this becomes an added value for Europe rather than a board of political directors.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a final remark. Everyone agrees that employment policy is an important issue. That is why the former German Government approved and participated in the coordination of European employment policy in Amsterdam and in Luxembourg. But we cannot go any further than coordination, than setting out objectives and benchmarking, because we do not have the instruments to do so. This employment pact should not be used to give the impression that we can pursue a common wage scale policy from Finland to Portugal or embark on financing a labour market policy. You spoke of labour market policy in your address. We sometimes get the impression that a huge employment‐policy show is to be put on shortly before the European elections in preparation for then producing an alibi for national elections, because Europe is held responsible for the failure of national employment policies. Europe is too important to be wrongly blamed.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischer, I have listened to you carefully and given the quality and scale of the debate we are holding here today it would be wrong of me to start off by advising you what limit values you should change and which individual environmental legislative acts urgently need renewing, even if I would like to do so and indeed could do so in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me nevertheless make a few comments that are very relevant to the dimension of which you spoke. When you talk about an enlarging Europe, an enlarging European Union and a more integrated Europe, which is something we all want, then a few things must be quite clear. It must be clear that there have to be and there are cross‐sectional policy areas, which must also be regarded as such and treated differently.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wim van Velzen spoke of social policy. That is certainly one example. In this Parliament I speak for my group for environmental policy, consumer protection and health policy. If we are serious about European integration we must also be serious about integrating these cross‐sectional policies in other policy areas. That means that environmental policy must become an integral part of transport policy, of energy policy and of economic policy – indeed it is also a motive force of employment policy. We keep paying lip service to this – this German Government does the same. However, I hope that it will become apparent after these six months that the earlier Cardiff summit and the forthcoming Cologne summit have produced more in this respect, that we actually see integral legislation that commits the Commission to integrating environmental policy in other areas too, including structural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of transparency, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, and I cheekily interrupted, for which I apologise. I know that the general public often do not know how legislation is made in the European Union. In fact they are not quite sure how it is made in their own Member States either. I do not approve of that, which is why I welcome your call for transparency. But transparency also means that it must be clear what the Member States do with the EU legislation once they have approved it.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is the case, as was quite usual in Germany – and as can easily be proven – that Germany may well approve legislation, especially in the environmental area, but does not then transpose it into national law or does not check observance of the provisions, then that too is an offence against transparency and I would ask you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, to do something about that too. If we want to do something for people all over Europe – and that includes people in the applicant countries – then we must take make sure they can live in an environment worth living in.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked a lot about foreign policy today and about very major issues. That always makes me feel very small and humble and I try not to say much; but at the end of the day the issue is always the people who live in this world, this Europe. These people breathe, these people have to eat and drink and exist in the environment. If we do not manage to maintain an environment worth living in then we can no longer talk about foreign policy either. That is why I urge you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, when you go home and when you go to Bonn, to remember that environmental policy must be a key component of German policy and also a key component of European integration.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fontaine </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, ladies and gentlemen, the German Presidency has opened under the best auspices. In Europe and indeed around the world, opinion is virtually unanimous that the launch of the euro has been a success that will mark a truly historic stage in the long course of the construction of Europe. Germany had spared no efforts and made every sacrifice to achieve this, and you will understand, Mr President, if I extend this tribute to Chancellor Kohl who held this course with such courage and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I want to express my warmest wishes for the success of the German Presidency. It is a heavy responsibility because this presidency will be marked by strategic decisions that will determine the future shape of Europe. It is a Europe that we naturally want to extend to those countries of Central and Eastern Europe seeking to join us, but it is a Europe that must now affirm its political dimension and therefore overhaul its institutions so that it can respond better to the expectations of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, after listening to you, my feeling is that the priorities of your presidency broadly meet these objectives. But I would like to put some ideas to you on two areas of the work.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as regards Agenda 2000, we applaud your determination to try to complete this, if possible, at the summit on 24 and 25 March. That is a very pressing timetable if we want the European Parliament to be able to fully play its part. The timing will be very tight anyway, bearing in mind that we have elections in June.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the idea that the future financial framework of the European Union, the reform of the structural policy and the reform of the common agricultural policy are inseparable parts of an overall package. To reach the lasting solutions you want, there must be respect for everyone"s sensitivities. You know and we know that some of the Member States are more concerned, and rightly so, about the problem of the financial contribution. Others, in fact, who provided assurances for all these years, are more concerned about the cohesion of our Community. And finally, others are more concerned about the common policies that formed the initial basis of our Union. I am sure you know what I mean, Mr President. I personally want to talk about the agricultural policy and tell you simply how I feel.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of measures that would effectively lead to a renationalisation, even a partial one, of the common agricultural policy would be a political mistake that would ruin the European Union in the minds of many of our fellow citizens. My dear Klaus Hänsch, of course no‐one has ever said that nothing should change. But it seems to me that the stakes are higher than anyone"s national interest because rural development is truly essential to the very balance of our European area. Mr President, please be kind enough to give this some thought.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the institutions. If we want a Europe that is naturally open but that is also strong and united, we need institutions that allow it to act; otherwise, we risk an institutional collapse, as you have said. You were very clear about the sensitive points we need to stress. You stated that the Cologne Summit will launch a new intergovernmental conference, but I have a question. Do you not feel that the limits of the intergovernmental conference system have been demonstrated? Mr President, I would be pleased if you could tell us if you think that there might be a more creative means of achieving the desired result.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I send my most sincere wishes for your presidency.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rehder </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let me just call out after Mr Brok, who is already fleeing to the group meeting room, that the SPD also differs from the PPE and its German members in that our party does not have a short memory. That is why I am surprised that after 16 years in government in Germany they now seem to be prophesying that the current German Government will have to answer for the failure of employment policy. That really is absurd, and basically everyone in Europe understands that.</p>
<p class="contents">What a number of people in Europe do not understand is rural development policy, agricultural policy. Anyone who speaks of a reform of agricultural policy in connection with the need to change the shape of the European Union must realise two things: firstly, this reform is overdue and necessary in any case. It has not been put on the agenda because of the imminent advent of the enlargement eastward that we hope to see. Secondly, they must realise that this is not just a question of agricultural prices, export refunds and compensatory payments, important as they are. Basically it is a question of the future of our rural areas, which account for 80 % of the European Union, and above all of how we will manage to protect jobs, to create new jobs and to maintain the environment in Europe both within the agricultural sector as such but also, independently of that, in the rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">European public opinion does not dispute these aims. What has been increasingly and rightly disputed are the ways and means by which the European Union"s financial resources are used for the rural areas. A short while ago the President of the European Court of Auditors pointed out that the situation is still not tolerable, with 80 % of the European tax‐payers" contributions intended for the rural areas, for agriculture, going to only 20 %, i.e. to the most prosperous people. No man or woman in Europe can understand that, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">So it must be one of the priority aims of Agenda 2000 to make it clear that aid policy must largely be social policy in the agricultural sector too. It is unacceptable to see a farmer in a rural area who earns millions, who has turned his well‐situated farm into virtually a one‐man business thanks to massive rationalisation, who has the best contacts with the world market and obtains the best prices on it, still being just as eligible for aid as a farmer in a disadvantaged area, who can often only survive by overworking.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats are not jealous of the European global player"s economic success. But we do demand that the farmer in a disadvantaged region who can never become a global player, but who protects the rural area through his invaluable environmental services, that this farmer should also be given decent support – a more decent level of support than we have seen in the past – for the services he has performed. That would close the circle.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, you rightly said at the start that we must not show solidarity only with the weakest Member States but must also and always show solidarity with the weakest members of society, and naturally that includes those working in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bianco </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President‐in‐Office, you have made some important points and have certainly set out some ambitious aims: a new intergovernmental conference, a new European constitution, an autonomous and independent common foreign defence policy, strengthening of the WEU, majority decisions in the Council and increased powers for Parliament. These are without doubt significant statements, Mr President, but they are intentions and, as the old saying has it: ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions'.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem lies elsewhere, namely in grasping how the coherent aims which you have announced tie in with the specific policies which the German Government seems determined to introduce. Our former President, Mr Hänsch, raised this same question in an interview with <span class="italic">Die Zeit</span> . The first signs are not promising: some of Chancellor Schröder's pronouncements, the coolness of one of your ministers towards the euro, the call for a cut in your country's contributions, and the threat to reduce resources for the southern Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">You yourself have certainly allayed some of these doubts – you deserve credit for that – but our doubts are still justified! I would remind you that this Europe of ours was largely built by leaders who came from a certain background, a Christian Democrat one. Will the Socialist‐led governments manage to complete the edifice? We hope so. That is your goal: we only hope that you will carry others along with you.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of unemployment, among others, can only be tackled in a European context. But how should it be tackled? Just now I heard a Socialist colleague speak of putting pressure on the Central Bank and slackening the rigour of our healthy finances, calling for what smacks of modern‐day dirigisme. Is this the right approach? I think not. I must confess, Mr President‐in‐Office, that – as Mr Cohn‐Bendit said – I am astonished by your silence on the Mediterranean. I thank you, incidentally, for what you said concerning Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">And now, if I may, I would make one final recommendation. Given that our President speaks Greek, I shall take the liberty of saying this in Latin and translating it with a German proverb: "<span class="italic">laus nova nisi oritur etiam virtus amittitur</span> ". The German proverb states: ‘<span class="italic">Wer nicht vorwärts geht, der kommt zurück</span> '. I believe that Europe too could fall backwards unless it moves forwards.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Colom i Naval </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President‐in‐Office, your speech was undoubtedly political, and in it you placed great emphasis on budgetary matters. Allow me, therefore, to begin with a reminder. The Union"s major financial agreements have been achieved by the smaller countries. The current financial perspective was not approved in Edinburgh, as some believe, but a year later in Brussels, under the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Government – the new German Government – faces the challenge of bucking this trend and breaking with tradition. As rapporteur for Agenda 2000, I wish you good fortune and plenty of luck. Let us hope for success.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened most carefully to the speech, because in your document on priorities you devote 12 lines to the Union"s financial and budgetary policy while the remainder deals with countless more policies, although there is a conspicuous absence of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Vienna European Council it was agreed that Agenda 2000 should be approached in a spirit of solidarity and budgetary rigour should be guaranteed. I made a careful note of your reference to an equitable solution that is not to the detriment of the weaker partners, and you also asked for Parliament"s cooperation. In my opinion, the wrong question is being asked. You can certainly rely on Parliament"s cooperation. The question should instead be whether or not we can rely on the Council"s cooperation. On 8 December, the Council had to issue a statement confirming that it intended to abide by the agreements it had reached with the Commission and the European Parliament that same morning, and not render them meaningless. It is the Council that creates difficulties. Rigour is not synonymous with saving. What is does mean is strict and efficient management. The meaning of the terms must be quite clear. Moreover, without Parliament, no financial perspectives are in fact possible. I should therefore like to draw your attention briefly to a number of issues Parliament considers to be particularly important, but which the Council does not seem to appreciate at times.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament took a stand against national contributions and the principle of fair return in its resolution of 4 December 1997. You have quite rightly stated that the euro represents a step forward in the development of a new kind of sovereignty in Europe. The Council should have the courage to take a further step forward in the spirit of this new European sovereignty and put forward a proposal for truly European own resources. It should be recognised that the concept of national contributions is not really European. Rather, it amounts to a backward step in the construction of a political Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has already come out in favour of the Cohesion Fund, as did the European Commission when it considered the matter. However, Parliament is against cofinancing of the CAP. A greater degree of flexibility is called for. Parliament has voiced its doubts concerning the financial consequences of the reforms proposed in Agenda 2000. The Court of Auditors" opinion on Agenda 2000 from December, No 10/98, is now available and is even more sceptical. Clauses and instruments to ensure flexibility will be required. The financial perspectives are at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, enlargement is a major issue. Those of us who were previously excluded from the construction of Europe because our country was under a dictatorship are ardent supporters of enlargement towards the East. You referred to the consequences of failing to carry out enlargement, and I agree with you on that point. However, do you really believe that we can prepare for enlargement with the meagre appropriations available in the financial framework, trimming Europe and the current budgets? An expansion of Europe"s territory cannot be achieved through a reduction in its budget.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pack </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, I would like to start by pointing out once again that nearly the entire PPE Group was present at the time when the President‐in‐Office of the Council spoke and that he received our full applause, as also the applause of the German Christian Democrats, because we too will support him in what he said – provided he also acts on it. That is why the comment made from up there was not fair and when I look at the Socialist benches all I can say is there are four more of them here than of us, which is not such a great feat.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to our debate, I just want to go into one point, the question of Kosovo. After the inglorious outcome of the negotiations between Holbrooke and Milosevic I said that the day is drawing near when the west will reproach the Kosovo Albanians for not finally giving in. What are the facts of the situation in Kosovo now? The Serbian troops who were initially withdrawn have long since returned. The Serbian police in Kosovo are armed to the hilt. Attacks targeted at Albanian villages and civilians are commonplace. The reactions to these Serbian acts of terrorism are the desperate and not always acceptable actions of the KLA, but they are above all a sign of the growing impotence of the Albanians and their cries for help.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is that step in a political direction you referred to a moment ago? Even in October 1998 it became clear that Milosevic did not want a political settlement. He wants to ethnically cleanse Kosovo and change the balance of forces between Albanians and Serbs in favour of the Serbs. Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, my dear Daniel Cohn‐Bendit, he is pursuing that line with great success. There are refugees wherever we look, not just in the forests, not just in Albania, not just in Macedonia. There are refugees from Kosovo in Bosnia too, and they come to Germany and Italy in any case! The OSCE observer mission is a joke and cannot be successful. We should withdraw these observers, otherwise news about the mortal danger these gentlemen are facing will dominate the media, instead of the misery and distress of the Albanians, whose lives have been in danger for nine whole years.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, when you said that the extraction force in Macedonia is there to protect these OSCE observers, I noted that you are not entirely indifferent to the whole business. For surely it must sound like a mockery to the people down there who have been suffering under the Serbian apartheid system for nine years. These troops are not there to protect the Albanian civilians but to protect the few OSCE observers who would basically be better advised to go back where they came from, back home. For there is nothing they can do where they are.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that a few Serbian soldiers have now been taken prisoner by the Albanians. But what has world public opinion been doing for the past nine years? Did it cry out when Albanians were taken prisoner every day, when Albanians were tortured every day? I question the relative manner in which these matters are currently being discussed. In the last few months the Contact Group has made no contact whatsoever. So I do urge you to withdraw the OSCE observers and let an international force that includes Russian troops see to establishing peace in Kosovo, so as finally to give a chance to an interim political solution that can lead to a real solution in the region. Otherwise we will have to go on and on hearing these same daily media reports.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, I too want to speak on the subject of Kosovo. Let me say first of all that I and my group can also congratulate you warmly on your statement. I believe that the subjects you addressed, and especially the foreign policy aspects, were precisely those points and aspects we rightly expect and hope a German Presidency to address.</p>
<p class="contents">You said little in concrete terms about Kosovo. I would like to prompt you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, to perhaps make a few more comments to clarify your position, especially after what Mrs Pack, whom I hold in very high esteem, has just said, because in this case I do not agree with the substance of it. I believe that we must adhere to the position that we can only have a settlement in Kosovo that is a peaceful settlement and that is in the end reached through consensus – however difficult that may be. We will have to be prepared for it to take years – it was a serious mistake to believe it could be achieved in Bosnia in just a few months. We will have to tell the Serbs that their aggression cannot be tolerated but also tell the KLA that their actions, which are indeed also directed against the Albanians and against Mr Rugova, cannot be accepted. We have applauded Mr Rugova here in this Chamber but on the other hand – and this is a contradiction – we verbally support the actions of the KLA. That can neither be tolerated nor accepted and the presidency must make its position clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, you have stated quite unequivocally in many interviews that you do not regard organisations such as the OSCE as merely incidental, as something that can be pushed aside. We are all aware of the weaknesses of the OSCE, but after all what we must do is strengthen this organisation rather than abandon it. So I do not believe the OSCE mission should be withdrawn. I do believe, however, that it needs protecting and that we must do our utmost to strengthen the troops who are in the region, especially in Macedonia, in FYROM, which will be a means of protecting the OSCE. It would be a disaster if the OSCE mission out there fails partly because it is not being given adequate military protection. Kosovo can serve as an example of cooperation between the EU, NATO and the OSCE with a view to finding a peaceful solution.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third point where I also definitely support you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council. You spoke of the dangerous trend away from multilateralism towards unilateralism. I admit, as I once said about Kosovo too, that there can be exceptional situations where a different decision needs to be taken. But I regard the trend in some quarters in America of turning the exception into the rule and the rule into the exception as very dangerous indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word in connection with what you said about Russia. One great task for the German Presidency would be to bring Russia back into partnership with the EU, as a partner willing and able to cooperate, and also to involve it more closely in NATO again, even after the current crisis. We need Russia as a partner, I agree with you there. But we cannot rely on that and expose ourselves to the vicissitudes of Russian decisions in individual cases. However, one important aim of the presidency of the Council must be to have Russia as a partner for a new peaceful order in Europe and beyond.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">von Wogau </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the determining event at the beginning of the German Presidency was certainly the introduction of the European currency. That opened a new era for Europe. Let me begin by saying, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, that I personally would have been pleased if the German finance minister had also been present for that important event on 31 December last year, like the other finance ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the most important task now facing us? It is to formulate a common economic policy for Europe, a common policy to combat unemployment. The fight against unemployment involves many things that have to be done at national level. But fighting unemployment also means securing future growth. Here we find some concern being voiced. The German Institute for Economics has forecast that growth could possibly fall to 1.4 % this year. I do not think that is inconceivable. But we do have to discuss the reasons why this is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the world economic crisis is held responsible, the events in Asia, in America and elsewhere. But I am convinced that these slowdowns in growth are partly homemade; one of the great tasks for the new German Government is to make the real situation clear to our enterprises. For I have found from talks with many business people that when they are asked: ‘why do you not invest, when interest rates are so low and the framework conditions so favourable?" they increasingly often reply: ‘so long as the framework conditions are not clear, so long as we keep reading different things in the papers every week, we will not invest." That is one of the main tasks for your government to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me address another important point, where we need some kind of legislation in the next six months. The introduction of the euro is more or less a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> . But there remains a question that has not really been resolved, in relation to the year 2002. Will that be the appointed date for the changeover or will the two currencies continue to exist side by side? After many talks with retailers, with workers, with local authorities, I increasingly tend to think that to have a period during which the national currency is used side by side with the European currency would involve unnecessary costs, which those concerned cannot be expected to bear. That is why we should jointly – meaning the Commission, the presidency of the Council and the European Parliament – take steps during these six months to ensure that 1 January 2002 is the appointed day for the introduction of euro notes and coins.</p>

You had many good and strong things to say about your visions – an integrated Europe versus the Europe of the past, human rights, institutional reforms, the need for majority decisions to become the rule in the Council, a strong Parliament. But why – and there are two whys given the present situation – why did you say nothing about reforming the Commission, why did you say absolutely nothing on the most important question of comitology? Nor, for that matter, did you say very much about the operational aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of a package deal in March on Agenda 2000, of lower contributions, especially by net contributors, of reducing agricultural expenditure. In my view your statement today gave the same increasingly ambivalent impression as your statements and those of other members of your government in recent months. I can only hope that the same does not apply to another subject you addressed again today, namely enlargement. Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, you said there can be no alternative to enlargement. In the past few months Mr Schröder has sent out very different signals I hope that what you have announced on behalf of the presidency as a whole will be the official programme and will be followed consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">The preceding presidency, the Austrian Presidency, sent out and followed very specific signals in regard to enlargement. I hope that your presidency will also take very concrete political steps in this regard, for that is the only way we can achieve the objective we are all pursuing, namely to make the 21st century the age of integration and not the age of the past!</p>

Obviously this cannot mean paying out billions on aid programmes. That is not the way to combat structural unemployment. The German Chancellor chose his words well when he wrote recently in a trade journal that the most important thing was to coordinate employment policies in the European Union. I would say to coordinate them better, for we do not have to recreate the world all over again.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the last German Presidency in 1994 it was agreed to coordinate national measures. At the Luxembourg special summit led by Jean‐Claude Juncker the Essen procedure was improved by the establishment of guidelines and national action plans, which, my dear Wim van Velzen, must indeed become more verifiable!</p>
<p class="contents">In 1994 we achieved another success with the directive on European works councils. This concerned the information and consultation of workers in European companies, which the then presidency declared a priority, and the much disputed question of economic co‐determination. Parliament recommended adopting the recipe for success of the European works councils as the procedural principle for European companies: flexibility, negotiations between the social partners on co‐determination rights and, if that failed, European minimum standards. By following this procedure, the Austrian compromise proposal took us very close to achieving that objective. Now we finally need political agreement within the Council. I wish Mr Riester, the Minister for Employment, the same success that his predecessor Mr Blum achieved with the European works councils in 1994.</p>

I certainly do not agree with Mrs Pack"s position, much as I sympathise with her emotional involvement, because we have to think things through to the end and consider the consequences of that position. And the consequences, which involve withdrawing the OSCE mission, would in my view be nothing other than war. That is the crucial point; it would be war, once again at the cost of a great many human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you the historical background again. Since 1989/1990 we have been seeing how unresolved conflicts, some of which date back to earlier times – I am thinking of the outcome of the Balkan conflict before the first world war – and borders drawn in earlier times, together with authoritarian regimes or even dictatorships that are responsible for extremely serious human rights violations, now lead to a situation in which, were we still living in the Europe of the past, we would virtually be in a state of war, in which new borders were drawn as a consequence of people being driven out, of the unspeakable sacrifice of innocent lives, of the destruction of intrinsic values. Sadly we saw all that again in Bosnia. But the battle would be fought to the bitter end. That was the European logic of the past, which had fatal consequences. For as a rule these wars are internationalised by the side that is in danger of losing. As a rule civil wars logically tend to spread, with the result that the regional powers very quickly become involved and with the result that in the end quite different conflicts enter into play in the region and large and powerful states, which also have their own particular history and conflicts of interest that have not yet been resolved, border conflicts, become directly involved. What that means is the threat of a major Balkan war.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot allow that to happen. It would be a reversion to the past and it is not just a question of the destruction of intrinsic values, not just of unspeakable misery, it is also a question of the destruction of the European security system and of integration. We must not forget that. That is why there is no alternative to a process of stabilisation. I do however ask myself whether Europe is in fact strong enough even to settle its own internal affairs. Quite obviously it is not strong enough yet. These include conflict prevention, a most important aspect. To put it in non‐technical terms, what will the consequence of these Balkan wars actually be? In practice it will be that the European Union has to take on responsibility in some form for the entire region.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, that is what we are now seeing in Bosnia. Without the detailed work done by the High Representative, without the presence of the allied troops, without the civilian activities, without the EU High Representative"s assumption of responsibility, we would be back in a situation of confrontation again there or even of bloody conflict. But for us Europeans that means we must find answers – and that is something we must think through properly, not today but at some point. A first very full, very open and, in my view, important discussion of precisely these questions was held at the foreign ministers" dinner at the Vienna European Council. What kind of long‐term political strategy can be found to resolve these conflicts that will not lead to war, to expulsions, to mass violence and the trampling of human rights? We will have to find an answer to this quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly in favour of our making greater efforts in relation to Russia in this connection. I do not find Russia"s current attitude in the UN Security Council very constructive because basically it is still founded on the old fixed idea of a confrontation between one superpower and another superpower, America. Russia would have a great opportunity before it today if it decided to play a constructive role; but unfortunately it is not grasping it. We are trying to make progress here through a constructive dialogue with Russia and an open discussion of all the issues. But we consider it extremely important, and the foreign ministers agreed on this, to formulate a central strategy, which cannot, however, be regarded as the conventional kind of assistance, as Russia is too big to allow us to talk in terms of assistance; it is a far too important, central partner in terms of European security, European stability. But we do give absolute priority to developing a common strategy here.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not inconsistent – and I thank all those who pointed this out – with considering the problems arising in the Mediterranean. I was recently visited by Foreign Minister Scharon; President Arafat will come next. The Commission will be visiting the Middle East in February. That is the second visit and it will encompass not just the question of North Africa but indeed also the Middle East peace process. This is after all the second neighbouring region, even if the European Union neither can nor wants to take over the role of the United States there. But the more progress is made with the peace process – and I really cannot see any better alternative to this peace process – the more all the parties concerned in the Middle East will realise that as regions we are neighbours. What role the European Union will then actually play, in regard to underpinning this process, is another aspect to which we will direct our attention when we continue the Barcelona process in Stuttgart. Here too it would be damaging to posit any conflict between eastern enlargement and the issues of the south. We want Europe! And by its nature Europe will be looking at different interests than, for instance, Germany or Spain, to give examples of geographically different positions. We have common interests. The interests of Europe are common interests and as such they must be brought to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now give a very brief, summary reply to a number of points I find most interesting. There is no doubt at all that Germany"s political approach is a European one. The same is true of the new German Government"s political approach. We are following a line of continuity with the preceding German governments and in the light of its national interests Germany would lose out a great deal if we changed that approach in any way. If we still regard the concept of national interests as at all in keeping with the times, all I can say for the German Government is that the European integration process takes first place in our national interests. So it was in the past, and so it is now, for the change in the political balance in the German <span class="italic">Bundestag</span> has not brought any change in our interests. Under the new government, Germany will continue its commitment to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it quite clear: what I have presented here is the approach of the German Government and the German Chancellor. Anyone who was present at the discussion between the German Chancellor and the Commission will emphatically confirm that. There are no changes here. The German Government is united in maintaining the same position. This whole reform project we are about to embark on is not a question of bookkeeping. So let me explain the German position to you once again in unequivocal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make the Union capable of enlargement. The next historic step after the introduction of the euro will be enlargement of the European Union. Just consider the implications if the European Union remained a Union just for western Europe after the end of the cold war. That would be a historical failure without parallel and the soul of Europe, the idea of integration, would atrophy. Quite apart from that, it would be a historical injustice of the first order vis‐à‐vis the Central and Eastern European applicant states. So we must now do our utmost to make progress with that step.</p>
<p class="contents">The second great historical challenge facing us is to make the European Union into a political entity. Personally I do not believe that we can act as an economic and financial ‘global player", as it is called in modern parlance, on the world stage if at the same time our political structures operate in a dimension that, compared to what we have now achieved in monetary policy, is – to put it rather bluntly – more reminiscent of a local stage.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">That will not do Europe any good, nor for that matter will it do the stability of our currency any good. That is why I am firmly convinced that our second important historical challenge is to strengthen the European institutions. In my view democracy always also implies a strengthening of democracy. That is a key point. Consider this: much of what is now presented so to speak as German strategy – I will be coming back to that in a moment – is to do with the fact that our national public opinion feels there is a lack of legitimacy; here I am only speaking for our national public opinion. We need to look at that very carefully if we want to develop the European institutions further, which means also to make them more democratic as institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must now meet these two central challenges. How can we do so? We can do so through the vision of Europe as a political entity. It can become a larger and stronger political entity if we get on with the homework that now awaits us. After all, the Cardiff Council set March as the date for the special summit above all because of three added factors. The Amsterdam Treaty is to enter into force and will intensify the pressure for reform, not just the pressure to enhance the EU"s ability to act. The European elections will be taking place in June. But the European Parliament must also be able to play its part in implementing the Agenda 2000 reforms. That also requires budgetary decisions before the end of the year, with the new approach to areas eligible for aid and suchlike.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, therefore, this date was set deliberately. But within the context of this historical challenge, which is enlargement and at the same time the development of a political entity, we must also ensure that subsequent presidencies can tackle the institutional reforms, in order to use the window of time that we have.</p>
<p class="contents">Under what are for us very difficult conditions – we only recently came into office, which has some implications for the business of Europe – the German Government declared itself prepared to make Agenda 2000 the focus of our presidency and to reach agreement at the special summit in March. I sometimes try to imagine what would happen if this failed. Early in the morning on 26/27 March the Heads of State or Government would appear before the people and declare failure. This time that would have immediate repercussions on stock market prices. It would not simply be a decision, as it would have in the past when a summit happened to fail. The date of 1 January 1999 has created a new dimension and thereby also a new responsibility. I think we are all aware of that responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It can only succeed – and now I am coming to the age‐old question of money – if everyone is prepared to look beyond their national interests, which are quite legitimate – in Germany too – and to set aside the conflicts between national interests in Europe for the sake of the compromise represented by integration. So it can only succeed if everyone, on an even‐handed basis, takes a substantial step away from their national interests. We want an even‐handed solution and, as I said in my earlier statement, we cannot allow the south, for instance, to have to pay for eastern enlargement. That would be absurd. Southern enlargement – as also the accession of Ireland – was and is a success story, economically, socially, but also in terms of democracy and security policy; it is one that we will and must now repeat with enlargement to the east.</p>
<p class="contents">I am old enough to remember the military coup in Greece. I remember the military dictatorships in Spain and Portugal. I remember very well the discussions about whether or not there was a military coup in Italy in the 1970s. That is all past history. European integration is a success story, and we must repeat it, we must commit ourselves to that!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The role that Germany plays also reflects our economic strength, and that should be a cause to rejoice rather than complain. We know what we owe to Europe, from many points of view, not just in material terms but also in political and cultural terms against the background of our history. The new German Government knows that too and will therefore adhere to its commitment to Europe. I have nothing to lose at all by saying that when I was in opposition I supported the major part of the policy pursued in these areas, especially Chancellor Kohl"s European policy, even if I criticised one or other aspect of it. I consider that nothing unusual; in my view, having convictions about something is part of the parliamentary process, especially when historic issues are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">My group in the German <span class="italic">Bundestag</span> was the first in the last legislative term to call for the Europe of 11, for the accession of Italy, at a time when others, like Chancellor Kohl, were far from prepared to do so. The 3.0 debate and all that lay behind it were things we criticised too. So I will say quite openly that I have nothing to make up for here nor am I afraid to thank Helmut Kohl; he was rightly appointed a freeman of Europe at the European Council in Vienna. It is only that since Amsterdam Germany has no longer played the right role.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amsterdam the Federal Republic of Germany put on the brakes for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that. And the coalition – here I am not talking about internal politics but about European politics – went into the elections with a position that was no longer entirely consistent, as you know better than I do. That position was: eastern enlargement as quickly as possible, Germany wants to pay less, and the German farmers should get more. That does not tally with the laws of logic in this world. That is why we must now define a clear and consistent German position, and that is what I have done today on behalf of the German Government.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly do not want to stop being a net contributor. We have no quarrel with the fact that there are some countries that are ahead and then there are the poorer countries. But it is obvious that imbalances have crept into the system and that they need correcting. In terms of domestic politics, it is difficult for a German politician to explain why countries that obtain a higher per capita income thanks to their GNP than we do should pay little or even pay no net contribution at all. These are of course all things that play a part in domestic politics. I need not tell that to my German colleagues, but let me point out the following to other Members: because of the special situation in West Germany after the second world war, Germany"s European policy was basically unquestioned and was determined solely by the politicians – until Maastricht. Maastricht changed all that. In future, every German government will have to rally the people behind it, as in all your countries, in all your own democracies. That used to be a matter of course and was not considered particularly noteworthy, as my German colleagues know only too well, but all that has changed since Maastricht.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the net contributor debate does of course also have a domestic dimension, which must not be forgotten and which I regard as entirely legitimate. But for us the crucial problem is how we can prepare the EU structures for enlargement. I am less concerned about the actual situation, which clearly needs rectifying, than about the fact that if we leave the existing structures as they stand, we will of course come up against imbalances in the burden‐sharing in regard to enlargement, which will quite simply no longer be acceptable or defensible. Since I am in favour of enlargement, I believe we need this situation to be rectified too. I think that is politically justified and certainly not a sign of anti‐Europeanism or selfish nationalism; quite the reverse. This is a central aspect of the necessary structural reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to get through with Agenda 2000, we will have to present it in all its aspects; it encompasses five separate packages. We will have to reach a compromise on the question of real constancy, budgetary constancy. There are five different interpretations, but I believe we will find a compromise there. Yesterday, the German finance minister said the EU budget must not grow faster than the national budgets. That is a point that will certainly be taken seriously in the discussions. Naturally we are also very concerned about the question of the budgetary structure. As was pointed out earlier, although 80 % of the territory of the European Union is rural, we must not forget that it is not 80 % of our population that lives in these rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that will arise in this connection is the common agricultural policy. The Commission has submitted its CAP proposals. Let me just add another word on the question of the renationalisation of agricultural policy. Cofinancing does not imply the renationalisation of agricultural policy. If it did, the German Government would regard that as a mistake. We do not want to see agricultural policy renationalised or even partly renationalised. So, cofinancing is a question of the national contribution. The political decision is taken at Brussels. It is important to remember that. That precludes any renationalisation. In any case we only want it in relation to direct income supports. That is the second important point. And here we consider it urgently necessary to have national financial contributions, in view also of the future European Union, the enlarged European Union, and the future of the agricultural market.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above that, let us please have no illusions. The WTO negotiations in the year 2002 will create an enormous pressure for adjustment, as every agricultural politician knows. Without this reform, the current disputes about bananas or hormones in meat will seem nothing compared to what we will be faced with, for many of the agricultural subsidies we have now simply do not come within the scope of the WTO. So there, too, we will face an enormous pressure for reform.</p>
<p class="contents">All three models that the Commission has proposed for the common agricultural policy must remain open to discussion. We have to discuss them. National preferences differ. And then there are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. I know how important and how productive these resources are, but I think that here too a contribution is needed and that special problems, such as those facing Portugal in relation to the Structural Funds, will need to be considered. I also believe we will have to carefully assess and consider the Spanish situation. We are looking towards an even‐handed solution.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is no doubt that an even‐handed solution also covers the rebate, the UK rebate, and, in the final analysis – and this is the fifth aspect involved, and one to which not only Germany but, as the presidency"s trip showed, the Netherlands and other net contributors also attach very great importance – this issue will also have to be resolved. We want to produce a global package, which will be anything but easy. At the European Council in Vienna, which took place at the historical site of the Vienna Congress in the Hofburg, the Portuguese prime minister pointed out that when Talleyrand was asked how long the Vienna Congress had lasted he replied ‘the last fifteen minutes". That will be equally true of the European Council, the special Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Member who quoted Goethe is no longer in the House. He quoted Goethe"s last words, on his death bed. I am not sure this is a suitable Goethe quote and whether he knew that. The words ‘<span class="italic">Mehr Licht, mehr Licht</span> " (more light, more light!) can be interpreted in two ways. Either this greatest of German poets felt that darkness was descending around him, or he was reverting to the dialect of Frankfurt in his final moments. Some people seriously interpreted what he wanted to say as: ‘<span class="italic">mer licht so schlecht</span> ", ‘I feel so bad". But if we want to quote Goethe, we really could do better, for Goethe was a European through and through and he was pro‐Europe. He would have no truck at all with nationalism. I think that is the real Goethe whom we should quote.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hänsch, I warmly thank you for your support in regard to the settlement of the Kosovo conflict and would say to the European Parliament: it is important that we cooperate very closely. The trilogue debate with Mr Verheugen will be continuing tomorrow. During that debate a number of questions that you have raised will be considered in more depth. We want a very close dialogue, in order to strengthen the European Parliament but also to ensure that it plays an active role in tackling the great tasks that face us. The European Parliament must play a central role here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok, allow me to point out one thing, which is something I also want to say to certain colleagues. I know how difficult it is to be in opposition; I myself was in that position long enough. But to be in opposition also means to attack very intelligently and make it difficult for the government to find a reply. To the accusation that all we have managed to do after 12 days of presidency is to make announcements, I would reply: yes, if I could do more than that after 12 days I would not be in politics, I would be a miracle worker and then I would be in the wrong job, I should be founding a church or something.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter) </span></p>
<p class="contents">But who indeed can perform miracles? So with the best will in the world, all one can do in 12 days is to state what one is prepared to do and then to be judged by it later. And I can see that the opposition has a very high opinion of us and is expecting a great deal of us.</p>
<p class="contents">But for Mr Brok – who openly thanked Mr Kohl, as I too have done several times – to accuse us of trying to divert attention at the Cologne summit from our own national failures in employment market policy a few days before the European elections, means he is obviously unintentionally revealing a strategy of the preceding government, for we were not the ones to set all these deadlines. It was not the new German Government that did this; we were not able to do so and nor did the opposition hypnotise the previous government into doing so. With the best will in the world, we were not able to do so. It was the Luxembourg summit that decided this, it was Vienna, which followed, that was responsible for no progress being made. These are not accusations that can seriously be levelled at the new German Government, because we have not been in office nearly long enough. In the interests of close cooperation we should refrain from transparent polemics of this kind, which, for the rest, do little to help solve the problems facing us. The areas of general consensus are more important.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion let me emphasise once again what one Member said about Germany"s role. I repeat that we know we will remain a net contributor. There will be no German disengagement here. That would be absurd and wrong given our interests. It is in our interest to ensure that Europe develops into a stronger political entity. The fact that the Deutschmark became integrated in the euro is not a matter of course, given its significance as a national currency, a significance that goes far beyond what a national currency normally signifies, and not just for the West Germans but also and in particular for our East German compatriots since unification in 1989/1990. It is a step that was taken with the broad assent of the German <span class="italic">Bundestag</span> , and it is also binding upon the new German Government. We believe that during the German Presidency we have an obligation to make the European Union more capable of enlargement, to combat unemployment, to take a first step towards making progress with institutional reforms, to help strengthen democracy in Europe and, in general, to turn the European Union into a real political entity, with the ultimate aim of full integration.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, you have of course spoken for 30 minutes, but I think that the Members, who have heard you speak for two hours, have been listening very carefully.</p>

I forgive you! But I would like to say that for you simply to dismiss what I said as emotional is male arrogance, and I am happy to return the insult. I have been concerning myself with Kosovo for ten years – a little longer, perhaps, than you – and I do not reproach you for that, just as you should not reproach me for being emotional. I simply believe that after I have been pleading for years for prevention in Kosovo and that has not been achieved, one cannot say after ten years: we must take preventive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also believe that I did not say the OSCE must get out and nobody else must come in; perhaps you did not hear me properly. I said that as it stands it is not much use because there is nothing it can do. Indeed it can achieve even less than the UN troops did in Bosnia. In my view we need an international force there which incorporates the Russians, so as to prepare the ground for peaceful solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to correct a few other words you said. Mr Westendorp is not the representative of the European Union, he is the representative of the international community including the European Union. Please do not misunderstand me next time!</p>

The point is quite simply that during the nine years when there was no preventive policy it was not this German government but another that kept denying the need for a policy of prevention. You must admit that too!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischer, </span>  <span class="italic">President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mrs Pack, I really think we do not need to quarrel so bitterly. Let me stress again that in connection with Kosovo, as also with Bosnia, I was not using the term emotional in any gender‐specific or even discriminatory fashion, for I too feel very emotionally affected whenever I look at this issue. I believe nobody who is concerned with it can feel otherwise. In that regard I can also understand people taking an emotional approach – and in the case of Bosnia emotion was not the worst counsellor, if I may point that out again – but nevertheless, we must think things through to the end. After all there is no point, Mrs Pack, in saying that an international force has to be deployed against the will of the sovereign government of that state, unlike the sovereign government of Bosnia which created a definite international legal basis for these international troops. That is an enormous problem. So it would create a great problem for an international force to intervene for the first time on the territory of a state recognised by all EU Member States and by the international community against the will of that state"s government.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the participation of Russia. At this moment in time the Russians in fact take the opposite view. You will not get them to participate now.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what is the aim? Secession? But what does secession mean? What does it mean, when one third of the population of Macedonia is of Albanian origin? These are all just questions, in order to make it clear that it will do nothing for our common interests if we seem to be exchanging blows on this issue. For these are questions which all the responsible parties ask themselves a hundred times a day. In fact my group and also the German Government"s new human rights representative and former deputy, Mr Popper, really have spent years trying to persuade the EU to become more closely involved in Kosovo and to make progress with seeking solutions there. At a time when the KLA did not yet exist we were calling for more support to be given to Rugova, among many other things.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately things did not go as we wished. Today the situation is different. But we have tried. We invited the Albanian interlocutors to Bonn and we are remaining in close contact. But it is also apparent that the Albanian side is of course thinking it can use the West for its own strategic ends, for goals the West does not endorse. You must realise that too. The Western community of states is in favour of an autonomous status, which we consider urgently necessary. Whether and to what extent there is any historical prospect of achieving that is a legitimate question, raised by freely elected Members of the European Parliament. In view of the experiences we have had, I consider it only natural that it should be discussed, that these issues should also be aired publicly.</p>
<p class="contents">But when I think of the practical end results, Mrs Pack – and I beg you not to misunderstand my words as any unseemly criticism of your position, for which I have great sympathy – I believe there is no option other than a strategy of stabilisation, however imperfect it may be at present. And in that context, the achievement followed by the implementation of an interim political settlement for Kosovo, endorsed by the Kosovar and the Yugoslav side, is of central importance.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view there are only worse alternatives to this strategy of stabilisation. That is why I have explained to you that we must do our utmost to bring about a peaceful solution, working together with our partners in the Contact Group, but also in the European Union and in other institutions. I am of course thinking just as much of Norway, which holds the presidency of the OSCE, as of all the others who are endeavouring to bring this about.</p>
