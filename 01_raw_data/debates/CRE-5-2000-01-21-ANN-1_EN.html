<p>Question 1: What specific provisions will the Member States submit?</p>
<p>Article 1 of the “Common Position of 27 May 1999 on negotiations of the European Union relating to the Draft Convention on Cyber Crime held in the Council of Europe”<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> expresses general support for the Draft Cyber Crime Convention, in particular for provisions regarding the investigation and prosecution of “cyber crime” offences. Momentarily, Member States contribute to the development of the Draft Convention, which is still under discussion in the Council of Europe, by supplementing the existing draft provisions where necessary. This is the case regarding provisions on substantive criminal law, but also concerning procedural law and, above all, in the field of international cooperation.</p>
<p>Question 2: Does the Council envisage a European body to monitor and oversee the prosecution of cyber crime at European level?</p>
<p>During the UK Presidency, the Council underlined in its “Elements of its strategy against high tech crime”<a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the importance of joining unbureaucratic and informal practical arrangements, such as the already existing G8 24/7 points of contact network. Until now, several Member States are part of this flexible network. It facilitates, above all, the investigation of cyber crime. At this stage, the Presidency supports this flexible approach and does not envisage setting up a proper European body to monitor and oversee the prosecution of cyber crime. However, the role of Europol in this area is kept under review.</p>
<p>Question 3: Seven months after the adoption of the Common Position, can the Council say what stage has been reached with the Draft Convention on Cyber Crime and what practical measures Member States have taken?</p>
<p>As the Draft Convention is still being negotiated, it would be premature to ask Member States to already take practical measures.</p>
<p>The mandate of the relative Committee of the Council of Europe (PCCY) to negotiate the Convention has been extended until the end of 2000. Especially the provisions on international cooperation are intensively discussed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council has consistently supported peace in the Middle East, through its own political initiatives, its constructive support for the efforts of the US and other key players and considerable economic EU assistance for the Peace Process. The Council welcomes the fact that the Middle East Peace Process is not only on the move but is also gaining momentum on both its Syrian and Palestinian Tracks.</p>
<p>On the basis of this positive development, the multilateral part of the Peace Process should soon be able to resume normal activities, starting with a meeting of its Steering Group at Ministerial level in Moscow later this month. As Chair of the Regional Economic Development Working Group, which has 53 members in and outside the region, the Council and the Commission will convene that group as soon as possible after the Ministerial meeting. The group will then be able to continue laying the foundations for the economic development and integration which is a basic condition for lasting peace in the region.</p>
<p>As for the Barcelona Process, the Council does not share the honourable Member's appreciation that it is “slowing to a stop”. The Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Ministers last April in Stuttgart, as well as the Ministerial Conferences on Water in Turin and on Health in Montpellier, both in the second half of 1999, on the contrary carried forward the work. We are now preparing an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Industry in June in Limassol. On substance, one of the particularly far reaching projects for this year, on which work is already started, is a Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability.</p>
<p>At the bilateral level, the Council is to decide, before the end of this month, on the conclusion of the Association Agreement with Morocco. During the Portuguese Presidency, four Association Council meetings with Mediterranean countries are planned: with Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey and Israel.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council will continue its work on a Common Strategy of the European Union on the Mediterranean region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0816"></a>

<p>Despite repeated declarations by the Council in support of the abolition of the death penalty throughout the world, the campaign pursued by the Council in Autumn 1999, which advocated the adoption by the UN General Assembly of a resolution calling for the introduction of a universal moratorium on the carrying out of death sentences, ended up as a complete shambles.</p>
<p>In order to avert another political and diplomatic fiasco for the Union and another defeat in the international campaign in support of the universal abolition of the death penalty, does the Council not feel that it should, with immediate effect, entrust the High Representative for the CFSP with responsibility for this issue and, in particular, with preparations for a new initiative at the forthcoming UN General Assembly in support of the introduction of a universal moratorium on the carrying out of death sentences?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The worldwide abolition of the death penalty is a key objective in the EU's human rights policy. The EU undertakes initiatives, in bilateral contacts and in multilateral fora, to encourage States to abolish the death penalty. If States are not yet prepared to abolish capital punishment, the EU calls on them to introduce moratoria and to respect minimum human rights standards.</p>
<p>The EU notes with satisfaction that its call for the worldwide abolition of the death penalty is supported by civil society representatives and NGOs within and outside Europe. It also notes that the number of countries that have abolished the death penalty has been growing over the last few years.</p>
<p>However, and in spite of the significant support it received from many UN Member States, the EU's initiative encountered fierce resistance from retentionist countries. The only way to get it adopted would have been to accept amendments which would have run counter not only to the immediate objective but also even to the principle of action on human rights in the UN. The EU accordingly decided after close consultation with the co-sponsors to freeze the initiative and postpone its introduction.</p>
<p>It is important to underline that decisions on the objective and tactics were taken by all EU Members jointly, in cooperation with other pro-abolition members of the UN. The former Presidency played its normal role in coordinating and leading on the EU's position, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the arrangements for representing the EU at the UN. Worldwide abolition of the death penalty will obviously take time; initiatives to that end can achieve much in raising consciousness about this issue, even though they may not be wholly successful in the short term. The Union's commitment and determination to pursue, within the UN and elsewhere, its long-term policy for the universal abolition of the death penalty remain unchanged.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0824"></a>

<p>The Council wishes to emphasise that it is firmly convinced that the establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice cannot be achieved in a harmonious fashion unless there is close interinstitutional cooperation, particularly between the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>This is the spirit in which the Council has always been concerned to consult the European Parliament, pursuant to the terms of the Treaties, regarding proposals put forward by the Commission or initiatives from Member States.</p>
<p>Like the procedure for all other proposals put forward in other areas, the Council consults the European Parliament as quickly as possible and, in most cases, virtually as soon as it receives these proposals itself. This is the result of its desire to keep the European Parliament informed at the earliest possible stage of work in progress and to give Parliament the opportunity to give the Council’s operations added value in due course.</p>
<p>As regards the proposed convention on judicial cooperation in criminal matters mentioned in the specific question which the honourable Member has asked, the Council wishes to state that, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, it consulted the European Parliament by asking it to issue an opinion within an appropriate time limit, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties.</p>
<p>Following the requests made by the European Parliament, the Council issued a new text to the European Parliament, following the Council meeting of 2 December 1999, regarding the proposed convention and is now awaiting the opinion of Parliament.</p>

<p>The Council has no detailed information about the particular case to which the honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>In its various contacts at every level, the Council has been attempting for some years to impress upon the Tunisian authorities how much importance it attaches to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Difficulties have arisen in the past because the Tunisian authorities have refused to meet Union representatives.</p>
<p>However, a number of developments in recent months have been sufficiently encouraging to warrant attention. In the first place, the Association Agreement entered into force on 1 March 1998, providing a basis on which to pursue the necessary dialogue at ministerial level. The EU-Tunisia Association Council held its first meeting on 14 July 1998 and at the dinner given immediately afterwards, the Austrian Presidency raised the question of human rights. The second Association Council meeting will take place on 24 January 2000 and likewise be followed by a dinner at which discussions will focus on the next stages of the political dialogue. The Union will also take the opportunity to voice its specific concerns about respect for human rights. The case mentioned in the honourable Member's question could accordingly be dealt with on that occasion.</p>
<p>In addition, several breakthroughs appear to have occurred where human rights in Tunisia are concerned. First of all, a Minister whose brief includes human rights was appointed in November� 1999. Initial contacts have been made with the Minister, who has said that he wishes to foster progress in the sphere of human rights, freedom of the Press and freedom of expression. He has given to understand that he is ready and willing to conduct an ongoing constructive dialogue with the EU on all of these sensitive matters, marking a departure from the previous attitude. Furthermore, after years of efforts to bring such talks about, the UN special rapporteur on promotion and protection of the rights of freedom of conscience and expression, Mr Hussain, has just visited the Tunisian authorities and will report to the next meeting of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0012"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member points out, the new treaty attaches greater importance to matters relating to respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the combating of discrimination.</p>
<p>On the basis of this new treaty, a number of actions have been undertaken by the Council pursuant to Articles 6 and 13.</p>
<p>Article 6 of the EU Treaty stipulates that:</p>
<p>1. “The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States.</p>
<p>2. The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.” </p>
<p>In accordance with the new powers thereby conferred on it, the Council has adopted a first annual report on human rights, both in the European Union and internationally. This report has, in fact, been published by the General Secretariat of the Council.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the European Council in Cologne decided that a Community Charter of Fundamental Rights would be drawn up in accordance with the terms specified by the European Council in Tampere, which make the procedure the responsibility of both the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has just presented the Council with a raft of proposals based on Article 13. According to Article 13 of the EC treaty, “Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Treaty and within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.” The European Parliament has been consulted on these proposals. The underlying principles which the Commission used in drawing up the two directives and the programme are explained in a communication. In the same document, the Commission mentions the great amount of consultation work carried out within Member States, particularly involving civil society, whether it be NGOs or both sides of industry.</p>
<p>The first directive, which targets discrimination of all forms, with the exception of sexual discrimination, is a directive with a view to the creation of a general framework in favour of equal treatment in employment and at work.</p>
<p>The second directive concerns the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of peoples regardless of race or ethnic origin. This is a legal framework intended to enable Member States to intensify the fight against discrimination in all forms.</p>
<p>As for the programme, it sets itself three objectives, which are as follows:</p>
<p>“(a) improve the understanding of issues related to discrimination through improved knowledge and measurement and through the evaluation of the effectiveness of policies and practice;</p>
<p>(b) develop the capacity of target actors (in particular Member States, local and regional authorities, independent bodies responsible for the fight against discrimination, the social partners and non-governmental organisations) to address discrimination effectively, in particular through support for the exchange of information and good practice and networking at European level;</p>
<p>(c) promote and disseminate the values and practices underlying the fight against discrimination.”</p>
<p>This programme will therefore make it possible to monitor breaches of the principle of non-discrimination more closely.</p>
<p>The proposals based on Article 13 are, in the opinion of the Council, of considerable political importance, and the Portuguese Presidency has made it clear that this is one of its priorities. The Presidency intends to take the examination of these proposals as far as possible during the first six months in order to achieve the adoption of these measures, if possible.</p>
<p>These proposals are also representative of the way in which Community institutions may give substance to a general principle. This process will contribute towards giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights greater credibility.</p>
<p>Finally, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, which was also created by Council Regulation No 1035/97, has just published its first report. At this stage it does not seem the right time to extend its mandate to make it a monitoring centre for human rights. This idea, although very interesting, seems premature in view of the short lifetime of the monitoring centre in its present form and in view of the fact that the process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights is still in its initial phase.</p>
<p>The Council would like to assure the honourable Member once again of its deep commitment to this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0017"></a>

<p>In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 12 May 1998, the Commission informed the Council and Parliament that the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related matters currently in force is confined to the territory of the State of Israel which, under applicable international law, binding on all of the Community’s Member States and on Israel, does not include the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely the West Bank, together with East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. Apparently, the territorial clause establishing this scope in the current Agreement is repeated in the EC-Israel Association Agreement initialled by Israel and the Council and now undergoing ratification by the Member States.</p>
<p>Have the current or previous Israeli governments instructed Israel’s customs services to apply the rules of origin as laid down in the territorial clause of that Agreement, as the Agreement requires?</p>
<p>Does the body of international law governing the application and interpretation of all EC bilateral agreements permit Israeli settlements, or any part of the Occupied Territories, to be treated as a part of the State of Israel?</p>
<p>Is the territorial clause and the obligation to apply it in certifying the origin of exports to the EC under that Agreement an essential element of the Agreement?</p>

<p>According to Article 38 of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement, it applies “to the territory of the State of Israel”. In addition, Protocol 4 on Rules of Origin provides that the term “Israel” shall also cover the territorial waters, which surround Israel, and under certain conditions also some sea-vessels. No further definition of that notion is contained in the agreement. The EC has always considered that the agreement applies solely to the territory of the State of Israel within its internationally recognised borders in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions. This issue is thus linked to the final settlement of the Middle East Peace Process.</p>
<p>Responsibility for monitoring the implementation of all international agreements entered into by the Community lies with the Commission. This applies also to the Agreements concluded with Israel and with the PLO.</p>
<p>In a Communication, which was also addressed to the European Parliament, of May 1998, the Commission pointed out the following: “Evidence suggests that the practice of exporting Palestinian products as “made in Israel” under Israeli certificates of origin applies to a substantial proportion of total exports into the EC of Palestinian originating products”.</p>
<p>The Council took note of this Communication and considered that these issues should be resolved on a technical level in a constructive dialogue with Israel. It asked the Commission to report back on the outcome of its talks with the Israeli authorities and to keep it fully and promptly informed of all relevant developments, including of further measures which might be under consideration.</p>
<p>Since then, the Commission held several such technical discussions and reported to Member States in the Customs Committee on a regular basis, and at a more political level last December. It appears that all these issues are still being discussed. I am sure that the Commission will also keep the European Parliament fully informed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0779"></a>

<p>The British Government is reported to be planning later this year (by amending the UK Opticians Act of 1989 through Section 60 of their proposed new Health Bill) to restrict the right to supply the public in Britain with ‘fashion contact lenses without power’ (which merely change the colour of the wearer's eyes) to sales by registered opticians only. It will, however, still be possible to purchase these products face-to-face over the counter of a fashion-house in the rest of the European Union, via mail-order or via the Internet.

<p>The honourable Member is asking whether the planned UK measure to restrict the sale to the public of “fashion contact lenses without power” by registered opticians only, is contrary to the rules of the single market. He points out that the sale of these products in the other Member States is made over-the-counter, or via mail-order or via the Internet.</p>
<p>It has to be examined, therefore, whether such a measure would infringe Article 28 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits all quantitative restrictions on imports of goods between the Member States and measures having equivalent effect.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice in its Judgement Keck of 24 November 1993 (C-267 and 268/91) ruled that national provisions restricting or prohibiting certain selling arrangements of products, fall outside Article 28.</p>
<p>It follows from the jurisprudence of the Court (Commission v. Greece C-391/92) that measures determining by whom or where goods may be sold are considered as selling arrangements.</p>
<p>As declared in the Judgement Keck, national measures on selling arrangements do not hinder trade between Member States, so long as they apply to all relevant traders operating within the national territory and so long as they affect in the same manner, in law and in fact, the marketing of domestic products and of those of other Member States.</p>
<p>Consequently, unless there is going to be discrimination in favour of the sale of nationally produced fashion contact lenses in the UK, such provisions would escape the scope of application of Article 28 of the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0789"></a>

<p>The Operational Programme for Afforestation under Regulation (EEC) No 2080/93 and the Operational programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-1999 provided funding for a number of measures to complement this latter programme for such activities as training (IR£ 7.054 million), afforestation of agricultural land and its maintenance, Forestry Development including Woodland Improvement, Reconstitution, Downstream Development Supports, Harvesting Equipment, Forest Roads and Research and Development from which Coillte would have benefited either directly or indirectly.

<p>The Commission is aware that the joint funding arrangements for national early retirement schemes for fishermen have hardly been used since they were introduced into Community legislation in 1995.

<p>Cutting the school drop-out rate is one of the main aims of the Member States' educational systems.</p>
<p>The school drop-out rate – in other words the proportion of young people aged from 18 to 24 who have completed lower secondary education or who have not attained that level and are not undergoing training – stands at 14.5% in the Community as a whole, but varies considerably from one country to the next, ranging from 6.5% to 34%.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of early school-leaving has been explored in a 1995 study entitled 'Dropping out and secondary education', produced for the Commission by the Milan-based IARD Institute.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Commission published a study on the opportunities for continuing in the educational system ('Poursuivre sa formation'), which lists and surveys the measures being implemented by the Member States to reduce the scale and consequences of early school-leaving. (These documents are available on the Commission's Europa site).</p>
<p>The employment guidelines adopted every year to give effect to the concerted employment strategy laid down at the extraordinary Luxembourg European Council in November 1997 call on the Member States to take steps to reduce the school drop-out rate. The national action plans for employment, drawn up on the basis of the guidelines, specify the measures to be taken to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>By virtue of the subsidiarity principle, educational policy matters still fall within the responsibility of the Member States. However, the Commission produces an annual report on education and employment setting out and summarising activities of the Member States intended to implement the national action plans for employment. The report serves to identify best practices such as the Irish attempts to help young people obtain qualifications.</p>
<p>The modernisation of vocational education (Austria), the growing links between school and the world of work (Finland and Luxembourg), and the implementation of the 'Invest in Youth' programme (United Kingdom) are other examples of good practice. The report has been submitted to the Ministers for Education meeting within the Council, and the Member States have been asked to consider what best practices should be adopted and how they might be disseminated.</p>
<p>Given the well-established link between early school leaving and social exclusion, this would certainly be an issue which could potentially be taken up in the context of the programme, currently in preparation by the Commission, to give effect to the provisions of Article 137 of the EC Treaty which provide for “measures designed to encourage cooperation between Member States through initiatives aimed at improving knowledge, developing exchanges of information and best practices, innovative approaches and evaluating experiences in order to combat social exclusion.”</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0802"></a>

<p>The head of the Commission's Solid Fuels Unit has asked the Spanish Industry Ministry for a list of companies or production units which must be included in the mine closure plan by 23 July 2002 and for fresh notification of the aid which Spain intends to grant in 2000 (and which must be scaled down until it reaches the target of 4% per year). This requirement jeopardises the Spanish mining plan which was agreed between the government and the unions and which was approved some time ago by the Commission.</p>
<p>Does the Commission feel that it is entitled to interfere in Spanish industrial policy and to demand the closure of companies, or should it not abide by the terms of the mining plan and monitor compliance with the aid-reduction process? Does the Commission take adequate account of the fact that coal mining is associated with regions which are highly dependent on the jobs it creates?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Commission Decision No 3632/ECSC on the Community rules for State aid to the coal industry stipulates that the Commission should examine the compliance of aid action, notified to it annually, with the plans for modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and reductions in activity which it authorised previously, and with the objectives of this decision.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that the only purpose of this examination, which is undertaken with the utmost discipline and professionalism, is to make it possible to legislate on this aid.</p>
<p>The specific purpose of the request for information sent to the Spanish Industry Minister is to provide information for the file on the aid which the Spanish Government plans to grant its coal industry for the year. This request for information concerns the objectives included in the Spanish coal plan, drawn up jointly between the government and the trade unions, specifying that “businesses which cannot maintain their activity unaffected in the context of a reduction of the aid must follow Article 4 of the decision in order to initiate adequate processes of restructuring and rationalisation…” or that “overall aid for the operation of underground mines shall be reduced by 4% annually and aid to open-cast mines by 6% annually per business.”</p>
<p>In view of the above, the Commission considers that the information requested complies with the terms of this decision.</p>
<p>The Commission, moreover, takes due note of the fact that the coal mines are located in regions which are extremely dependent on the employment they generate, as is shown by the considerable amounts of aid authorised each year to the Spanish coal industry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0811"></a>

<p>The Commission is presently examining the acquisition by Carrefour of the Promodes group. The operation was announced on 30 August 1999 and was notified on 5 October 1999. Given the lack of essential information, the notification was declared incomplete successively on 7 October 1999 and 11 November. On 2 December, the parties completed the additional information requested from them.</p>
<p>The Spanish and the French competition authorities have formally requested the referral of the case, according to Article 9 of the Merger Regulation, of some down-stream markets' aspects of the case (most of the local areas where activities of the parties overlap).</p>
<p>The Commission is currently carrying out its investigation. It will decide by 25 January 2000 on:</p>

<p>Six years after the Thessaloniki underground railway project was included in the operational programme for ‘Urban Development’ within the second CSF for Greece (1994-1999), and almost two years after the Commission’s rejection of the accusation that Community law relating to public contracts for the project in question had been breached, the Greek Government is continuing to stand in the way of the project’s completion, depriving the city of Thessaloniki of a project which is of vital importance for the region’s development.</p>
<p>In the light of this, what is the Commission’s view of the failure to complete the project? Has it been asked by the Greek Government for the commitment of appropriations from the Urban Development subprogramme for the Thessaloniki underground railway under the second CSF which is, of course, expiring? Has the transfer agreement to the second Thessaloniki underground rail contractor been registered with the Community institutions’ departments and is it consistent with the requirements of public contract-awarding and also with Community legislation? In the context of the investigations which the European Ombudsman is conducting, has the file of complaints examined concerning the Thessaloniki underground railway revealed any liability on the part of the Commission?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that, on 30 December 1999, it approved the co-financing of the Thessaloniki metro project as part of the “Community Support Framework 1994-99”, and more specifically of the operational programme “Urban Development 1994-99” for an amount of up to EUR 5.8 million to be contributed by FEDER. The amount in question should cover co-financing expenses for the preliminary works of the project for the period up to April 2000. As regards the remaining part of the project, it will, in principle, be co-financed in the context of the 'Community Support Framework 2000-2006'.</p>
<p>As regards the management of the project, it has been agreed with the Hellenic authorities that a limited share company will be created to ensure the management of the concession contract as well as any other aspect relating to the project (studies, works-complementary projects, etc.).</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to inform the honourable Member that it has not received from the Hellenic authorities a copy of the concession contract, as finally signed, for approval. In any event, such approval is not required under community legislation. However, the Commission has received a new complaint from the Macedonian Metro Consortium claiming that the concession contract, as finally signed, infringes Community rules on public procurement since it departs from the tender document requirements. The Commission is currently examining the complaint in question.</p>
<p>As for the involvement of the European Ombudsman in this case, to the Commission's knowledge, he is still considering the case and has not reached his decision thus far.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0013"></a>

<p>The Commission Delegation in Beijing, together with the Union Embassies, monitors closely the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in China. The Union has, on several occasions, and most recently in January 2000, undertaken formal démarches to express concern about reports of torture and ill-treatment of arrested followers of the Falun Gong movement, and the harshness of sentences given to these members. It has also sought information about the number of arrests of members of the Falun Gong movement. In accordance with the international human rights covenants signed by China, the Union urges Beijing to review harsh sentences imposed on Falun Gong practitioners and to ensure that safeguards of a fair trial, including adequate legal representation, are fully respected with respect to all individuals. It calls on China to comply with the provisions and the very spirit of the UN human rights covenants it has signed even before ratification occurs. The Falun Gong issue will also be raised during the next round of the human rights dialogue between China and the Union on 17 February 2000 in Lisbon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0018"></a>

<p>In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 12 May 1998, the Commission informed the Council and Parliament that the territorial scope of the EC-Israel Interim Agreement on Trade and Trade-related matters currently in force is confined to the territory of the State of Israel. In that same Communication, the Commission also indicated that it had grounds to believe that the Interim Agreement’s Protocol on the Rules of Origin as governed by its territorial clause was being reached and that it was investigating this matter.</p>
<p>Has the Commission since confirmed that goods wholly or substantially produced in illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories have been, and are being, certified by Israel’s customs service as products of Israel and then fraudulently imported into the Community under the preferences provided for in the current EC-Israel Agreement?</p>

<p>Since the May 1998 Commission communication, there have indeed been further indications that products which could have been produced in Israeli settlements may have been irregularly exported to the Community under the preferences established in the EC-Israel Agreement. As the honourable Member may know, the agreement establishes a verification procedure for cases of this kind, with checks carried out by Member States customs authorities. At this stage, it has not been possible to determine with certitude the origin of the products concerned.</p>
<p>As already explained in the communication, Israeli settlements or occupied territories cannot be considered by the Community as part of Israeli territory for implementation of the EC-Israel Agreement. This issue is highly sensitive, in as far as it relates to the broader question of borders, to Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, the Commission has taken a number of steps to find a viable solution to this problem, with meetings at officials level in both 1998 and 1999, and with a number of ideas on how to gain clarity on the origin of export products without prejudicing the position of any of the parties.</p>
<p>These extensive efforts to find a solution to this issue have not yet yielded a satisfactory result, but discussions are still under way. It is to be hoped that the new Israeli Government, in the context of the revitalised peace-process, will be as eager as the Community to overcome these problems. Indeed, by far the best way forward for all, Israelis, Palestinians and Europeans alike, would be that a mutually satisfactory solution is found in the coming months within the framework of the permanent status negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
