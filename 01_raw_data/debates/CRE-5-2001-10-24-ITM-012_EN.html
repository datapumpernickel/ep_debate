<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gahrton (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the accession of the People’s Republic of China to the WTO is, without doubt, one of the major ventures and experiments of our time. The People’s Republic of China, which is still a country formally governed by a Communist party, is now to be a part of what might be called the stronghold of the free market economy, the WTO. If the Commission is to be believed, that is a huge victory from the EU’s point of view. It is said that this is a one-way market opening process. It is thought that, for the EU, China’s accession to the WTO will signal an enormous gain in enforceable rights, with no significant change in the EU’s own commitments towards China.</p>
<p class="contents">It is really quite a one-way process that is described in the Commission’s proposal. China must adapt. The EU does not need to do very much. Certain China-specific quantitative restrictions are to be phased out. However, these are of relatively little importance.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission’s description in Paragraph 13 is to be believed, accession to the WTO will be good for China’s economy. I have a number of doubts on that score. Clearly, the Commission has to look after the EU’s interests, but the issue is whether, in the era of globalisation, we might not have passed the point at which trade policy could be judged as if it were a football match, in which winning is everything and there is complete indifference to how things are for the other side. I therefore think it is quite remarkable that, in its proposal, the Commission does not say so much as a word to hint that accession might nonetheless lead to problems for the other party, namely the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">I must briefly relate a number of facts to indicate that there may be certain problems for this large, but, nonetheless, still underdeveloped, country. Criticisms are being made in China. When, in connection with my official visit as chairman of the European Parliament’s China delegation, I recently visited China, I was able, on the fringes of this visit, to meet authors of books which are very highly critical of China’s accession to the WTO. Both books are published by legal publishing houses and, obviously, in Chinese. One of the books is known in English translation as <span class="italic">Collision: Globalisation and China’s Reality Choice</span>. The author, who is an economist at Beijing Aeronautic University, maintains that China will lose to a system that is dominated by transnational companies. His sympathies are with the lower social classes, he says, and he believes that Chinese companies will be swallowed by transnational giants. This will hit those groups of people in China which have little in the way of wealth. His main argument is that China is not ready for accession to the WTO. The Chinese economy is not strong enough, and it will be the poorest classes that will have to pay a heavy price in the form of unemployment and social insecurity. This book attracted a certain amount of attention in China when it was published last year. A relevant article was published in the journal belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the book received many positive reviews.</p>
<p class="contents">The second book is known in English as <span class="italic">China in the Shadow of Globalisation</span> and constitutes a warning to the effect that accession to the WTO might cause China to split into five parts. That is one of the things that the Chinese leaders fear most. The fact that the chaos which might result from accession to the WTO could lead to the division of the country touches a sensitive point in China’s understanding of itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the fact that China is not a democracy and, to put it mildly, does not allow complete freedom of expression, and despite the fact that the Chinese government is in favour of accession to the WTO, a book of this type was nonetheless allowed to be published. That means that there is uneasiness, considerable uneasiness, in Chinese society. This uneasiness is, in all likelihood, about the possible consequences within the governing party, too. You only have to log on to the Internet. There are many web sites: <span class="italic">China Online</span>, <span class="italic">South China Morning Post</span> and such like. There is a lot of information about what different commentators, including those outside China, believe might happen because of accession to the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">China Online</span> reported, for example, in August of this year, that approximately 18 per cent of the total number of employees within the State sector are estimated to be surplus to requirements. It is said that they will be still more surplus to requirements following accession to the WTO. Unemployment in city areas is already estimated at over 15 per cent. This report from <span class="italic">China Online</span> also maintains that unemployment will increase further in connection with accession to the WTO. The prospects for new jobs are very limited because those who are made redundant are often older, unqualified workers. According to <span class="italic">China Online</span>, an estimated 30% of the agricultural labour force is surplus to requirements, meaning that 120 million farmers will have to look for jobs in the cities. Agriculture was one of the most important areas raised by China in the negotiations. China received certain concessions. Many commentators still believe, however, that accession will lead to enormous changes in the countryside and have enormous consequences when China is opened up to imports of food and agricultural products from, for example, the United States. China has nine hundred million people employed within agriculture. The Chinese government itself, which does not exactly exaggerate the difficulties, estimates that, because of cheaper grain imports, 9.7 million farmers will lose their jobs within seven years of Beijing joining the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">I could go on at length quoting and referring to different sources indicating the difficulties for China, but I think these examples suffice. The point of the quotations is that I, again, wanted to emphasise how odd I think it is that the Commission should be presenting the Council and Parliament with a document in which there is <span class="italic">not a single word</span> to suggest that accession to the WTO might lead to difficulties in the world’s most heavily populated country. That is an odd information policy, in my opinion. China’s accession to the WTO may, of course, lead to problems for ourselves, too, if stability in China is seriously undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">What conclusions do I draw, then? I do not draw the conclusion that we must say ‘no’. Even if China is not a democracy in our sense of the word, I think it would be unreasonable for us to try to assume the responsibilities of the Chinese government and say that, what the Chinese government has judged to be correct might, in actual fact, be wrong. Nonetheless, I believe that we should be aware of the fact that we are embarking upon an incredibly risky game. It places great demands upon European companies to be responsible and not misuse the opportunities they are given when they now go into China with the freedom granted to them by the latter’s membership of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this serious criticism and these serious misgivings, I naturally recommend that we vote in favour of China’s membership.</p>
<p class="contents">I only have a small amount of speaking time left to devote to Taiwan. That was intentional, because Taiwan is in a quite different situation. Taiwan is a developed modern democracy, a developed modern market economy and industrial state and the world’s tenth largest trading power. I cannot see any real problems with Taiwan’s accession to the WTO. We are concerned there, with an entirely different set of problems with which no comparison can be drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Taiwan will be accorded a local collective agreement with China and become a member the day after China has become a member. I have no comment other than that we naturally ought to vote in favour of Taiwan’s membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, we think it is of fundamental importance that the European Union should take an extremely responsible attitude when facing this momentous challenge for the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The People’s Republic of China’s accession to the World Trade Organisation will have repercussions in China itself, as we have already seen. They have now had many years to prepare for and take control of the possible consequences. There will also be significant repercussions for the European Union: I am aware, for example, of what could happen to us with regard to agriculture. There will also be repercussions for the functioning of the World Trade Organisation, which is going to be completely restructured, although it must be said that this is already a matter of some urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, although we are aware of the whole range of problems, dangers and possibilities that this accession brings, our group supports these two proposals without reservation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The history of the creation of the World Trade Organisation can be traced back a long way, to a time when the Second World War had left a trail of destruction in its wake and there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what shape peace would take in the future. The key elements for a peaceful world, and this was as clear then as it is now, are freedom, security and stability, democracy and human rights. We have used these basic principles to lay the ghosts of the past in Western Europe and finally bring about an era of peace of which, in my view, we can be proud. But we have to defend this peace anew every day, a painful lesson each and every one of us now has to learn.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are on the threshold of major enlargement of the European Union. In a few years, we shall live in a Europe which can be an area of stability and freedom. But how shall we achieve this? </p>
<p class="contents">We shall achieve it through integration. Integration means inclusion, unification, political, as well as economic, completion. I do not think anyone disputes the fact that this is an absolutely winning recipe for peaceful development and that this does not just apply to Europe. Other parts of the world have not been blessed with peace in the last 50 years. The Cold War was synonymous with conflict and discord for numerous regions in the world. We must bear this in mind if we are to understand the significance, today, of an organisation, such as, the WTO. Here, too, the watchword is integration. The more countries commit themselves to the peaceful principles of trade, the more stable and peaceful the world can become.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I expressly welcome the accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO. For the same reason, I also welcome the accession of Taiwan to the World Trade Organisation. We want to integrate, not leave part of the world standing on the doorstep.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has clearly formulated the important objectives in its strategy on Asia. Political dialogue with the People's Republic of China should be stepped up, the transition to an open society should be supported and China should be further integrated into the global economy. This last objective is now within reach. Only with China, both the People's Republic and Taiwan, will the WTO become a real world trade organisation. I can assure you that we shall not lose sight of the other objectives and I would also stress that this includes dialogue about human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The numerous negative aspects of China's accession to the WTO, which you choose to identify in your explanatory statement, Mr Gahrton, cannot be supported by us in the PPE-DE Group in their present one-sided and, in my view, somewhat disproportionate wording. I think the advantages to all sides of these accessions outweigh the disadvantages. The award of the 2008 Olympic Games to Beijing became as acute a topic of discussion as the accession to the WTO is now. But I am positive that we are on the right path, the path of integration, not segregation, the path of inclusion, not isolation, the path, I trust, towards a more peaceful world, which we need, today, more than ever. We are still in shock from the horror of 11 September. And that is another reason to stand together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course we welcome China and Taiwan, because I think we should be pleased, as the previous speaker said, that China and Taiwan are joining. A whole host of reforms is being initiated, as the Commission has rightly pointed out. For the rest, China will take up a key position within the WTO and this will also bring about considerable changes for the West. I am fairly certain that this will present the Commission with further challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, we are supporting the accession of China with considerable funds and I think we should do more here. For the first time, Parliament has been consulted. This is a result of excellent collaboration with the Commission and, of course, with the Council. But I have one thing to say to Mr Gahrton: it is true that accession to the WTO is not without its opponents in China. But I think that to overemphasise this in the report without, at the same time, trusting in the fact that China is more than capable of evaluating whether or not it is in a position to cope with accession is to underestimate China's capabilities considerably. I rather think that the doomsday scenario which you have conjured up in your report is highly exaggerated. I would like to see you evaluate matters in a somewhat fairer and more balanced manner in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission submitted the accession conditions to you for your opinion. I would like to thank the House, in particular, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the rapporteur, Mr Gahrton, for your willingness to treat this subject as a priority. If you accept the recommendation of your rapporteur, the Union will be in a position to give the green light to China’s accession at the next Ministerial Conference of the WTO, which, as you know, will take place in Doha on 9-13 November.</p>
<p class="contents">The documents you have been issued with, will have informed you of all the technical elements of the negotiation. I will not return to them today, but I would like to share with you some thoughts of a more political nature, at the same time giving my reaction to Mr Gahrton’s document and speech; they both warrant it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, firstly, like to stress the special nature of negotiations for accession to the WTO and try to correct the impression – created by your report, Mr Gahrton – that it is something which we have handled in an excessively unilateral fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">An accession to the WTO is not negotiated within a traditional multilateral framework, where concessions are made on the basis of the principle of reciprocity. On the contrary, in an accession negotiation, at least to the WTO (I say that prudently, since this seat was occupied by Günter Verheugen less than an hour ago), a country puts itself forward as a candidate to join a club whose members have already negotiated commitments amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate country must therefore pay for entry into that club by offering commitments in terms of access to markets which reflect what the members have already accepted amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions your report points out, and with a degree of reproach which has not escaped me, the positive tone taken by the Commission to describe the results we have achieved after fifteen years of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if, contrary to what the report says, the Commission’s report is not jubilant, I nevertheless believe that we can be satisfied with these results as a job well done.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task was primarily to defend the interests of the Union in these negotiations, and that is what we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case, however, that this agreement is not some kind of unilateral victory for the Union, which is something, if I have understood correctly, that you rather reproach us for. If there has been any victory, I am tempted to say that it is a multilateral one, since it is the multilateral system as a whole which has been strengthened as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot claim that the WTO has a global vocation if it excludes a country which represents more than 20% of the world’s population. The issue was not, therefore, <span class="italic">whether </span>China should join the WTO, but rather <span class="italic">when</span>. Well, after fifteen long years of negotiations, the different parties involved, China and its trading partners, have reached the conclusion that that time has arrived. One of the Union’s main objectives was that these negotiations should lead to a strengthening of the multilateral system. It was therefore necessary for China to accept what we could describe as the multilateral <span class="italic">acquis</span>, and I will not make any controversial parallel here either, in other words, the advances made within the framework of GATT and then the WTO over the last half a century. We have ensured that the level of Chinese commitments offers this guarantee. But this accession to the WTO is also a victory for China, since we believe it to be an essential condition if she is to continue her exceptional economic development. Chinese external trade has increased by an average of 15% per year over the last twenty years. It is, therefore, literally an explosion. And accession to the WTO ensures China a stable framework for her commercial policy by guaranteeing the outlets which are crucial to her. Her status as a member will also allow her to defend her commercial interests by participating fully in the round of negotiations. At the end of the day it is clear that accession to the WTO is only one element, perhaps an essential one, but, nevertheless, only one element in the reform process launched by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 and continued by his successors. More than an end in itself, accession is a consequence of these past reforms and a springboard for new reforms to come. The justification for these reforms does not lie in accession to the WTO, and I feel that it would probably be presumptuous to try to distinguish between, what would result from accession itself, and, what is connected to the reform process taking place in China. This close connection between the timetable for internal reforms and accession to the WTO has been recognised by China’s trading partners, the Union, in particular, by means of the acceptance of transitional periods for the implementation of certain obligations. In fact, our objective was more the eventual result rather than the speed with which that result comes about. Mr Gahrton, you referred to two works which stress the dangers which may arise in China as a result of accession to the WTO in terms of regional tensions or social problems. I do not believe that these problems are being underestimated by the Chinese authorities, whose fundamental political objective seems to me, to be to guarantee the stability and integrity of their country. From the conversations I have had with them, I understand that China sees accession to the WTO as an essential element in the continuation of these twenty years of reforms, and, therefore, a continuation of this growth which has allowed internal tensions to be kept under control, here or there. China’s per capita GDP has multiplied by four over these twenty years. This is therefore a classic, if specific, case of the relationship between commerce and development. We all know, and I have often said to you, that commercial liberalisation is a good thing, as long as it is accompanied by the means to translate growth into sustainable development, that is to say, internal social and environmental policies, without which the beneficial effects of commercial liberalisation are not enjoyed. From this point or view, we believe that China’s accession promotes that type of better internal policy. I believe that this accession will strengthen the rule of law in China. The fundamental principles of transparency, non-discrimination, efficient administration and independent judicial control, which are included in the <span class="italic">acquis</span> of the WTO, will contribute, we believe, to the positive evolution of China’s economic, legal and social systems. In any event, for our part, we have been concerned, throughout the process of negotiations, to propose progressive measures which will prevent any particular section of the Chinese economy from being exposed to foreign competition overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to insist on the fact that the result of these negotiations is balanced. It is true that we have defended European interests, and our document to Council and Parliament reflects that strategy. No, we have not ignored the consequences for China and for the WTO. Yes, accession will have a positive impact in terms of the quest for economic development in China, and therefore on the quest for internal reforms. In any event, it is the Chinese themselves who have chosen to integrate themselves into the international economy, and so much the better. At the same time we can only rejoice at the fact that, for the first time, Taiwan is becoming a full member of an international organisation, in a way which reflects its economic development and its status as an industrialised country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by saying to the House that these two results are due to the wisdom of my predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, who had made these two accessions one of the priorities of the Union’s commercial policy. All I have done is finish the work which he had largely and judiciously started. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
