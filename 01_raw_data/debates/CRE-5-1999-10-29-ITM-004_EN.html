<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langenhagen (PPE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputy rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his capacity as rapporteur, Mr Cunha has called on me to present his report. The Protocol to the EU-Angola fisheries agreement, as mentioned, already expired on 2 May this year. A new Protocol was signed by both parties. This Protocol laid down the technical and financial conditions whereby Community ships are permitted to fish in Angolan waters in the period from 3 May 1999 to 2 May 2000. Apart from the extremely short period of validity of the Protocol, one year instead of three, and the fact that the tuna quota was increased, the Protocol is identical to the previous one.</p>
<p class="contents">This Protocol is significant for the EU, however, from the budgetary viewpoint alone. EUR 10.3 million is already a large sum in itself, and we do not even have a guarantee that we can interrupt payments in the event that Angola stipulates a closed season for shrimp fishing. Moreover, we are not making the most of our fishing entitlement, with the exception of tuna vessels where 100% of permitted capacity is taken up. Only 63% of shrimp vessel capacity is taken, and 0% of dredger capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">We also must give serious consideration to the funds allocated to scientific programmes (EUR 1.7 million), training (EUR 1 million) and studies (EUR 350,000). There is no clause authorising the Commission to check whether these funds are used correctly. For their part, the Angolan authorities are not obliged to account for how the funds are used. In this area, the rapporteur recommends that all payments under the agreement should be dealt with by the Angolan Central Bank. This is valid for reasons of security and transparency, especially as Angola is still in a state of war.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission made a sound choice in concluding a protocol with only a one year duration because Angolan fish stocks have been exploited intensively over recent years, particularly by the Soviet fleet, which has led to a spectacular drop in catch levels. We have also heard that, as a result, licences will not be distributed to shipowners belonging to the EU. If we consider the repercussions of this, we could conclude that fishing in Angolan waters is a rather risky matter as far as the EU is concerned. Nevertheless, as the rapporteur says, we can be optimistic. The number of tuna vessels and surface longliners has increased. This is generally a reliable indicator of the state of deep-sea stocks, and so can be viewed positively. However, the Protocol does not contain any international standards regarding the conservation and rationing of fish stocks. Having a closed season is certainly an effective means of preserving fish stocks, and this has been borne out in practical and scientific terms. An international framework is necessary, however, otherwise the fear remains that Angola could abuse the close season to the detriment of the EU. The Commission has to ensure in this regard that shipowners are informed in good time, i.e. at least three months in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusions are as follows: The negotiations are obviously important. The current political situation in Angola is deplorable, all the more so given the fact that it is fundamentally a potentially rich and geopolitically important country. What the Protocol lacks, however, is precise information on the state of fish stocks in Angola. The Committee on Fisheries has submitted the appropriate amendments so as to obtain this information.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we are not in a position to talk about a new fisheries agreement. The results of the negotiations should be supported however and should serve as a basis for a comprehensive Protocol or a new fisheries agreement in the future. In return, the rapporteur expects Angola to observe the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and to improve its budgetary procedure in connection with financing the expenditure arising from this fisheries agreement, which is extremely important as far as we are concerned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are in total agreement with this solution. On the one hand, it allows fishing to continue, within the framework of an agreement whose formulation has been generally satisfactory to both parties and which has presented no apparent problems.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, this Protocol provides a natural step towards the signing of the new agreement, which could be under threat given the political situation in the country and the possible presence of other fleets in the event that the European Union were absent from the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Another piece of good news is the increase in fishing opportunities for the tuna fleet, whose number of ships has almost doubled, which indicates the more than healthy state of the fish resources in those waters.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the maintenance of fishing relations with Angola is, at the moment, of great importance and the least the European Union can do is to help a country which is traditionally closely connected to certain Community areas and which is enduring worrying political and economic times. There is no doubt that financial compensation is an important form of support but, nevertheless, the presence of the European fleet contributes to a greater sense of stability in the area, which can only be beneficial to international relations with Angola.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the presence of the Community brings a more responsible form of fishing to the area and may be an important factor in terms of balance given the presence of other fleets, particularly the Russian fleet, not to mention the aid to scientific research programmes which is included in this Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, and in the hope that, as Mr Cunha’s report requests, the Commission will inform this Parliament of the result of the application of this Protocol, our group, Mr President, calls for the approval of the Cunha report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both Mrs Langenhagen and Mrs Fraga have summarised the content of this agreement. It has been pointed out that it is not a new agreement, but rather an extension of the previous agreement which, in reality, was signed in 1987 and which the Community inherited from a previous agreement between Spain and Angola. With regard to its importance, it is perhaps not one of the most important, but it is a useful agreement, both for the European Union and for Angola, as Mrs Fraga has highlighted. This type of agreement – as long as they conserve biological resources, that is, they do not lead to over-fishing – also benefits those countries in which such activity is carried out, both through the financial contribution of the European Union, and through the aid which is provided, for example, in the field of professional training and scientific research.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission is doing good work, but our main concern at the moment is the maintenance of fishing activity and, specifically, activity which does not lead to over-fishing, but rather the conservation of natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, in the amendments which the Committee on Fisheries has presented, asks the Commission to pursue the matter, to inform Parliament and the Council, at least three months before the expiry of the agreement, so that its continuation may be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to insist on the usefulness of the agreement, both for Angola and for the European Union, and we hope that the Commission will make the necessary effort so that this agreement may remain in force in the years to come.</p>

Today we are being asked to review a similar agreement with Angola.</p>
<p class="contents">In my brief but eventful career as an MEP, and particularly after yesterday, I have noted a willingness of this Assembly which dares to call itself a “parliament” to act as a rubber stamp for the Commission and again I sense that this is our role. But if this Assembly is to begin to behave as a proper review body with any teeth it must begin to ask some fundamental questions about the whole principle behind these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Such evidence as we have about their operation indicates that these have been responsible for conservation disasters of the first magnitude. Effectively, an example of colonialist exploitation of the peoples of the Third World which should shame everyone in our supposedly civilised one.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past seven years the taxpayers of the European Union have paid out EUR 1.4 billion to the governments and elsewhere and, even in the neutral words of the Commission, it is difficult to trace where the money goes. Yet all this is to fund Spanish and Portuguese fishermen, giving them a licence to pillage Third World waters, often in flagrant disregard of the basic principles of fisheries conservation. We know from Morocco what despair this has aroused among local fishermen as they see immense damage being done to their fish stocks, simply to provide European markets with sardines and other common species on which their own livelihoods depend. The horror of what is happening down the west coast of Africa was illustrated a few years ago by Namibia. In the end it said it had had enough, so devastating was the impact of Spanish fishing there.</p>
<p class="contents">It is about time that we in this House said that we have had enough of it all. The result of these policies has been a conservation disaster. In fact the whole thing, it seems to me, is an insane catastrophe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to this report, I would like to point out that the fisheries agreement with Angola means a continuation of the common fisheries policy of the European Union with regard to international fisheries agreements, which contribute to the consolidation of one of the fundamental pillars of said policy. This was pointed out by Mr Crampton’s report to this Parliament in the previous legislature, this report stating that these agreements were a fundamental condition in the effort to reduce the commercial deficit in the European Union in the field of fishing, in fish supply and in order to protect direct and indirect employment in the fishing sector and in the industries related to fishing in the European regions which are heavily dependent on it. This was approved here during the last legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Cunha report on the conclusion of a new Protocol which defines the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the agreement with the Republic of Angola for the period from 3 May 1999 to 2 May 2000, I would like to point out that this is a classic Protocol, which allows for access to fishing resources during a certain period and sets a financial contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that certain information and statistics must be borne in mind, and the Commission has promised to be very strict about this, and also bearing in mind the delicate situation that that country is in – it is in a state of war – we believe that the conclusion of this provisional Protocol is very positive, in the hope that it will be renewed for a year or that a new agreement will be reached. This is a very important country geopolitically, with a very considerable potential wealth and which the European Union has to support, clearly helping it to put an end to the serious situation which it is in. But it must help in the best way possible for both parties: Angola, on the one hand, and the Member States of the European Union and the regions involved in fishing, on the other, with the control of this Parliament and in accordance with the amendments which the Committee on Fisheries has presented with regard to this important Agreement which has, as has just been pointed out here, a considerable political dimension, as well as economic and financial dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, on this question and with regard to fisheries agreements in general, as was demonstrated yesterday in the important debate which we held in relation to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, you will always enjoy the favourable, generally majority, opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, and I hope that you will continue to enjoy the favourable opinion of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am doing so for economic reasons, which have already been explained by several speakers in this Chamber but, as in yesterday’s debate on the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco, also in order to help a country that is rich in natural resources, but which remains poor due to its political situation, and particularly its on-going civil war. This is why I think it important to see this agreement, in addition to the economic benefits that it brings to one of our country’s industries, also as assisting the development of an economic sector, as well as the consolidation of peace in Angola. </p>
<p class="contents">We agree that we must be vigilant in the way this agreement is implemented, specifically in the way funds are spent. Vigilance is also necessary in order to ensure the preservation of species and the sustainability of fishing. However, we would like to point out, Mr President, that although the words exploitation and cooperation have the same ending, there is quite a difference between them; cooperation means both parties cooperating when they are in agreement, and we do not believe that Angola sees any kind of exploitation in this agreement, otherwise they would not have renewed it the day after it expired. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until tuna fishing is extended, this Protocol certainly assumes the potential catch quotas of the previous Protocol for the years 1996 to 1999 as well as the appendices thereto. It must also be emphasised, as a number of speakers have already said, that the Protocol is only valid for one year and more than half of this period has already lapsed in any case. This year, however, the Community and Angola will be able to redefine the future framework of their fishing relations, as has been proposed by Angola. We should therefore use this time.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Community is paying Angola in return for the catching opportunities afforded under the Protocol and the contribution which Community shipowners pay in the form of duties have also remained at the same level as previously. The financial consideration therefore corresponds pro rata for one year to the sum established in the previous Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Parliament’s amendments are concerned, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to assure the Committee on Fisheries that the Commission, as has been the case in the past, will inform Parliament in the appropriate manner as regards the implementation of the Protocol. We should, however, choose the most suitable form for this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
