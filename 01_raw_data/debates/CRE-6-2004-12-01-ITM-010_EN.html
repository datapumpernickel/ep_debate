<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Council</span>. – Mr President, let me start by saying that I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you the situation in Ukraine after the presidential elections and the state of the relations between the EU and Ukraine. Five weeks ago I said that Ukraine was at a crossroads, with presidential elections which would determine the direction Ukraine is going during the next four years. We have all seen what happened since then. And I think that we all agree that the elections of 31 October and 21 November were not free or fair and did not live up to international standards. Javier Solana explained that message to your Foreign Affairs Committee last Wednesday. I will explain what we have done since then, how we see the current situation and what steps should be taken next.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has not stood by and watched. Before the elections, we called on the Ukrainian authorities, through telephone calls and otherwise, to ensure the elections were free and fair. Immediately after the elections the presidency issued a declaration, on the basis of the report by the OSCE/ODIHR, expressing its concern about the election process. On the same day, Monday 22 November, the Ukrainian Ambassadors in all EU capitals were summoned to receive this message. This was, as you know, in line with the Council Conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">On 24 November the presidency asked Ambassador Biegman to go as its special envoy to Kiev, where he was joined later by Javier Solana, in order to stimulate a dialogue between all parties. That day, we also expressed our regret about the fact that the Central Election Committee made the results of the elections public and declared Mr Yanukovich the winner of the elections, despite the large number of complaints about the election process. That regret concerned the procedure and the timing, not the winner or the loser.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency was pleased that the Supreme Court of Ukraine on Wednesday decided to take the complaints on the election results into consideration and blocked the official confirmation and publication of the election results, thereby stopping the process of installing a new President.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent days the EU has been in very close contact with the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the US and Russia, since solving the situation in Ukraine requires a concerted effort and sending a similar message to the Ukrainians. Prime Minister Balkenende, in his capacity of President of the European Council, has been working behind the scenes constantly. In his conversations with President Kuchma, Mr Lytvyn, the Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament, and others, he has underlined the EU’s position, including the EU’s call on all sides to show restraint and to express themselves in a non-violent manner. Foreign Minister Bot has talked to, amongst others, his US, Russian and Ukrainian counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, High Representative Javier Solana and the personal representative of the EU Presidency ambassador, Mr Biegman, are also fully engaged in helping to solve the crisis. In fact, as we speak they are both in Kiev for a second time to try to reduce the political tensions caused by the discussion about possible autonomy and hence a possible split in Ukraine. Polish President Kwaśniewski, as chair of the Council of Europe, and Lithuanian President Adamkus are also in Kiev to contribute to finding a solution for this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also worried about signals that the parties would not talk to each other any more. Therefore, more recently the presidency has called on all parties to meet again as they did during the round-table talks on 26 November this year and to live up to the agreements made there. Respecting the unity of Ukraine is essential to a peaceful solution to the conflict. We have made it clear that any use of force is to be condemned and that the European Union is willing to continue to play a supportive role in the resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we see the way ahead in this situation of political tension and a potential further rift within the Ukrainian society? The current situation requires a political answer which fits in with Ukrainian legislation and which respects the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Any solution should ensure that the Ukrainian electoral system regains the trust of the Ukrainian people. We have to make sure that the people trust that the outcome of the process reflects their will. Frankly speaking, I do not see how all the complaints that have been filed on the second round of elections can be solved so that the outcome of this round of elections is ultimately acceptable to all. In such a case, a new, second round of elections may be the only way out. We then have to ensure that they are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner, with a level playing field for all candidates across Ukraine. This requires sufficient international and local observers, media that can freely report on the election campaign and people who can vote truly freely, without outside pressure. This applies to the whole election process, from the start – when the candidates present themselves – to the final tallying by the Central Election Committee. It requires a situation where the most hotly contested issues, such as absentee balloting and local election observers, are addressed beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to discuss individual persons. It is not the EU’s position to support one candidate over the other. What the EU’s position <span class="italic">is</span> about – and we have insisted on this from the very start – is that the process should be transparent, free and fair, so that the Ukrainian people can trust that the outcome of the elections reflects their will. Only then can we ensure that the new President is the President of all Ukrainian citizens, and not just of those from the east or from the west. That way, territorial integrity will also be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis in Ukraine does not require just the EU to act. It requires an involvement from all international players, such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the US and Russia. Ukraine is not only an important neighbour of the EU, it is also probably the most important neighbour of Russia. That is why the presidency has stayed in close contact with the Russian authorities and why it was discussed at the EU-Russia Summit. We both support the Ukrainians in their search for a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people, ensures the territorial integrity of Ukraine and contributes in the long run to a stable, free and prosperous Ukraine under a President of all Ukrainian citizens. We should not support one candidate over another; we should support the achievement of democratic standards characterised by transparent procedures and legal recourse. In addition to an electoral process that cannot be trusted, there is another possible cause that might create a decisive rift in Ukrainian society. That is a situation where violence or force takes over from the legal, constitutional process. Therefore, together, we have put severe pressure on all involved to refrain from violence or the use of force.</p>
<p class="contents">The coming days will be crucial for Ukraine and for the relationship between the EU and Ukraine. With our engagement, we want Ukraine to succeed as a strategic and democratic neighbour. We want to cooperate with Ukraine in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, with shared democratic values at its base. The presidency understands the European Parliament’s hesitance to discuss the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan for Ukraine in the current situation. Like the European Parliament, the Council will reflect on its policy in the light of further developments. But I think we all want to engage Ukraine in a closer and more intense relationship. The potential is there. As a start, Ukraine has to deliver on democratic values. Therefore, in closing, I say that we should express our support to all those on both sides who are peacefully and democratically expressing their views and their political aspirations. We urge the people of Ukraine to work together with the international community to resolve the current political crisis. We have to find a solution that ensures that Ukrainians can trust that their will is reflected; a solution away from violence and the use of force, and one which guarantees that the territorial integrity of Ukraine is maintained; in short, a solution which is acceptable to all Ukrainians. Let us hope that together we can help Ukraine to do so.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrero-Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that I too want to firmly advocate a non-violent solution in Ukraine, and I would like to follow on from what Mr Nicolaï has said today about the situation there. I might add that the Commission was constantly involved in all these efforts at mediation, and that it too, of course, has been very concerned from the outset about the evident disregard of fundamental democratic principles in the latest Presidential elections. It is clear from the OSCE Electoral Observation Mission’s reports of grave and really systematic irregularities that the results as officially announced do not correspond to what the Ukrainian electorate wanted, and it follows that the EU as a whole, and hence also the Commission, cannot accept the results of the elections.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members will be aware that this is the position adopted by the Ukrainian parliament too, in a resolution passed by an overwhelming majority. There was therefore no mistaking the message from the European Union that the democratic decision of the Ukrainian people had to be adhered to. At the same time, of course, we have to engage in active crisis management if a peaceful resolution of this crisis is to be achieved – I can endorse what Mr Nicolaï has already said. Ambassador Biegman was despatched to Ukraine to take initial soundings as to what might be done. He then had these discussions on 25 November – as this is well-known, I will not discuss it at length – and it was on this basis that the first conciliation mission was sent, which involved Poland’s President Kwaśniewksi, Lithuania’s President Adamkus and the High Representative Javier Solana seeking out facts and, of course, engaging in constant dialogue. The Secretary-General of the OSCE, Mr Kubiš was also involved, and that, I believe, was very important.</p>
<p class="contents">These conversations, and Ambassador Biegman’s preliminary discussions, produced the first alternatives and first potential solutions, a process in which a re-run of the run-off presented itself more and more as a probable way out. The Ukrainian parliament also voted for a re-run of the second round of elections. Moreover, as you will be aware, Yushchenko has gone to the Supreme Court to contest the election results. As Mr Nicolaï has already said, it is of the essence that there be a political solution to the problem. While a political solution is admittedly not yet in sight, the second Round Table has now begun. There is no agreement among its participants on whether there should be a completely new second round of the elections or whether new elections should be held in only a few districts. Support for Mr Yanukovych, the Prime Minister, is in any case declining, as became evident in the Ukrainian parliament this morning, where members adopted a motion of no confidence in his government, which they did by an overwhelming majority of 228 votes in favour, one against and three abstentions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I take the view that two fundamental principles are essential if there is to be a solution. The first is that democracy must be safeguarded. The people of Ukraine must be free to take decisions on their country’s future. This is not, then, about taking the side of one candidate or about intervening in a dispute about the practicalities of an election; what is at stake is, quite simply, the defence of recognised democratic principles. The second is that we need stability, both in Ukraine itself and in terms of its territorial integrity. Ukraine must remain intact as a viable state. Dividing the country would result in a grave crisis, hence the statements that all of us – that is, the various European institutions – have made about territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">Just before this debate, I spoke with Mr Tarasyuk, the former foreign minister, who is present in the visitors’ gallery. He assured me that it would not be from the opposition that the first move towards violence would come. What that means is that they want a peaceful solution, and that is what we too are working towards.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to consider two issues that have arisen over and over again in the past few days and are hanging over us: have we – that is, the European Union – done enough to help Ukraine move to democracy and to a market economy? I believe that we have. We have done what we could. For a start, the EU is not just the largest donor to Ukraine, having, since 1991, allocated over EUR 1 billion to it under TACIS and other programmes, much of which was – and is continuing to be – used for programmes promoting democratisation, institutional reforms and human rights initiatives; it has also always offered Ukraine a specific and clear perspective. Since 1991, and particularly since the entry into force of the partnership and cooperation agreement in 1998, we have stepped up our cooperation in many areas, giving particular support to economic and social reforms. A particular feature of that is your House’s dialogue with the Ukrainian parliament. Now, as part of the European neighbourhood policy, we want to considerably build up this partnership. You will be aware that the object of the European neighbourhood policy is to establish a ring of friends around the enlarged Union. The action plans devised for this offer each and every partner a perspective that is ambitious, but above all tailor-made. They contain, for example, joint actions on justice, energy and environmental issues and strengthened trading relations, that is to say, an opportunity to play a part in the internal market, and, ultimately, partial integration into it, that is to say participation in what we call the four freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the issue of Ukraine’s accession to the EU does not at present arise, we have made it clear that we are not shutting any doors. I will also say loud and clear what Mr Nicolaï has already said, namely that the quality of our partnership depends, of course, on the quality of democracy in Ukraine. It is precisely because the EU has a strong interest in relations with Ukraine that we expect from it an ongoing commitment to European values.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This morning, the Commission did of course discuss what plans of action we have for Ukraine, and these plans of action are very definitely on the agenda for the next meeting of the Commission. We will of course be closely monitoring developments in Ukraine, and will be coming to a decision next week. In so doing, we will of course, take full account of Parliament’s position, and so I am very interested in what your views are on this issue. The Commission will continue to implement the measures that are already in place in support of democracy and civil society, of which the general public are of course the main beneficiaries. I believe we are sending exactly the right message in support of the popular struggle for the establishment of fundamental democratic values. I can tell you right now that, as soon as the Ukraine decides to repeat the elections in a way that really does adhere to democratic criteria, we will bring European instruments into play to support them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is of course Ukraine that has responsibility for the elections being properly conducted, but, at the same time, it is crucial that the OSCE’s recommendations be acted on in organising and administering them if renewed irregularities are to be prevented. What that means in particular is that both the electoral legislation and the practical conduct of the elections must be substantially improved. There is also a need to ensure fair reporting in the media, and we can already see the first small improvements in reporting by the electronic media. The Commission is currently examining to what extent our rapid response mechanism and other resources can be used to support this election process, as they were in support of the Georgian electoral authorities in January 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Images from every corner of Ukraine show us how millions of Ukrainians are living out their fundamental democratic freedoms under adverse and tragic conditions. These images remind us all of the non-violent citizens’ movements of 1989, which made it possible for the division of the continent of Europe to be overcome. The European Union and all its European citizens are solidly behind Ukraine. The European Commission, too, will continue to do everything it can in this historic process of transformation in order to be able to work closely with Ukraine. When it comes to promoting and exporting stability and Europe’s fundamental principles, the European neighbourhood policy is an essential instrument.</p>

Let me draw the House’s attention to the fact that we are witnessing an unprecedented revolution in Ukraine. A vibrant, true democracy is being born before our very eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost a quarter of a century ago similar events took place in the Gdansk shipyard where Solidarność was born. Then as today they captivated the minds of the whole of Europe. We are all watching the emergence of true civil society. People are raising their heads and, just as in 1980, they do so against all the odds. Then the response of most European democracies was clear. The message then was that the people on the other side of the Iron Curtain had a right to freedom. Just as then, all the political families in the European Parliament stand united in their unequivocal support for democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">We all stand together in our condemnation of manipulation and electoral fraud. Our support is for democracy, and not for a particular candidate or party. On democracy there can be no divisions among us. Today we are all Ukrainians. We all speak the same language, as is shown by the resolution on Ukraine – jointly agreed by all groups. This is the language of democracy, human rights and freedom. We owe that to Ukrainian society and to its nascent democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few days ago Ukraine seemed a distant place. Today we understand Ukraine better and feel closer to the country, which is one of our most important neighbours. Ukrainian society has shown us not only its political maturity, but also its adherence to our common European values. Undoubtedly one of the most important missions of the European Union is to promote democracy and the rule of law. The Union does so, as the Treaty says, by placing individual rights and freedoms at the heart of its activities. We cannot stand idly by when human dignity and democracy is trampled upon.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot recognise the results of the second round of elections in Ukraine, which were manipulated and falsified. We cannot accept the disregard of the wishes of the people of Ukraine. We have to reject all allegations that, by expressing its support for the Ukrainian people’s right to exercise democratic rights, the European Union is encouraging violence. On the contrary, we appeal for a peaceful solution and dialogue. All neighbours carry a great duty of responsibility as regards the situation in Ukraine, including Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Our duty is to act. We are bound to call on the Ukrainian authorities to cancel the second round of the presidential elections and to organise a rerun of the second round, but not new elections that would eliminate current candidates. This should be done before the end of the year and under the full scrutiny of international observers. The European Union and other international bodies should do everything to guarantee full transparency of the electoral process, which should meet all democratic standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We look with hope to the role played by the Ukrainian Parliament, Supreme Court, international mediators and the free media. The EU should use all means to secure the democratic character of the elections. We should envisage two scenarios. The first negative, meaning violation of democracy and the eventual introduction of sanctions against the undemocratic regime. The second positive, meaning generous assistance and a helping hand if democracy wins in Ukraine. The European Parliament should also strongly encourage safeguarding of the country’s integrity, carried out in a peaceful manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the Council’s and Commission’s assessment of Ukraine as a key neighbour and partner. If the rerun of the second round of the presidential elections meets international standards, we should ask the Council and the Commission to speed up implementation of the action plan for Ukraine and, as a priority, to focus on the development of civil society. If Ukraine takes a positive step towards democracy, we should do more, act more quickly, and consider giving more relevance and true content to our new neighbourhood policy towards Ukraine and a new impulse to our eastern policy under the CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">We should move beyond rhetoric. Let us multiply the links between the European Union and Ukraine in all possible areas – education, culture, entrepreneurship, trade, investment, to name just a few.</p>
<p class="contents">If realities on the ground allow, we should grant Ukraine the status of a market economy and more access to our markets. We should also allow for more flexibility in the visa system. These concrete moves will constitute the best recipe for strengthening the emerging democracy on the doorstep of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should express – and not only verbally – our solidarity with the Ukrainian people. We should keep doors open to Ukraine’s European aspirations. If democracy prevails in Ukraine, it will be a triumph of values which are enshrined in all our European constitutional charters.</p>
<p class="contents">I end by saying in Ukrainian, perhaps for the first time in this House: <span class="italic">‘</span>Європейсъкий парламент<span class="italic"> </span>вітає демократію в Україні!’ – the European Parliament greets democracy in Ukraine.</p>

Commissioner, we have had a hand in somewhat extending the time you had to prepare yourself for your new office, but that had nothing to do with you. By way of a word of welcome, let me tell you that you are for all of us the Commissioner for Foreign Relations of the whole European Union, and we offer you our constructive cooperation in the hope that it will reinforce peace in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There are fine moments to be had in this House, and I have just enjoyed one of them. The applause for Mr Saryusz-Wolski, who has just spoken, shows that we are united. Speaking on behalf of our Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I can say that, when peace and democracy are at stake, when it comes to peaceful coexistence and the securing of fundamental citizens’ rights, which the state must guarantee if it is to deserve to be described as a democracy, then we are all on the same side, and that is one of the good things about Europe. Over and above the gulfs that separate us in other respects, there are things we all want, and we Social Democrats are quite clear in our own minds what those things are: fundamental citizens’ rights, fundamental citizens’ freedoms, above all else the unrestricted right to vote, the sovereign right to determine who runs the state – all that is traditional European democracy. I agree with Mr Saryusz-Wolski that, if the Ukrainians are now on the move towards this model of democracy, they will need more than anything else the help of the most successful model of multinational democracy in the world – that being the European Union, in defence of which we in this House should be united!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Discussing these things in the European Parliament is, of course, a straightforward matter; things are much more difficult in Kiev and in the countryside, and there are two crucial factors that must define the roles of all who are currently actively involved, both those based in Ukraine and with responsibilities in that country, and those whom we have sent there, where they act on our behalf. I have not been there, nor am I going there – a delegation from our group is going there today and will assuredly get a much clearer impression than we will – but, when I see these pictures, it becomes clear to me that what there is on the ground is such a mass movement, with the power of the state on the one side colliding with the popular will on the other, that it will be very difficult to steer and direct it, and there is little distance to be covered between a peaceful solution and a bloodbath. This is a responsibility to be assumed by all – by those who bear responsibility in Ukraine, and by those who remind them what their responsibility is. What we need is a peaceful solution, one that will make the people sovereign while maintaining the country’s unity. I might add that that is not only in the Ukrainians’ interests, but also in our own most essential interest. For Europe too, a divided, fragmented or destabilised Ukraine would be fatal.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, we take pride in the fact that the European Union is conducting conciliatory dialogues on the ground, and we see this as an opportunity. It also shows that it is not the European Union alone that gives itself important tasks, but that it is also sought out as a partner in dialogue and accepted as a mediator. I take pride in the fact that our friends Javier Solana and Aleksander Kwaśniewski are playing key roles in negotiating between the parties – the involvement of the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Relations and the President of Poland is a good sign, for President Kwaśniewski, as you so rightly said, represents a country that has successfully been through this process, and Javier Solana was once a minister in a country – and a member of a party – both of which had freed themselves from a dictatorship. So we now have two men in the thick of things who can draw on their own experience in making an important contribution towards the Ukraine adopting and realising what we describe as a European model of democracy. So we Social Democrats too can address the Ukrainians and say: welcome to the democratic family of peoples!</p>

The European Parliament’s donning of the colour orange today will go down in European history. This House is facing its defining moment, which will decide the role of the European Parliament in the Europe of the future. I should like to express my great satisfaction at the fact that the European Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament have been united in their positions on an issue as important as Ukraine. Parliament was actually the first to understand the significance of the colour orange in Europe. In 1981, the Congress of Warsaw Trade Unions, held in Gdansk, home to the Solidarity Trade Union, appealed to working people all over the world, and particularly in the Soviet Union. This bore fruit, and today the colour orange reminds us of the solidarity that is at the basis of Europe’s existence.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a connection between the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, the Rose Revolution in Georgia and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. The issue at stake here is freedom, and Europe’s future depends on the concept of freedom. What is it we want at present? I would like the Polish Parliament’s voice to be heard, as it was the first to give an official welcome to a representative of the Ukrainian opposition, and to protest at the lies. I would like the European Parliament to state clearly today that it will not accept lies or deceit, and that it will not recognise the elections. I would also like it to make clear its expectation that truth and the principle of the rule of law will be victorious in Ukraine as well, and that no one can override this principle by means of violence. In view of this, I would like the European Parliament to express its solidarity with those waiting in the cold on the streets of Kiev for results acceptable to them. Let me add that we expect the political negotiations under way in Kiev, with the participation of Europe’s major institutions, such as the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, will deliver a solution that restores freedom. Finally, I should like to say that Ukraine has opened itself up to Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must open itself up to Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having had many meetings and conversations in Kiev, my impression is that violence is not being threatened by those who have pitched their tents in the city’s streets, or by those who have been demonstrating there for ten days and upwards. If there is the threat of violence, it comes from the former powers, and of that problem we must be aware if we are going there.</p>
<p class="contents">Just what does crisis management mean in this situation? Crisis management can in fact only mean an attempt on our part to bring into being what these orange revolutionaries, who are indeed far more than a Yushchenko party, are calling for. What that means in plain language is that the run-off election must be repeated, that the re-run must be in December and no later, and that adequate provision must be made for the election to be observed. Having failed to cover ourselves with glory when observing the last election, we Europeans really must get much more involved this time.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think it important that Mr Saryusz-Wolski said that Ukraine had seemed a long way away. That was self-criticism on his part, and I think we Europeans should be self-critical today. I am glad that Members from Poland and other countries in the East that already, thank God, belong to the European Union, are being more far-sighted about policy on Ukraine than the rest of the EU. For that, Mr Geremek, I am very grateful to you and to others, and I am proud of what you have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So much of our discussion of the Ukraine focuses on interests. Again and again, I hear people talking about Putin’s interests, about Russia’s interests, about American interests, about Europeans’ interests and about geostrategic interests, but, since coming back from Kiev, what I find lacking is any understanding, at the end of the day, among ourselves, that this mass movement in Ukraine is, at the moment, about the Ukrainians’ interests. If we do not put that centre stage in the debate and in our diplomacy, there is a very great risk of failure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that we are setting out this very evening and that this joint delegation of the European Parliament has at last been put together. I had hoped it would come to pass last weekend, but better late than never. What I brought away with me from last weekend – and I think that will be our common experience – was that, after all our debates about European values and where in the world they are being realised, it does you a power of good to spend a few days in Kiev, for that, if anywhere in Europe, is where you can really feel that Europe shares a soul. I hope that the delegation we are sending there will be what you want, what all the Members of this House want, and that we will be able to put flesh on the core demand – to which I referred at the outset – of the wearers of orange, the pressure from whom we too have needed.</p>

<p class="contents">Overcoming fatalism and fear, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens are demonstrating their demand for change, with calm determination. Their movement has gradually won over large sections of their parliament, the army, the media, and even, so it would appear, the Supreme Court. That sea change has taken place because the Kuchma regime has, over the years, given rise to an increasingly broad opposition that now in fact contains differing schools of thought on the country’s future. It is worth recalling that the regime’s drift towards authoritarianism got under way when the prime minister’s name was not Yanukovich, but Yushchenko. Nevertheless, a number of European leaders, usually western, have long considered the President of Ukraine as an ally to be treated with kid gloves. As recently as last year, President Bush, for example, apparently put his trust in the incumbent regime to defend democracy in the Middle East with him, by saluting Mr Kuchma’s decision to send troops to Iraq. All of these elements should help us to water down certain democratic declarations of faith and to avoid any simplistic and Manichaean view of the reality of Ukrainian politics.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me that the great challenge now is to ensure that what is intrinsically good news for democracy is not in fact transformed into a tragedy for the Ukrainian people, by resulting if not in the partition of the country, then at least in renewed stirrings of nationalism and a resurgence of splits down ethnic lines, which would take us back to the periods of the Russian or Austro-Hungarian empires. Accordingly, I find it somewhat archaic, not to mention irresponsible, to interpret the Ukraine crisis as a tug-of-war between the West and Russia and as something of a European take on the struggle between good and evil.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of Ukraine’s history, such an approach may only exacerbate the split between the two main sections of the country. It does not in any way address the interests of the Ukrainian people, particularly the population from the western part of the country, which is highly reliant on the rest of the country given that cross-border trade has been in a state of collapse since Ukraine’s neighbours joined the EU. Neither does it address the interests of the EU; the more we are committed to fostering an economic dynamic in Ukraine through our mediation, the more we have everything to lose from the destabilisation of such an economically and politically fragile country and, on a broader scale, region. We should let Paul Wolfowitz retain his imperial vision of Europe; he said, and I quote, ‘the objective of a complete and free Europe will not be achieved until Ukraine has become a full Member of Europe and joined NATO’. From our point of view, we would be best advised to avoid exerting any pressure of that nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Once fresh elections have been held in Ukraine – this, at least, is what we hope will happen – in other words, once the entire country’s legitimate representative has been appointed completely transparently, the time will have come to start calm political dialogue with both the authorities and society itself; dialogue that would not pit new relations with the EU against the particular relations between Russia and Ukraine, but would, instead, be aimed at developing a perspective that all sections of Ukrainian society can identify with. This is yet another real-life test of our ability to implement a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crowds in Kiev who are demonstrating in favour of normality and justice, and who retain their calm and their dignity, rightly deserve our admiration. We all pray that, unlike in the past, it will be the Ukrainians alone who decide their future. Whilst enthusiasm is a positive thing, however, blindness certainly is not. There is a tendency to oversimplify the situation in Ukraine – one side is presented as completely black and the other completely white. When we decide to give democracy lessons and speak of standards, we must ensure that that democracy applies across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">We rightly condemn one side for not complying with the basic rules on holding free elections, yet I have Internet pages in my hand, taken from a Ukrainian newspaper, denouncing, a few days ago, an election document distributed in Western Ukraine by some supporters of Yushchenko. Under the heading ‘Ukraine for the Ukrainians’, the article says that ‘the election of Viktor Yushchenko guarantees us the installation of a national dictatorship... Let us chase the Muscovites, the Polacks and the Jews out of our lands... Our power will be terrible for the Muscovites, the Jews and the Poles who refuse to adopt our faith, etc.’. If Parliament turns a blind eye to such incitement to hatred, then we will be made to look ridiculous. If we preach morality to some, we must also preach it to others. Let us be clear about this, I do not suspect for one moment that the vast majority of Ukrainians think this way, but history teaches us that particularly aggressive minorities can take power and confiscate from whole peoples the fruits of their just uprising. The British delegation in Helsinki has also reported a number of racist statements made by Yushchenko supporters.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore sincerely hope that my Ukrainian brothers, for whom I feel special affection, elect the President of their choice. I also hope, however, that that President does not fall into the trap of discriminating against national or religious minorities, and let us hope that no more foreign countries meddle in Ukraine’s internal affairs. I am a Member of the Independence and Democracy Group, so I say long live independent and democratic Ukraine! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the same vein, I believe the events I witnessed during my ten-day stay in Ukraine give me the right to say that at present the capital of Europe is not in Brussels or in Strasbourg, but in Kiev, as it is in Kiev that millions of our Ukrainian brothers are fighting for the most basic of European values.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud and moved today to see so many Members of this House, on both the Left and the Right, uniting to defend basic European values such as freedom and democracy. I should like to add that the fact that the colour orange can be seen today on both the Left and the Right does not mean that we support only one candidate, or that we are interfering in Ukraine’s domestic affairs. We do not wish to interfere in the electoral process under way in Ukraine. We do, however, want to make it quite clear that if we are to be proud of this European Union and of this European Parliament of ours, there can be no question of condoning electoral fraud or of allowing force, violence and lies to deprive the Ukrainian people of their freedom and of the right to elect their own president.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that today’s statements by the Council and the Commission and Parliament’s motion for a resolution, despite being a compromise, will be a clear sign that irrespective of the political differences that divide us, Europeans are sending out the unequivocal message that Europe’s goal is freedom and democracy in Ukraine. I should also like to add that statements that have unfortunately been repeated in this House, to the effect that President Yushchenko’s supporters included chauvinists or nationalists, are lies and loathsome provocation, and it is a shame that Members of this House are prepared to be party to such provocation. I spent ten days on the streets of Kiev and stood among crowds of people fighting for freedom, and not once did I hear a single person insulting Russians, Poles or Jews. I should like to tell the Members of this House who are concerned about anti-Semitism in Ukraine that they should turn their attention to anti-Semitism in Poland, where it is much more widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to add that tomorrow’s vote will provide us with an opportunity to send a very clear signal to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters, namely that Europe is opening its doors to them. Let us hope that it will not be long before we meet in a united Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to demonstrate our solidarity with those who are in the cold fighting for democracy. We must demonstrate our solidarity today, and also in the days to come, when Ukraine might no longer be so fashionable. Democracy is something we take for granted, although many of the nations represented here have only enjoyed it for a short while. This is why we wish to show our understanding and solidarity, and I say this as a representative of a country in which the concept of solidarity has a special meaning. Lech Wałęsa’s journey to Ukraine on a mission of solidarity was proof of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there any way today of reversing what has happened, namely the rigging of elections? Yes, there is. This was proven in Serbia four years ago and in Georgia one year ago, when those who allegedly lost the elections were ultimately victorious and came to power. Today we stand shoulder to shoulder with the EU’s closest neighbour. Yet we should admit our own mistakes, as the European Union is also to blame for what has happened, given that it failed to provide Ukraine with a clear signal this year that we are expecting it and that we trust it will meet the required standards. Before the first round of the elections, Europe failed to tell President Kuchma that we were watching his actions closely. After the irregularities of the first round Europe thumped the table, but failed to utter even a murmur of protest.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that a number of nations are paying close attention to the EU’s relations with Ukraine, and that in future years these nations will provide us and themselves with an answer to the question of whether they want democracy and civil freedoms. Finally, I should like to refer to a Polish saying that suggests: ‘if you don’t know how to behave, be on your best behaviour,’ and commend it to the Commission and Council representatives who have experienced major problems this year in adopting a position on Ukraine. Mr President, I should like to say that I am proud to be a Member of the European Parliament, which is redeeming Europe’s honour today through its position on Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ever since 1990, we have seen a change in Europe, with the peoples of Europe possessing the right to determine their own destiny, and that right must not again be jeopardised through interference from outside or manipulation from within. That is what this is about. It is not about one or other candidate; it is about this European Parliament taking the side of democracy and wanting to give the people the chance to say what they want to say. I believe we have thorough and careful work to do in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the message to Ukraine must be that a president who rigs elections in order to legitimise his power has no credibility on the international stage. That also means that we will have to do some thinking about the neighbourhood programme. I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for having suspended the action programme, and, in view of the way things are developing in Ukraine, we will have to consider what is to be done about that country. I would also encourage you to be bolder than your predecessor was. Over the last two of three years, or so I believe, it was not enough to send Ukraine the message that we took it seriously and regarded it as an important partner in dialogue. I think there were those here in Brussels and in the national capitals who failed to state their position clearly, and that is why we are in this situation. That is something we should do better now, if we still have the chance to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It is here, if we have the imagination to do it, that a European Economic Area and much else can be brought into play in order to open up new perspectives. If we are to send a delegation to Ukraine, it must be made clear that what we are aiming for is the unity of the country, with no violence being used, and the continuation of the dialogue between the various parties, and that we have to ensure that the electoral legislation is amended, and the second round of the election – but only the second round – repeated. Anything else would be yet another manipulation intended to deny the leader of the opposition the chance of an election victory. That also means, though, that both sides must summon up the willingness to cooperate with us and with Russia equally; this must not, however, be the product of the desire for revenge, but must be characterised by respect for both sides if it is to help bring reconciliation to the Ukrainian people.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to greet Mr Tarasyuk, who once shared with me the chairmanship of the inter-parliamentary delegation, and whom I know as a champion of reforms in his country. The reason for the political crisis in Ukraine is the violation of democracy. The elections did not meet democratic standards. There was no balanced campaign, the electorate was intimidated and fraud was committed in various ways. That is unacceptable. It follows that we reject the result of the second round of the presidential elections. What is central in this issue is the right of the people of Ukraine to make up their own minds in an open and transparent, democratic process. We side with everyone in the Ukraine who stands up for their democratic rights. We must, first and foremost, find a way out, a political and peaceful solution to the situation that has arisen. The EU must deploy all diplomatic means in order to help bring this about.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a greater challenge yet, for this political crisis does not stand on its own. The outcome of the elections will have a great impact on the EU’s relations with Ukraine, either in the positive or negative sense. The only satisfactory solution to the crisis is that justice be done to democratic principles and to the will of the Ukrainian people. The outcome of the elections was also rejected by the Ukrainian parliament. The solution is to re-stage the second round of the elections with the close involvement of international observers, ensuring that this third round takes place under circumstances that are totally different from those under which the first and second rounds were held, a situation in which democratic standards are, of course, respected under the close observation of the international community. We call on everyone to cooperate in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic aspirations of the people of Ukraine are unmistakable and receive our unqualified support. The people’s involvement is evident from the scale of the demonstrations. I would express my great appreciation and admiration for the protesters in the cities of the Ukraine who argue in favour of the recovery of democracy. The situation in that country is tense, though, and we would call on both the opposition and the authorities to preserve the non-violent nature of the actions and to prevent the situation from escalating. If the authorities were to decide on using violence against the peaceful protesters, this will, in our view, immediately impact on relations with the European Union. Similarly, the division of the country, for which some appear to be pressing, will engender a fresh, much more serious crisis and would not in any way contribute to a satisfactory solution. Moreover, this ambition gives a false representation of the current state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">What lies at the heart of the matter is the violation of democratic standards, and not the fact that there is a geographical division in the support for the candidates. Neither is this about Ukraine’s choice between the European Union and Russia. On account of its location, economy and history, Ukraine will always need to maintain in-depth relations with both. Although today’s debate is not about our relationship with Russia, Russia <span class="italic">is</span> an important factor in the issue and, unfortunately, adopts a slightly different stance in this respect. Last week, Mr Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister and President of the Council, on behalf of the presidency, expressed very clearly the contrasts between Europe and Russia, and on that we congratulate him. It is, nevertheless, of major importance that Russia be involved in the way in which the crisis is solved and that the Kremlin’s support be sought for the staging of another second round of the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe benefits greatly from stable governments in all its neighbouring countries. On account of its size and location, Ukraine is a crucial partner. The European Union must offer scope for the accelerated strengthening of political and economic cooperation. Needless to say, the EU and Ukraine can only cooperate in a more concrete form if a satisfactory and democratic solution has been found for the present crisis. In my view, the debate in question should produce a better response to the European aspirations of Ukraine than has been the case to date. I think that not so much this Parliament, but certainly the Commission and the Council have avoided the response to that question over the past few years and like Mr Brok, I am not that impressed with the EU’s commitment to Ukraine in recent years. We now have a different Commission, though, and that opens up new opportunities. Today, we stand united in the reaction to the crisis. I trust that once the crisis has been resolved, hopefully in the positive sense, we can start taking concerted action along with Ukraine and with better policy than has been adopted so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many Members of this House have personal experience of what it means to live under authoritarian regimes and of what it is like to have to fight for democratic rights. Many of these countries are now members of the European Union, a fact that exemplifies what can happen when people are allowed to choose their own path.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole world has been impressed by the democratic national festivities that we now see on the streets and in the squares of Ukraine, in which hundreds of thousands of people are braving the snow and the cold and, in a cheerful, peaceful and well-organised way, are demonstrating in pursuit of their rights. We are firmly behind the supporters of democracy and, as many have said, this is proved by the fact that we are all wearing orange scarves.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Ukrainian people, we reject this election that has been surrounded by so much cheating, harassment of journalists, lies, buying of votes and other factors that really are out of place in free elections. We support the demand for a second round of elections under quite different circumstances. It was pleasing to hear from the Commissioner about the degree to which Europe intends to be a helpful presence in the event of a second set of elections, and it is to be hoped that this commitment will also continue in the same way and with the same vigour after the elections, however they may turn out.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address the representatives of the Ukrainian Parliament, if they are still here, and let them know that the message from this House to the effect that the Ukrainian people, like all other peoples, are entitled to enjoy freedom and democracy and to shape their own freedom has the support of this House across the political spectrum. We support you in your struggle. Good luck!</p>

I feel that the dynamic at work in Ukraine itself should be brought to the fore. Entire sections of Ukrainian society are collapsing, with journalists, intellectuals, civil society, the authorities and the institutions all claiming their right to free speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, I feel it is useful to highlight the fact that the mobilisation of civil society has enriched and probably increased the effectiveness and coherence of EU action to address this situation. It is also true that we are starting to dream that the EU can take a similarly coherent and effective stance in other EU-neighbouring countries where the will of civil society is stifled by authoritarian and autocratic leaders. This is, for that matter, what the EU is doing with the countries in question, on the basis of common values and commitments. This should be emphasised, as should the extent to which this approach differs from that of Russia and differs from what is already happening in that country, where calumny prevails in all of the State-monopolised media. We are indeed entitled to feel much more concerned about democracy today in Russia than about the future of democracy in Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The correct result of these elections must be put on the table – on that we agree. No matter how this election may have turned out, though, the main thing it shows is that Ukraine is deeply divided – territorially, politically and ethnically. This division is to a substantial degree the result of international interference going back long before this election and very much to the detriment of the Ukrainian people. Mr Putin gave his favoured candidate massive backing and wasted no time in congratulating him on his victory. In his own country, the Russian president is doing away with elections for the heads of the Russian regions, some of which are no smaller than the whole of Ukraine. President Bush is concerned and criticises the way the election was conducted, seemingly having forgotten the grave doubts about the propriety of his first election and the numerous complaints about his second. Innumerable advisors have given logistical support to the opposition in Ukraine. For months, this election has been dressed up as a choice of direction – with Russia or with Europe, as if Russia were not itself part of Europe to a substantial degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine, however, cannot throw itself into the arms of one single ally. If it wants to resolve its serious economic and social problems, the right thing for it must be a good relationship with all its neighbours, both new and old, and this it must be allowed to build up under whichever President, without empty promises, admonitory finger-wagging or unconcealed arm-twisting. The people of Ukraine must take their decisions democratically and independently, and they will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Shoulder to shoulder with the United States of America, the European Union should aspire to review in the short term the outrageous electoral deception of the <span class="italic">ancien régime</span> in Ukraine. All credit to the Dutch Presidency, incidentally, for its efforts to date and also for the stance adopted by our new Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, the Union must also draw conclusions from the current dramatic situation in Kiev. Why should we not give Ukraine the prospect of membership when we would do the same for Turkey, which is – let us face it – a non-European country? That appears to me to be an untenable, and in any event harmful, position.</p>
<p class="contents">The doom scenarios about the collapse of, or even a civil war in, Ukraine have been concocted by the actual losers of the ballot both inside and outside Ukraine. Would President Putin actually put Russia’s relationship with the United States and the European Union on the line for a Ukrainian President who has no credibility either inside or outside Ukraine? That appears too irrational to be true. Precisely a week ago, a Ukrainian author urged that ‘more urgently than ever, we need the moral and political support of the democracies in the world, because if we gamble away the democratic Ukraine today, you can forget about your self-congratulatory and conflict-free Europe as soon as tomorrow’.

The Ukrainian people reject the Belarussian model, which is a source of shame for Europe, and also the variant of democracy that is subservient to the President of Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the outcome of the electoral crisis may be, Ukraine will never be the same again. The demand by a wide section of society for its rights is mobilising society to take action not only in respect of the stolen election results, but also against corruption and oligarchical capitalism, and is forging a clear understanding of the choice for a democratic future for Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Following an invitation from the Ukrainian Parliament, I was able to follow the course of the Ukrainian presidential elections in person. I unequivocally agree with the conclusion reached by the international observers that the elections were fraudulent. The ruling politico-economic elite is preventing the Ukrainian people from democratically electing their president. The disinformation about the opposition candidate that poured out of the government-controlled mass media chimed exactly with the assessments broadcast by the mass media under the control of the President of Russia. In the eastern part of Ukraine, it was precisely the Russian media that played a decisive role in turning society there against the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has invested considerable resources into the campaign of the Ukrainian Government’s candidate. This included the direct intervention of the President of Russia himself. This clearly shows Russia’s fear that its policy in the region is under threat. The victory of democracy in Ukraine would threaten the Russian-sponsored stability in Belarus and the amnesia regarding Moldova. The victory of democracy in Ukraine would mobilise democratic forces in Russia itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukrainian society has come to the defence of its decision. Now it is the turn of the democratic world – the European Union first of all. The European Union must make it clearly understood that those who fail to observe democratic principles and fail to abide by the law cannot be partners of the European Union. The same restrictions must apply to them as have been introduced against Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine is a European country, and the people on the streets of Ukraine have proved that an absolute majority of them have chosen democracy and the rule of law. Those are concepts that unite the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine has become a focus of world attention. It must become a focus of the European Union’s attention. Ukraine must be given the opportunity of joining the European Union. Starting to open up such an opportunity would be an enormously stabilising influence on the democratic process in Ukraine.</p>

The peaceful orange revolution currently under way in Kiev has a great deal in common with the ‘rose revolution’ which brought President Saakashvili to power in Georgia exactly one year ago. He was then democratically elected by a huge majority in January 2004. Mr Saakashvili, whom I was able to meet in Tbilisi a few days ago, is leading Georgia towards a path of renewal, growth and development, within a healthy, pluralist context of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in November 2003, however, the people’s verdict had been overturned through the vote-rigging arranged by ex-President Eduard Shevardnadze, who was then driven out by a popular uprising, which, apart from anything else, took place without bloodshed. Today the story is being repeated and, as all the international observers, including those from Europe, have confirmed, the Ukrainian people’s decision has been blatantly altered and misrepresented through obvious, flagrant irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the Ukrainian Parliament, the Rada, has passed a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Yanukovich. Although this action in itself is not binding from a legal point of view, it does have a great intrinsic symbolic and political value and confirms the success of the popular pressure that has been exerted in recent days. We must not allow Europe to remain deaf and dumb to all this. Let Europe make its voice heard in that country, which lies so close to our borders, so that the tensions there do not degenerate into civil war or an escalation of violence, and so that all those young people can at last be heard. The young citizens who courageously and proudly wave orange flags or Georgian flags demand and hope for a future of peace, justice, the rule of law, democracy and freedom – a new, different page of history. Let us here in Parliament raise a cry of solidarity with the demonstrators in Kiev: today we are all Ukrainians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was personally deeply moved by the faith of the young Ukrainians in that square in a free, democratic and European-value Ukraine in the future, and their belief that justice, through people power, will ultimately triumph.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that they were cheated of their election result and the choice of a president of their own desire, but we in the western world cannot be neutral over a large European country struggling between a future as a potential EU and NATO Member State – a democratic one at that – and a powerful clique of corrupt, post-Soviet, anti-democratic authoritarians willing to steal the election, through fraud if necessary, under the tutelage of Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome today’s vote of no confidence by the Parliament of Ukraine, which has distinguished itself as the only body that is generally reflecting the views of the people. I call on Prime Minister Yanukovich and his government, who unlawfully used the state’s resources to further their campaign, to resign forthwith and on Mr Yanukovich to fight the election as a private citizen, to ensure free, fair and transparent elections on a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent calls by eastern apparatchiks to split Ukraine in half is highly cynical in a country which in 1991 voted overwhelmingly for a unitary state. This agenda is designed to produce immunity from criminal prosecution for electoral and other frauds, as well as to ensure that the Donetsk oligarchs, who have accumulated massive wealth which funded Mr Yanukovich’s campaign, are not open to challenge or scrutiny and that they are not subject to confiscation of some of the dodgy privatisations that have occurred in Ukraine in the last couple of years.</p>

<p class="contents">Leaving aside this repetition of Soviet rhetoric about Solidarność, he does have an important point, which I would like to make here again today. The new Members feel acutely, both negatively and positively, the course of events in Ukraine today. Just as the founding Members of the EU recall the experiences that led to the establishment of the Union, so too we recall what was done to us and why for so many decades we could not join the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">We recall the sham elections in the three Baltic countries in 1940, when for instance, like Mr Putin's congratulatory call to Mr Yanukovich even before the announcement of preliminary results, Latvia's sham election results were accidentally published the day before they took place. We recall only too well the rigged elections after the war in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. We have seen this before and we know what comes of it. But we have seen the other side as well, how tens and hundreds of thousands of people come together peacefully to state their solidarity with democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw this with Solidarność in Gdansk and Warsaw and with Charter 77 in Prague; we saw it in the streets of Berlin and we saw it in the singing revolutions of the Baltic countries. In other words we know what is going on, we have seen it before. The 75 million people who became EU citizens this March are experiencing 'déja vu'. Our understanding of these events, our empirical knowledge, must not be dismissed by those who lack the knowledge or understanding of what this means.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Yastrzhembsky, but I fear also some in the West, would paint the new Members' direct experience and knowledge as something that gets in the way of relations with Russia or that threatens illusions about what is going on in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">We recall those in the West who said we should be careful with Solidarność, it might upset Brezhnev. We recall Western politicians who said the Baltic countries should not seek independence lest it threaten Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not here to take sides in a political contest between candidates and parties in Ukraine, but I do take a stand against manipulation of elections. </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot say no to the Ukrainians because we are afraid of losing investments or markets in Russia. Democrats always try to find the Aristotelian golden mean, even in politics, but there is no middle ground between the truth and a lie, between democracy and its all too many opponents.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall be honest and admit that this was not what I expected. After seeing how rapidly the European Union took immediate action to send Javier Solana, Aleksander Kwaśniewski and President Adamkus to Ukraine three days after the rigged elections, I felt for the first time that accession to the European Union had been worthwhile, and that we are now part of a group able to stand up for a defenceless nation that is struggling to achieve independence and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my heartfelt thanks for this. Up until now, such a rapid reaction could only be expected from the United States, or at least that was the case in our country, Poland. I am delighted that this time the European Union was able to act more swiftly and effectively. The European Union is now acting as mediator in the conflict in Ukraine. As an observer of the presidential elections in Ukraine, I should like to share an observation with this House. The crowd of people on Independence Square last Saturday numbered one million. This number included many Poles, as the Polish people remember the explosive emergence of the Solidarity movement in 1980, and realise that history is currently repeating in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a great many Georgians and Georgian flags on Independence Square, as Georgians are aware that recent events in their own country are being re-enacted in Ukraine. Yet there are also huge numbers of other young people who have travelled to Independence Square, Russian and Belarussian students, for example, The latter are anxious to experience in Kiev, albeit briefly, the freedom denied them in their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that if the European Union supports the emerging democracy and civil society in Ukraine, it will in so doing ensure that democratic principles prevail in the whole of the East and in the whole of the area to the east of Ukraine and to the east of the European Union. This is not about the division of spheres of influence. It is about democratic principles, which, after all, we would all like to be enforced to the same degree throughout geographical Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that I will travel to Kiev tomorrow as part of a delegation, I should like to call on this House to adopt the amendment I shall now read out, tabled by myself and Mr Geremek. This amendment calls on the Ukrainian Government to refrain from exerting any pressure on the media, and in particular on the public media, in order to ensure that the Ukrainian people are provided with objective and impartial information on the candidates and the situation in their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, therefore, very important for everyone now to show solidarity. Our support for democracy today in Ukraine also sends out a signal to the dictator of Belarus.

Yet this is a very good day for the European Parliament, as we are expressing our opinions on issues of the utmost importance to the European Union. We are discussing our largest neighbour, which has a border of 700 km with the European Union. The EU’s 25 Member States are experiencing problems relating to social apathy, yet there is a country in Europe in which electoral turnout is almost 80%. In that same country, several hundred thousand people have been standing in the cold for ten days in many towns, demanding the right to free and honest elections. After ten days, the people of Ukraine are now becoming impatient, and there can be no doubt that they are also exhausted.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is up to us, the international community, to take the initiative by bringing pressure to bear on those in power and by calling for fair elections. We should adopt a clear stance on this issue. In my opinion, four key principles must be upheld. The first is that those in power should avoid any kind of solution by force. The second is that Ukraine’s territorial integrity should be maintained. The third is that the second round of elections should be held again, with OSCE monitoring and an electoral law preventing widespread irregularities such as voting away from one’s place of residence. Fourthly, the candidates should have equal access to the media. We appear to have already forgotten that this was our key principle even before the first round of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also things we must demand of ourselves. For example, observers are needed, and in far greater numbers than previously. A thousand observers from the 25 EU Member States, the European Commission and the European Parliament are needed for the next round of elections. I ask for this figure to be agreed on, for the costs to be shared and for an appropriate number of observers to be sent. This will prove that we are genuinely opening up to Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We call for the ballot to be repeated and express our solidarity with all Ukrainians, with the whole Ukrainian people. We are not here to support either Mr Yushchenko or Mr Yanukovich, who have both, moreover, been heads of the Ukrainian Government; nor are we here to push for the partitioning of Ukraine between the East and the West, but to guarantee the territorial integrity of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I find this contrast between the good guys and the bad guys rather nauseating. Who are we to say that the democratic good guys are the Kiev students and the bad guys are the miners coming to protest in Kiev? We need to make a non-simplistic interpretation of what is happening in Ukraine. Unfortunately, Ukraine is already a geographically divided country, in which the Russian population makes up 33% of the total population. In view of these figures – which are similar to those we find in Iraq, where the Sunni population makes up 33% of the total Iraqi population – we need to find a political solution that seeks to hold the two parts together and allows the president who is to be elected – and we want to see him elected in a democratic election – to be president of the whole country.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger now is not just that the country may split, Mr President, but that there may be civil war. I have the feeling that the spirit of Yalta is perilously alive in this Parliament and that the only objective is to drag all or part of Ukraine into the western sphere of influence. I do not agree with that. The strength and the responsibility of the European Union is not to fight for the causes of the West but to fight for the cause of democracy and to play a part in helping the President of Ukraine to be truly the president of the whole Ukrainian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been the rapporteur for Ukraine on behalf of the Council of Europe. What is happening today is nothing new: the same rigging of elections, curbing of the press, depriving people of their rights took place then. It is a pity that continual reports about shortcomings in establishing the rule of law and transparent society have not been taken at their face value in the West.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years hopes were cherished that in due time and with patience all problems would be overcome. The opposite has happened: policies of accommodation and attempts to keep post-Communist rulers as good allies at the cost of turning a blind eye to gross violations of democratic rules have brought about a dramatic worsening of the situation. The EU also has to share responsibility for not reacting in time and for not clearly taking the side of genuinely democratic forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, the Ukrainian people have given us a lesson. Now there is not a minute to lose. Some still argue for declarations in support of democracy but say let us be prudent and not offend anybody, let us not aggravate the situation further by taking sides. It is right that we should not take the side of a particular candidate – that is the exclusive right of the Ukrainian people. However, look around this Chamber and you can see that we have taken sides – look at the orange colours. It is our duty.

<p class="contents">In Ukraine, just as in Russia, oligarchic cliques have seized power and produced a criminal state with the blessing of the International Monetary Fund. What is happening in Moscow is not to anyone’s liking, but hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in the West to pull Georgia, Belarus and Ukraine away from Russian influence. That is the truth, and the ideals of freedom and democracy have little to do with it: 49 million Ukrainians are the victims of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Victor Yushchenko and Yulia Timoshenko are no more champions of democracy than Victor Yanukovich: both are in fact the children of Leonid Kuchma. It is obvious that Vladimir Putin’s Russia wants to reassemble a few pieces of greater Russia, and that is no less legitimate than wanting to pull Ukraine into the West. The question is whether it happens with or against the will of the peoples concerned. It will be very difficult to keep all Ukrainians in a new Galicia and it may end in bloodshed. Mr Yanukovich has proposed a compromise which at least buys some time to prevent a clash. Mr Yushchenko has rejected it.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, Mr Putin’s strategic design will be in tatters without Ukraine and, clearly, Mr Putin will not give up easily. If anyone is perhaps thinking of forcing him to do so, they should think of the consequences, which would be a serious blow to the future of European-Russian relations. I do not believe Europe should venture along that path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not all of our neighbours, though, can accede to the European Union. As early as when we take our decision in December, we will have to consider the European Union’s capacity for accepting new members, and so we need to come to some clearer conclusions about our European neighbourhood policy, and that very soon. In her hearing before the committee, the Commissioner was pretty clear about how that was one of her priorities. If that is the case, though, if there is the expectation of coming to Europe, and if we are ready for it, then our response over the last few weeks was inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">That the High Representative was willing to go to Kiev only when this House insisted on it was a mistake on his part. He should have been there before the elections, showing that Europe has an interest in fair elections, and if it is indeed the case – as our fellow-Members tell us – that the Commission had to be asked whether it might not send a larger delegation, whether it was not willing to be more involved in these elections, then that too revealed an oversight, and one that is now a source of great pain to us. Whilst we understand that massive staffs, lots of money and large numbers of personnel are going into the preparations for the Palestinian elections on 9 January, we could have shown the same commitment to one of our immediate neighbours, with its 50 million inhabitants, which wants to be part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that our European neighbourhood policy, with the report that we will be starting to consider in a few weeks’ time, needs to have new life breathed into it. Participation in the internal market, participation in European programmes – we need to be sending out signals now about the many things we can offer.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about thinking in terms of spheres of influence, nor is it anti-Russian, for a democratic Ukraine too will need to maintain good relations with Russia, and we Europeans need to support it in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the obligation of the European Union to remain constant on questions of principle and not to take a selective approach, as certain parties have hastened to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The sole objective must be the contribution of the European Union to a peaceful and democratic solution, by repeating the second round of the presidential elections under conditions of complete freedom, so that Ukraine can get out of the political cul-de-sac and so as to avoid any danger of destabilisation, which would have dramatic consequences for security and peace in Europe. Our message must also be clear to Russia, concerning the avoidance of any action which would complicate the situation. For the European Union, Ukraine cannot be batted back and forth between conflicting interests. It would certainly be a strategic error if the European Union were to be trapped in the dilemma between Europe and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">At this crucial time, the European Union must talk to all the political forces in Ukraine and win the confidence of all the Ukrainian people, not line up behind one side or the other. Our collective stand must be linked to a guarantee of the democratic expression of the people and defence of the independence, unity and territorial integrity of the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the recent events in Ukraine it has become evident that Europe is definitely larger than many people had previously believed it to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the harsh eastern winter, the spirit of European democracy is once again decisively on the march. The determination of the demonstrators in Kiev is not an attempt to protect the opposition leader, Mr Yushchenko, but to defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine and to demonstrate their support for the rule of law and a legal state.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support a united Ukraine, a country that is both our partner and a powerful neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not simply a question of the voters deciding between the two candidates. It was, above all, a vote against one of the candidates. They voted against the prime minister, Mr Yanukovich, who, in the eyes of many, represents the oligarchy and a corrupt state.</p>
<p class="contents">It was and still is an uprising of the humiliated and the outraged. An uprising in the name of human pride and dignity. It is an uprising in the name of basic human rights and this is why the men and women of Ukraine deserve not just our support and our solidarity, but our help and our action.</p>
<p class="contents">This resistance by people who have nothing to lose represents a last hope for them just as it does for us. For us it represents, above all, a responsibility to put our European institutions in order.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commissioner, and I would like to make one other point. Ukraine has contributed greatly to democracy and peace. She has given up her nuclear weapons, which was an enormous contribution. Now she deserves to be rewarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should come as no surprise, as the virus of freedom and democracy is extremely contagious and fast-spreading. My own country, Poland, and other Central European countries provide abundant proof of this. They became infected with the disease of democracy and freedom many years ago. Today the impossible is becoming possible in Ukraine, and the Ukrainian people are awakening from their lethargy. Ukrainians are demanding their rights. They no longer wish to be cheated, and they wish to make their own decisions. Before our very eyes, the Ukrainian people are facing one of their most difficult tests, a test of their civil responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet today we too are faced with a test, namely a test of our solidarity. What must we do to come through with flying colours? Firstly, we must speak clearly and plainly about values, and about the values that connect us to the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streets of Kiev. We should speak in the very language used in the motion for a resolution. Secondly, we should dispel myths, including those referred to by Mr Fava, among others. Ukraine is not divided geographically, although there are many today who wish this were the case. Ukraine is divided into those who have shed the yoke of fear and those who have not yet managed to do so. The first should be given political support, and the second should be guaranteed a place in the new Ukraine. Thirdly, the European Union must continue to participate in the political dialogue taking place in Ukraine, as without our international involvement, there is a threat that Ukraine will be faced with the worst possible scenario, namely chaos and fratricidal warfare. This is the most important challenge facing us today. In order to prevent such a disaster, the European Parliament should adopt the motion for a resolution by acclamation and without amendment, and it should be taken to Kiev by the European Parliament’s mission. The Council should support the continuing presence of the High Representative in Kiev, and outline its vision of a European future for Ukraine at the summit in December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have woken up to our responsibility. This is now a question of law, justice and freedom, because Ukraine and the EU share a common future.</p>
<p class="contents">The spread of democracy is our greatest challenge. It is our mission. One day mankind’s weapons should all be trained in the same direction. It will be a long journey, but it is a morally right and just one. At present this is not just about Ukraine: this is also about developments in Russia, which has, quite unexpectedly, got mixed up in the Ukrainian elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s future is closely connected with ours. At present, Moscow is rapidly moving in the wrong direction and away from democracy. If we can steer Ukraine’s development in the right direction, that will also help Moscow make the turn in the right direction itself. We cannot all have different notions about what democracy is. They are universal. We cannot allow Europe and Russia to head off in different directions: Russia must make the turn. On this point we have to remain adamant. The United States of America and the European Union need to work closely together, as there are such huge issues involved here.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud of the Ukrainian democrats. It now remains to be seen whether they will be proud of us for staying adamant about this through to the end. This is a watershed in the development of Ukraine, but also for the EU. It is a historic moment. On one side of the watershed the murky waters of a totalitarian regime flow towards the past, where only the oligarchies and the present administration reap the benefits. On the other side, pure waters, the waters of democracy, flow towards tomorrow, one where the Ukrainian nation can draw strength for a better future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only are various political tendencies united, but so are the Council and Commission. However, I should like to draw your attention to certain truths which we should take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a certain paradox, that often enough we see what is happening far away from us better than what is happening next door. To be quite frank, I was surprised that even before the first round of the elections in Ukraine we were already receiving very many signals that there were violations and that the opposition candidate was not being given the opportunity to campaign openly. We did not react, and it was only when these flagrant injustices manifested themselves in the second round that we all bestirred ourselves. That too is good.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy of the European Union has never been and never will be aggressive, but the European Union is not and cannot be a mere talking shop that dispenses advice. The European Union is a sufficiently strict and powerful political union and that is why the European Union must, at all levels – Council, Commission and Parliament – demonstrate a strict and determined political will. That is why the European Union cannot merely point out the fraud involved in the Ukrainian elections. We cannot pretend that we do not see what forces lie behind the falsification of the Ukrainian elections. Those forces understand only determined and strong policies and actions. Otherwise, we shall have a situation where on one half of the field a game of tennis is being played but on the other a game of rugby.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not mean here simply the European Union and Russia, the West and the East. I am very familiar with Russia, and I know that there are a great many democratic and intelligent people there. Yet the leading tendency is antidemocratic and thirsting for revenge. We must therefore definitely support democracy in Ukraine, analyse the situation that has come about and forecast the future. That is why I agree with my colleague Elmar Brok, that the Council and the Commission must also react very speedily and very determinedly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applies as applied fifteen years ago, and the events will be as decisive for Europe and for the way Europe will look in ten to fifteen years’ time, and subsequently, as were the events of 15 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucially important that we see the serious dimension to the crisis that is playing itself out, in which the old dictatorship is trying to rob the people of its new democracy. We must be on our guard against a repetition of developments that might lead to a new Balkans. The events pose a number of important questions, especially – as Mr Vatanen pointed out – concerning how we go on to view Russia’s own development towards democracy, which is a matter requiring consistency and clarity. The events pose questions as to how we ourselves are to have respect for our own common foreign and security policy, and this is a crucial test in terms of how we are able to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it important for us to act not only on the basis of how serious present events are but also with a view to preventing what, in the worst case, may happen tomorrow and in the months to come and which is something that makes the situation extremely serious and that calls for immediate action. An unambiguous message to Russia and the Ukrainian leadership is required. Our only concerns should be for the Ukrainian people and for democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without any more fear of contradiction, we can state that the abuses that took place during the Ukrainian elections were such that the results are unacceptable. Even Prime Minster Yanukovich himself has asked for the election results to be invalidated, particularly as there was some confusion in the western parts of the country. The leader of the opposition, Mr Yushchenko, and international observers, on the other hand, discovered that there was some confusion in eastern parts. Both, however, agree that the elections were not fair, something that everyone acknowledges.</p>
<p class="contents">The first countries to approve the rigged election results, which include Russia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Belarus, should be the first to take a look in the mirror. I would like to thank the Ukrainian opposition forces for calmly and patiently managing to make the voice of democracy heard in difficult circumstances. The EU should adopt a calm but determined stance on the situation in Ukraine. Our task is to promote democracy and human rights. This we have done in the case of Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Much will be decided in these elections. The elections will decide whether Ukraine is to become a large version of Poland, a western European country with an open attitude towards democracy, or a small version of Russia, which looks to the east and an authoritarian, quasi-democracy. I hope that we in the EU agree which would be preferable. We will nevertheless respect the Ukrainian people’s right of self-determination. As long as the second round of elections is organised democratically and fairly, we have to respect the outcome, whether it accords with our personal opinions or not. If what I personally hope for were to happen and Yushchenko won, the losing party, that is, Yanukovich’s supporters, would not just fade into the background. We have to be able to work closely with them too. The Ukrainian nation is already a very much divided one, and we should not add to or aggravate this division and the policies it relies on. We need to secure a peaceful solution to enable all the Ukrainian people to continue building their society as a united Ukraine based on democracy, human rights, and the EU’s common principles of the rule of law.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted that this is also apparent from the fact that your Parliament is sending a delegation to Ukraine this evening. I think that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and others have made it abundantly clear what part – in many ways an important one – the European Union has played in the developments in Ukraine. Since a few somewhat more critical questions have been raised and comments made, it may be useful to point out that Europe was, of course, in Ukraine before the first round, and had given signals and sent warnings, for example in connection with access to the media during the preparations for the elections. As you know, and I am saying this because there may have been some confusion in this matter, it was after the first round that we took steps, issued our statements and developed our activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view of a number of Members of this House – first expressed by Mr Schulz, but later by Mrs Staniszewska – that this is also a moment to be proud of what the European Union is doing, of the way we are trying to get the democratic model to work outside of Europe. As Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Schulz, Mr Geremek, Mr Kaminski and many others have already stated, it is true that there is broad agreement in your House about what the position is and should be, and that there is also broad agreement with the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Understandably, reference has also been made to the historical significance of what is going on here. Similarities were drawn with, among others, Poland in 1980 and the Commissioner mentioned 1989 in many other former Eastern European countries. Rarely have I heard the Council, the Commission and Parliament speak with one voice to such an extent, because we refuse to accept the results which the central election committee has announced. We demand a new second round for the elections. Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Brok and others did not pull their punches in that respect. We have absolute agreement on this. We all want free, fair and transparent elections, and a peaceful solution which also guarantees Ukraine’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the timing of the new second round of elections, to which reference is made in the resolution, both parties will first need to embark on further consultations. On the one hand, a bit of time is needed to gain an insight into the correct circumstances, for example in relation to provisions to enable sufficient observers to visit that country. On the other hand, I very much understand the concern that the whole process is being dragged out or delaying tactics are being applied. We should not accept this, because everyone, the people of Ukraine in particular, is entitled to have a new President elected in a free and fair manner as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that the size of the observation mission should also attract comment. Allow me, further to a number of remarks on your part, to say that I too hope that the Commission will take initiatives, so that we will have an extensive European Union delegation in that country, obviously in tandem with the OSCE and the Council of Europe, to ensure that the elections will be truly free, transparent and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have, of course, mentioned Russia as the other important partner in these developments, and in that connection I am pleased to inform you that we as presidency will, of course, maintain the very close contacts with Russia and that Mr Balkenende, in his capacity as President of the European Council, phoned Mr Putin again today and that both have concluded on a positive note that there is only one way forward, namely the peaceful solution within the legal framework by means of dialogue. Needless to say, and I am addressing Mr Wiersma and others when I say this, many improvements are needed for those forthcoming elections. I should like to flag one in the first stage in the run-up to new second elections there, namely access to the media for all parties, as we indicated prior to the first round. That should mean that the media should show more examples which herald a bright future under the motto ‘the future is bright, the future is orange’. This time round, orange is not the colour of the Dutch Presidency, because as you know orange is the Dutch national colour. Neither is orange the colour for a certain candidate, as has been remarked by a number of you, but is, as Mr Geremek and other have stated, a colour symbolising solidarity with all Ukrainians who demand free and fair elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rarely can there have been such agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and I hope that is something we can achieve more often. My hope is that, if we speak with one voice, this will also really result in positive action of the kind we have just described and that I do not need to repeat now.</p>
<p class="contents">I did of course listen carefully to your observations, some of which were rather critical, and I would like to consider some of them. Firstly, many of you said that the European Commission or the European Union itself had shown too much of a hands-off attitude when it came, for example, to the observation of elections. To that I would like to say that I was myself President of the OSCE in 2000; we have a major organisation in Europe, which puts a great deal of effort into observing elections. On the ground, there is also ODIHR, which is a very important institution, and I believe that the OSCE should work together with ODIHR and the European Union on a basis of complementarity. In this case, though, it was the OSCE that made these elections its own particular concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I will readily respond to your appeals and have already done some preparatory research. We are more than willing to get involved; we will see how much we can do, and, as I have said, my rapid reaction mechanism contains a number of things, similar to those we used in Georgia, that I can now tell you about. There is a whole range of things that we have been doing for two years already, including projects in support of training, for example the training of local election observers, along with projects for the information of voters and for training the members of local electoral commissions and journalists, and projects relating to the reporting of elections or helping to reform legislation on elections and the media. As you can see, we have been far from inactive, but I do believe that the various institutions in which we all work should complement each other in the work they do.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that it has been said time and time again that Europe did not go far enough and that we too bore some responsibility for Ukraine’s present situation. That is something I really must repudiate. In my former capacity as Austria’s foreign minister, I sought out very close contacts with Ukraine, and I can tell you that the European Union’s partnership and cooperation agreement, which was negotiated above all by the Commission, has, unfortunately, been insufficiently implemented. Over and over again, I really did go to a lot of trouble about this and told people that they had to do something themselves. I believe that the time has now come to put this neighbourhood policy really centre stage in my policy, and that is what I intend to do; it goes without saying that what we do about the action plans in the immediate future depends on how Ukraine itself now reacts. My plan is to put these things on the table provided that we can really make speed about tackling them.</p>
<p class="contents">One of you said that Europe shares a single soul and that shared soul is also present in Ukraine. Let us all be inspired by that to join together in giving this shared soul wings!</p>

The critical situation in which the people find themselves is the result of the restoration of capitalism and subsequent intervention by and competition between the imperialist powers and of the policy followed by the elite in the new imperialist order who have been governing the country over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The undisguised intervention of the ΕU, with the presence of Mr Solana and the governments of Poland and Latvia, suppresses any concept of national independence and is connected to efforts by the ΕU to safeguard a beneficial playing ground for controlling the region in the tug of war between USA and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU stand that it does not support either candidate is hypocritical in the extreme, when it has turned into Yushchenko's pre-campaign office. The statements by the US administration on the Ukraine regime are also provocative when, exactly one year ago, it was praising it on its positive stand on the war against Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The ΕU, the USA and Russia are interested in securing their interests in Ukraine and are exploiting the dissatisfaction being expressed by the people with the policy being applied, which both contenders for power endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the interest of the Ukrainian people, who alone have the authority to resolve their problems, to overturn the current policy, expressions of it and foreign intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
