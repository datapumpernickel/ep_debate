<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fourtou (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, as you have mentioned, in 1998, the Committee on Pensions received two extremely important petitions. The first was submitted by a Belgian national, on behalf of the Self-help Group for Women damaged by Silicone bearing about 1 000 signatures, and the second was submitted by a British citizen requesting a ban on silicone breast implants.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of 1999, following a study, the Committee responsible sent a reply to these petitions which could be summed up as follows: the results of currently available scientific evidence do not seem to justify a ban of silicone implants. Attached was information on the position of third countries and European Union Member States on this issue. In March 2000, the European Parliament Directorate-General on Research, sent the Committee on Petitions a working document on silicone breast implants. This information on the status of research, along with international references from medical institutes, scientific organisations, universities and the medical press etc. lead to the following conclusion: there is currently no definite answer to the question of whether silicone implants are the cause of inflammatory reactions which indirectly cause an auto-immune response. In other words, there is currently no scientific evidence that women who have received breast implants are more susceptible than others to serious diseases, connective tissue diseases, and that they have an abnormal lymphatic response.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the complexity of the problem and without wishing to end the investigation into such distressing petitions, Parliament requested STOA to carry out an independent scientific study and, in May 2000, Doctor Moreno presented his conclusions, giving three options. The first option was for a status quo and no ban. The second option was an outright ban on silicone breast implants. The third option was not for a complete ban, but the adoption and implementation of critical specific measures to develop and improve information for patients, tracking and surveillance, quality control and assurance and fundamental research.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission, the Committee on the Environment and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities were asked for their opinion and they chose the third approach. In March 2001, Mr Liikanen, the Commissioner, confirmed that the Commission was preparing a communication on silicone implants, with a particular view to strengthening European standards and surveillance, to introducing a system of patient consent and to undertaking research and development. Lastly, on 29 May 2001, the Committee on Petitions, having taken into account the complaints by the petitioners and the opinions of the committees consulted, who I would also like to thank for their thorough work and for their help, adopted unanimously, on the basis of STOA’s third option, a resolution which will be voted on tomorrow in Parliament. Its main recommendations are that all patients should have access to information free of charge, any advertising for breast implants should carry a health warning, surgical operations should be very strictly monitored, a database on implants should to be set up, research and development should be undertaken and there should be a ban on breast implants carried out for aesthetic reasons in patients under 18 years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, this is the first time that the Committee on Petitions has presented a resolution to the House which is a direct result of requests from the citizens of the European Union. The Committee on Petitions is pleased to have thus fulfilled its role of an active listening post for its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the report by Mrs Fourtou, whom I congratulate, the Committee on Petitions is for the first time bringing a specific petition to the floor of the European Parliament. I also congratulate Mr Miller, who gave a great deal of support to the petitioners on this particular item. We have demonstrated that by petitioning citizens can get an item debated on the floor of the European Parliament and that the Commission will come to Parliament, as indeed it came to the Petitions Committee. I thank Commissioner Liikanen for the initiatives that he has put forward. A scientific study was inaugurated under STOA, Parliament's assessment panel. All this was achieved by the free opportunity that all citizens have across Europe to bring to their concerns before this European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of this report is a good compromise and one which I hope will command universal support across the House tomorrow. Having said that, it is important to remember that while some citizens come here with their particular concerns, there will be many others who perhaps have a different point of view. Recently a very well-known celebrated TV presenter in the United Kingdom said to me: 'always remember that there are people who need breast implants'. This lady herself had to have a mastectomy for preventative cancer reasons and she has had a very successful implant. So she said: 'do not stop it; do make sure, however, that if there are to be implants, they are safe.'</p>
<p class="contents">In the proposals from the Women's Rights Committee, the Environment Committee and the Commission, we have a compromise that I am sure we can work with and will be good for Europe and for a citizens' Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miller (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, over seven years ago a woman walked into my office in Glasgow. She had been turned away by a wide variety of authorities – elected members and health authorities. Nobody would listen to her. They treated her somewhat as an eccentric. I sat down with her and over a period of about three-and-half hours she convinced me that there was a problem with the whole question of silicone and silicone implants.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of that conversation, over seven years ago, is that I am standing here tonight talking about it – not on behalf of Mr Miller, but on behalf of that woman and the hundreds of thousands of other women who have since joined together in a vast network, not just in Europe but throughout the world, to petition against the use of unsafe silicone implants. It is a testament to the citizens of Europe that they can petition this Parliament and actually get heard. This is the first time that I can remember an ordinary citizen raising an issue which has reached the floor of this Parliament. I congratulate Parliament and the Petitions Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, this was not only down to Mr Miller, though I have pursued it through Parliament. This has been down to the women themselves who have bravely fought against scorn and ridicule from a variety of sources and who have continued fighting their campaign against silicone implants. That campaign has continued for years and they are still fighting. Many of them believe that there should be a complete ban. However, most of them recognise that at the moment there is not enough evidence to ban silicone implants so they are happy to settle, at this point in time, for stronger rules and regulations governing this whole question.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding a couple of points in the report, I am glad to see the call for a ban on implants anyone under the age of 18 for cosmetic purposes. When we talk about the quality of the implants we also have to talk about the safety of the implants. I cannot stress that too strongly. We talk about the information to prospective clients undergoing this operation. That information has to be available from independent sources. It is not good enough for that information to come from the surgeon carrying out the operation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also talk about registration. We have to know the number of operations taking place. We have to know the clinics that are taking these people in. We have to know what surgeons are carrying them out. Until we do so we will not fully realise the scale of this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a tribute to Parliament, but moreover, this is a tribute to the thousands of women who have been fighting for years. It has finally been recognised that there is a problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that we have come to conclusions, having looked at ways to make implants safer. My group supports these proposals. At the same time, we would strongly defend the principle of subsidiarity and what is to be dealt with by Member States. However, the proposal does not respect the prevailing principle of subsidiarity on all points, e.g. point 3 on the design of care.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to give a warning about systems of patient registers. If I may take the country which I know best as an example, I can say that we have recently had a discussion because a large number of patients have been surprised at the fact that sensitive medical information has been recorded and then used in an unacceptable way. Therefore, we cannot support what has been said about an EU-wide register, either. This is something which each Member State must consider very, very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the age limit, we should perhaps avoid making this matter into something of a forbidden fruit. By setting an age limit, I believe we are making it even more attractive. It is a matter which we must take measures against in some other way. I believe that many of us feel it is rather ridiculous and dangerous to have implants, but we should not decide about this at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been extremely interesting to read the reports ordered by Parliament and the Commission. I can only say that it is very difficult in practice to apply the precautionary principle. I believe the reports on the entire issue have shown us this. It can be seen, for example, that we have been on rather shaky ground when trying to introduce a total ban. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issue of silicone gel breast implants is a sensitive one and this debate, as many have said this evening, is long overdue. That is why we in the Environment Committee wanted to see access for all patients to free comprehensive information drawn up by independent experts, clear, bold health warnings in advertising, and an end to the before-and-after-pictures frequently used in women's magazines. We in the Environment Committee believe that all breast implant operations should be recorded in the EU and that, as a result, manufacturers should supply only to surgeons who use such a register. The cost of breast implants should include precare, independent advice, alternatives, a cooling-off period and post-care. Finally, there should be comprehensive national lists of registered private clinics and trained plastic surgeons. I am glad to see that he rapporteur has taken on much of the Environment Committee's opinion and I thank her for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would say that I was privileged to take part in this procedure and I highly appreciate the respectful and professional way the committee dealt with the issue. It gave a chance to the citizens to come with their serious problems and concerns. The committee wanted to hear the scientific opinion on the issue, the experts, and then draw its conclusions. This is a new departure for our institutions and I hope it will pave the way towards closing the gap between the citizens and the European institutions, a problem which faces all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution has a strong independent scientific basis in the report drawn up by Professor Moreno at the request of Parliament. The draft rightly distinguishes between measures to be taken at Community level and those that should be taken mainly at national level as part of health and consumer policy. The draft resolution reflects the consensus between our institutions and Member States, with whom we have been discussing the subject over the last few months and who share our concern to improve the situation that was highlighted in such an impressive way by the petitioners. The Commission will adopt a communication on breast implants within the coming weeks, before the end of July. It is now subject to internal Commission consultation procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Our communication intends to reinforce the implementation of the medical device directive on issues such as conformity assessment, standardisation, monitoring, clinical data etc. It also addresses recommendations to Member States that fall under the chapter of health policy, in particular on the highly important issue of informed patient consent. Women have a right to the fullest possible information regarding the risks and benefits of breast implants before surgery so that they can take a well-informed, deliberate decision. The Commission services had a meeting with the representatives of the petitioners, in particular concerning informed patient consent and we received a number of useful suggestions. The Commission's communication will be sent to Parliament as soon as it is adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
