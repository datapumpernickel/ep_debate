<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I am not going to use this speech to give praise. Although if I wanted to, it would be difficult for me to better the adjectives that have been used in the last six months by, for example, the Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana, the British Prime Minister, or the current German Chancellor, who are all of the same political leaning as Mr Barón, although that may not appear to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, reasonable to say that in the past six months we have made more progress than ever in the field of justice and home affairs. And something that I think is more important, perhaps, than having agreed a common definition of the crime of terrorism, having created Eurojust, or having adopted the arrest warrant, is having understood that terrorism is a problem and a threat for all Europeans and that it therefore requires measures at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who murder, or use extortion and threats as a means of achieving their political objectives are undoubtedly a threat to democracy and to the system of freedoms. But the same applies to those who instigate or cooperate with terrorists. Those who contribute funding, for example, which the Batasuna treasurer is accused of, after the French judicial authorities found more than EUR 200 000 in his car boot which he said he was given by a Member of this House. I am therefore very relieved, and I think we all should be, to know that the Bureau of the European Parliament has intervened in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of attacks on human rights, there are few actions that are more repulsive than the trafficking of human beings. The fight against illegal immigration also requires an effort at European level. Of course my Group wanted to get further, like the majority of the members of the Council, but I think that we should be satisfied with the agreement that was reached, which was a result of the requirement for unanimity and which is undoubtedly a step forward, especially for those who not long ago were demagogically demanding papers for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to end by repeating some words that were said in this plenary in January 1996, during the previous Spanish Presidency of the European Union. The spokesperson for my Group, Abel Matutes, said then that the Presidency does not belong to the Government that is temporarily exerting the power, but is the responsibility of the whole country and all of its people. The <span class="italic">Partido Popular</span>, as Mr Matutes said then, has therefore given you its loyal support in order to achieve the objectives set out.</p>
<p class="contents">We have fulfilled that objective and therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to say that we take the good and bad elements of this Presidency as our own. There are people this morning who have missed the opportunity to show the slightest institutional loyalty. They will always have the freedom to continue bringing strictly national discussions to Brussels and Strasbourg. They therefore also have the opportunity first of all to lose the debates in their country of origin and then lose them again here, in Brussels or Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every presidency also has the option of shuffling some things off on to the other Member States. If we tend today to mention more of the points of criticism, then that is, of course, in the interests of debate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one positive aspect that I would like to mention, and that is the Interinstitutional Agreement, which it is intended should be now concluded, following lengthy preparatory work by Commission President Prodi and in Parliament. After a great deal of discussion with Mr de Miguel, the Secretary of State, we have now managed it. For this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank you and, especially, Secretary of State Miguel.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the Council has yielded less glorious results, especially as regards transparency. That transparency should have to do with only part of lawmaking, only at its outset and conclusion, and only in a particular way, is actually ridiculous. We really should not fight shy of the transparency that exists in Parliament. What we demand of the Council is complete transparency in all aspects of the lawmaking process.</p>
<p class="contents">The confirmation, as on so many occasions in the past, that there is, in principle, a desire to make Tampere a reality, is being celebrated as a great success in the immigration field. It is not one yet, however. Little progress has been made even under the Spanish Presidency. You must be honest in admitting, Mr Aznar, that the only really "big" idea, the imposition of sanctions on the immigrants' countries of origin, has not been a success. That it has not been a success has been, thank God, the work of our group. It would have been absurd to punish the poorest of the poor. The people we must punish are the criminal gangs who get the poorest of the poor to part with all the money they have left and promise them heaven on earth in return. Often, what they end up with is death in the Mediterranean. What the world's poorest countries need is cooperation and aid in order to reduce the pressure to emigrate.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my last point. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if I am to believe the <span class="italic">Handelsblatt</span>, which is normally a serious newspaper, you said this: "I believe that the Left has lost its direction. It is afraid of the modern world, a world of change and innovation." Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Left, at any rate the social democratic Left, has no fear of modernisation or of change. We simply know that many people in our society are afraid that this change and modernisation will make them losers. Modernisation and change do not just produce winners; there are also those who lose out through them and these are the people with whom we have to concern ourselves. If we Social Democrats do not look out for them, they will be easy prey for populist movements, especially on the Right, which cannot be in our common interest, as these movements exploit fear of immigration and of the enlargement of the European Union. We, though, want immigration to be properly controlled. We want and need enlargement as our next great step forward. So it must be the concern of Social Democrats that the opportunity to show solidarity, which is the social dimension of modernisation, privatisation and liberalisation, is not lost.</p>
<p class="contents">A European Union that does not demonstrate solidarity with the weaker members of society cannot be a success. That is what Social Democracy stands for – we are not afraid of reforms. We want to help all those who fear unemployment and instability.</p>

As a Liberal, I am therefore glad that the more repressive proposals did not receive support in Seville and that the Council appears to have understood that trade, aid and support of democracy are better ways to prevent people from fleeing their country than threatening sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am cautiously positive about the reforms of the Council. It is good that the organisation is being streamlined, that the meetings are becoming more open and that the summits are becoming less of a publicity stunt. However, this is not sufficient. The negotiations must also be opened up, and the documents must be made available if the legislation is to be called democratic. I hope that the Danish Presidency will be able to set a good example in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also wonder about the strategic programme, covering many years, which the Council is to adopt.

<p class="contents">The media screen of achievements that you have put up does not hide the very serious questions appearing on the horizon. The proposals from your party colleague, Mr Fischler, to reform the common fisheries policy or the CAP are generating uncertainty and concern among our fishermen and farmers. They just need to come into line with our reality, which today is very far from the virtual technocratic reality in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for you to demonstrate the forcefulness of your politics there, here, where our future is being decided.</p>
<p class="contents">Your greatest achievement in the Spanish Presidency has been your will, your team’s capacity for work. Congratulations! I had never seen so many memorandums presented here, although proportionally the progress has been scarce.</p>
<p class="contents">You cut the tape for the launch of the euro. Very good. But you underestimated the prior work that had been done by some people.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, your initial proposals on immigration were significantly reduced, thank God, and, to the disappointment of many, the people of Barcelona and Seville behaved and dispelled all of your alarmist predictions with their civic-minded attitude. I therefore formally ask, Mr President, that the European institutions congratulate both cities on their behaviour and civic-mindedness, and on their patience in the face of those expensive and unnecessary displays of power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have two observations to make after the event.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I am very relieved that the proposal for a European police service for border control and the idea of deducting development aid from unwilling countries of origin of illegal immigrants have not been adopted. These measures were mainly aimed at fighting the symptoms, namely keeping the illegal immigrants out. This might placate anxious European citizens in the short term, but the usefulness and consequences of the measures had not been sufficiently thought through.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, only a combination of fair distribution of welfare on the one hand and an enforceable European asylum and immigration system on the other can offer a viable future. Unfortunately, the Summit has not resulted in any progress in this area, even though proposals have been ready for some time. I can appreciate that rejected asylum seekers have to return to their countries of origin. What happens, however, with the millions of illegal immigrants who have never applied for asylum? I endorse the idea of trying to restrict the inflow, but how do we intend to regulate the outflow?</p>
<p class="contents">Given the sensitive nature of the issue, I can understand that this takes time. However, the European Council has merely regurgitated existing decisions. This is not a new stage in the development, but stagnation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This practice, Mr Aznar, has made it very difficult for you to sound sincere. One enlightening example was your refusal to recognise the general strike on the occasion of the Summit of Seville. As a matter of fact, for you and your government, that strike never happened. This ridiculous way of yours of ignoring reality is unforgivable in politics and that is why more Euro-scepticism or even outright hostility to the European Union reflect your presidency's poor schedule.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">"2002 est l'année d'une poussée spectaculaire de l'Euro-phobie, notamment dans les classes populaires européennes"</span>, as Professor Dominique Réné said.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course you are not the only one to blame for the current pitiful image of the European Union because facts like the genocide practices in Chechnya, Palestine and Kurdistan cannot be disguised. Mr Aznar, you are particularly keen on the teachings of the governments of Russia, Israel and Turkey. Everybody can see this from your irresistible desire to ban Batasuna and all the Basque nationalist organisations. In doing so you have provoked the bitterest quarrel with the Basque bishops, trade unions and a large majority of Basque citizens since the time of Franco. Your time as President-in-Office is over and the Basque conflict remains. The only way to get out of your endless Basque nightmare is a simple one: just wake up. Before it is too late, please stop hovering over the summits.</p>

I wanted to say this, Mr President, because in this type of debate the problems of a situation like this can be dealt with from different perspectives, and all of them are valid, except that of those who out of a lack of moral fibre do not speak out to condemn the murder of innocent victims, which is an insult to their memory and makes a mockery of Parliament’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">He said that criticism is a healthy exercise, but that it must be levelled under certain premises. I think that it is much easier to criticise than to act and it is obvious that someone who acts always deserves greater consideration, even if they do not achieve 100% success, than a bad critic.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism, Mr President, is also a little like wills, in that only the most recent one is valid. I am frankly shocked that some of what has been said here seem to clearly contradict more than thirty paragraphs approved in the resolutions that Parliament adopted for the Seville, Madrid and Barcelona summits, which definitely had the support and the vote of the Parliamentary Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in my opinion, Mr President, there is also a question of personal style. Everyone has their own style, just as they have their own nose, and bringing domestic issues and debates to this Parliament clearly means that citizens will take note of this type of attitude, which is not in the general interest, but rather aimed in vain at compromising the image of the Spanish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this type of debate is purely about knowing whether the European Union, without exaggerating the good points or disguising the bad points, is progressing. I think that, although some prefer to see things as they would like them to be and not as they are, it is obvious that in the past six months a lot of things have been done. Some serious work has been done, and we have satisfactorily reached the end of a road filled with internal problems, due to the electoral processes in some Member States and external problems arising from the international situation.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is clear that in the short six-month period the President-in-Office cannot magically resolve all the problems afflicting the European Union, as if he had the philosopher’s stone, the yellow ointment or the balm of Fierabrás. What is true is that the fourteen other Member States also count and in this type of situation, Mr President, one thing is very clear: those in the worst situations, those who have failed to resolve the problem of employment and convergence in order to join monetary union, are always those who give the best advice.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that Mr Barón is not in the House at the moment, because he, having been a Transport Minister, is here giving us lessons in how to sail, when his boat is taking in water left right and centre. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The way to resolve the Basque conflict is for those who are persecuting and killing us to stop doing so and leave us to live in freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is true that we could have made more progress, but we could also have made much less progress, and true that we could have done a lot better, but we could also have done a lot worse. This is all on the basis that in a six-month presidency there are neither resounding successes nor complete failures. In six months there is not enough time for complete failures, they are impossible, and relative failures can be explained.</p>
<p class="contents">You yourself, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have acknowledged the futility of a rotational system that results in presidencies being forced to seek success, nationally if possible and in a short space of time. In this sense, the reforms of the Council agreed in Seville, which have already been discussed, represent minimal, but positive progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not here to criticise you, but neither am I here to flatter you, so I will assess the status of three of your priorities: enlargement, transatlantic relations and foreign relations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, I can say nothing less than that the objectives have not been fulfilled, you have said so yourself. The chapter that the Presidency had proposed closing in order to achieve the reunification of Europe and make it a reality remain open. They are difficult subjects and give rise to a lot of suspicion in various Member States, but refusing to promote a serious debate that will enable us to overcome the uncertainty is not the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding relations with our main ally, I have to acknowledge, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have had an undeniable personal success: you were invited to Camp David. But that relationship was not cemented in Europe’s favour in terms of its relations with the United States. They have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, they have withdrawn their signature from the creation of the International Criminal Court, they will not take advice on the Middle East, and the variety of trade disputes between us are increasing. In short, our leadership is flagging.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding foreign relations, it is true that the agreement with Chile has been signed, on which we congratulate you, but this Presidency has not given the Union’s policy on Latin America and the Mediterranean the position it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is not doing well, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is not doing better than it was six months ago. I know that we have had to go through some difficult times, but politics is for difficult times. Therefore, with the same sincerity with which I offered you our support six months ago, believe me, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I tell you that I hoped and wished for more. More success, more progress, less uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I was not planning to describe this Presidency, but your Minister for Foreign Affairs, as always, has provoked me by saying that he is reasonably satisfied. Perhaps because I am leftwing and a woman, and women and the left wing require more ambition, I will say that I am reasonably unsatisfied.</p>

Personally, I should like to see the prime minister – and, hopefully, his delightful wife too – have the opportunity to take some holiday now.</p>
<p class="contents">The following is not therefore directed at the prime minister personally, but at the Council, and it concerns the issue of illegal immigration. The Council declarations devote an incredible number of lines, not to mention pages, to illegal immigration. No sensible person is in favour of illegal immigration. The issue comes down entirely to whether the causes are to be tackled or whether a ‘Fortress Europe’ is to be created. The Council has, in the main, concentrated exclusively on a ‘Fortress Europe’, and the document that deals with the actual causes is too weak and ineffectual. According to that document, the European Council draws attention to the importance of economic cooperation. Would it not be better if the European Council refrained from drawing attention to anything at all and instead actually did something, for it is precisely European cooperation that can do something about these matters. We shall continue to have illegal immigration if we do not bring about sensible cooperation with the developing countries and, as long as we do nothing, illegal immigrants cannot be blamed for coming to Europe. The most important thing, therefore, is to bring about sensible cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It exposes Europe’s impotence for all to see. Filled with panic at what they call populism – which is nothing more than the exasperation of the European citizens who are being dispossessed of their very identity – the worthy Heads of State and Government took it upon themselves to tackle the problem of immigration head on. This attempt bore scant fruit in the form of Amsterdam in 1997. Yet again, the Union is appropriating the competences of the Member States and failing to replace their policies. As Mr Barón Crespo said earlier in this debate, we have to start work on Europe from scratch every six months. What a great idea! The citizens are gradually growing wise to this lack of progress and their exasperation is steadily increasing, which could have serious consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one item of the Seville conclusions which was largely overlooked and is worthy of emphasis – I am talking about item 6, which, it is said, asks the Council to study the question of the use of languages in order to improve the present situation. There is only one way to improve the present situation, and that is to allow Members to work in their own language. Despite the Rules of Procedure, however, this is far removed from our current way of working, as we increasingly, in committee, for example, vote on texts that are only available in English.</p>
<p class="contents">Will we one day be forced to recruit European Members of Parliament on the basis of the results of an English language test? I would warn the Danish Presidency against the proposals it is about to make. It is not acceptable to choose one or two working languages because Parliament is not an international organisation. Nor is it acceptable to have to choose a pivot language, which would naturally be English, or rather, American English. If the federalists make this mistake, all will become clear in the eyes of the people, and we shall plainly see the true face of the European Union, as an outpost of the empire of the United States, and its true purpose of grinding down the European nations until they are nothing more than casualties of US world domination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What concerns us, however, is that this battle should become the key factor in relations with third countries and in cooperation agreements, assuming greater practical and political importance than that accorded either now or in the past to the advancement of democracy and the Rule of Law. In the few seconds available to me, I must illustrate this point with a paradox. According to this line of reasoning, Albania under the Communist dictator, Enver Hoxha, would have been a perfect partner, for it was impossible for people to emigrate from those countries; nobody could emigrate from countries under a military regime. Yet it is possible to see beyond the paradox, for it is where we are unable to bring democracy and the Rule of Law that conflict breaks out, and that was the case in the Balkans. That is the real, basic, problem underlying unmanageable migration flows. Therefore, Europe may well do better to focus on the deep-rooted causes of the unmanageable problem of illegal immigration rather than on the symptoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am afraid, Prime Minister Aznar, I cannot get out of my mind this image of you endeavouring to seduce "Carmen" Tony Blair.</p>
<p class="contents">I was going to begin by saying what a great encouragement and example you have been to the centre-right parties in Europe. Very many of the political successes we have seen during the course of recent months have been because of the good example you have set. However, looking at the agenda at Seville and the areas where we would wish to see greater progress, I have to say that I am a little disappointed at the economic reform package. I do not blame you for that, Prime Minister, I blame recalcitrant governments elsewhere in Europe. However, there is no doubt that there is too much complacency about corporate governance issues in the United States and about the assumption that the Lisbon agenda will just in some way be delivered without there being marked change here within Europe. The Prime Minister understands that, but I am not sure that many other Member State governments do.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to terrorism and illegal immigration, it is quite right that you have put those matters at the forefront. Much has been said about them. I merely endorse the remarks and your support for raising those matters in terms of the overall agenda. In relation to enlargement, certainly my party looks for considerable progress in negotiations on the CAP and structural reform. We look with some interest at what may happen in Ireland in the referendum, which may turn upon the charms of our President.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me back to the compelling image of "Carmen" Blair, because when it comes to Council reform – the concept of having a five-year presidency – maybe we would regard you as being the ideal candidate for that role, but Mr Blair has been telling our House of Commons that <span class="italic">he – </span>not you – is the man who set the agenda at Seville. He did not say it once, he said it five times! His Europe Minister said that it was Mr Blair's agenda that is being set. I would just ask you to reconsider the whole story of Carmen because I do not think that she was necessarily a totally reliable person to be engaged in seduction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The focusing of the European Council on its main role, namely to strengthen the coordination role of the General Affairs Council and greater transparency, are certainly along the right lines. Nonetheless, the European Council could have been more ambitious with regard to the actual functioning of the Council and better cooperation with Parliament in speeding up legislative procedure. We would also have preferred the Community method to be formally confirmed at every stage of the decision-making procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, to change the subject, the Spanish Presidency deserves thunderous applause for its statement on the Middle East. The European position, which was clear, concise and to-the-point, stands out favourably in comparison with the stalling tactics of President Bush’s speech.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, sustainable peace cannot be achieved unless the two adversaries comply with the basic principles of international law and respect the resolutions of the United Nations. We have to put an end to terrorism and occupation. A temporary Palestinian state is an illusion – borderless states do not exist. Israel must therefore draw back within the borders established in 1967 and dismantle its illegal settlements. The Seville Declaration requires military operations to cease. Restrictions on freedom of movement must be lifted, as walls will not lead to peace. Bravo, Mr Aznar, well done! Now you just have to convince our US counterparts that the European vision for peace in the Middle East is the only way to put a stop to these massacres. Moreover, if it is true that lasting peace could be achieved in the Middle East by a change in leadership, then, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I beg you to ensure that Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat bid goodbye to politics on the same day, at the same time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the only way I can explain their decision. The final declaration referred to ‘an’ accession treaty for all candidate countries, while in Laeken, treaties were still mentioned in the plural. For the ratification, this means that national parliaments have to like it or lump it. The universally adulated individual assessment suddenly does not apply to national people’s representatives. The Commission and the European Council are in this way taking a further swipe at democracy. The precedent of the previous limited enlargements is not relevant. After all, there are now no fewer than ten countries that have to meet a whole host of new requirements. I would appreciate an explanation from the President.</p>

It was right to do so. The Council, in turn, was right to leave aside the misguided, poorly assembled projects tabled by the Commission and instead take practical, operational decisions. We can only guess at the harm done to the concept of Europe in public opinion in recent years by the Commission’s integration projects, which prioritised uncontrolled freedom of movement within the Union and the most extensive reception of third-country nationals possible, even above protecting citizens’ safety and social cohesion in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that this period is over, although I have my doubts, since although the Council is more aware of the priorities required, the Commission, on the other hand, is like a liner whose course cannot easily be altered.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only encourage the Council in future to thoroughly revise the Commission’s pending projects on asylum, family reunification, long-term resident status and temporary protection, and even to jettison the idea of supranational border guards. Priority must be given to practical, effective projects that respect the territorial sovereignty of the Member States and which could, where necessary, be variable-geometry projects, for example, a joint visa file that would finally provide information on who has entered and left the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would point out that the Council statement on Ireland was only designed to soften up the Irish before their second referendum on Nice. It appears to accept a pick-and-mix European security and defence policy, but in fact this does not at all concern the underlying philosophy or the content of the Nice draft treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union, under your Presidency, has continued to discuss issues that are fundamental to its future, such as the necessary reform of the Council with a view to enlargement, the establishment of a common asylum, immigration and integration policy, and the reinvigoration, finally, of the Barcelona Process for improved mutual understanding between the countries of the Mediterranean. I, in turn, can only tell this House that I welcome the progress made in all these areas, and congratulate you on it, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I am sorry that, under the same presidency, the transatlantic link between the United States and Europe has become increasingly distorted, such that the US would be solely, or at least in an increasingly isolated fashion, responsible for handling the crises that continue to threaten global stability and peace in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Kashmir and elsewhere. Europe, meanwhile, would be sidelined into managing humanitarian aid missions and post-crisis reconstruction, due, Mr President, to the failure of the governments of the European Union to understand that their professed desire to participate in crisis prevention and management is incompatible with the continual reduction in their defence effort.</p>
<p class="contents">In discussions on the subject, everyone is united in demanding better spending through more balanced and intelligent distribution of tasks between players in the European weapons industry. This will be nothing more than a pious hope until we decide to establish the beginnings of a European defence budget, perhaps initially restricted to the field of research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">We need better spending, Mr President. Do you not also think we should spend more when the time comes if we do not, as Europeans, wish to resign ourselves to the role of a mere servant to US military power? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns the Seville conclusions on the reform of the Council: Parliament has been asking the Council to reform since before the Nice Treaty. When you take a small step forward, therefore, we are not going to oppose it. However, this is indeed a small step. A great deal remains to be done and I am not one of those people who think that you must not progress because of the Convention. Do not imagine, however, that because you are making progress, you will fully deal with the subject. If we can find a sound model for the reform of the Council without waiting for the reform of the Treaty, all well and good. However, Parliament will ask more of you and I hope that the Convention will make even more proposals, and I think it will, with regard to transparency and the implementation of a coherent presidency system so that the Union can take decisions effectively and democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns growth and competitiveness with a view to full employment. Decisions have been taken and Parliament has made requests which merit further attention. We still think, and we shall continue to stress, with regard to the adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines, that the European Parliament should play a greater part in their preparation and that greater attention should be paid to its requests.</p>
<p class="contents">References were made at Seville to the subject of services of general interest. I would therefore now like to express our concern over the framework-directive on which a specific commitment was made at Barcelona. The related rumours make me think that perhaps some people would prefer to wait for the reform of the Treaties before drawing up the framework-directive. We think this would be a mistake. We cannot afford to wait for the reform of the Treaties to draw up the framework-directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, we do not consider that these advances have sufficiently fulfilled the objectives set at the start of the Presidency with the slogan “more Europe". In the field of immigration we need greater attention to cooperation and integration policies; in enlargement, we need more success in the reform of the CAP and of the financial resources; in institutional reforms, we need the Commission’s and Parliament’s proposals to be more in tune with each other. On international matters, and despite the progress and the meetings in Valencia, Madrid and Seville, we have lacked presence and results in the interventions in the Latin American crises, the common position on Cuba, the process of decolonisation of the Sahara and the Middle East crisis.

This is particularly the case with respect to improved safeguards against fraud and the securing of the EU's external borders. It is intolerable that over 500 000 illegal immigrants should find their way into the EU every year. They are a constant source of criminality, oppressing and enslaving people, endangering the life and limb even of children. Those who traffic in human beings must therefore be punished as severely as those who deal in drugs. Both shamelessly exploit human misery for financial gain.</p>
<p class="contents">Eastward enlargement has proved the occasion for the German Federal Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, to bring off the flop of the year with his intention to take the candidate countries hostage to the internal reform of European agricultural policy. The European Union's current inability to do its homework in good time is not a reason to jeopardise the reunification of Europe. The fact that the Americans are currently massively increasing their agricultural subsidies means that Chancellor Schröder's threat to suspend direct payments to European agriculture would have a catastrophic effect on its competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely in difficult times like these that Europe must keep on course. Your proposals, Mr Aznar, like those of the Commission, Mr President of the Commission, are a sound basis on which to further develop of the European Union, but the outcome of the second Irish referendum continues to hang over eastward enlargement like the sword of Damocles. This is where the European Union has to improve its overall image in order to reach people's hearts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You said, Mr Aznar, that Spain has proposed a European immigration and asylum policy. I think I recall that there already was one. Nearly three years ago, in Tampere, the European Council adopted a programme to harmonise asylum policies and to provide the European Union with a common framework for immigration policies. The programme had its deadlines, which, it is true, will expire in two years’ time. The Commission, during that time, presented all the proposals for a coherent immigration policy: family reunification, integration, management of flows of legal entry in order to cover existing employment in the European Union (perhaps we should consider that we need more employment inspection and less border controls in the European Union, which would also be a way forward), relations with third countries in terms of joint management of influxes and joint development, and combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">None of these proposals were adopted. In Seville, in any case, you had to ratify the Tampere agenda; you had to ratify its objectives after three years. This gives me two feelings: one of hope, because that is the last thing you lose, but also one of concern as to how you did it. You turned the Tampere agenda around and that concerns me for many reasons, including reasons of efficiency. The fight against illegal immigration should be defending a legal European immigration policy. If that is not the case, it is just a fight against the desperate; it is a horrible war against illegal immigrants, which we cannot win.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today this European immigration policy that we need for the twenty-first century does not exist, but there are proposals for it. I hope that there will be real steps forward in the future.</p>

This will hopefully allow us a debate on the real issues surrounding the Treaty of Nice and, as colleagues have said, win the hearts and minds of the Irish people through the two declarations which were annexed to the Seville conclusions, stating that EU common foreign and security policy will not prejudice Ireland's traditional stance of military neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">Great confusion arose during the last Nice referendum campaign with unrefuted scare stories that we could be forced to take part in foreign missions against our will and even that conscription could be introduced. We now have a so-called 'triple-lock', requiring that any Irish military involvement in international missions overseas has to have in every case a UN mandate, as well as the approval of both the Irish Government and the Oireachtas or Irish Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not support the view of many on the 'no' side that NATO is the bogeyman of the world, nor that the UN is necessarily the panacea for all global ills. If we are to have a truly independent or neutral country, as these same people claim to wish, then how do we approve of and allow a situation where any one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council can prevent Ireland from participating in EU missions when we believe they are appropriate? What I am saying is that Irish foreign policy decisions should not require the agreement of Moscow or Beijing. Nor indeed should our Irish troops now be pulled out of Bosnia-Herzegovina because the United States, as we speak, is threatening a veto on the renewal of the UN mission there.</p>
<p class="contents">To Commissioner Prodi I say: could I ask you to clarify on the record what exactly you said in Copenhagen yesterday about the implications for enlargement of a second failure by the Irish to ratify Nice? There are contradictory reports and further confusion in the Irish press today. We now need above all crystal-clear leadership on the issue of enlargement, as what is being played out on the Irish stage is a full reflection of the concerns – real and perceived – of all our citizens on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have suffered greatly, first under the fascist and then the communist joke. The time is long overdue for them to be allowed to rejoin the European family. It is above all a moral imperative. Remember what the King of Jordan said here at the last session: 'there is no future for any without a future for all'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our leaders are also stepping up their use of tough language, but in my view, they have treated our electorate's concerns with contempt by failing to formulate objectives in Seville, such as a European border police force, real European migration policy with partnership agreements with the countries of origin, and genuine and prompt support for the proposals of Commissioner Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has been made in European security policy. Institutional adjustments have been made, but it is still necessary for Europe to speak with one voice in establishing an EU-NATO treaty in order to be able to use the NATO assets and thus to become operational in good time. We hope that in the Council’s Foreign Affairs club, both the ministers of Development and Cooperation and the Defence ministers will be meeting with each other regularly and visibly to demonstrate that Europe’s security policy places great emphasis on conflict prevention and fighting poverty in the interest of a more stable world. Our draft resolution of Parliament refers to the Council, Foreign Affairs, as well as Development and Cooperation. This is the title which we warmly recommend.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East, we now want to focus all our attention on the international conference. Our PSE Group stresses that it should be the Palestinian people who decide on their leadership, and not President Bush, but we deeply regret that hundreds of Europeans who wanted to support the peace process were denied access to Israel, and we continue to call for a political dialogue involving two states, Israel and the Palestine, which are both safe and both democratic. The spiral of violence, from whichever corner, is always ultimately at the expense of the desire for peace that we all share</p>
<p class="contents">As for EU-Russia relations, we support the progress made. In addition, Kaliningrad must consider the Schengen Agreements as a framework for a solution. Joint EU-Russian border control could be a first step.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE Group expresses grave concern about India and Pakistan. The EU and the Member States must make far greater efforts in the field of de-escalation. Pakistan must comply with Resolution 1373 of the Security Council, the infiltration has to stop and we need a bilateral approach in this area, also involving India. The EU could act as the facilitator in this. May we hope that we will work in a multilateral manner, in contrast to the unilateral deviations of our US allies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is happening is that the European left is saying one thing in the European Parliament that does not coincide with what their governments, where they have them, are doing, they are saying something else in international forums and the opposite in the national parliaments and in the media. That is called schizophrenia, lack of ideas and of a political plan. And to cap it all, they call for strikes to hinder the work of a summit which tried, fortunately successfully, to give fresh impetus to the measures agreed in Tampere and to fight those who deal in and traffic human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is important, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that it should be known that Members from across the Mediterranean spectrum who met in Bari, without any distinction in terms of politics, three days before the Seville summit, unanimously adopted a resolution clearly supporting each and every one of the guidelines agreed in Seville: to promote integration policies ensuring the respect of the rights and freedoms of immigrants that legally live in the European Union, and also respect on their part for their obligations as citizens and for the values of civil society; making association and cooperation agreements a tool for joint responsibility in managing migratory flows; and adopting the necessary measures to evaluate and ensure the effective application of the agreements. Also that the countries of origin should also increase their efforts in the fight against illegal immigration, better monitor and manage their borders and take responsibility for the readmission of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the thousands of deaths and disappearances already counted on the coast of Andalusia, along with those in Dover, or the sad sight of boats full of immigrants on the Italian coasts should not allow the slightest room for demagogy or irresponsible partisan accusations, which only encourage those who make immigration into a radical flag with serious political consequences.</p>

<p class="contents">I would now like to ask Mr Aznar and Mr Prodi a question. The document adopted at Seville on Council reform refers to a strategic document which the Council is to present, covering three years. In other words, the Council undertakes to present its strategic programme for the three years to come in consultation with the Commission. There is no mention of Parliament. The question is a simple one, then: firstly, why three years, given that the legislature covers a period of five years, and secondly, why is there absolutely no reference to Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a concern to express and a request to make. Our friend, Mr Poos, has already mentioned the distance existing between the Union, of which Spain has the Presidency, and President Bush as regards the Middle East. Could Mr Aznar inform us whether, in the next six months, the Danish Presidency will be sensitive to the development of the situation in the Middle East, in view of the fact that recent statements made by the Danish Foreign Minister are completely in line with statements made by President Bush as regards both the international conference on the Middle East and the quartet. These statements are completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last question. Mr President-in-Office, you were in this House on 20 March. The previous day, a university professor, Marco Biagi, was assassinated in my city by the Red Brigades. You expressed your condolences on that occasion. What would you think, Mr Aznar, if one of your government ministers referred to a victim of terrorism as a pain in the ass – please would the interpreters translate that literally – who complained because he wanted his consultancy contract to be renewed? Do not call me to order, Mr President. I am not being rude: these are the words of the Italian Minister for the Interior. Do you think that statements like that will further the fight against terrorism? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But no one who aspires to be the least bit objective will fail to recognise that we have not seen six months of formalities, simple management or passive drifting in resigned apathy. Or was establishing a genuine internal market for energy not an unthinkable goal only a few years ago? Or is configuring and developing a European satellite communications system not a step forward in new technologies, significantly changing the current scene and breaking a monopoly that some considered to be irreversible? Who could ignore the fact that, finally, the foundations have been laid for a common immigration policy based on generously opening up our territory to those people who legitimately want a better life, as well as effectively combating the illegal and outrageous trafficking of human beings?</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the progress made in the negotiations with the candidate countries, this has been spectacular, and the criticism that some very sensitive chapters were left uncompleted is loaded with partiality and a lack of equanimity. Enough has been done in the complex electoral context in Europe during the past few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the criticism based on a supposed change of priorities along the way is selfishly forgetting the dramatic acceleration that has taken place at the beginning of this century and is describing as fickleness what in fact was a remarkable capacity to adapt and to react to the unexpected problems that arose, which required immediate responses.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we were promised more Europe and more Europe is what we got. We were presented with an extensive and intensive programme, which was largely completed. The Spanish six-month Presidency began with a renewed enthusiasm for the future of the Union, and despite the obvious problems and obstacles, that enthusiasm is stronger than ever now, as a result of the Spanish Presidency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Aznar López,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a few brief comments on some of the positions held by the various groups and certain honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to say that, as you all know, the task of the presidencies is essentially to promote measures, to promote reforms, to introduce initiatives and above all to shape and seek agreements which allow things to move forward, and this reflects our European tradition and also the form of the debates in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issues raised in relation to the area of freedom, security and justice and those presented to us today in relation to immigration policy, I would like to point out that what was implemented in Seville was the general plan, the general strategy approved at the Tampere European Council. I am grateful for all the comments made in this regard but at the same time I would like to point out that in 1998 the then Austrian Chancellor, Viktor Klima, commissioned certain prime ministers, under the Austrian Presidency, to develop and present drafts of work to be carried out. And I, on behalf of Spain, had the honour of being commissioned to work on all the issues relating to the third pillar of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere Council was established on the basis of the work carried out and approved at the informal European Council of Pörtschach. And Tampere establishes a general framework for the third pillar, for the first time, which naturally needs to be implemented in accordance with new circumstances and with the dynamic of the process established in Tampere. That is what was done in Seville, as laid out from the outset in the programme of the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say in this regard that we must work on the basis of four elements within such a complex field as immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, legality. Immigration in our countries must be based on legality. That is necessary, just as immigration is necessary; it is essential to the integration of immigrants into our societies; it is essential to the organisation of migratory flows which can only be based on legality; and it is extremely advisable for the maintenance of co-existence in all of our societies and countries. To believe that we can create an immigration policy without distinguishing between the legal and the illegal, with a cry of ‘papers for all’, would I believe be a mistake and would mean opting for conflict, for non-integration and for demagoguery.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as this is the case from a legal point of view, we are also absolutely obliged to combat illegal immigration. We cannot seriously say in our societies that it does not matter whether an immigrant is legal or illegal because, at the end of the day, the person who really loses out is the one who has been through all the legal procedures to seek shelter and work in a country. And there are mafias who are dedicated to human trafficking and illegal immigration, which is a very profitable business for those mafias and furthermore is connected to other crimes, such as drug-trafficking. Therefore, the implementation of an action plan against illegal immigration is one of the most important elements to have been carried out in Seville and naturally it is one of new elements to have been implemented during the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely believe, ladies and gentlemen, that common sense demands that we pay very special attention to the control of external borders and gradually improve that control until, on a Community level, we find a formula which we believe best guarantees our effectiveness, especially within the context of European enlargement. We have fundamental obligations to defend, control and monitor our external borders and we have fundamental obligations to be much more efficient through the use of common visas, groups of experts, security forces, working groups, special forces. We have many more obligations, especially – as I have said – within the context of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a significant innovation within the field of immigration, which is to incorporate it into the European Union’s cooperation policy. It is the first time this has happened, but all the agreements signed by the European Union with any country, from this point on, must include an immigration clause, just as they have clauses relating to the fight against terrorism and the defence of human rights. All agreements signed by the European Union from now on will contain a clause relating to commitments in the fight against illegal immigration. We are not talking about a controversial debate on any particular type of sanction. We are talking about considering the issue and saying the following: what happens when a country systematically refuses to comply with the agreements on the readmission of illegal immigrants? What happens when cooperation on technical resources in favour of one country are used not to combat illegal immigration but to favour illegal immigration? Can we seriously say that in this event the European Union must act as if nothing had happened? Are we going to continue to give technical or financial resources to countries that use them to favour and not to counteract illegal immigration? Ladies and gentlemen, I seriously believe that this is not a coherent, correct or serious position. It is precisely for this reason that I believe the Union should reserve its right to act accordingly if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing is therefore to be gained from failing to confront these problems. And as has been demonstrated recently, nothing is to be gained from confronting them with demagoguery. And neither do I believe that anything is to be gained from holding sterile debates on whether Europe should be a fortress or not. Europe must be possible and Europe has a capacity for reception which must be based on the law and on this basis we will undoubtedly create a positive immigration policy which is to everybody’s advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on this point relating to terrorism, certain very significant aspects have been implemented which have been progressing in Europe for years and in particular since 11 September 2001. I would like to say on this issue, ladies and gentlemen, that there can be no apology for any terrorist act, nor support for any terrorist act, and even less resignation in the face of any terrorist act. Terrorism and terrorists do not only include those who belong to an operative unit carrying out murders and attacks. Those who support, shelter, assist or fund terrorists also form part of the terrorist organisation …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… and are just as responsible for the actions of the terrorist organisation. I hope there is no European institution or institution in any Member State of the European Union that gives shelter or assistance to those who protect, fund or support terrorists. Because the only outcome of terrorism, in this regard, is moral, political and operational disaster. Winston Churchill said that no fate is destined to inevitably befall us, except where we do nothing to prevent it. Well I would like to say that what we must prevent at all times is allowing terrorists to be sheltered within institutions so that they can continue to commit crimes or continue to fund or support crimes in any part of the European Union or in any country of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the economy, I would like to say that the fundamental element and objective, as you know, is full employment. That is our objective, to achieve full employment. Practically every country in the European Union is currently undergoing social and labour reforms in order to try to come closer to full employment. It is precisely those countries with more unemployment problems that must work harder to implement these reforms. Full employment in Europe involves just two approaches: one is the stability pact, the foundation for sustainable and stable growth in Europe, and the other is the policy of reforms aimed at a more open, competitive and productive area. We cannot weaken the stability pact or fail to make reforms; we must instead maintain the stability pact and undertake reforms. In this way we will stimulate growth, we will increase competition and, above all, we will help to fulfil our objective, which is to have the greatest possible number of people working in Europe. If we weaken the stability pact and fail to promote reforms, however, we will not be able to fully implement Europe’s full employment policies.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My third consideration relates to enlargement. I would firstly like to clarify something: my hope and my desire is that the Nice timetable will be complied with. The Nice timetable expires at the end of 2002. We are therefore a good way through the Nice timetable. Secondly: the common positions on regional policy, institutional policy, the financial framework and agricultural policy have been adopted. Therefore, the mandate received by the Presidency to establish common policies has been carried out. Within the common policy, the common position on agriculture, we still need to determine the financial aspect, and this will happen in November. This has been the case because an agreement and a difficult consensus were achieved at the Seville European Council, where the only danger was that an agreement would not be reached and enlargement would be at risk. Therefore, in November we will be able to take decisions and in December we will have fulfilled the Nice timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do is apply the Community acquis and not call other policies into question: in other words to mix up the financial perspectives and Agenda 2000 – which is valid until 2006. To mix up the financial perspectives with enlargement is a mistake, in my opinion. And to mix up policy reforms with enlargement is another mistake. And to mix up all three things would lead to enlargement not taking place and that, of course, is not what the Spanish Presidency wants to promote.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external issues, I would like to say that over these months a common position has been established for Johannesburg. With regard to this common position it is essential that we take care not to re-open the Doha agreement or the Monterrey agreement, which took us so long to reach.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reform of the Council, I would like to say that decisions have been taken which do not imply a reform of the Treaties. Reform of the Treaties was not within the reach of the European Council, and that is what has led to these considerations. Reforms which do not involve a modification of the Treaties do, however, represent reasonable progress. With regard to the controversial debate on the presidencies, that debate is under way and many different views will be expressed. If someone says that they are not in favour of a six-month presidency or of a presidency of three, four or five years, they must say what they are in favour of, because the European Councils must be presided over in some way: six months, one year or two years, but the European presidencies must be organised in some way. Unless what is proposed is to put an end to the presidencies and the European Council, something of which I personally am not in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have given presentations to this House on three occasions and I have appeared here on three occasions. My hope and desire is that subsequent presidencies of the European Council will also fulfil this task of appearing before the House to give an assessment of the European Councils. We now have very important challenges – relating to institutions, enlargement, security, defence and economics – in our own countries and in the European Union. We will continue to contribute to the ongoing progress of the European Union so that we can effectively fulfil our objectives and our ambitions. That is why, after these six months of work, we can be reasonably satisfied, and this will provide us with the best basis for our future expectations.</p>

<p class="contents">The first point concerned further debate on the issue of terrorism. It has become clear that only close cooperation at European level can resolve the problems, and tangible progress has been made in the last six months on readmissions, on joint border control operations and on the joint visa system. Terrorism cannot be overcome through isolated measures: coordinated action is required, which it is our duty to take at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Another series of problems mentioned concerned international aid and the forthcoming Johannesburg Summit. I would like to focus briefly on this point for, after today’s and tomorrow’s debates, we will not meet again before this extremely important event at the end of August. With Monterrey and Kananaskis, the trend of constantly decreasing Third World aid has, to some extent, been reversed during these six months. I say “to some extent” because although, on the one hand, I welcome the fact that there has been a reversal of the trend, on the other, I am somewhat concerned that it may not have been as decisive or as convincing as we would all have liked. This concern has then been heightened by the difficulties encountered by the meeting held in Bali to prepare for Johannesburg. To answer your questions, I would like to say that, as far as the Commission is concerned, not only will the Development Directorate-General not be abolished, it will actually be strengthened. Indeed, I intend to launch a Community initiative for Africa, developing the Nepad lines defined at the Kananaskis G8 meeting. It is absolutely essential that we devote greater energy and vigour to Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I also want to touch on the issue of the Mediterranean, which has received a boost during the past six months. Here, too, however, the impetus is as yet insufficient to deal with the scale of the problems posed by this region. Everything we have said today about immigration, our security and our relations with the rest of the world is dependent upon a more effective, larger-scale Mediterranean policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of enlargement, the groundwork has been done for the negotiations to be concluded in Copenhagen. This was an extremely ambitious goal, but the Presidency and the Commission have pursued it resolutely and successfully. There is, of course, a great deal of speculation – and also a question mark – over the way these negotiations will go in future, particularly where agriculture is concerned. I have to say, quite frankly, that the Commission’s proposals are our only hope of reconciling the various demands and expectations in a situation in which our budget is limited but in which we also need to do everything we can to meet the needs of the farmers of the current Member States. We have committed all our remaining resources in direct aid. We have economised heavily in recent years and succeeded in getting the figure down to below 1.27, which is our limit, and although, when a further ten countries have joined the Union, we will manage to keep within the limit of 1.27, we will use up all our resources in the process. I still feel, however, that this is the only course open to us for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now briefly answer specific questions. Mr Bonde mentioned the famous telephone conversation between Mr Aznar and myself on the problems of the CFSP. I must say that this is a good way of working, that we have had at least 30 or 40 telephone conversations in these six months and that it is precisely because of this ongoing cooperation that we have been able to work for the common good. Indeed, I invite Mr Bonde to telephone me as well if he feels the need, so that we can coordinate our work.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Ireland, Mrs Doyle, I made it quite clear yesterday that there is no plan relating to the Irish referendum. Not only did I say that but I also said that there are no back doors or side doors either. I was absolutely clear and I hope that this explicit statement will be recorded in today’s Minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Imbeni asked some questions regarding our annual operating programme – this is a very important point – and the three-year programme laid down by the Seville European Council. I do not think I am wrong when I say that this annual programme is the only acceptable solution, within the constraints currently imposed by the length of the term of office of the Presidency of the institutions, which can provide coherent interinstitutional continuity. In other words, it will enable us to respect the term of the Presidencies of the institutions whilst facilitating long-term planning. As regards the annual programme, the Commission has started to make initial proposals within the framework of the APS procedure, which provides for an annual strategy, and these involve both Parliament and the Council. They are a practical way for us to start to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the three-year programme, the three institutions will have to reflect together on how to put this new idea to good use and how to avoid it becoming just a bureaucratic exercise. In this context, it would be useful to reflect on how the length of the programme and the length of the current term of the institutions can be reconciled and made as uniform as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">One last comment, in answer to another question from Mr Imbeni. I would like to take this opportunity to remember the expressions of great appreciation and esteem as well as of sorrow which were voiced in this House after the death of Professor Marco Biagi, who was barbarously murdered by terrorists.</p>
