There are 36 crossing points along this border where it is legally possible to cross. The figures quoted by the honourable Member refer to places where crossing the border between Croatia and Slovenia is physically possible but legally prohibited – for instance, footpaths, roads and bridges. I agree with the honourable Member that it is the reality on the ground – literally speaking – that deserves attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recalls that Slovenia must achieve a high level of external border control upon accession. The Commission is paying close attention to Slovenia's progress in the framework of the negotiations under the Justice and Home Affairs chapter, as well as in the pre-accession process. Slovenia is required to demonstrate its capability systematically to check all persons crossing external borders and to ensure effective border surveillance between authorised border crossing points.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Slovenia has prepared a detailed action plan for the implementation of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, as requested by the European Union. In its action plan, Slovenia has shown that it is taking the necessary steps to ensure that the appropriate infrastructure and equipment are allocated to the border with Croatia. In addition, Slovenia is taking measures to ensure greater coordination between its authorities involved in border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes also to underline that Slovenia is already engaged in intensive bilateral cooperation for control of the common border with Croatia. This should be further expanded by the conclusion of the agreement on simplified border checks on road and rail traffic and an agreement on cross-border police cooperation. The latter agreement will also encompass joint border patrols for the surveillance of the green border, that is between the authorised border crossing points.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the very substantial financial assistance granted to Slovenia for upgrading its border controls – this is financial assistance within the framework of the pre-accession process – the Commission is encouraging and directly supporting the bilateral cooperation between Slovenia and Croatia. This is funded under our assistance programme to Croatia for integrated border management, which will also cover border crossings with Slovenia.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovenia and Croatia have recently reached agreement on the demarcation of the common border. While, in the past, the lack of demarcation did not affect in practice the quality of the border controls and of the surveillance of the green and blue border, this agreement, once ratified, is additional proof of the good cooperation between the two countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everybody is aware that this is very difficult. My point is one that was raised with me by a minister in Ljubljana. All the crossings, whether they are legal or illegal, will be used by terrorists, smugglers, immigrants, criminals and so on. Therefore it is a very serious problem. The minister also said to me: we cannot pay; we do not have the money to man all these crossings! So Slovenia has got a real problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There are nine other applicant countries – if I leave aside Cyprus and Malta where it is presumably easier to control the borders – so we have ten applicant countries, all with problems like this, without enough money to meet the cost.

<p class="contents">Concerning the association agreements, 2001 started with the good news of Egypt’s decision to initial the association agreement and negotiations are ongoing with Algeria, Lebanon and Syria. My second point concerns the association agreement signatories developing free trade between each other. We are encouraging each association agreement signatory to agree on free trade arrangements with the others so as to facilitate economic cooperation and inward investment. The Commission is working with the countries which have already started this process to see where technical advice can best be provided to help partners reach agreement. In parallel we are working on the rules of origin to see how the partners can be brought into the pan-European system.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to lay the basis for a Euro-Med internal market so as to fully exploit the future free trade area, we are assisting our partners to bring their regulatory frameworks closer to ours. During 2001 the Commission has further developed a concept of the Euro-Med internal market, provided information about its implications and opportunities, and we have paid particular attention to internal market issues in MEDA programming. Cooperation is being strengthened across a range of sectors. The regional economic dialogue is being reinforced with future discussions focusing on growth and employment. MEDA is being used to examine certain infrastructure needs from a regional or subregional perspective and, where appropriate, to draw up strategies for interconnection and for linkage with the trans-European networks to ensure that priority projects are funded and implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with our partners we are developing a new regional MEDA programme on justice and home affairs and are engaged in discussions on these issues bilaterally in relation to the provisions of the association agreements and in MEDA programming.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning new instruments and mechanisms, in recognition that cooperation between Europe and Mediterranean countries cannot be solely political or economic, the Commission is looking at ways to initiate a new broad-based cultural dialogue in the Mediterranean region. In this regard, in addition to the programmes which are currently being implemented to support cooperation in cultural heritage, audiovisual activities and youth exchanges, the Commission is examining the feasibility of extending the TEMPUS programme for higher education to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to new structures for dialogue, the Commission will bring forward proposals to adapt the working methods of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, in particular to provide for more frequent political dialogue on regional and international issues. The Commission will launch a policy dialogue with the Mediterranean partners on employment policy, sharing EU experience on ways of combating unemployment and of creating new jobs. It will work to improve the available information and statistics as part of ongoing efforts to channel legal migration and to combat illegal migration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission will consider ways to stimulate investment and joint development projects in the Mediterranean, for example by studying the need for, and feasibility of, a new bank or other financing mechanism, building on the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add some information concerning the performance this year of the activities in the MEDA programme. For this year, there are commitments under MEDA of about EUR 740 million in the budget which are expected to be fully implemented. The same is true of other budget lines benefiting the Mediterranean partners. As far as payments are concerned, they are expected to represent over 56% of commitments this year to reach nearly half a billion euro, in fact the best ever result achieved in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">This year is also the first year of the implementation of the revised MEDA regulation which puts in place mechanisms for more coherent programming of the aid, better coordination both with partners and with the other major donors, and more streamlined approval procedures inside the EU. Consultations have already taken place with the partners and with the other donors on the country and regional strategy papers covering 2002 to 2006 and on the more detailed national and regional indicative programmes for 2002 to 2004. All these documents should be approved by the end of the year. I am reporting these details because I do not want to miss this opportunity to inform Parliament about the MEDA Programme which has been quite problematic in the past. We are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the Commissioner has given us a variety of reasons to think that the European Commission is taking the same approach as Parliament. We must prevent one of the greatest successes of European Union external policy, the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean process, from entering a period of stagnation. This process must not be limited to Euro-Mediterranean summits or ministerial meetings, such as the one which is going to take place next April under the Spanish Presidency in Valencia. It is therefore necessary to implement mechanisms which lower the level in a vertical sense and also broaden it in a horizontal sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest that, with regard to what the Commissioner has already said, we add, the possibility of relations between civil society, trade unions, women’s organisations, young people, as he has also already mentioned, and, of course, the cultural field. I would like to hear the Commission’s views in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: African children sold into slavery in Europe</span></p>
<p class="contents">The BBC recently raised the issue of the increasing trade in child trafficking from Africa to Europe. There are thought to be around 10 000 West African children living with strangers in the UK alone, and the trade appears to extend across the European Union. Parents are persuaded that a new and better life awaits their offspring in Europe and send them off to live with distant family and friends in order to receive an education. In reality, children are put to work as domestic slaves, some are beaten and abused – they rarely set foot in a classroom.</p>
<p class="contents">The BBC highlighted the apparent ease of bribing West African officials to buy genuine papers to enable children to be taken to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission indicate whether it is aware of the level of this trade and whether it has statistics from the Member States to quantify the problem? Has it considered whether coordinating action can be taken at Community level to bring an end to this appalling practice and confirm that the OECD Convention on Bribery and Corruption, aimed at discouraging the bribing of public officials in third world countries, has been ratified by the Commission and by all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the situation in the European Union, a study has been finalised with support from the Stop programme. The title of the report is 'Trafficking in unaccompanied minors for sexual exploitation in the European Union'. It was carried out by the International Organisation for Migration and is available on the IOM's website.</p>
<p class="contents">The report includes figures from Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. The Commission is also shortly expecting a report from Defence for Children International in the Netherlands. They have carried out a study on the extent to which children are trafficked for sexual purposes into the European Union, how they get here, what happens to them next and what can be done to help them. Furthermore, for 2002 the Stop II programme will support a follow-up and extension of the IOM report through a seminar on trafficking in unaccompanied minors in EU Member States. Additional research on the situation in France, Greece and Spain will form part of the preparations of this seminar.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards action against trafficking in human beings, the Commission has been developing a comprehensive policy to fight and prevent such trafficking in human beings over the past few years. The most recent example is the agreement reached on 28 September 2001 on the Commission's proposal for a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings. The framework decision essentially concerns approximation of criminal laws and penalties to improve and facilitate law enforcement and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission confirms that the political dialogue under the Cotonou Agreement and EU support for good governance in ACP countries have given real opportunities to address the human and social aspects of this practice, as well as the corruption elements that may be linked to it. Moreover, as poverty and lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for children being trafficked, the poverty-reduction approach of our development cooperation is a meaningful basis for attacking the problem. It gives a priority to equitable growth and better access to education.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also implementing actions and coordination with UNICEF and a large number of NGOs in several African countries where this problem is most acute. In June 2000, in Cotonou, in Benin I had the strange experience of visiting two projects we were funding from the Commission. One project was helping abandoned children, the other helping abducted children. In the same city we had two groups of beneficiaries: one project was for street children or orphans or simply abandoned children, and the other was for children who had been freed by the project from being enslaved. It was very strange to experience. We went from one project to another and were told about two different ways in which children find themselves in very serious situations. We are pleased with our cooperation with NGOs in many countries in trying to do something meaningful here.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is not envisaged that the Community as such will ratify the OECD Convention on Bribery and Corruption which is mentioned in the question, as its Member States are ratifying this convention. At present all Member States, except Ireland, have ratified the convention and it is expected that Ireland will ratify it very shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps he could confirm whether my own Member State is involved or whether it will be brought in in the future. If not, maybe this is something that I, along with others, can do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in terms of the work outlined and personal experience, particularly in relation to the issue of providing information to the parents of children – to some extent setting aside the issues I raised in my question, as it is clear from the BBC report that parents of children are being completely misled by people wishing to exploit their offspring – are there perhaps grounds for involving the EU in some sort of campaign to overcome this problem of misinforming parents, to try and tackle the issue at source. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 20 October 2001, five people died as a result of a fire which broke out while they were working on board a tanker. It is thought likely that the tank in which they were working had not been properly cleaned. Similar fatal industrial accidents occur frequently in ship-repair yards in Greece while tankers are undergoing maintenance. The Greek judicial authorities responded to the last accident by initiating criminal proceedings, inter alia for infringement of Presidential Decree 70/90 concerning the health and safety of workers engaged in shipbuilding and ship repair work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years have passed since the Presidential Decree passed into law and, in the meantime, a number of Community directives on the protection of workers in such conditions have also been issued. Will the Commission say whether there are any directives and accompanying measures concerning the health and safety of workers applicable to working conditions on board tankers, whether they have been incorporated into Greek national law, and whether Presidential Decree 70/90 now covers the obligations deriving from Community legislation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reply to Mr Alavanos's question as to whether there are any directives and accompanying measures concerning the safety of workers on board tankers, which should have been incorporated into Greek law, is that there are no new measures and no new legislative framework which should have been transposed and that framework directive 89/391, which covers both shipbuilding and the ship repair industry, was transposed into Greek law so as to cover working conditions in such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">This specific accident is being investigated by the Greek authorities and the European Union is waiting for the final results of the investigation into the causes so that measures can be taken, in collaboration with the Greek government, in order to prevent this sort of accident from happening again.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the health and safety strategy is on the European Commission's list of priorities. There is a huge number of deaths every year at European level. The new health and safety strategy is due to be announced in 2002, and the report on the application of European health and safety legislation at national level is being drafted as we speak, by which I mean that we are drafting a European report to evaluate the extent to which each country applied the health and safety specifications applicable to each sector last year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to ask the following supplementary question: having studied the texts, not that I have any highly specialised legal knowledge in these matters, I found other directives which, to judge from their titles, appear to relate to the matter under discussion here. Directives 89/656 and 99/92 concern explosive atmospheres and work in such atmospheres, which is what caused the accident in Perama. Surely these directives have a bearing on the matter?

<p class="contents">There have been charges relating to the application of national legislation, there has been an exchange of correspondence which started in the summer, in August to be precise, between the Greek government and the European Commission, staff from my directorate have visited Greece and examined the institutional framework and its application and we have requested additional information further to a letter sent by the Greek government on 9 November. We believe that the information sent is being processed at the moment and other information has also been requested, so that we can make a full evaluation of the level of application of legislation in the case of the specific directives to which you referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important that regulations governing health and safety at work are applied in the field of shipping, especially where oil tankers are concerned. It is also of crucial importance to comply with environmental legislation. Since the Erika disaster, we have had several projects in Europe that have aimed to improve environmental legislation with regard to oil tankers. </p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday an oil spillage was discovered close to a nature conservation area in the archipelago off Turku, in Finland, probably due to some breach of environmental legislation – or at least the reason for it has not yet become apparent. I would therefore like the Commissioner to comment on what measures can also be taken with regard to environmental legislation so that culprits may be identified, and on whether it is possible that the Commission might also take action regarding the kinds of oil-related accidents that occurred last year in Gotland, on the French coast (with regard to the Erika disaster), and now in Turku in Finland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as far as the specific issue of the health and safety of workers on tankers is concerned, I have to say, first, that European legislation which applies to building sites also applies here and, secondly, that there is a specific directive on fishing vessels, which are a separate class of ship, and a directive on the provision of medical care on board ships.

As I said earlier, the European Commission has put the strategy on health and safety on its list of priorities and harmonised statistics from the EU Statistical Office will be the basis for the proper development of this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has published two harmonised statistical methodologies since 1990. The first is the ESAW, the European Statistics on Accidents at Work, with 1993 as the reference year. The second is the EODS, the European Statistics on Occupational Diseases, with 2001 as the reference year. Provision was made for a special unit for work-related health problems in the 1999 survey on employees. As far as accidents at work since 1993 are concerned, the Commission has annual statistics available for nine economic sectors. These statistics come from various national sources and include statistics from Greece and, once they have been received from the Member States, they are adjusted by the Statistical Office in order to estimate the total number of accidents and ensure that they are comparable at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards your comment on statistics supplied by Greece in comparison with other countries, the statistics provided by Greece are supplied by IKA, the Social Security Fund, and only refer to a proportion of accidents because only accidents which result in more than three days off work are reported. According to IKA estimates, 39% of accidents are reported, which compares with Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, although we must bear in mind that 45% of Greeks who are self-employed are insured with IKA. However, we know that, in 1999 in Greece, 43.4% were employers, self-employed or employees of family businesses, while the corresponding European average, according to Eurostat, was 16.2%. As part of the new Community strategy on safety, the Commission intends to recommend measures to improve the reporting of accidents at work and occupational diseases which, we believe, will help promote this strategy in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must stress that the efficient implementation of national provisions transposing Community directives, especially those relating to the employer's duty to report accidents sustained by employees at work is a matter for national governments. It is very hard for the European Commission to monitor the situation at national and regional level, let alone at enterprise level. So it is important for each country to set up national mechanisms to monitor health and safety issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The objectives of this dialogue, as of others too, and I will come back to this, are in a sense to build bridges across the Atlantic by bringing together a number of private, non-governmental players on the one hand and political decision-makers in the Union and the US Administration on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">This system of dialogues that was established at the time certainly includes the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, but also includes a Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, a Transatlantic Labour Dialogue and a Transatlantic Environment Dialogue; the business aspect being one of the pillars of this dialogue, which includes three others.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this range of dialogues is to draw up public recommendations addressed to the Commission and to the US government, which, on a rotational basis, present their recommendations to the political leaders at the EU-US summits.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission for its part attaches the same importance to all these dialogues, and we emphasise this because it has produced valuable results in terms of a number of developments, and certainly in terms of creating more balanced and solid transatlantic relations. Participation in these various dialogues is open. It is open to the parties concerned, in the various areas, and the results are obviously largely a question of how much the various participants invest in them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is involved at different levels in the events that are organised in the context of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, including an annual conference between the CEOs of the various companies, which could be said to form the annual highpoint of this dialogue. The recommendations are published and available to the public, both on the website of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue and on the Commission sites, since our reactions to these recommendations are also in the public domain. In fact, some Members of this Parliament closely monitor the bilateral US-EU bilateral business relations and are invited to take part in the annual conference of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">When the first dialogue was arranged in Seville, the two sides shared the costs of this event. In 1998, at another EU-US summit, both sides undertook to support all the dialogues and in fact that same year the European Parliament created a specific budget heading to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to your specific question about financing, since 1998 the Commission has contributed to the financing of the business dialogue, as, incidentally, it has contributed to financing the other dialogues in the form of annual contributions. In the case of the business dialogue, part of the Commission’s contribution was designed to cover the costs of organising the annual conferences, although most of the costs of these events are now covered by the business sponsorship system. That in fact explains why the Commission gives markedly less financial support to the business dialogue than it does to supporting the consumer dialogue, the labour dialogue and the environment dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The major companies in TABD are making a number of practical demands, or expressing their wishes, in connection with legislation they want to see within the EU.

This contribution is, therefore, far from being exclusive. Since we are engaging with a number of people from the business world, with trade unions, with non-governmental organisations, we have a whole range of bodies that are contributing to trade policy, part of which is the dialogue on trade. This dialogue is important because the European and American business world is putting a considerable effort into this, which is commensurate with the importance of our trade relations with America.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework provides the opportunity for desires and wishes to be expressed, and recommendations and comments to be presented. We discuss these, as we do with a number of representatives in the area of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to participation at the summit, as I said earlier, those taking part in these dialogues on business, consumers, the environment and employment are, in turn, urged to come and present their recommendations to the leaders of the two sides, in other words to the American president on the one hand, and to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">This is being done in conjunction with the summit’s official meetings, which, as expected, bring us together with the responsible political authorities. This is being done in conjunction with these events. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I shall give you some background information. Any member country of the World Trade Organisation can stand as candidate to organise the ministerial conference. It turned out that Qatar offered to host the Fourth Ministerial Conference, and that it was the only candidate. If we cast our minds back, so that we have a clear understanding, this decision was due to be taken several months after the Seattle conference, which may explain why there were not as many candidates as some might have wished.</p>
<p class="contents">Doha was, therefore, the only candidate city and it is relatively small in size. Nevertheless, I think that the authorities made a considerable effort – this was something that all those taking part in the ministerial conference mentioned – to be in a position to offer the delegates appropriate accommodation and provide the necessary logistical support. It is true that several delegations had to restrict the number of their participants due to the limited number of hotel rooms. That is true. However, I do not think that it is a catastrophe to slightly restrict the number of participants at such conferences. In any case, I am sure that this saved the taxpayer some money and as for the delegation from the European Union, we were pleased with the way the conference was organised. Furthermore, 20 Members of the European Parliament were in the EU delegation and I believe that they said they were satisfied with the way everything was organised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that logistical matters were not helped by the events of 11 September and that many security measures were added to the checks that are normally applied at such conferences. That is true, and it did not make anyone’s life any easier. I would like to reiterate that, as I also said to Parliament some time ago, we asked the Qatar authorities for access for the non-governmental organisations and were granted it. This is what happened, even if the security restrictions caused some difficulties for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point that I would like to stress is that, again for security reasons, a large number of potential participants, whether governmental delegations, parliamentary delegations or non-governmental organisations, decided on their own initiative not to come to Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, NGOs were offered genuine opportunities to put their case at Doha. The organisations that were present were able to contact their national delegations, were able to influence the outcome of the conference and we at Commission level widely encouraged transparency towards the non-governmental organisations. For instance, documents were discussed quickly, meetings were held openly, and everything that favours transparency has been, in my view, significantly improved over the last two years by the WTO secretariats, has been supported, encouraged, and even initiated by the European Union. Furthermore, the Director-General of the WTO arranged a number of meetings, in accordance with the commitment that he had made at the conference held in Geneva in July. I willingly take on board the idea of a code of conduct, which could regulate relations between the WTO and the non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to our own delegation, I said that it was made up of a number of MEPs, a number of colleagues of Franz Fischler and myself, more than fifteen representatives of civil society, who valiantly made the journey to Doha and who all achieved the goals they had set themselves. We worked together with them at Doha. If any one of them wishes to give their opinion, I have no objection to them doing so. I myself had many intensive discussions with these representatives during the conference, and also with the representatives of other organisations from European civil society, who were not, strictly speaking, part of our delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, if I compare Doha to Seattle, I think that we had better participation, greater transparency, a more lively reflection, and that the organisations present had a genuine opportunity to put their case. This certainly had an effect on the outcome of the Doha Conference. I spoke to you this morning on that subject. Overall I think that progress has been made in the way that civil society is managing to make its voice heard as regards multilateral trade policy. This happened between the Seattle and Doha Conferences, this happened at Doha and I am certain that this will happen more often after Doha. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, if everything was the way you describe it and Doha really was better than Seattle, how, then, do you explain the numerous complaints by NGOs that they were disadvantaged in the run-up to the event, that they could not get visas issued to them and that they were deterred from active involvement by bureaucratic obstacles being put in their way or by being told that there were too few hotel beds?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you have just described the narrow field of vision experienced by the European delegation, and how our delegation was composed. That was not, however, what my question was about; I was asking, rather, about the extent to which civil society could consider itself represented there, my point being that the situation was quite different from that in a country in which there is the freedom to demonstrate and the corresponding possibility of self-expression. If though, you do not see things that way, I would very much like you to confirm that a second time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If my memory serves me well, there were approximately 4 500 rooms and, again if I remember correctly, about 700 of these had been reserved for the non-governmental organisations, meaning of course those NGOs that were present in that capacity, apart from those NGOs who were part of the delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the context of the European Union, and I suppose that it is essentially the EU that is of interest to you – it is, in any case, of primary interest to me – we are very lucky to participate in such conferences with 15 Member States, which themselves bring a number of NGOs along with their own delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, from the European standpoint, many NGOs were present and I heard no complaints about this issue, either before or during any of the many meetings that I had with these organisations. As far as what happens next, I will be taking part in a status meeting next week which will enable me to come to an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, if you wish to hear first-hand information, those who were there will be able to give you the details.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the NGOs were able to take the initiative in Doha. Either I myself or my colleagues on my behalf spent time each day explaining to them (as I did for Parliament’s delegations and, of course, for the Council of Ministers) where we were coming from, what stage we had reached and where we were heading, so that they could follow the work and influence it. As you know, when you meet a delegation of this type which is able explain a few crucial points, this is what counts in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that, from this perspective, things were much better at Doha than at Seattle. I would reiterate what I said earlier, with Doha being the only candidate city, competition and the law of the market concerning the appeal of the conference location did not really play a part. This is an issue that we can only take note of; since Doha was the only candidate city, I cannot see what other choice we had. I reiterate that we ourselves specified the condition that access be offered on an equal basis for all the delegations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the reasons why Doha was better than Seattle – and, in my view, this is the main reason – was because everyone (the governments, the WTO, the NGOs) gave much thought as to why Seattle failed. Everyone learnt a great deal from this failure after the event, if I may say so, and took lessons from it in preparation for Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why Doha was a success was, in the main, related to preparation. The reason why Seattle was a failure was, in the main, related to preparation. The preparations for Seattle were poor, the preparations for Doha were good, and that is what counts for around 80% of the success. That basically leaves 20%. In Doha, things were well managed and the number of parties, in other words, the number of people who felt involved in the negotiations, who felt able to influence them, was considerable. I always thought that what happened in the streets of Seattle only had a very small bearing on what was obviously a failure. Similarly, I believe that what did not take place in the streets of Doha only had a very small bearing on the success of Doha. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What Mr Hans-Peter Martin is referring to, though, is the dialogue with the NGOs, a point I would like to probe further with reference to the Parliamentary Assembly. I do not believe it is feasible for this discussion to be carried on every couple of years and at the same location.

You know, as I do, that we have worked on this area, and this House was a primary contributor. We have not managed to set up anything with any shape or form for the time being, for reasons that mainly relate, on the one hand, to the great reluctance of a number of developing countries, and on the other hand, to the fact that the members of the American Congress have not, as yet, shown any particular enthusiasm for the idea. These two barriers are still standing in our way, but I believe that we must not give up, and, in any case, if Parliament continues to move in the direction it has chosen, namely to attempt to set up this inter-parliamentary structure, you will have the support of the Commission in striving to overcome the obstacles that I have just mentioned, which are still standing in the way but which, in my view, must not deter us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Travelling times, as with other parameters such as temperatures or densities, are essential elements to achieve a good level of protection for the animals during transport. As a matter of policy, the Commission considers it to be of the utmost importance to draft legislative proposals on the basis of sound scientific advice. The Commission has therefore requested an opinion from the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on different welfare aspects of animal transport and, in particular, travelling time limits. This opinion is expected early in 2002. The Commission will present further proposals on animal transport in the light of this opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the granting of export refunds for slaughtered cattle, the Commission shares the views of the Council, as expressed in its resolution of 19 June 2001 on welfare. The first objective is to correct the deficiencies observed with the implementation of existing legislation. There should be more controls and severe sanctions if the existing legislation on welfare during transport is not correctly implemented, be it on transport inside the Community or on exports to countries outside the EU. Commissioner Fischler is also committed to strengthening the existing rules in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation in the field of export refunds unambiguously links the payment of aid to the respect of all the conditions related to animal welfare. The Community must achieve a well-balanced solution to the different aspects of this question. For example, it is wrong to assume that if we abolish the refund for live cattle, third countries will import carcases rather than live animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by assuring you that animal welfare is very high on the agenda of the Commission. Animal transport in particular deserves much attention and action in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1999, we had further evidence of particular problems in Spain, Italy and Greece. There is no reason to believe that implementation enforcement has improved at all since 1993 or 1999. Animals frequently still find themselves crammed into overcrowded trucks, given neither food nor water, often for journeys flouting the current limits and travelling for up to 30 or 40 hours. The combination of high temperatures, poor ventilation, overcrowding and lack of water can be lethal. Many animals suffer extreme discomfort during transport and arrive dead or dying at their destination.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has repeatedly voted in favour of an eight-hour limit on transport. It had the overwhelming support of a majority in plenary. It had the support of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I am pleased to hear that a proposal will follow the opinion of the Scientific Committee, but what is the Commission going to do to ensure the proposal is enforced properly and to ensure the current laws are enforced properly? What specific actions is Commissioner Byrne going to take to improve enforcement both of current laws and the laws that we hope to see implementing an eight-hour limit and an end to export subsidies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already seen how animal nutrition has significance for people’s health, but the ways in which we treat animals and the methods and systems we use to feed and transport them in fact affect public health as directly as does poor animal feed. If these matters are not handled in the right way, there is a significant increase in the risk of diseases. These are mainly cured with antibiotics, but large quantities of tranquillisers are also used.</p>
<p class="contents">One consequence of antibiotics being misused as a result of poor animal husbandry is that what, during the last 60 years, have been simple infections are now – and, above all, <span class="italic">will be </span>in the future – significantly more serious when antibiotics are no longer available to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a close association between the two and definitely a connection in the sense that you make reference to – antibiotics. The Commission has brought forward legislation in that regard and I refer you to the conference that took place only a couple of weeks ago under the auspices of the Belgian presidency on this particular issue. I refer you to what I said on that occasion and also to what Minister Magda Aelvoet said in relation to that particularly important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I also make reference to the zoonosis directive which has gone through the Commission and is now before Parliament. Mrs Paulsen is your rapporteur for that particular piece of legislation and I identify that legislation as also being important in addressing the question of animal health as an influencing factor on human health.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one final point on this question, in relation to the transport of animals over long distances. One of the issues that has to be weighed in the balance and borne in mind is the location and quality of abattoirs and meat plants: they need to be up to the high standards necessary to comply with the legislation passed here in this House and by the Council of Ministers. The investment needed to achieve these standards means that there are now fewer abattoirs than there used to be and this is necessary in order to comply with the legislation for the protection of human health. But ultimately it also affects the question of animal transport and the transport of live animals over a longer distance. That, however, is another issue that has to be borne in mind in determining the protection of human health in respect of animals, animal health and animal welfare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Danish newspaper Politiken reported on 15 November 2001 that the EU was to raise limit values to allow more heavy metal in fish despite a recommendation from an EU committee of experts that stricter standards should be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Mercury, lead and cadmium, which are found in shellfish for which there is high demand, can, for example, weaken the nervous system and cause other very serious diseases in humans. There are absolutely no grounds for raising these limit values. Will the Commission therefore say why these limit values are to be raised, on which studies any increase may be based, and which studies are opposed to any increase?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out in this connection that the population of Denmark has long been encouraged to eat more fish as it promotes the general level of public health. Unfortunately, these endeavours will now be to no avail if, at the same time, the EU intends to raise the limit values for noxious heavy metals in fish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When EU legislation on contaminants is established, if the intake levels are below safety thresholds, the principle known as ALARA must be followed. This involves setting maximum levels as low as reasonably achievable. This is an internationally applied approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In this specific case, the Commission adopted limits for lead and cadmium to come into force in April 2002. Concerns were expressed at the time by the Member States in the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs that the new provisions were not achievable for certain fishery products. It was agreed, therefore, urgently to review the relevant provisions. From recent data, it became clear that these limits would impose requirements beyond the scope of what is reasonably achievable, without benefit to public health. Therefore, the maximum levels in certain fishery products were reviewed and slight increases for certain limited species are now being proposed to take account of this reality. To set unachievable limits is not defensible. Given the overall intake levels, the revised maximum levels do not increase the risk to public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are concerned here with ordinary, edible fish and shellfish, of which we normally recommend people in Europe to eat plenty. I therefore find it worrying that there is now a desire to increase the limit values. I must ask a couple of supplementary questions. Is it correct that the Committee of Independent Experts has in actual fact recommended a reduction in the limit values? Is it correct that the United States has stricter limit values in these areas than we have in Europe? Finally, I want to ask who has asked for these limit values to be increased. Is it the fishing industry and, if so, in which countries does the fishing industry want permission for higher limit values for the heavy metals at issue here: lead, cadmium and mercury? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That remains unchanged as previously set under veterinary legislation, in particular Commission Decision 93/351. The only proposed change is that two additional species have been added to the list of fish species for the maximum level of 1 mg/kg. These are the grenadier fish and the emperor fish which are minor contributors to diet, but data showed the lower level was unachievable.</p>
<p class="contents">You then asked me about shellfish. The proposals will not increase the safety level of eating shellfish for either children or adults. The only proposed change for limits in shellfish as bivalve molluscs is for lead. A slight increase from 1 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg is proposed, because data shows that the lower level for lead is not reasonably achievable. Exposure to lead in the diet is well within safe limits. Otherwise, there is no change for provisions on cadmium or mercury. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: 'Smiling face' food quality label</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 1 October 2001 the Danish food inspectorate began to have its reports put up in the 40 000 or so establishments in that country producing or selling food and drink to the public. The idea is that within a year all of them will be prominently displaying at least one report, clearly expressing the outcome of the official inspection in a label taking the form of one of four different facial expressions.</p>
<p class="contents">A broad smile for example will mean that no adverse comments were made after the most recent inspection, while a really cross face will show that the establishment was fined, reported to the police or had its permit withdrawn. It would be hard to find a better way of conveying clear consumer information.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of this new Danish system? If so, is it prepared to recommend other Member States to follow suit? If not, does it not feel that the system deserves closer study as a possible basis for future rules on the matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Member States are responsible for carrying out the official control of foodstuffs at all stages of production and distribution. It is for them to decide how best to inform the consumer about these activities. This is in line with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission is not aware of this particular initiative by the Danish authorities, it can encourage such steps or the voluntary implementation of such initiatives by other Member States, but it is unlikely to make a similar proposal at Community level.

The meat from the remaining operational slaughterhouses that is judged fit for human consumption can be marketed on the national territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The last inspection mission on fresh meat carried out in Greece by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office was in September 2000 in relation to porcine meat. This mission identified serious wide-ranging deficiencies in the operation of official controls and production standards in this sector. As the honourable Member is aware from the reply to his earlier question at the November session, there have been follow-up contacts with the Greek authorities during 2001 in an attempt to resolve the problems found. To date the action taken has not been satisfactory and the Commission remains very concerned about the situation. Further high level meetings with the Greek authorities are planned for early 2002 in an attempt to resolve the remaining shortcomings in food safety and veterinary control standards.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to waste water treatment, Council Directive 91/271 concerning urban waste water treatment foresees rules for slaughterhouses. Waste water above a particular volume must meet conditions established in prior regulations and or specific authorisations by the competent authority since 31 December 2000. Where slaughterhouses discharge directly into the public sewer, the general rules of the directive are valid. Detailed information on the situation of industrial discharges in Greece is under assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has led to further interaction between the minister, the relevant authorities in Greece and my own services.
