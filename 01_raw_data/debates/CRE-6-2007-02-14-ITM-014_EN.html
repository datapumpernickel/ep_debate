<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michael Gahler (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, developing countries, too, are experiencing structural change or dislocation in the age of globalisation: politically, socially and in terms of the impact of climate change. These are often countries that have either not had any involvement or had insufficient involvement with sustainable development up to now. We note that previous approaches to help give people in these countries better prospects in life have had either no success or insufficient success. Budget support – the subject of this own-initiative report – is one of the recognised instruments of EU development cooperation today. It already accounts for over 20% of European Development Fund resources – and there is an upward trend.</p>
<p class="contents">With the right framework, budget support can be an effective instrument of development cooperation. It involves donors and recipients opting for a partnership-based approach to development cooperation. Both parties must truly want this partnership, however, as the donor provides funds for the sole use of the recipient with no preconditions. A requirement is that agreement be reached on the recipient’s development strategies and programmes to be supported: in particular, comprehensive poverty-reduction strategies. Donor and recipient agree that the success of this support will be reviewed on the basis of many performance indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has found an approach that has received a great deal of attention and also met with much approval. This approach divides the promised payments up into fixed and variable tranches, with payment of the variable tranches being dependent on the achievement of objectives by the recipient. I envisage this instrument having great value and benefit in principle in instituting general policy dialogue between donor and recipient. The actors who are ultimately negotiating the budget support with the recipient have access to and input in the policies and national budget of the recipient. Partners willing to enter into cooperation can thus develop and review all key policy fields and measures together.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament must ask ourselves at this juncture how this benefit will be reflected in our work, for example with regard to the discussion of Commission strategy papers. Will the knowledge we gain or our input into development cooperation also change as a result? Will we be better able to account for the use of our development assistance and have better results to show for it, both now and in the future? Have we developed sufficient expertise to use this instrument?</p>
<p class="contents">Last May’s evaluation by the OECD/DAC Evaluation Network on the basis of seven countries advises caution with regard to the assessment of budget support, stating that it is still too soon to carry out any real evaluation of this young instrument. We must also recognise when budget support is inappropriate or should be withdrawn. Donors should resist the temptation to be attracted to budget support because of its potential use in accelerating the disbursement of funds, or so that they can boast at international level about being an effective donor who also upholds the principle of recipient ownership. This must never be reduced to a matter of the disbursement of funds, or of merely paying lip service to the proper use of funds. In terms of effectiveness, too, budget support must always be examined from the point of view of whether it is really a better way of achieving the desired objectives than other instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The instrument of budget support cannot be used if, on the part of the recipient, ‘public expenditure management is [not] sufficiently transparent, accountable and effective’, if no ‘well-defined macroeconomic or sectoral policies established by the country itself and agreed to by its main donors are in place’, or if ‘public procurement is [not] open and transparent’.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 61(2) of the Cotonou Agreement, from which I have just quoted, makes this clear. Only if these preconditions are met will direct budgetary assistance be granted as support or for sectoral reforms. Another interesting element is that budget support has to be tied to a process of reform. There is no budget support for the preservation of the status quo.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, a process of reform also entails the development of a culture of accountability in these countries and thus also the involvement of parliaments and the supreme audit institutions in the evaluation. This is an important point for us Members of the European Parliament, in particular, in terms of our cooperation with our counterparts in these countries. For this reason, I hope that, thanks to this report and this evaluation, we reach a stage where we can strengthen dialogue in the particular countries where we consider the Commission has been a little incautious, with a view to clarifying whether, at the end of the day, budget support is really the best instrument for those concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joaquín Almunia,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Mr Gahler and his colleagues for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that, in order to consolidate the governments’ capacity to plan and implement macroeconomic reforms, sectoral reforms and reforms of their public finances, and also to stimulate growth and alleviate poverty, budget aid can be more effective than other kinds of aid, provided that certain eligibility conditions are met. I would like to stress that last caveat; provided that certain eligibility conditions are met.</p>
<p class="contents">Budget aid provides funding with regard to the capital costs and the spending necessary in order to achieve the millennium development objectives, such as the construction of schools, hospitals or roads, paying teachers, nurses and maintaining infrastructures, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, by supporting a country's budget, rather than a specific project, not only are the transaction costs reduced, but also, at the same time, local authorities are given more responsibility for the use of the funds, provided that there is a mechanism for controlling the use of those funds in the beneficiary countries. That is one of the eligibility conditions that I mentioned just now.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience over recent years demonstrates that budgetary support can – and in fact often does – meet these expectations. This is confirmed by the highly positive assessment made last year by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee of the support for the general budget in seven countries analysed by that committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased with the comments in Mr Gahler's report on budgetary aid as a fundamental instrument of the European Union’s development cooperation. This is something that was also expressed in the European consensus on development, approved last year. This consensus, this joint declaration by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, commits us to increasing budget aid, provided that conditions allow it. We are working intensively with the Member States and other bodies in order to ensure that this commitment is fulfilled, in full compliance with the established legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to respond to an issue raised in Mr Gahler's report, but which we believe is not entirely in line with reality. According to our analysis, budget aid is not synonymous with a lack of prudence or with bad management, but rather the opposite. The Commission applies strict eligibility criteria when deciding which countries should receive budget aid. Those criteria are reassessed before each payment, within the framework of the general aid programme. The objective is to minimise the risk of budget aid being squandered and trying to prevent it from being used inappropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, improving the management of public finances is a key objective of our budget aid. Our approach is to assess the direction and credibility of the reforms of public finance management that our aid may support, and not so much to demand that any specific minimum standards are adhered to. This approach is shared by other budget aid bodies and was not questioned in the 2005 Special Report of the Court of Auditors, whose main recommendations have been taken into account by the Commission in drawing up a revised series of guidelines for budget aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We entirely agree with the report’s demand that institutions playing a crucial role in controlling the executive be consolidated, but we believe that these institutions must be national, conforming to the local political framework, and not foreign bodies that must answer to donors. Generally speaking, the Commission believes that good governance, which is crucial to development, cannot be imposed from the outside. The establishment of innovative associations, drawn up in accordance with the initiative on governance and with the Commission’s Communication on this issue, is a promising way to promote good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, even though the positive conclusions of recent independent assessments of budget aid are encouraging, we agree on the need continually to assess the effectiveness of budget aid and guarantee that the results are communicated clearly, in order to obtain the citizens’ support for development cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, even European Union citizens in difficult circumstances wish to help those who are less fortunate still, but only on the condition that the money reaches people in genuine need. We should ensure that our aid does not give rise to rumour and innuendo. Following the tsunami, for example, it has been alleged that, instead of rebuilding damaged dwellings, canny entrepreneurs are evicting the population from the coastal strip on the pretext of safety measures and then using our funds to build commercial hotels for tourists. Let us hope that nothing of the kind has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">What should be supported? I would highlight two aims. Firstly, we should support education, including the creation of a civil society. That involves ongoing long-term investment, which is essential, although its results are not immediately obvious. No innovation or development is possible without it. Secondly, we should support local people’s economic initiatives, that is to say, small and medium-sized enterprises. This should be done through technical, commercial, legal and organisational aid. Potential beneficiaries should be informed by the local authorities of how much European Union aid has been made available and for what purposes. This information cannot be kept secret and revealed only to governments and banks. We need to carefully monitor this aid. All of us, especially the Commission, are responsible for both the appropriate use of funds and for the money wasted or seized by fraudsters, dictators, wealthy international corporations, sly intermediaries and sometimes even by certain European Union entities and representatives. It is incumbent on us to devise wise policies and take great care of the money contributed by wealthy donors. We must take even more care, however, of the far more precious ‘widow’s mite’ contributed by our poorer taxpayers.</p>

Budget aid is now regarded as a vital tool in the fight against poverty and in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, because it enables the most vulnerable populations to be reached directly and resources to be focused on the crucial sectors of education and basic health care.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it also plays a decisive part in rehabilitating States. That is very important, because it is the decline of States and their inability to fulfil their basic public service obligations that is now hindering development, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Budget aid provides an incentive for appropriation, that is, the opportunity for the recipient country to choose its own development process, and it is also a precious instrument of political dialogue between donors and beneficiaries and perhaps even of support for parliaments in their role as public finance controller.</p>
<p class="contents">However, budget aid cannot fulfil its objectives if prior conditions are not met, in particular good governance and the fight against corruption, democracy, respect for fundamental rights and a system for managing public finances that is controlled by a democratically-elected parliament. All of that has been outlined very effectively in the report by my fellow Member, Mr Gahler. However, as the Court of Auditors report revealed, at a time when budget aid really needs clarity, transparency and democracy, it is sometimes a lack of clarity that prevails, because, in several countries – Kenya and Malawi were mentioned – the Commission has used budget aid without the conditions, the proper prior conditions, having been met.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we are now awaiting some very precise answers from the Commission and that we expect it to get right to the bottom of these countries that have been mentioned and to establish control. Like the report, I would recommend a form of external control, instead, either by having the Court of Auditors step in, or by creating a control body in cooperation with the other donors. I believe that, in return for precise monitoring, Parliament will support this new instrument that you have implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first weakness is that aid given through budget support will not reach the remotest and poorest areas if the national infrastructure in those areas is weak. Last October I visited West Pokot, a remote and arid area of north-west Kenya, and heard from local people about the problems they experienced persuading personnel to come and work there. Budget support for health and education in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals may simply not penetrate into remote areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s evaluation of the ninth EDF in Zambia makes exactly the same point: ‘Budget support does not give the tools to target specific geographical areas. In the absence of goals and corresponding indicators related to the spread of impact over the country, budget support is not relevant for targeting remote and poorer areas’.</p>
<p class="contents">The second weakness of budget support that I would highlight is that it is a blunt tool. It is very difficult to use it to deliver a balanced result between potentially conflicting development goals. For example, in the Cambodia country strategy paper for the tenth EDF, the main focal sector is support to the National Strategic Development Plan, which covers actions such as reviving the agricultural sector by promoting large-scale irrigation. But the country environmental profile warns this may lead to overuse of land and pollution from increased use of pesticides and fertilisers. I would like to ask the Commission what conditions on sustainability are laid down when budget support is offered, and how does the Commission check that these are being adhered to? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears, however, that allowing free access to the European Union market for goods from those countries would be a far more effective way of supporting them.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the various restrictions on access to the European Union market and to the markets of other developed countries the world over, notably the United States, mean that the Union’s budget aid is a very important instrument for supporting developing countries. Given this situation, in which highly developed countries defend their markets from access by products from developing countries, it is very important to ensure that financial aid to these countries is provided on the basis of clear and transparent principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, budget aid must only be provided to third countries when it is clear that it will generate a positive outcome. Secondly, such aid should be directed primarily at reducing poverty, which is casting shame on the 21st century. Thirdly, European aid must be subject to parliamentary control, both on the part of the donor and on that of the recipient of the aid. Fourthly, budget aid from the European Union must be used first and foremost to support macro-economic reforms in the recipient country.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, it is important to ensure that a substantial amount of the aid is used to foster primary and secondary education in the recipient countries, as well as healthcare. These are the two most important areas requiring long-term support. Sixthly, it should be borne in mind that significant financial aid could trigger the emergence of corrupt activities. It is therefore essential for the decision-making processes concerning budget aid to be clear and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express my hope that the substantial financial resources made available to third countries by the European Union will serve not only to assist the development of those countries, but also to ensure that the European Union is recognised as a major force in international relations in our globalised world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Какво точно имам предвид: осем от деветте региона на Румъния и пет от шестте региона на България съставляват тринадесет от петнайсетте най-бедни региона в Европейския съюз като цяло. В доклада четем, че трябва да се насочат повече средства за борба с бедността, но какво да кажа аз, който идвам от страна, в която пенсионерите живеят с по-малко от 50 евро на месец, а пенсионерите са два милиона души. Какво да кажем, от гледна точка на развитието на образованието и на медицинското обслужване, когато се вижда, че в страни като България медицинските работници и учителите получават месечни заплати в размер 150-200 евро, при това става въпрос за високите заплати в тези сектори.</p>
<p class="contents">Ето защо трябва много внимателно да се подхожда, когато става дума за осигуряване на субсидии извън Европейския съюз. Нека престанем да се опитваме да вадим треската от чуждото око, а да не забелязваме гредата в собственото. Искам да се присъединя към призивите на колегите, които чух до сега, за разработването на много специфичен механизъм, който да осигурява пълен контрол от страна на Комисията и на институциите на Съюза върху средствата, отпускани при предоставянето на помощи извън Европейския съюз за развитие.</p>
<p class="contents">Защото много често, когато тези средства отиват в страни, които са политически нестабилни с произтичащите от това икономически и социални проблеми, се създава впечатлението, че Съюзът подкупва управляващите в тези страни, за да си осигури тяхната послушност или защитата от тяхна страна на правата на човека, което не е правилно. И твърде често тези средства не отиват за борба с бедността на обикновените хора, а за борба с бедността именно на върхушката, която властва в тези страни.</p>
<p class="contents">Моля, и призовавам Комисията и всички колеги, нека да изработим механизъм, който да е ясен и твърд, така че тези средства да достигат действително до хората, които имат нужда от тях. И не забравяйте, че в момента Съюзът не може, все пак, да отделя толкова много средства за трети страни, защото в самия Съюз има много региони, които са дори по-бедни от държавите, за които са предназначени въпросните средства. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report – which is fairly critical – contains many reservations. I share each of those reservations, and I should like to illustrate them a little more. In the strategic documents by country that we are currently monitoring, we see that the budget aid provided by the Commission is often like a black box – it is impossible to evaluate. For example, in the case of Cambodia and Laos, the Commission is proposing to allocate 40% to 60% of the entire budget to the national anti-poverty programme, without giving the slightest indication of which sectors will actually be funded.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more worrying is the fact that, when the Commission reveals to us the sectors that it once funded in its programmes, we see that they were not directly contributing to the fight against poverty. Under the guise of funding for national development programmes, the Commission is actually funding measures designed to improve the business, investment and trade climate. Consequently, it is not enough to make budget aid more sectoral and conditional in nature; the Commission must genuinely aim to fulfil the objectives of reducing poverty and of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, if such excesses are to be avoided – and I propose this whenever I can because this is my firm belief – a significant percentage of budget aid must be decentralised, for the benefit of NGOs and local authorities. This would mean preventing central governments from managing and monopolising all of the European budget aid. Decentralising aid would enable us to give the populations access to European funding and thus to make sure that our financial support is really benefiting the populations on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are poor and backward countries where, in many cases, armed conflict or even full-scale war is taking place. Corruption is rife in these countries, and it would be a sick joke to speak of the rule of law, parliamentary democracy, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights or political pluralism in this context. The only asset all these countries have in abundance is poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to help them. Wealthy Europe has never been extravagant. It has always thought long and hard before parting with money. The resolution before us reflects this attitude. If the 20 principles and 29 recommendations were applied to the letter it would be impossible to spend a single cent.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect countries hoping to obtain aid to meet certain conditions. We all know what these conditions are, but I shall venture to recall some of them. Firstly, the initial condition for the award of budget aid is a properly functioning democracy. Secondly, for budget aid to be effective, the recipients and national structures must be efficient. They must be efficient not only in terms of a properly functioning democracy that respects fundamental freedoms, human rights and political pluralism, but also in terms of budget procedures, competent spending and the provision of services that will be the subject of control. In addition to this, aid may only be awarded in cases when the net benefit obtained thanks to that mechanism can be identified on the basis of clearly itemised criteria, and only following a detailed risk assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">As we establish these principles, we should recall what the President of the Palestinian Authority stated in this House a few months ago. He was writing on the subject of the worrying decision concerning the award of budget aid to Malawi and Kenya, for which all the Member States have suspended budget aid. This move then cast doubt on the European Commission’s ability to use such an instrument effectively. Let us remember that an annual amount of EUR 6 is allocated to each child at school in Nairobi. That child will receive one pencil a year, and will have to share a textbook with two other children. There are between 100 and 120 children in each class. Most of the people are also short of water, electricity and food, yet this is one of the most stable countries in Africa. The World Bank continues to provide it with aid, and the European Investment Bank has also recently begun to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the statement that the European Parliament is concerned about the difficulties relating to assessing the degree to which effectiveness indicators have been met sounds rather strange. In particular, concern has been expressed concerning difficulties in assessing the impact on poverty. Parliament has urged the Commission to support efforts to foster developments in the compilation of statistics, data collection, quality assessment and analysis. I am firmly convinced that the principles presented here are appropriate for Germany, France and England, but certainly not for the countries we are concerned with. Therefore, I cannot understand the reason for this resolution and what it is meant to improve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The popularity of this instrument rose against the background of the ongoing discussions on improving the effectiveness of aid and on meeting the Millennium Development Goals. This goal should be just as important to the EU as carrying out sound structural operations at home.</p>
<p class="contents">Budget support is considered an appropriate measure for the achievement of macroeconomic objectives or for large-scale infrastructure programmes. If there is a lack of decentralisation in a country, however, it is questionable whether marginalised regions and sections of the population will be able to derive any particular benefit from budget support. Project aid will have to remain an important part of this cooperation, therefore, to enable the swift achievement of measurable results at local level. The main focus of Community development cooperation must continue to be justice and poverty reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption and poor financial management are among the most alarming issues in connection with budget support. Direct budget support must promote the strengthening of civil society, and a culture of accountability for the funds received must be created. In this regard, it is important that the parliaments of the beneficiary countries participate in adopting the budget and that the budget laws be published. The criteria to be met to entitle a country to receive direct budget support are laid down in Article 61 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement. These criteria must form the foundations, and there must be regular checks to ensure that they are being met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent years, budget aid has become one of the main forms of development aid provided by the European Union. As far as the European Commission is concerned, this type of aid is a key instrument of Community development policy. It is indeed the case that in favourable circumstances, budget aid can prove a powerful tool, helping to achieve the European Union’s aims in the area of development aid, sustainable economic and social development, the smooth and gradual integration of developing countries into the world economy, the fight against poverty, economic growth, job creation, and the development and strengthening of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament’s report, we emphasise that as an instrument for aid, budget support can only be effective if both partners take on full responsibility with a genuine spirit of partnership. The European Parliament calls for budget aid to focus as much as possible on development priorities relating to combating poverty. It also emphasises the need to ensure that these priorities figure prominently in the donor-recipient policy dialogue, and to guarantee parliamentary control by both the donor and the recipient. We believe that democratic governments, the rule of law and decentralisation offer the best guarantee of a proper use of development funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effectiveness of its aid measures is a prerequisite for sustainable aid that meets the needs of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the principle of aid effectiveness is a priority for the European Union, budget aid shows how relevant it is, fulfilling, as it does, the appropriation principle and the need for better coordination between sponsors. While this instrument therefore appears to meet the demands for effective aid, it must be used under certain conditions. Finally, budget aid enables beneficiary governments to take on a more assertive role in the coordination of development aid: this active approach creates a spirit of partnership, which is necessary in order to face up to the problems of appropriation and of the sustainability of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty reduction is a non-negotiable objective. Thus, the involvement of all parties is needed to accomplish it. Developing countries and the European Union must work to ensure that the promises of the Millennium Summit, in 2000, are kept. For its part, the European Union must be equal to the expectations it has raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
