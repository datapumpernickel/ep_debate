<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Workers from Romania and Bulgaria</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report on the Functioning of the Transitional Arrangements set out in the 2003 Accession Treaty shows that workers’ mobility from the EU Member State entrants of 2004 to the EU15 has on the whole had a positive effect. Is the Commission therefore disappointed that Member States such as the UK and Ireland have decided to curb the rights of Romanians and Bulgarians to work within their respective countries once Romania and Bulgaria become full EU members on 1 January?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission believe this will have any negative economic effects both within those Member States and across the EU as a whole or that it may push more people to work illegally? Does the Commission believe the unease expressed by some Member States about an ‘influx’ of migrant workers is a genuine concern, given that the UK, Ireland and Sweden (which did not apply restrictions after May 2004) experienced a drop in unemployment, a rise in employment and high economic growth? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One should remember that this freedom is one of the core principles of the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania, like those of the previous enlargement, lays down transitional provisions on the right to free movement of workers. Essentially, these provisions leave it up to each current Member State to determine whether, during a transitional period, to grant Bulgarian and Romanian nationals access to their labour markets. This is thus a prerogative of each and every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission plans to send a letter to all the Member States recalling their obligations under Community law and asking Member States to provide the details of any national measures that might be introduced for the first two years that follow the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, let me draw your attention to the Commission’s report on the functioning of the transitional arrangements for the enlargement of 1 May 2004, and in particular to the finding that the arrival of workers from the accession Member States has had a beneficial effect and actually helped to reduce imbalances in national labour markets, without the newcomers largely taking the place of local jobseekers. This applies, of course, to those Member States that have facilitated the free movement of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also found that there have been overall positive effects on the economies of the EU 15 Member States, with workers from the new Member States contributing to a better functioning of the labour markets, to sustained economic growth and to better public finances. It also found that restrictions on labour market access may increase the incidence of undeclared work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that those findings are still valid and trusts that the Member States will consider them closely when deciding whether to introduce transitional measures applicable to Bulgaria and Romania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is perfectly possible that this might happen, but only time will tell, which is why we are constantly analysing developments in the labour markets in the EU and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two basic scenarios, which may vary from one Member State to another. Namely, a given Member State may benefit from having the possibility of receiving workers from the new Member States, owing to its demographic profile and the challenges posed by an ageing population. At the same time, it may be that another Member State has labour market problems, and higher unemployment, and that the national government consequently decides that, given the circumstances, it would benefit from the transitional arrangements. That is why we have decided to leave this matter to the Member States to judge, and why we have given them the option of applying the transitional measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is without doubt a prerogative of those countries, as for any other Member State. Prior to these decisions, I used the United Kingdom and Ireland as a benchmark when arguing the case for opening the labour markets of the other Member States to the candidate countries. I am proud of having in my previous capacity helped the Prime Minister of the Member State I know best to draft his speech on 1 May 2004 when he declared that Member State – Finland – was likely to remove the restrictions on free movement of workers from the new Member States. That particular Member State maintains the same liberal practice for Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is that on the basis of very reliable studies there are overall positive effects, but at the same time we want to leave it to the Member States – and we have to leave it to the Member States because that is the decision of the Council of the European Union, which is the highest decision-making body in cases of this kind in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Duty-free sales within the new aviation security regulations</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the 6 November introduction of new EU aviation security regulations, concerns have been raised as to how the new regulations will affect the global duty-free market. This market is of vital importance to many European luxury brand producers, including Scotch whisky producers in my constituency. The new regulations include provisions for passengers to continue buying liquid products from airside retail stores (via the ‘tamper evident’ bags system). However, these provisions extend only to 'Community airports' and 'Community carriers'. As a result, neither duty-free retailers at major international airports outside Europe nor non-EU carriers are able to sell popular goods like premium Scotch whisky to EU-bound passengers transferring at an EU or EEA airport.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commissioner inform me of what steps the Commission plans to take to facilitate duty-free sales to EU-bound transfer passengers and safeguard this vital market for Scotch whisky producers, their employees and the local economy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 is to address the new threat to civil aviation that is posed by homemade liquid explosives. As such, it prohibits passengers on flights departing from Community airports from taking liquids in hand luggage in individual quantities greater than 100 ml. However, an exemption has been granted for liquids sold at airport shops and on board aircraft when certain security conditions are met, including the tamper-evident bag system.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that Community legislation does not apply in third countries, it is currently not possible to ensure that airports in third countries or non-Community air carriers have security requirements that are equivalent to those applied within the European Union and the European Economic Area. Consequently, such airports and airlines cannot benefit from the exemption. The Commission will consider whether it is possible to work with third countries to develop a means of establishing equivalence of security measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission and the Community is doing what it can to further open up the system in place with regard to the European Union, although it will probably be quite difficult to achieve significant results in the very short term, and therefore before Christmas, as this calls for negotiations with third countries in order to achieve similar positions to ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding your point concerning the publicity campaign, the Commission has been working with the international airport and airline stakeholder organisations concerned so that they can inform their members in third countries about the new EU rules.

<p class="contents">In response to the question by Mr Davies as to when the Commission will introduce measures to end the discard of by-catch by fishing vessels, I should like to point out first of all that the Commission considers discarding to be a serious problem in European fisheries, and is committed to acting on this issue as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The cause of discards is that unwanted by-catch is taken in many European fisheries and then discarded. Discarding can primarily be reduced, and eventually eliminated, by reducing unwanted by-catch. This can be done through legal regulation or by providing incentives for the development of fishing technologies and fishing practices which produce little by-catch and therefore little discard.</p>
<p class="contents">In early 2007 the Commission will present a communication on reducing discards. The instruments that will be considered in this context include selective fishing areas, closed areas, requirements to change fishing grounds when significant by-catch is encountered and the economic penalising of by-catch.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will outline the main elements of a new policy on discarding and open a debate on the implementation of that policy. Following a debate in early 2007, the Commission will develop implementing regulations on a fishery-by-fishery basis, the first of which will be presented in 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I met with the Fleetwood Fish Producers' Association recently. They tell me that their inshore fishery currently produces some 70-80% discards on vessels above 10 metres. They told me: ‘he Irish Sea is full of fish, but we are murdering it by catching fish too small to breed’. They say that if they use larger nets they are regarded as going out to catch cod and, therefore, they have to go out for fewer days, they lose income and it is a vicious circle.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I know that you want to do something about this. I have talked to you about it over the years.

The rate of progress is not attributable to a lack of willingness on our part, or to a lack of means to try to achieve results, or a lack of determination on the part of the Commission. More often than not it is attributable to the fact that we have very complex fisheries in Community waters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is far simpler to operate a decent discard system further north, where fisheries are relatively clean, where you go to fish for mackerel and you catch virtually only mackerel. In Community waters most of the time you target a particular species, but you have what is essentially a mixed fishery and that is much more complex to manage.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking at ways and means of introducing measures which will reduce discards significantly. This year we have tried to introduce an effort-management scheme for the Kattegat. The North Sea Regional Advisory Council was heavily involved in this. We had hoped that at the December Council I would be able to announce that this would start in 2007. However, after considering the various proposals being made to operate such a scheme, the operators’ representatives asked us for more time, because they realise that the impact on fisheries could be significant.</p>
<p class="contents">The North Sea Regional Advisory Council is of the same opinion and therefore I shall not be proposing that it starts in 2007. I hope that during the course of next year this will materialise and that it will come with a much more general position with regard to the management of fisheries whereby discards are reduced as much as possible.</p>

Our intention is to heavily involve the regional advisory councils and to involve the stakeholders in how to manage fisheries in a way in which we try to tackle the cod problem effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, as all of us know, a serious problem with regard to cod sustainability. In most, if not all, Community waters it is in a virtually depleted state. It is possible for it to be rescued, but we need to be inventive in this regard. The general idea behind a cod by-catch fishery is that, for as long as cod is not recovered, you do not target cod. Thus fishers would not target cod, but they would be allowed to land cod caught as a by-catch within certain limits. In that way you can provide an incentive for the diversification of fisheries into other fisheries so you would not thereby be targeting cod and at the same time you would reduce the unnecessary and very costly discarding of cod.</p>
<p class="contents">These are initial ideas which we need to ponder further and which we need to discuss primarily with the stakeholders, to see whether there is a way forward, or whether, as in many other respects, we end up concluding that the system as it operates is giving better results in certain respects. But I hope that we will manage to work out a system which will give much better results than those we have at the moment with regard to cod and to cod recovery in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission considers the situation of women working in the fisheries sector, and in particular their legal and social recognition, to be a very important issue. It is using all the instruments at its disposal to promote equal treatment and opportunities for women and men in the sector concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the four specific questions raised by the honourable Member, the Commission would like to point out the following.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the European Fisheries Fund, which is the new structural instrument for fisheries for 2007-2013, explicitly states, in Article 4(g), that one of its objectives is to promote equality between men and women in the development of the fisheries sector and fisheries areas. The EFF is based on the principle of partnership with all stakeholders in the fisheries sector, and this explicitly covers partnership with bodies responsible for the promotion of equality between men and women. The EFF contains specific provisions promoting gender equality, both through better women’s representation in decision-making processes and in the programmes to be implemented by Member States. In particular, the Commission is encouraging participation by women in the various stages of implementation of the European Fisheries Fund, including the design, monitoring and evaluation of the Member States’ operational programmes for the next programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fund can also support measures aimed at promoting equal opportunities between men and women through networking and the exchange of best practices among relevant organisations. The Commission will strive to ensure that Member States reflect these provisions and priorities in their operational programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission recognises the importance of training in the fisheries sector, and education and professional training are eligible for support under the European Fisheries Fund. Training measures are also expected to promote access to employment for women. Moreover, under the Fund’s new priority axis 4 on the sustainable development of fisheries areas, support can be granted for the diversification of activities and the promotion of alternative employment for fishermen through a large variety of measures. Under this axis, special measures for the improvement of professional skills, work adaptability and access to employment for women can also be supported. It should be stressed that the Commission is promoting the involvement of women in the local bodies, managing the measures supported under axis 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as mentioned above, the EFF requires Member States to ensure broad and effective involvement of all relevant partners in the different stages of programming, and this includes bodies responsible for the promotion of equality between men and women. The Fund also requires the operational programmes to contain information on how the partnership principle has been implemented, the list of the parties that have been consulted, the results of those consultations and how they have been taken into account. The new priority axis 4 on sustainable development of fisheries areas, supported under the Fund, will be implemented through a bottom-up approach. It will be the local players, including women’s associations, that will serve as the engine for designing and implementing local development strategies. This allows women’s organisations to get involved in decision-making at the local level and ensure that their specific concerns and suggestions are taken into account in local development strategies. Women and their representatives are also encouraged to participate in the Regional Advisory Councils, which were set up to improve the governance of the reformed common fisheries policy. For instance, women’s associations already have a seat in the North Sea RAC, which was the first RAC to be formed. Women are also represented in the North Western Waters RAC.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the present programming period, under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, Member States can co-finance studies and innovative projects covering the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers. This possibility is also offered under the European Fisheries Fund, under priority axis 3 on collective actions. The Commission has since 2003 been launching a series of calls for proposals for innovative actions in the fisheries sector. These actions are now almost completed. In 2005 the Commission conducted an ex-post evaluation of these actions in order to assess their impact and added value. The results of this evaluation showed clearly that such actions do not have an added value, whereas innovative actions included in, and financed through, the operational programmes of the Member States, were more successful and better monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account these conclusions, the Commission decided to integrate the implementation of those actions into the European Fisheries Fund Regulation and to support their implementation through the operational programmes of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 46 by Lambert van Nistelrooij (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0972_EN.html">H-0972/06</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Economic and innovative changes of demographic change</span></p>
<p class="contents">The ageing of the population and the demographic change it brings with it are regarded as a threat to the labour market and the EU 'knowledge-based economy', its Member States and regions. However, it can be seen as an opportunity for new jobs in a growing market with new products and services which improve quality of life for older people, for economic growth and for improving Europe's competitiveness. This is the approach of the so-called 'silver economy'. Recent calculations for Germany have shown that a proactive response to the needs and interests of the sometimes increasingly rich elderly could lead to 900 000 new jobs in the next two decades. There are no other sectors or businesses with a higher growth potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now the chances that the challenge of the ageing population brings with it have not been clearly set out horizontally in the Commission communications on 'Demographic future of Europe' (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0571">COM(2006)0571</a> final), 'European values in the globalised world' (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0525">COM(2005)0525</a> final), the Green Paper 'Confronting demographic change' and the major Lisbon-oriented policy programmes such as the Structural Funds, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development and the Competition and Innovation Framework Programme. An exception is the Commission's Innovative Actions, ‘Ambient Assisted Living’, the i2010 initiative and its eAccessibility communication, now part of the eInclusion programme in the third pillar of ‘i2010’.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do to encourage Member States and regions to take on board as a horizontal policy the ‘silver economy’ concept in its 2007 and beyond innovation driven Lisbon reform programmes?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission envisage to coordinate policy making in the different 'silver economy' issues? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The silver economy is one example of how we can make the most of the fact that people are living longer. In its recent communication 2006/571 entitled ‘Demographic Future of Europe – From Challenge to Opportunity’ the Commission used the silver economy as an example of the positive effects of ageing in terms of fresh economic growth opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes initiatives like the Silver Economy Network of the European Regions (SEN@ER). At the first European forum on demography, which was held recently, a politician from North Rhine Westphalia gave a presentation, in one of the workshops, of activities that Germany is pursuing in the area of the silver economy, within the framework of the SEN@ER network. On 25 and 26 January 2007 the Commission will hold a conference on the theme of the regional response to demographic change, where a series of examples of successful regional silver economy projects that often receive support from the structural funds will be presented.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention that on 17 and 18 April 2007, the German Presidency, with the Commission’s support, will hold an important conference in Berlin entitled ‘<span class="italic">Demographischer Wandel, Chancen erkennen, potenziale Nutzen, Wachstum fördern</span>’ (Demographic Change: Recognizing Opportunities – Tapping Potential – Fostering Growth) on possible synergies between ageing and the economy. The silver economy is a new issue that, in the context of the Commission, touches upon a number of different policy areas. The Commission has set up an internal working group to coordinate the various European policies on demographic change and in this regard the Commission will continue to work, in general, on the issue of demography, and, more specifically, on the silver economy. This work may lead to a number of Commission initiatives, for example on the consequences of the ageing population and the opportunities provided by the silver economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the ageing population, the Commission has also launched the key initiative i2010, which proposes a holistic approach and practical measures relating to development and to the innovative and more intense use of information and communication technologies. This initiative will draw on all available instruments including the Seventh Framework Programme initiatives under Article 169 in the area of Ambient Assisted Living, the new programme for competitiveness and innovation in the area of the best use of information and communication technologies relating to ageing, including measures for raising awareness and political measures. The Commission communication on this issue is expected at the start of 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to emphasise the fact that this is a legitimate question and that the Commission’s strategy is not to set a particular age. The Commission’s strategy, of which I am a firm advocate, is to extend people’s active age and working lives. The notion of stipulating an age at an administrative level is not especially important. It is much more important to create the conditions under which people can continue in work for longer. The administrative age is often set at 65, whereas, the average working life currently ends at the age of 59 in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that life expectancy in good health is longer, and currently stands at an average of 62 in Europe, although this age varies greatly between different Member States. This, too, is an issue that must be taken on board in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that the concept of an inclusive society is based on the fact that work not only has its economic aspects but is also about active involvement in society. Scientific research has clearly shown that early retirement before a person has not made full use of his or her potential is felt more as a burden than a benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to come back to your original question. The Commission is not planning to stipulate or recommend any fixed retirement age at an administrative level. On the other hand, it takes the view that, in the light of demographic ageing and the longer period over which pensions are being drawn, it is right to extend people’s working lives. To this end, a range of measures should be adopted, of which, in my view at least, an administrative extension of the retirement age is among the less important ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those measures include increasing employability, vocational training, retraining, support for people when they have lost their job and the concept of flexicurity, which means actively supporting people during periods of transition. The latter does not necessarily refer to losing one's job. It can also mean the transition from one type of occupation to another. All of these are very important issues, and should be incorporated into the solution to the problem you have raised, which is to say the activation of the European labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is to assess and eliminate all discriminatory elements, or elements that create inequality in respect of retirement and social security systems. The Commission considers all of these important and this is the direction in which it is heading.</p>
<p class="contents">A further measure that also forms part of the Lisbon Strategy is that of providing for higher employment among the over 50s. One of the most important goals at the moment is to eliminate the gender pay gap, because this is one of the main causes of difference in retirement age. In this case, the Commission takes a wide-ranging view, which covers the labour market, social security systems and pay inequality. I feel that this view and this approach are the right way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Demographics experts are generally agreed that it is difficult to separate the effects of different kinds of financial benefits from other, perhaps decisive, factors influencing the birth rate. The Commission feels, however, that the search for examples of tried and tested approaches should not be restricted solely to the EU Member States; we could certainly learn from what the Northern European countries that are not EU Member States, in other words Norway and Iceland, have done to solve the problem of demographic change.</p>
<p class="contents">Following its communication 'Demographic Future of Europe – From Challenge to Opportunity', adopted on 12 October 2006, the Commission decided to set up a group of government experts on demographic and family issues, which will help the Commission in future activities and act as a basis for exchanging tried and tested approaches. I also wish to point out that as well as adopting the communication on demography, the Commission decided to consult with the European social partners over the issue of harmonising professional, private and family life. The social partners have been called on to assess whether further improvement is needed, especially when it comes to working time, flexible working conditions, the new opportunities provided by information technology, the accessibility and quality of childcare, care for the elderly and other dependent persons and holidays, including family holidays and holidays taken with the aim of caring for dependent persons, children or disabled family members.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that the Norwegian social partners are members of the European organisations representing social partners, their experience with family contributions will be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also support the German Presidency in creating a European alliance for families. The Commission takes the view that such an alliance would help identify tried and tested approaches and enable their exchange between Member States, with the aim of improving family conditions in the EU and of giving Europeans the opportunity to have the number of children they want to have. Honourable Members, as you may have gathered from my long speech, the Commission has yet to assess directly the issue of financial payments, which will be examined at a later date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Can the Commission explain why the existing body of legislation is so ill-suited to its task and/or has been so badly implemented to the point of deterring consumers and making them mistrustful of transfrontier purchases? How does it intend to protect consumers against the ever increasing number of illegal practices of which they are now the victims following the rapid expansion in Internet sales?

However, if we consider where we started, where we begun, and where we are today, we should not adopt such a completely negative view.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress has been significant and we can witness it through the measures we have taken and implemented over the past years. However, the Commission does not rest and continues to act in the direction of boosting consumer confidence, but the Member States have also an important role to play. Despite low confidence, which is due to several factors, one of the most important ones is the lack of a harmonised consumer protection system; this means that consumers do not know what to expect when they go shopping outside the country’s borders. However they must acknowledge that a lot of things have been achieved during the past years in the direction of solving these problems. Moreover, it is clear that a lot more needs to be done to increase consumer confidence, especially with respect to the existing legislation and its implementation. Both the measures that have been taken as well as those that are being planned are intended for dealing with the increasing number of unfair or illegal practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Has anything been done at European Union level? First of all let me reassure you that the Commission has never ignored any complaint that it has received or continues to receive through its networks. On the contrary, in the past such complaints have made things happen, for example the approval of the legislation against unfair trade practices. Moreover, they play an important part in the data and information base for future actions, for example for time-sharing. With the legislation on time-sharing we will cover travel products that are not covered by law and therefore do not provide an acceptable level of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The other legislation I mentioned, namely directive 2005/29 on unfair trade practices, prohibits aggressive practices such as sale under pressure, misleading market promotion methods and unfair advertising. European Union consumers are protected equally whether shopping in their own country or in other Member States or over the Internet; moreover the horizontal nature of this protection will allow it to control new practices that will arise as the market develops.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, directive 2000/31 on electronic commerce has imposed information requirements with the purpose of guaranteeing total consumer information regarding the trader’s identity with respect to the commercial nature of communication over the Internet, actual price and technical means.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation 2006/2004 on cooperation regarding consumer protection will allow national competent authorities to take swift action for dealing with ruthless and unfair cross-border traders, wherever they might be in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the proposal for a regulation regarding the law that will be applied in the agreements that is ‘Rome I Regulation’, the Commission’s proposal will significantly increase consumer confidence bearing the benefit of a legislation with which they are already familiar. Moreover, we have the European Consumer Centre networks or Economic Conflict Resolution Networks that will inform consumers on their rights and assist them in guaranteeing their rights through court appeals or out-of-court settlements in cross-border cases.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament is aware, in the future the Commission will proceed to review the legislation on consumer protection. Quite soon a Green Paper will be approved for wider public consultation. Its goal is to find a way to modernise and improve existing legislation with the purpose of increasing consumer and enterprise confidence so that they can buy and sell within the borders of the internal market. Moreover, the issue of consumer protection will be examined within the context of the upcoming strategy on consumer policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, on the one hand our investigations do indicate that there are still serious problems but on the other, I believe you understand that the Commission does not rest or remain passive. On the contrary, it is taking steps which are part of a complete programme for dealing with the drawbacks that have been noted by the investigation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a very strict system in place to ensure that no product slips through the very high standard assessment procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the contamination of US long grain rice, involving unauthorised GM LLRICE 601, proves that this is not just a statement but a fact. Our reaction has shown that we intend to apply our legislation in every possible case.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as the Commission was informed of this contamination of US rice, we took every possible measure to prevent unauthorised products from entering the market. First, we introduced a requirement for certification of every single consignment arriving in the European Union. But when we became aware that shipments of US rice certified as GM-free tested positive at the port of arrival in the European Union, the certification requirement was strengthened by the imposition of systematic counter-testing of each consignment originating in the US.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is also important that this counter-testing be carried out on the basis of a harmonised and very strict sampling and testing procedure, which guarantees reliability and comparability of the results, so our consumers can be assured that every consignment of US long grain rice is tested twice, both in the US and on arrival in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to remind you that Member States bear the primary responsibility for enforcing these requirements and verifying that they are fulfilled by business operators. The Commission has systematically reminded national authorities of this obligation to carry out adequate checks and withdraw contaminated products.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Food Standards Agency has clarified its approach by agreeing to the conclusions of the Standing Committee on 11 September 2006. In that context, Member States commit themselves to checking all stored bulk consignments of US rice already on the European Union market.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to products on the shelf, our legislation provides that Member States will take all appropriate measures to ensure that these are tested and removed from the market if necessary. But the aim is to provide the legislation. It is up to the Member States to ensure that measures are taken in the most effective way.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of cross-pollination, it is important to remember that no GM crop can be grown in the European Union unless it has been evaluated as safe for the environment and human and animal health and authorised for cultivation. Member States are developing coexistence strategies to ensure that they can limit as much as possible admixtures of GM and non-GM crops and address the economic consequences. The competence for this lies with the Member States, following the recommendations and guidelines of the European Union. However, the special characteristics of each Member State – the landscape, the environment, climate conditions – make it important for them to take the most appropriate measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that many Member States, including the United Kingdom, have defined or are in the process of defining approaches to ensure that GM crops can coexist with conventional and organic crops. Member States are obliged to notify national coexistence measures to the Commission and the Commission follows this very closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the UK issue, any product containing an unauthorised GM component has to be withdrawn because it is on the market illegally. That is an obligation for all Member States including the UK; this was made clear to them and they understood that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the European Food Safety Authority said that there was no imminent danger to human health, and the UK repeated that, but, as far as the Commission is concerned, any product of this sort that has not been authorised through our procedures is on the market illegally and has to be removed. After we made it clear to the UK authorities that this was the legal position, they adjusted their position. In this respect, we make sure that Member States also apply the legislation, which is very strict, and no unauthorised product can reach the consumer.
