<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Amalia Sartori, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold">− </span><span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have had a good debate today in Parliament on the issues of industry, growth and employment, which, as the Commissioner pointed out just now, began this morning with the plenary debate with Commissioners Tajani and Andor and has effectively continued, because we talked about energy for a long time, addressing the problems faced by the automotive industry. We will now continue with a question I submitted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and which will be discussed here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">We were given assurances that in December we would have a solution to this problem, and I believe that everything we voted on yesterday at the start of the session reinforces the attention Europe is paying to this issue. There is no doubt that a host of industrial activities are linked to the European steel industry: on the one hand, upstream, the steel, iron, cast iron and iron alloy industry, and on the other, downstream, all of the industries that use these products, particularly the automotive, mechanical engineering, building, piping and metal goods sectors, as well as maritime and naval shipbuilding, domestic appliances, chemicals and other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">To maintain an active and competitive steel industry is vital for the future of Europe and its citizens. Even by early 2000, Europe had already lost its supremacy, beaten by China to the top spot. In recent years, the European Union has chosen to invest heavily in environmental issues – and that is a choice we approve of – but this has doubtless led to rising costs in this sector, together with an increase in commodity prices and rocketing energy costs – let us not forget that in Europe, electricity costs 100 % more than in the United States – and for some Member States, higher borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2007, European steel production reached an all-time high, with 406 000 workers directly employed in the sector and in related activities. During the period 2007-2011, we saw a 10.6 % fall in employment, and today the industry employs 363 000 workers. These are rather discouraging figures, particularly for 2012. The most worrying figure is the sharp decline in production in sectors closely linked to steel; in other words, automotive and construction, which last year alone recorded a fall in production of 3.2 %. Non-European imports are steadily rising. The administrative burden that European manufacturers must bear is high and gives rise to additional costs that reduce our capacity for investment in innovation and research, at times even resulting in relocation.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we should ask ourselves if, alongside the new strategy for industrial policy that the Commission has recently adopted, there is a need for sector policies, which seek to intervene on a case-by-case basis to reverse damaging trends that Europe can no longer afford. We know that the Commission is working on an action plan for the steel industry: what stage is this at? Having welcomed the CARS 2020 Action Plan, we would also like to see an operational plan for the steel industry that can be implemented immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perhaps worth considering whether policies could be introduced that would fully enable our strategic companies to respond to global competition. To be innovative, we should imagine the re-industrialisation of Europe being accompanied by a set of policies that need our support, such as research and innovation, which is an essential tool. However, I would also like to mention the need for a review of competition policy, which was drawn up in the 1990s and perhaps does not take into account the need for Europe’s economy to deal with a global market and global competition. The completion of the internal market is essential in order to bring down the cost of energy and special attention must be given to trade agreements with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we should perhaps also ask ourselves whether it is worth reinstating a Council dedicated solely to industry, returning to the situation prior to 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the restructuring efforts, and mergers and acquisitions of the 1980s and 1990s, the steel sector is today a dynamic and competitive global industry, even though it suffers from a certain number of problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Although 12 % of the steel sold around the world is currently produced in Europe – our companies supply around 80 % of the European market and export 80 % of their output – we cannot fail to notice how, on the one hand, the economic crisis and the stagnation of the euro area, combined with increasingly high prices of raw materials and energy, represent a problem for all our companies operating in the steel sector. Added to this is the strong competition from countries, particularly in Asia, where steel can be made more cheaply. On the other hand, demand for steel products from non-EU countries is also falling, as is demand for imports. Our electricity prices are among the highest in the world: if we were to compare this with, say, the United States, electricity in Europe costs twice as much as on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore address a series of problems with this general framework, which is why I have renewed the commitment I assumed before the summer recess, following a meeting with trade union representatives accompanied by the Chair, Pervenche Berès, to set up a high-level group which will prepare an action plan for the European Commission before the summer of next year. The first meeting took place on 19 September, following which the interested parties – industry and company representatives – identified the major challenges that the steel sector must face.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key messages is finding the right balance between the objectives of the various policies so that the European steel industry remains competitive and continues to offer employment prospects, and to prevent the erosion of the steel value chain. The next meeting is scheduled for 6 December, when we will try to examine in more detail the issues covered at the first meeting. I intend to submit an action plan to the College of Commissioners before the summer recess in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely convinced that steel can and should be supported, because in our opinion this is not a structural crisis, but one linked to the general economic climate, which is why steel could again become a key player in our industrial policy over the next few years. It is no coincidence that Europe’s reindustrialisation policy covers certain sectors that need special support, particularly with innovation and significant public and private funding, high-quality sectors – such as environmentally sustainable buildings and clean vehicles – which are two of the principal customers of the steel industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, steel is an integral part of the overall strategy of the European Commission, which has set itself the target – as I have explained to the parliamentary groups and to the Council before that – of ensuring that, by 2020, 20 % of the EU’s gross domestic product will come from the manufacturing sector. Evidently we must strive to promote the latest business technologies, so that manufacturers can increase their capacity for innovation: even in the steel industry, it is still important to focus efforts on innovation. I am therefore optimistic, notwithstanding the difficulties. The European Commission is fully committed to applying itself in this sector, therefore I have asked Commissioner Andor to take part in all initiatives aimed at achieving the objective in question. My plan is twofold: (1) to anticipate the effects of a crisis that could potentially worsen, and (2) to act in concert with industry and with workers’ representatives – and with Parliament of course, as Ms Sartori and Ms Berès know, since I have always invited them to high-level group meetings on behalf of the two parliamentary committees involved in the steel strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">So: participation and consultation with all stakeholders, including the European Parliament. I believe these two words could guide us in the weeks and months ahead so that we might guarantee a future for the steel industry, which in my opinion could be a positive one. It is my belief that, if we work together intelligently, we can achieve the objective we all believe in, and which is central to the question raised by the Committee on Industry, which I have tried to answer, being in full agreement with the sentiments expressed by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think it is right that trends that are also in evidence in the steel industry, namely simply reducing capacities, are not followed. Just recently I read an article in the press by the President of the European steel industry body that said that 100 000 of the close to 400 000 jobs in the industry would have to be cut, that we had to shed 25 % of capacity – a hard, deep cut.</p>
<p class="contents">No, we cannot deal with the problem like this. We must make sure that we stabilise this core industry in the European Union and create prospects for development. This of course was a foundation stone on which the European Union was built. I would like to bring to mind the European Coal and Steel Community, which very successfully developed a research and structural policy for the steel sector. I believe that there should continue to be such a model; work on the further development of the European steel industry should involve three equally represented groups – the Commission, employers and employees. </p>
<p class="contents">What we really need are innovations to ensure we have highly flexible steel at our disposal, particularly for the energy transition, an area in which there is undoubtedly demand. We must also ensure that the steel industry can exist in a competitive environment and is not unduly burdened with costs. You therefore have our support to stabilise the European steel industry.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Steel is nevertheless a basic backbone industry for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Europe needs to be re-industrialised. It is up to you, the European Commission – and why not on 6 December – to launch a ‘Steel’ initiative linked to the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, a coordinated initiative at EU level that will make the Member States cooperate with each other instead of leaving to the large iron and steel groups the right to decide on the life or death of their subsidiaries, including those which have invested in tooling or human capital. These are large groups, which profit from fiscal non-harmonisation or, worse still, which play with the advantages they obtain.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, regulation will not take place by itself. It has to be organised. It is unacceptable that CO<span class="sub">2</span> emission quotas have been diverted to non-European subsidiaries and even accumulated in reserve. At EU level, there is a surplus of 950 million emission quotas; the runaway champion of all categories of this accumulation of reserves is obviously ArcelorMittal, which, in Seraing, made the reopening of a blast furnace subject to the allocation of an emission right.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the steel question, there is obviously the issue of economic redeployment of Europe, an ambitious Europe with ambitious policies. What is certain is that this will not be done without steel, and as far as I am concerned, I would like that steel to be European. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Poland, the implementation of its provisions has caused a rise in unemployment by around 250 000 and an increase in energy prices. In view of the rise in production costs and decreased demand, there are currently plans at the Huta Sędzimira steelworks in Kraków alone to lay off more than 600 workers, and similar group redundancies are anticipated at Sosnowiec, Chorzów and Warsaw. Unless the situation changes, there will be a series of shutdowns of large furnaces and a transfer of production to Ukraine or to India, where no climatic constraints are in force. Re-starting the industry and bringing it back to Europe is unlikely to be possible. This is especially sad as the sector accounts for 7.5 % of production of the entire industry in Europe, and is one of the largest industrial employers in the European Union. Consequently the basis for the rescue package for the steel industry should be a suspension of the provisions of the energy and climate package, which is leading to the de-industrialisation of Europe. The next important factor is to block imports of cheap steel from countries of the former Soviet Union and from China. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Iron and steel: an industry at the very foundation of Europe; a sector that has enabled a very large number of industries to develop; that seeks progress; that has enabled people to acquire exceptional know-how in vehicles, rail, building, packaging and agri-food; that directly and indirectly provides millions of jobs, and indispensable wealth for our regions and our populations; a sector that has made Europe great but is in great danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Subjugated by finance and large international groups, our iron and steel industry is on the verge of an enormous crisis that will destroy much production capacity, witness the disappearance of know-how and destroy the lives of thousands of employees. From this perspective, the Mittal code is enlightening. It is closing sites such as those in Gandrange, Florange or Liège, in Belgium, from where it did not hesitate to transfer USD 37 billion to Luxembourg for tax optimisation purposes. It is selling wildly, keeping only that which is most profitable. At the same time, it is putting into service several blast furnaces in India, financed by the sweat and blood of European employees, whom it casts aside after thoroughly exploiting them.</p>
<p class="contents">The independence of Europe and the future of European industry are at stake. ‘The tree is known by its fruit,’ says a French proverb. What does the Commission intend doing? Will it decide to act for Europe and finally assume its responsibilities and legislate to protect the iron and steel and industry, a major European cause for 2013? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With prices for raw materials constantly fluctuating and energy costs increasing at the same time, this is no doubt causing a great deal of problems for steel manufacturers, and has now also affected the scrap industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the steel industry in the EU also has to contend with the highest production costs in the world. It is in fierce global competition with competitors from outside Europe who do not have to deal with such high costs relating to energy, the environment and CO<span class="sub">2</span> allowances. An increasing amount of cheap steel is therefore forcing its way onto the European market from third countries that do not have such strict environmental regulations. This is something that the Commission should take into consideration with its plan to drive up the CO<span class="sub">2 </span>price by restricting the supply of allowances.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European steel industry is talking about having to cut a quarter of its capacity, it should be clear to us all that, if there is an adjustment to long-term demand, this will cost up to a quarter of the jobs in Europe, that is around 100 000 jobs. If this actually happens, it should be clear to us all that the Union will need to provide tremendous assistance to cushion the social and economic effects of this restructuring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The steel industry, which is fundamental for Europe, is experiencing a decline with widespread job losses. The main problem is imports from outside the EU. China is the leading supplier, although it is not alone: needless to say these countries have an unfair competitive advantage and have inadequate rules on environmental protection and workers’ rights. In general, outside the EU, rules on State aid and tariffs are varied and less restrictive, while energy costs are lower.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Tajani, clearly we are extremely confident in the strategy for the steel industry that you are working on, and I truly thank you, partly because on numerous occasions you have said that the EU must modernise the rules on State aid and competition. I would like to mention Terni in this regard: the Terni site is part of the industrial heritage not just of Italy but of the whole of Europe. The company is one of the world’s leading producers of stainless steel. It is renowned for its high-tech processes, rigorous quality control, pollution abatement and scrap metal recycling. The European antitrust authority, to avoid dominant positions, has authorised the sale of the Terni site, the Società delle Fucine company and the LBA2 production line, leaving the Tubificio di Terni company to the Finnish company. The site used to produce 1 200 000 tonnes of goods: steel pipes are the core business of the site and without this the company risks becoming uncompetitive and unattractive to potential buyers. This is a real concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by asking, how can we guarantee a long-term, competitive industry without jeopardising current market share and employment levels? What strategies are there to reduce energy costs? Why can we not introduce quality certification for steel products? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The major steel conglomerates are increasingly pivoting towards the Far East or the American continent, which raises a question over the direction of our development model.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Europe should resurrect the idea that a manufacturing sector such as ours needs a solid production base, able to supply the European internal market. We must therefore defend this sector and the role of a stable steel industry, and we must support it, Commissioner, if we want to halt the industrial decline. I think we need to move away from the dualism – which has not emerged here this evening, but which is often heard in discussions about this sector – between those who campaign to protect the environment and workers, which is misguided because it does not show us the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">An industry in which steel is considered to be an integral part needs the latest production systems, concrete and balanced solutions, which safeguard the various interests, the various requirements. Therefore, we need a strong European plan focusing on sustainability – on which we should never turn our backs, in my opinion – as a source of real added value, with which we can compete in the world, supporting investments, as several parties have already said, new technologies, new processes and upgrading our plants; a European economy that makes efficient use of its resources, including energy, indeed starting with energy and the search for new materials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a classic example of carbon leakage, or an escape of emissions. If the European Commission keeps changing the system of emissions trading, the situation will only get worse – and that is a cause of considerable concern to us. The backloading that is proposed by the Commission is a serious problem for the steel industry today. In the opinion of some, not only shall we feel the impact of the decision on prices, but everyone knows that backloading is the first step towards structural interventions, set-aside and various other solutions of that nature.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have accepted the guidelines on aid to states, which allow indirect costs to be compensated, but everything points to Member States, at a time of crisis, simply not having the budget or the cash for such compensation. On Thursday we shall be voting on the draft decision on COP 18. The document expresses concern about the increasing level imported emissions. Before any actions at all are taken, we must be sure that what we are deciding on will genuinely help, and that we are not exporting jobs in order to import pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This not only concerns the limited powers of completion, shall we say, of the industry, but the overall effect of competition, trade, cohesion and fiscal policies. Although the economic crisis has highlighted the central role of manufacturing, we must move away from a system that has in recent decades put consumption before production, services before industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the various cases, such as the special steel manufactured at Terni and the Piombino steel plant, are food for thought in this respect. In terms of competition policy, for example, we should maintain a global, and not just a European, outlook when evaluating dominant positions. With regard to this particular question, I believe it is important that we guarantee the integrity of the Terni site during the current sale and hive-off by Outokumpu of its steel pipe business.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of fiscal policy, the measures contained in June’s Growth Pact must be implemented swiftly, encouraging fiscal consolidation to bolster growth and thus safeguard the role of public investment in European fiscal policy. Finally, there is the question of rules on State aid, which should be recast to encourage bridging finance aimed at securing the future of manufacturing at sites deemed to be strategic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A piece of history and a memory are disappearing, and I am in a very good position to share the sadness – and also the anger – of thousands of people, both here and elsewhere. I will not, however, harp on the usual subject of the wicked capitalists who shut down factories to feed shareholders who are already too fat.</p>
<p class="contents">The exceptional economic crisis, the fall in demand, production overcapacity, and also the European regulatory frenzy that undermines our competitiveness, are indisputable facts and I will not make unjust accusations against the economic decision-makers. However, I am aware of the devastating effects of the closures of iron and steelworks sites on both jobs and European industrial know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to respond, not by making unrealistic promises, but by embarking on a European industrial policy worthy of the name. As Europeans, we have strategic interests to defend and the iron and steel industry is certainly an industrial element. Industrial policy certainly does not mean protectionism or closing borders, but Europe must not be a sieve, a market open on all sides. Our main partners are showing us the way.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning iron and steel we, as the European Union, must aim to define minimum rules so as not to bleed dry an industry that will pick up again one day, when the economic situation improves. There is something irreparable in what is happening today. A European industrial policy could remedy this perfectly without affecting the essential competitiveness of European industry compared to other parts of the world.</p>

Our workers in this sector have developed real know-how. Steel is the raw material of the manufacturing industries we would all like to re-launch, like the car industry. It is a sector that provides jobs and contributes greatly to structuring the economic fabric and in which major investments have been made, often with the participation of the public sector, in research and development of new iron and steel products with a high added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take an enlightening example of the drifts of the large groups. For several years, the ArcelorMittal group has been putting in place, in the Moselle-Luxembourg-Liège iron and steel basin, a strategy of gradual destruction of production capital. What are the foundations of this strategy? The group is shutting down production sites that are still profitable, but plays on competition between these sites to redirect their investments. It rejects the idea of selling the tooling, which still offers good performance, to prevent it being taken over by a potential competitor. We must act.</p>

<p class="contents">You have led some of these debates with Commissioner Andor, which is right, as they discuss industrial policy, which is also at the heart of European jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a key figure is missing from your debate – that is, Commissioner Barnier – because it is evident that, behind several strategies that are at play, it is strategies for financing the economy that lead to the unravelling of the industrial fabric of our regions, and it is also the stitch you will need to knit, if you will permit the expression. I therefore thank you for having taken the initiative of this working group, which is a logical link between the reasoning on raw materials and that on the car industry. What is required is a global strategy that combines the issue of research and development with the issue of quality and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am always struck by the extent to which Europeans have been mobilised and shocked at the idea that they could no longer control access to rare earths as if it were a strategic issue, rather like what the Americans have sometimes done. Yet when considering the issue of iron and steel, Europeans do not consider it just as strategic for our economies. We allow Mr Mittal to behave simply like a financier and, contrary to everything we have learned in our economics textbooks, rather than create added value, he tries to go up the added value chain by destabilising and destroying production units on the European sites so he can go and buy mines, where he can organise speculation better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The steel sector – as I said in my first intervention, in response to the question from Ms Sartori – is a key element. Competing at a global level evidently means having to deal with a reality that has completely changed compared to the past, as many Members have pointed out during this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, during the last Competitiveness Council, we discussed the issue of industrial policy, its strength at a global level and the problems that exist in a context that has changed since the 1950s. A debate is also under way within the Commission: I have received a letter on this very subject from seven industrialised countries – from Luxembourg to France, Italy and Germany – which are insisting that we have a debate on this issue, as well as on the issue of State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Almunia, who is responsible for competition policy, intends to present a draft reform. The Commission has also begun a debate, because we do not wish to be left behind. At the same time, we must remember that competition laws are fundamental for growth and that we must protect the internal market. However, if I have understood Members correctly, this is an issue that we must discuss and reflect on over the months ahead, if we want our industry to be competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Internal market policy – in response to Ms Berès – must also be part of this initiative: Commissioner Barnier is undoubtedly one of the strongest advocates of a European industrial policy, and I have always been able to count on his support for all the initiatives I have sought to adopt, including the one on steel. This leads me to say that a reversal is under way at a political level in Europe: I mention the 20 % target, because alongside the 20 % reduction in CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions and the 20 % renewables target, there is also the target of 20 % of GDP linked to industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, there is still much to be done in the steel sector, such as the question of ETS raised by several Members. The Commission has already given a positive response regarding compensation: we have reached a stage where up to 85 % of the amount of State aid in this sector has been authorised, and we have included all of the most important industrial segments, including steel.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, with regard to back-loading, the European Commission has unveiled a specific proposal and the ball is now in the court of the European Parliament, whose opinion will be decisive because without the support of Parliament and the Council, nothing can be achieved in this sector. However, I have taken note of the concerns raised, although we need to act in a way – which I believe to be possible – that reconciles environmental policy and industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to reply to Ms Durant...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. − <span class="italic">(FR)</span> … and I do so in French. The new framework programme and Horizon 2020 will offer new opportunities for financing research and development and progressing towards more efficient production in terms of resources and energy. The iron and steel industry, together with other industries, has already submitted a proposal for a new public-private partnership called SPIRE. I think that these credits can also be used in future financial perspectives. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">–</span><span class="italic">(IT) </span>Even regarding access to raw materials – an issue I raised but which Ms Merkies talked about in her intervention, as echoed by Ms Berès – I definitely do not think that the question of rare earth elements is the only problem. However, a strategy for raw materials is fundamental for the steel sector. As you know, we have signed a series of agreements with non-EU countries, paving the way for the Innovation Partnership on the replacement, recycling and extraction of raw materials. This is a strong initiative which will be financed as part of the current and upcoming financial perspectives, in which the European Parliament will be closely involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Terni, I believe Commissioner Almunia has acted in strict compliance with current legislation. The fact the Terni industrial site has remained united and whole is, I think, a good thing, and will enable it to be sold: fragmenting it would have been much riskier in terms of protecting the site; keeping it whole at least means being able to place it on the market with more guarantees for the protection of jobs and know-how. In terms of the steel pipes business, admittedly this has not been included with the rest of the site; however, this is not strictly related – even from a geographical point of view – in view of the willingness, it appears to me, of the current owner to sell the business. Therefore, I believe the problem that was highlighted by Ms Angelilli can be resolved by protecting this industrial site, which is important not only for Italy, but for the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress the importance of having an industrial policy for the Union. We will discuss this again at the next Competitiveness Council on 10 December – a Competitiveness Council to which we would like to assign greater importance, and strengthen the role of industrial policy and industry representatives. I would like to thank the Cypriot presidency for its help with this initiative. On the evening of 9 December I also intend to meet with industry ministers to tackle the subject of the automotive crisis, which is closely linked to the issue of the steel crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is absolutely determined to protect our industry, to make it more modern and competitive, more environmentally sustainable, but also, of course, to make it instrumental in exiting the crisis and safeguarding jobs. I am utterly convinced that the sacrifices we have demanded from our fellow citizens will be absolutely essential. However, unless these sacrifices are accompanied by a strong growth policy – and thus by a strong industrial policy – they risk being not only ineffective but above all harmful to our citizens. This is why it is important to tackle both fronts simultaneously. It is my responsibility and aim to defend the growth policy throughout the European Union, while protecting, strengthening and rendering the steel industry more competitive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are the same people who, in 2006, in the name of the sacrosanct competition policy, approved Mittal’s hostile takeover bid of Arcelor, harshly criticised anyone who denounced the absence of industrial plans on the part of the Indian billionaire and rejected any national, or even European, strategic vision. The result of your management? Now the great majority of the iron and steel industry is in the hands of non-European multinational firms that give preference to short-term profitability and search for the lowest possible costs, especially in their countries of origin. However, the iron and steel industry is strategic. To apply common Brussels law to it condemns to unacceptable foreign dependence many other industrial sectors that provide millions of jobs, such as the automotive and construction sectors, and symbolises the absence of a European industrial plan. The reaction of France, which asks that strategic multinational companies take into account the concerns of the Member States, is pitiful: as he demonstrated by his first merger-acquisition, Mr Mittal does not care. These multinationals serve only their owners-shareholders. Unless it is a shareholder itself, the state can do nothing. However, those sacrificed in Gandrange, Florange, Dunkirk and, sadly, elsewhere will appreciate it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The destructuring of the European steel industry, together with the increase in steel imports from third countries which are not subject to the same stringent environmental regulations, have caused job losses in Europe. As a result, the workforce within the steel sector has decreased from 1 million employees in 1970 to approximately 408 000 employees in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2010 EU steel exports reached 33.7 million tonnes, the main importers being Turkey, the United States, Algeria, Switzerland, Russia and India, and the Union’s steel imports amounted to 26.8 million tonnes, the main exporters being Russia (6.5 million tonnes), Ukraine (5.7 million tonnes), China (3.6 million tonnes), Turkey (1.8 million tonnes), South Korea, Switzerland and Serbia. Against the background of the economic crisis, the steel industries of Romania, Belgium, Sweden and Bulgaria have been worst affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Steel is the most used material in the world owing to its strength, flexibility and multiple uses, and production amounted to 1.4 billion tonnes in 2010. The Union needs a competitive steel industry capable of providing jobs within Europe. I call on the Commission and the Member States to help the steel industry to modernise, because only by causing less pollution and becoming more energy-efficient can it remain internationally competitive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
