<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Linkohr (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, my report is less controversial, but, I believe, no less significant. It makes the simple claim that Europe must invest more in research. The proportion of Europe’s gross domestic product devoted to research expenditure is to increase to 3% by 2010; one-third must be raised from public funds, and two-thirds to be contributed by industry. Only in this way can the European Union become the most competitive region in the world, which is what Europe’s Heads of State or Government called for in Lisbon as many as three years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission endorses this call and has calculated that, by 2010, industry’s expenditure on research will have to increase by 9% per annum, and the public contribution by 6% per annum, if this target is to be reached. We are nowhere near doing that. Even though the EU is more populous, the USA spends USD 140 billion more every year on research; the National Institute of Health, which deals solely with medicine as a life science, has USD 28 billion at its disposal – more than the whole of the rest of the world spends in this field. Its budget has doubled over the past five years, and, in 2004, it will be getting another billion dollars, itself equivalent to over two-thirds of the budget of the German Research Foundation. The National Science Foundation will also have its funding increased by 6%.</p>
<p class="contents">The USA is not alone, though, in increasing its expenditure on research, which is already at a high level; Japan has sharply increased its spending on research, even though its economy is flagging. In 1997, all parties in the Japanese parliament joined in taking the initiative in adopting a ten-year plan, with substantial rates of increase to encourage young scientists. Canada, which was facing economic recession some years ago, has consciously invested in science and technology and is now reaping the economic rewards of its efforts. In the past year alone, the sum of CAD 800 million was made available for the purpose of attracting foreign professors to the country. In Europe, by contrast, spending has been static and has, in some countries, even been reduced; despite all their pious utterances, most EU countries are cutting back on education and research. Fewer and fewer students are interested in physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology. Enterprises are moving their research to the USA. UNICE is already talking in terms of the threat of de-industrialisation. To be sure, there are exceptions: Sweden and Finland are showing us what everyone should be doing. Why is it, though, that it is the larger countries that are neglecting research? I have just received a letter from Italy, where a competition was held to appoint 1 600 scientists to university posts. They have now spent two whole years waiting to be appointed because the funding has not been made available.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely, though, this cannot be just about money; after all, we spend a lot of money on subsidising all sorts of things, including EUR 900 million from our budget for tobacco cultivation alone. It is evident that what we lack is not money but the right priorities; it is in the past that we invest rather than in the future. What is to be done? We have to change course, or else our repeatedly calling for a knowledge-based society in Europe will become a sad joke, and then nobody will take the EU seriously any more. It will be seen as a tired and enfeebled colossus, a continent filled with boastful babble, fragile and old, nothing more than a historical museum.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore have three demands to make in the hope that Parliament, the Commission and Council will endorse them. Firstly, there must be an increase in private-sector expenditure on research; a rate of increase of 9% per annum would be feasible if we were to do as the Commission communication on research policy recommends. To do that, we have to try every incentive, including tax exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to increase public expenditure. What this means for the EU’s research budget is that the Seventh Research Framework Programme must run to at least EUR 30 billion. I might add, by the way, that this figure corresponds to the annual increase of 6% for public-sector research expenditure that I have called for and takes account of the growth in the EU’s size.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the EU should act on the advice of the scientific organisations and set up a European Research Council, from whose resources basic research would be funded. If we are to change course, the new policy has to be set out, so I suggest that we hold, before the European elections, a European Scientific Congress in Brussels or Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Enough has been written, enough has been said; the Commission, too, has presented a convincing document. Enough of statements of intent; now is the time for action.</p>

This is a very high-quality report, which is entirely worthy of the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. I would also like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its members.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again this report shows, and I am delighted about this, the importance that Parliament attaches to research and innovation. What is also very important is that this is a growing phenomenon. The Council of Ministers now regularly discusses research and innovation. The Growth Initiative introduced research and innovation as a key element of European growth. In the same way, knowledge production has – and this is quite logical – become a major political priority in the knowledge-based society. This is why, moreover, the 3% objective, which was discussed here in Parliament, was also adopted by the Council of Ministers and must be implemented. Mr Linkohr did, however, quite rightly mention that, in order to implement the 3% objective, an average increase of at least 8% is necessary, 9% for the private sector and 6% for the public sector. It is a good idea to repeat these figures regularly if we want to take up the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The actions proposed in the action plan are aimed at many aspects, in particular creating a more favourable environment for private investment as well as in research and that regards, in particular, the areas of competition, intellectual property, the regulatory environment, financial markets and taxation. Nor must we forget however, as you stressed, the issue of public support for research and innovation, which remains essential, as does, of course, the whole issue of fundamental research, and I will return to this after the speeches – which will no doubt provide some responses – on this European Research Council which is being discussed and formed. There is, of course, also a process and the action plan is the start of the process. There is no time to lose. Fundamentally, I believe that we need, once and for all, to not see research as an expense, but rather as a priority investment for the future of Europe. I think that this is the key element in the approach and I feel that, with the joint action by Parliament, the scientific community, and industry, there is greater and greater awareness that this is a question of life and death for Europe, in economic and social terms. I would like to thank you Mr Linkohr, and all of the Members too, for having given your backing to these issues and I hope that the next time I speak, I will of course be replying to more specific aspects of what has just been presented to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is consensus in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy regarding the fact that research funding in the EU should be increased significantly and promptly. Thus, on the threshold of enlargement it would be good to come up with some clear figures in addition to all the fine words. The final sum for the Seventh Framework Programme has to be EUR 30 billion. A smaller investment will not bring the same benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">One of Europe’s weaknesses has been insufficient SME involvement in research. Statistical illusion also has a part in this. The most important tool in Europe to achieve the 3% target is companies and in particular SMEs. At present, companies are doing much innovative work that is not statistically recorded at all as Research and Development and it cannot even be supported through the various public aid instruments. The reason for this is that the notion of innovation is vague, the rules can be interpreted in many ways, and, consequently, there is uncertainty over the fairness of the system. For this reason, it is this area that needs improving, because SMEs are often particularly innovative. They are also a driving force behind any kind of growth and the creation of new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Market-oriented research support for SMEs should be encouraged through special funding. Forms of public intervention, be they tax advantages or direct subsidies, must not, however, influence what types of subsidy are approved nor the permitted intensity of aid granted. Member States should in future be free to devise their own policies so as to ensure that the competition rules which are within the Community’s competence are neutral in relation to the choice of instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of a European Research Council would strengthen the worldwide competitive position of basic research carried out in Europe at the highest scientific level. This would mainly come about by offering long-term funding at European level. There is a need to ensure that the European Research Council is granted sufficient resources, not out of the present budget, but over and above the existing research funding.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the Commission should provide further and more accurate information about which forms of public aid do not distort competition. The Commission’s aims to investigate and clarify the Community’s R&amp;D state aid system and target such aid at horizontal objectives are very important and welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are lucky to have two committed men, both of whom realise the importance of science. I was re-reading the hearings documents on the appointment of the Commission and I was very pleased to see how far the Commission has gone towards the objectives the Commissioner set out at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment the whole credibility of European Union Member States is at stake. They have made declarations, including the one made in Lisbon, but they have not taken the action needed to put those declarations into effect. Indeed, some Member States have done precisely the opposite of what is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, like many of us, endorses the Commission's recommendations and the action plan it has put forward. We plead with Member States to implement what they have said in their declarations. We need the Finance Ministers of the European Union to look towards the seventh framework programme and the necessary funding. We need to train and retain scientists; women scientists in particular are a wasted resource. There needs to be coordination between research infrastructure and regional policy. We must find out why countries like Sweden and Finland can do that whilst other countries cannot. We have much to learn from them.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely support the creation of a European Research Council to give some coordination and coherence to our work, particularly in basic research. A recent meeting with astronauts made me more aware of the potential for science in Europe if we take the messages of the Lisbon declaration seriously. Almost all of us know them off by heart, but Member States have so far taken very little action on them.</p>

This is a necessary target if we want to close the gap with the US and be the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010. Unfortunately, this 3% is currently not being achieved; it is only 1.9%. Industry must account for the lion's share of this 3%, because, according to the Council proposal, one-third should come from the government and two-thirds from industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an agreeable proposal, but the European governments should, however, create the right climate for industry to be able to gain a permanent foothold in Europe and to re-invest, particularly in development and in R&amp;D. This also applies to a great extent to small and medium-size enterprises. In various Member States, initiatives have been developed in order to provide financial support to starter projects from SMEs, especially in the field of technology. In this respect, the fact that technological research, especially high-quality research, takes a very long time to establish is being overlooked. That is why there is always a need for new funding, and this is not always forthcoming in Europe. Starting is not such a problem, but secondary funding is a huge problem. We are experiencing this in the Netherlands too, with the hugely successful 'Biopartner' project. However, an investment climate requires clear and transparent legislation, backed by sufficient and well-trained researchers. Moreover, the mobility of researchers in Europe is still a major problem, because researchers are being hindered by different working conditions in the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to put their money where their mouth is and take specific measures to create a favourable business climate for research and development in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They include recognising the role of research and researchers and the need to increase expenditure and ascribing the importance to basic research which it deserves. For that I should like to thank our rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, there are also extremely dangerous points in keeping with the more general policy of commercialising everything. They include the reference to competition-orientated research in paragraph 5, the approach to intellectual property rights from the point of view of the commercial interests of private undertakings in paragraph 26 and public intervention for market-orientated research and financing which abides by the rules of competition of the European Union in paragraph 32.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a proposal for tax incentives for private research activities, while the main international cooperation which appears to be of interest is at the level of undertakings in paragraph 41. The most worrying of all is that the suggested criterion for measuring the success of each research activity is if it has a positive economic result, while the introduction of a corresponding evaluation system is proposed in paragraph 37.</p>
<p class="contents">The above proposals and everyday political practice in research and higher education make the positive points in the report sound like a simple wish list. Thus, I disagree with the overall orientation of the final version of the report. We face the demolition of the system of values developed over previous centuries and the erection of a new structure founded on commercialisation and corporate profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, as Mr Linkohr rightly said, I believe that what is very important is that we show that we are keeping a close eye on the next Financial Perspective, because this is what will determine the leeway after 2006 and, not least, the place of research and innovation in the European Union budget. As Commissioner for research and innovation, I submitted proposals and the Commission will present a document, but it is clear that there will be a major political debate next year and up until 2006. That debate will allow a Financial Perspective to be drawn up, which increases the relative share of research and innovation in EU budgets, and will do so in order to respond to various needs that have been expressed and to sustain the 3% objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly it is also important that, when I think of new measures, I am thinking, among others, of fundamental research, which is not currently supported at European level. I am thinking of space policy, on which Mrs McNally and myself have just published a White Paper, which has obviously drawn on this desire to develop new technologies and to develop technology transfers and to sustain this level of scientific curiosity, which is determined by the desire to go further because there is the potential to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Matikainen, however, you rightly stressed the role of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is true that the drive to transfer research to the economy, which is also a reality, is and must be greater for small and medium-sized enterprises. You are from a country that sets an example for us since, in Finland, 55% of small and medium-sized enterprises maintain regular contact with universities and centres of research. These areas must be extended to European level and there are, of course, methodologies, which must be specific to small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission intends to adopt the category exemption of small and medium-sized enterprises regarding state aid for Research and Development at the beginning of 2004. As a result, from 1 January 2004, it will no longer be necessary for small and medium-sized enterprises to inform the Commission and, therefore, it will be possible for the various States and regions to adopt more individual and specific measures for their small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as regards fundamental research, it is absolutely necessary that there is a clearer proposal on this field, in the Seventh Framework Programme, that also takes into consideration the current debate in the scientific community on the European Research Council. You have spoken about this European Research Council, which seeks to place the best scientific teams in the area of fundamental research in competition with one another at European level and consequently to support these areas which, as has been said, are comparable with what is being done in the National Science Foundation<span class="italic">, </span>where the best teams have programmes at US level. We should have this type of programme at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, the issue that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, moreover, quite rightly stressed, and that is the issue of funding. This obviously includes public funding, private funding, which must be increased, and of course looking to the European Investment Bank, which could be more geared towards research and innovation, which is, incidentally, happening more and more. Also, in the Growth Initiative, which was adopted on 11 November 2003, we find the concept of ‘quick starts’, that is to say projects that can be implemented quite quickly. In addition, for the first time, EUR 14 billion is earmarked for projects for European structures and for essential European infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, thinking about all general network issues, all issues of space policy, regarding in particular the GMES and interactive telecommunications satellites; we are, of course, thinking about tri-electron lasers, which are crucial to the emergence of a new generation of research in molecular biology, in materials and in nanotechnologies because nanotechnologies will be essential, bearing in mind the shift from microelectronics to nanoelectronics.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made provision for a technological platform and, in this area; the Finnish centre is involved in implementing the shift from micro to nanoelectronics because it is there that the greatest challenge lies. As regards this challenge, we will clearly look into the issue of technological platforms. According to the sector, we will endeavour to bring together major players to determine research projects as well as research needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, to reply to a question from Mrs McNally, it is, therefore, through programmes that include questions such as: ‘what are you going to do?’ that we will get there. As regards the Member States, the 3% objective and the Growth Initiative call upon them to say: ‘this is what we are going to do. Here is our programme for us to reach the objective by 2010’. The Commission’s role will therefore be to encourage, because even if we cannot decide for the Member States, we can still motivate them, show the best practices and support the process to this 3% in 2010. This is an essential process if Europe wants to keep its place in the world, but that requires financing and being given the priority, which is granted to research policy. I think that you appreciate this and I would like to thank you for supporting this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Since, in addition, this will probably be one of the last times we will be given these reports to discuss, I would like to thank all of the members of the Commission, as well as Parliament for the support they have given to research and innovation and my friend Erkki Liikanen, who will take over from me. Clearly we are on the same wavelength and we are in favour of an ambitious European industrial policy for research and innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I endorse his call for a significant increase in the amount of money spent on research in Europe with the aim of achieving the Lisbon targets, even though prompt transposition will be made difficult by the present tightness of many Member States’ budgets. If research in the EU is to be built up on a long-term basis, any increase in expenditure must therefore go hand in hand with greater efficiency in the application and management of the resources and with a more pronounced bias towards basic research. I am glad that the lead committee has agreed to my amendments in this regard. However, it also rejected the motion that what are termed the new instruments in the current Sixth Research Framework Programme should be drafted more rationally. This has led my own group to reintroduce Amendment 1, in which Parliament ‘calls, in the context of the 6th Research Framework Programme, for the ideas of 'networks of excellence' and 'integrated projects' to be geared more closely to the guiding notion of the European Research Area, and that adjustments, particularly in relation to the size of projects – both in terms of the number of project partners and of the financial volumes involved – should therefore be made.’ It is our expectation that this will enable, even now, the EU’s research policy to be adapted to the currently prevailing realities. I therefore ask you to adopt this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
