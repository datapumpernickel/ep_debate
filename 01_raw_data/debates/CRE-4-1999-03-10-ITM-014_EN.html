<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Trakatellis, </span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (EL)</span> Madam President, the Commission proposal only partly addresses the restructuring of the common organisation of the market in tobacco.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four points in relation to which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made changes which we believe will be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns the fact that, since 1995, there has been absolutely no readjustment of premiums, which has resulted in producers suffering a substantial reduction in income. Our committee has proposed a 5 % increase in premiums, which exactly covers inflation in the European Union since 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the transfer of certain varieties of tobacco from one category to a better one. We believe that this is quite proper, except that these transfers must be possible and they must go ahead. Let me give you a specific example from Italy, where out of approximately 15 000 tonnes, which is the guarantee threshold, it has been proposed to transfer between 3 000 and 3 500 tonnes from an inferior variety group to other groups. This can go ahead. In Greece, on the other hand, out of approximately 15 000 tonnes, it has been proposed to transfer 14 800 tonnes, which is impossible within the time suggested. This cannot go ahead for many reasons. I would like to say, first of all, that if a producer were able to change his variety, why would he not do so? For less tobacco production, he would receive the same money. What our committee is proposing, therefore, after much study and debate, is that up to 25 % could be transferred, at least in the case of Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns the time needed for implementation. We are already well into the 1999 period, and these transfers require study and a programme. We propose that the framework should be implemented for 2000‐2002, as this is logical and feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point concerns the introduction of a national variety which is grown in the region of Pieria and bears the name of a town in Pieria: Katerini. It has been proposed that this variety should be moved to another region of the European Union, in other words outside those regions which are provided for in the COM regulations. We believe that this will have negative results, rather than the desired outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the four points in relation to which our committee has made changes which I believe must be accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some amendments which refer to the harmful effect of smoking on health and which say that funding must not be given and that tobacco production must be reduced. However, what they do not say is that if production is reduced, imports of tobacco from outside the European Union will increase for years to come. I feel, therefore, that this is an unreasonable proposal. We seem to be unwilling to face reality. Perhaps the campaign against smoking should be waged from the point of view of consumption and not from the point of view of production. I am a doctor and I do not smoke, but I find it illogical that we want to reduce production when we currently import tobacco and will import more in the future as a result. This will have damaging economic effects on the European Union and it will also lead to social unrest, because many tobacco producers will be left without work, not only in Greece but in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Germany – everywhere, in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is proposing, therefore, is that these amendments should be rejected – and we have already rejected similar amendments in committee – because, as we have said, we believe that there must be economic and social support in the tobacco‐producing sector. This is the truth and the reality of the matter. I propose that we fight to reduce smoking, in which case world production of tobacco will be reduced. What we are in fact doing is punishing our own tobacco producers while rewarding tobacco producers in countries outside the Community and creating a major social problem in the European Union.</p>

By a decision of the Council of 22 June 1998, the additional funding which is allocated for cultivated tobacco in Austria, Belgium, Germany and France will increase by between 50 % and 65 % in relation to the 1992 harvest. In addition, in order to maintain financial neutrality, the overall level of guarantee thresholds will fall by 0.95 % between 1999 and 2001. Premiums are to be increased by 10 %, with a corresponding reduction in special subsidies allocated through producer organisations. These proposals maintain financial neutrality, and therefore the Committee on Budgets raises no objection to them. I would point out that the value of the premiums has fallen by 5 % in real terms in relation to 1995. Consequently, an increase in the order of a further 5 % would be a logical readjustment. For this reason, I support the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the comments made by Mr Trakatellis on the difficulties and the fundamental inability of Greek producers to carry out tobacco transfers. Greek producers are small and medium‐sized tobacco producers and it is impossible to replace the qualities they cultivate. Essentially, in the infertile soil where the tobacco is grown, it is impossible for them to switch to better varieties in such a short time. That is why, Madam President, I believe that the Commission proposals regarding Greece do not fall within the spirit of the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco.</p>

<p class="contents">I fear I cannot speak with the mild good humour and the calm words of my chairman. I get quite indignant when I hear my good friend, Mr Trakatellis say that of course we must wage a campaign against tobacco, but if we are going to kill 28 million people in Europe per year with tobacco, it may as well be with our own subsidised crops. That surely should not be the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection believes that with tobacco responsible for as many deaths as it is, the hypocrisy here is, on the one hand, for the European Commission to be spending large sums of money on subsidising research into cancer but throwing away a similar amount on the subsidy – and now the renewed subsidy – of this crop. The fact of the matter is that we have been, for 28 years, supporting tobacco growing within the Community and the financial dependency that goes with it. The Environment Committee has asked for a gradual reduction in these quotas and premiums for raw tobacco. We intended that, in the countries where the dependency was the greatest, to take effect by 2008 – in ten years – and in the northern countries, where, as we have just heard, there is a proposal to increase the sums available from 50 % to 65 % in relation to the 1992 harvest, we wanted that abolished within five years. We are not getting that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are moving in the wrong direction and we are creating a health problem. To my good friend Mr Trakatellis, who is himself a doctor, I ask if he could honestly deny that is the case? Every time there is a case brought against the tobacco multinationals, every time damages are proved once again in one of these cases, we see the medical evidence laid bare. We all understand that fact. When I hear Trakatellis I am reminded of what the martyr Jan Huss said when he saw people piling up the faggots to burn him to death. He said to an old peasant woman coming forward with her faggots: ‘<span class="italic">O sancta simplicitas</span> ". Those who argue for a greater subsidy for tobacco are saying that today. I say to them: <span class="italic">sancta simplicitas</span> . This is not the way to go.</p>

This is where the main obstacles lie. As the representative of the Environment Committee said, there is a fundamental paradox here. It is true that smoking is unhealthy, but it is equally true that the problem will not be solved by reducing or eliminating tobacco growing in Europe. Either we take a radical position and have the courage to call for smoking to be banned, or else we try to cut the rhetoric. The arguments are always the same: on occasion, I have had to support tobacco growers and defend the sponsorship of major sporting events, including the Formula 1 Grand Prix, even though tobacco advertising has been banned at these, and certain Member States' governments have challenged the legality of the measures we are adopting. It was nevertheless decided to press ahead, without applying the principle of subsidiarity, bearing in mind that other sectors – such as textiles and clothing – had branding problems needing to be tackled gradually over time. We are told at one and the same time that production should be switched and that milk quotas cannot be increased, that under the COM in wine vineyards cannot be replanted or extended, and so on in all the other farm sectors. Let us call a spade a spade; let us not make impractical proposals. If we put forward workable ideas, with the necessary subsidies, then tobacco growers will be willing to go along with our initiatives – as long as they are feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us cut the rhetoric of the Environment Committee's amendments. Let us support the Commission's proposal as amended by Mr Trakatellis, remaining consistent with the realistic approach we adopted previously, granting aid for quality improvements with a view to promoting tobacco that is less harmful than before, and investigating tangible – not rhetorical – ways of embarking on a process of crop substitution.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lambraki </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Madam President, the Commission proposal on the fixing of premiums and quotas for tobacco over the next three years centres around two main issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it aims to abolish group V varieties almost totally and in a very short space of time and, secondly, it offers the possibility of transferring the Katerini variety and introducing it into Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the first issue, the Commission seems to be unaware of the particular conditions of production in the specific regions where these varieties are grown, since it is proposing the substitution of certain varieties, such as black tobacco, in soil where their cultivation is simply impossible. Moreover, the very short space of time proposed by the Commission for this substitution will mean a deadlock for producers, whereby any idea of planning will be turned on its head.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second issue, the introduction of the Katerini variety into Italy will affect the operation of the market both in terms of prices and stocks, since it will have a negative impact on the balance of supply and demand, and in terms of the quality of this variety of tobacco, since the soil and climatic conditions of the new producer regions are totally different from the regions where it has been grown for the last 30 years. Unfortunately, the Agriculture Commissioner has failed to bring me the study I had asked for, which was allegedly written by a Greek and which purported to show that these tobacco varieties could prosper and be productive in Italy. I am still waiting for the name of the Greek who carried out this study, and this is the first time the Commission has taken account of a study and put forward a proposal based on one. This has not happened before. I am still waiting for Mr Fischler to give me the name and the relevant details.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur for his own amendments and for those accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I believe that they greatly improve the Commission proposal. These amendments aim to improve conditions for the production of tobacco, to set in motion a rational and feasible adjustment in terms of time towards improving the quality of tobacco and, finally, to maintain the level of income of many families on the continent of Europe who live in some of the poorest regions of the European Union, something which the author of the study never really took into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say a word in conclusion. As the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been proposing amendments and talking about health matters for the last five years, it would be a good idea if it tabled an amendment to ban the use of butter, since butter damages the heart and increases the risk of heart disease. We should also ban the circulation of cars, because I doubt that there is a scientist who can say that smoking is more harmful than the pollution caused by cars and car manufacturers. At some point the hypocrisy in this House has to stop.</p>

It is a moderate report because it makes certain suggestions that, in my view, will help to adapt the tobacco market to the need to improve quality, give tobacco producers the time they need to change varieties and, at the same time, act as a preventive measure by promoting change to a given variety such as Caterini in the case of Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Trakatellis's proposals and also agree with the 5 % increase which is really just compensation for the successive devaluations that have taken place since 1995. 5 % is no big deal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to emphasise two aspects. First of all, the lack of concern shown by the European Parliament, in my view, about fighting fraud in the tobacco sector. I have no doubt whatsoever that if fraud in the tobacco sector – one of the major forms of fraud to be found in Europe – were really taken seriously, without crocodile tears or hypocrisy, the money recovered would be more than enough to pay for the many illnesses that the Committee on the Environment says affect smokers – since we know full well and have been amply warned that tobacco is harmful. As far as I am concerned, the only thing I ask of a smoker is that they do not disturb me and blow their smoke over me.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that tobacco is one of the most heavily taxed products. In my country, it is taxed at 82 %. I think that whoever takes the risk of smoking and becoming ill will already have paid for his hospital bed. It may be in poor taste to say this but it is the truth. As far as I am concerned I think everyone should be free to do as they wish as long as they do not inconvenience others.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hardstaff </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, I could not allow to go by default possibly my last opportunity in this Parliament to point out the nonsense of spending over ECU1 billion subsidising the growing of a product which kills and maims its consumers. Only yesterday at the end of the debate on Mr Needle's report on European public health policy Commissioner Bangemann pointed out the contradiction of spending vastly more public money on supporting a product which undermines health than on public health programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are actually discussing here a Commission proposal to increase payments to tobacco producers in four of the richest countries in the European Union, allegedly because they produce better quality tobacco. France, Germany, Belgium and Austria are not countries so poor or with soil so poor that no other crops can grow there. There is absolutely no case on social grounds, such as could possibly be made for Greece or Spain, for public money to be used in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a lone voice in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the date of the vote, supporting the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and very similar ones of my own, calling for the phasing out of subsidies for all tobacco. Sadly, others who shared my view could not be present on that occasion. I strongly support my colleague Mr Whitehead. The proposals before us move completely in the wrong direction. If European farmers want to grow tobacco it should be without public subsidy and the subsidies that exist should be phased out over a number of years with extra support to Objective 1 and Objective 5b areas during the transition. Increaisng subsidies over three years to rich countries is totally indefensible.</p>

These references have chiefly come from Members not concerned with agriculture, who see the debate more in terms of social policy. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur very sincerely for all his efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of tobacco production in the agricultural sector of the European Union and of individual Member States varies widely. I believe that for a number of reasons it would be unwise to abandon tobacco production in the EU without any compromises, as many people are demanding. In many regions of Europe, tobacco growing is often the only viable form of agricultural production, and this applies particularly to a number of Objective 5(b) areas, including those in ‘rich' countries such as Austria. Many family farms working in difficult conditions are dependent on tobacco production, which represents their only source of income. Switching to other agricultural products is often out of the question because of the climate. I think we are all acutely aware of the social and economic pressure on the population of these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that it is pretty unrealistic to expect that people would smoke less or even give up altogether if we completely stopped European tobacco production. The result would just be that all our cigarettes and tobacco products would be imported from third countries. I hope that you will not misunderstand me, as I attach great importance to a healthy lifestyle and I myself am a non‐smoker. Nevertheless I think that decisions about our own health should be left to the individual. I think we should grant each person that much responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to point out the need for an improvement in tobacco quality. I would also like to stress that a voluntary halt to tobacco production in the EU should be possible, with financial support from the EU.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Santini </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Madam President, I feel as though I am at the races: whenever we discuss tobacco it is the same old Derby between Latins, Mediterraneans and Anglo‐Saxons, as if the latter did not smoke. It really is disconcerting that yet again, one year after we last met here to discuss the COM, we are sticking to our guns and saying the same things. I was tempted to repeat the speech I made last year, just to check whether anyone was listening! Mind you, I shall not stray very far from it.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, while the Derby continues, some points have been scored by those wishing to abolish the cultivation of this crop in Europe. The prices and premiums have been unchanged since 1995, meaning that they have already fallen by 5 % in real terms; the COM is being put into effect slowly – indeed, for the time being it merely represents additional costs; and the negative effects of the transition from the ecu to the euro are weighing most heavily of all on areas where tobacco is grown, in other words – let us not forget – in the most peripheral areas, those of Objective 1.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, neither the COM proposal nor that of the Commission takes the slightest account of new elements which we attempted to introduce last year: for example the social proposals – recalled by several speakers – aimed at eliminating tobacco growing as a means of combating cancer, as if people would stop smoking because they could no longer find any European cigarettes on the market. Clearly the big American multinationals would have a field day! Well, in many respects the wrong approach is once again in evidence this evening. Smokers will not stop smoking, and let us not forget it, but woe betide us if we halt tobacco growing: unemployment in Europe would rise, more or less, by another 1 380 000. That would be extremely damaging, without a doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is proposed in some of the amendments put down by Mr Collins and others. Mr Collins says ‘stop growing tobacco and grow some other farm produce instead'. My reply to him is that this cannot be done everywhere, and that to ask other Europeans to do so is certainly not acceptable. And my own question is this: given that alcohol is more lethal than tobacco, why don't you British stop producing whisky and start growing strawberries?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Keppelhoff‐Wiechert </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, both the Commission proposal and the report before us are based on the premise that health should be sacrificed on the altar of structural policy. As a non‐smoker and farmer myself, I think it is important to recognise the double standards involved in the present form of tobacco subsidy. I find it hard to believe that no other crop would thrive where tobacco is grown. We need subsidies in that if we stop growing various tobacco varieties here, they would have to be bought in from outside the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that we need a change, an improvement in structural policy in the weak regions, in this case in Greece and Italy. I accept that production cannot be stopped overnight in these countries, but I feel that we have been talking about this for far too long. From my own national viewpoint, the Commission's proposals are acceptable. Although the guarantee thresholds have been reduced, this reduction at the same time makes it possible to increase the premium for the northern countries. But overall, I believe that these subsidies should be rejected in their present form. Why? Because increasing subsidies does not persuade tobacco‐growing countries to switch to other crops, but if anything encourages them to carry on as before, because ironically enough the cigarettes that are most damaging to health are those that receive the greatest subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposals are quite simply market‐oriented. The quotas for varieties with guaranteed markets and high market prices are being gradually increased, whilst the quotas for varieties with weaker markets and low market prices are being correspondingly reduced. For 28 years now tobacco production has been receiving massive support without any sign of a change of course. The varieties produced in the Community are of low quality, and producers should show more ambition and switch their production to higher‐quality varieties.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me ask what lessons we should be learning. First, I believe that tobacco subsidies should be abolished by 2008. Second, during the transitional period, they should be reduced in a socially acceptable manner. Third, as part of this reduction process, less harmful varieties should receive support and varieties which are particularly damaging to health should no longer be subsidised. Fourth, we should provide financial support during the transition period while production is switched to other agricultural products. These suggestions are not anti‐smoker, they are aimed at enhancing quality and improving health, and I believe that they also offer a solution for farmers.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Madam President, I wish to begin by complimenting the Committee<span class="italic"> </span> on Agriculture and Rural Development, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, on the quality and efficiency of their work on the proposal to complete the reform of the COM in leaf tobacco. To tell the truth, we spent a long time discussing the committee's report and the proposal on the COM reform. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission all agree on the need to continue supporting tobacco growers, whilst at the same time offering them the appropriate incentives to improve product quality. In keeping with the thrust of the report, the Commission is proposing to leave unchanged the premium levels and quota amounts, while considering a sizeable reduction in the quota for group V.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like briefly to review the main issues raised in the amendments. As regards those aimed at excluding the 1999 harvest – Amendments Nos 1 and 3 – the Commission cannot accept them, because the reform of the COM is to enter into force and apply from the 1999 harvest onwards. Furthermore, the impact of the proposal on producers is limited, in that the guarantee thresholds are maintained for all variety groups with the exception of group V; for this group, the existing threshold is below 30 % for Greece and 22 % for Italy. This deficit is being transferred to other groups on the grounds of poor quality and low market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 and 6, since the annual stability of the budget must be respected. The amendments dealing with the adverse impact of monetary conversion – Nos 4 and 5 – are unacceptable because, in the Commission's view, the same rules must apply to the common organisation of the market in tobacco as to the other COMs.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the amendments on the guarantee thresholds – Nos 7, 8 and 9 – the Commission wishes to avoid disrupting the market in all group V varieties, for which market prices are poor and which face competition from cigarettes manufactured in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Therefore, although we are prepared to examine the impact on the sector of the proposal to transfer amounts to other groups, we confirm our reservations concerning any reduction in group V.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendments Nos 10 and 13, as the additional sum for northern tobacco‐growing Member States reflects the situation of their growers and so should not be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 11, 12, 14 and 15 deal with the mandatory disengagement of the Community. I can reaffirm what the Commission proposed and Parliament agreed last time Mr Fischler discussed this matter here: the tobacco grown in the European Union covers only about a third of Community consumption, and therefore imports – currently accounting for two thirds of domestic consumption – could easily cover it entirely. On the other hand, support for tobacco growers is vital in that they are concentrated in the least developed regions of the European Union, without any obvious agricultural or economic alternatives, as has been pointed out. Moreover, the tobacco reform already makes provision for voluntary withdrawal from the sector, but we should not force farmers to leave the land. Therefore the Commission cannot accept these amendments.</p>
