I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to restate the commitment we made to inform the European Parliament systematically and transparently on the issue of the spread of infectious animal diseases in Europe. Commissioner Kyprianou, who is responsible for health and consumer protection, has kept your Parliament informed of the latest developments and of the measures taken by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday evening, he presented the situation regarding animal health to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as he had also done to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 14 September. The Commissioner has also already provided the honourable Member with information in writing on the action taken by the Commission to control these threats.</p>
<p class="contents">The discovery of outbreaks of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease in Asia of course gave rise to fears that these diseases would arrive in the European Union. All the legal measures needed to prevent the possibility of these diseases being introduced via animals and products of animal origin have already been taken. These include, in particular, the requirement to inform passengers in international ports and airports of their obligations in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission uses its regulatory powers to ensure that the existing provisions are continually updated. It is in this connection that the Member States were recommended to strengthen the application of existing measures and controls at the EU’s borders in order to ensure that only animals and products that meet Community requirements are imported.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards vaccination, emergency vaccination is already possible if outbreaks of avian influenza are discovered. The Commission has proposed a new directive regarding avian influenza. This proposal will enable us to adopt an approach to vaccination that takes into account the latest scientific developments in knowledge of the disease and the most recent epidemics. Clearly, we must not forget that vaccination on its own cannot guarantee proper prevention and control of the disease. With regard to foot-and-mouth disease, similar provisions have already been put in place. Those are the answers I wished to give on behalf of Mr Kyprianou, Madam President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two points on which I would appreciate a straightforward answer from the Commission. The Commissioner states that vaccination cannot be prevention, but that means that we should let it happen first before we use the vaccine, while the vaccine is already available. Poultry already receives 10 different types of vaccines, so why not add one against avian flu? It exists, we can use it, and it is being produced in the European Union. So why are poultry farmers and countries not given the opportunity to use it to prevent an outbreak of the disease?</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to legislation. We have just been talking about the simplification of legislation. The use of a preventive vaccine would lead to far fewer rules in the EU, and that must surely appeal to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am simply saying, and I even stated specifically, that emergency vaccination was already possible if outbreaks of avian influenza were discovered. We know, of course, that vaccination is a preventative measure but that it is not enough and that we must, at the same time, draw up a whole series of provisions that the draft directive aims to lay down. That is why I think, Mr Maat, that the Commission is not at all reticent with regard to vaccination. We also hope to develop this vaccination in view of all the scientific data that enable us to increase our knowledge of the disease, but the Commission would like to have a broader provision than simple vaccination to prevent the introduction of this disease into Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some constituents recently contacted me in connection with difficulties experienced in relation to a My Travel Airways holiday charter flight from Canaria to Glasgow. They experienced 15 hours of delay and enormous inconvenience but received no compensation from the charter flight company. They were among 49 passengers denied boarding because of airline regulations on crew shortage after a crew member had to be taken to hospital. My constituents sought compensation under recent EU legislation on denied boarding, but My Travel maintained that the new rules did not apply to the case as 'the reason for the delay was unforeseen circumstances'.</p>

As such, airlines operating this type of flight are of course obliged to comply with the provisions of that regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">From what you said, this was a case of a long delay caused by a crew shortage, and therefore not denied boarding. In this case, no financial compensation is laid down as it is for denied boarding and cancellations. Nevertheless, airlines are of course obliged to provide appropriate assistance – drinks, food, means of communication and hotel rooms, as appropriate – in order to minimise the inconvenience suffered by passengers. This assistance is compulsory in the case of denied boarding, long delays and cancellations, even if they are due to <span class="italic">force majeure</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to financial compensation, airlines are only exempted from providing it for cancellations and denied boarding caused by exceptional circumstances. So, can a crew shortage be considered to be an exceptional circumstance? This matter must be assessed on an individual basis, in view of all the factual aspects, in particular the organisation of replacements and the availability of reserve crews on site. Mrs Stihler, you will appreciate that, without all those details, the Commission cannot issue a definitive judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the basis of Article 16(2) of the regulation, passengers may now complain, if necessary, to national monitoring bodies specially authorised to deal with their complaints and their differences with airlines. I think that is all I can say, given that the best of regulations cannot cover all specific situations and that such situations need to be assessed case by case, on the basis of all the elements. In this specific case, it would be necessary to check whether replacement staff were available at the local airport for a return flight or whether organisational provisions were in place. As I said, though, the passengers in question now have the option of turning to the body set up at national level to deal with their complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find it fascinating that when air stewardesses have colds and cannot travel on an airline there must be immediate backup to cover staff shortages in those circumstances. So I wonder whether in this case the systems were just not in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Only today another Scottish constituent, a Mr Duncan Thorpe, raised the question as to whether a delay of five hours or more entitles him to compensation. According to the Europa website, where there is a delay of five hours or more the airline must offer to refund the ticket. Yet the company that replied to my constituent stated, and I quote: 'Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 does not impose any obligation on carriers to offer or pay compensation when passengers are delayed'.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Serious problems with flight safety</span></p>
<p class="contents">The air disasters which occurred during the summer have heightened concerns, particularly among airline employees and the users of airline services. Inadequate checks, which employees themselves say are largely due to deregulation of the markets and fierce competition, the contravention of safety rules to achieve immediate and maximum profit, and the welter of companies appearing and disappearing from the market without providing the necessary safety guarantees, are transforming transport from a social service into a business whose sole motive is profit.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that the single open sky and the uncontrolled pursuit of profit have contributed to the reduction in checks? Will it take measures to ensure that effective safety checks are made on all flights and take account of employees' proposals (e.g. pre-flight checks by a qualified, licensed mechanic)? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously the Commission cannot comment on the causes of those accidents: that is a job for the experts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Pafilis that we cannot draw a connection between liberalisation, the opening up of air travel to competition, and any safety issue that could be attributed to this opening up to competition. It could also be borne in mind that, at the same time as liberalising the internal market in air travel, the Commission strengthened the safety rules. The Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the field of aviation safety has grown considerably and changes in safety-related data show that the numbers of accidents and deaths have continued to fall since the launch of the liberalisation process. This process, at the same time, has made it possible to give many European citizens the option of cheaper air travel.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, safety is, now more than ever, a top priority for the aviation industry, and monitoring of Community aircraft, which is, of course, the responsibility of the national authorities, which have the freedom to refuse to grant a licence, is a point that we must monitor very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to pre-flight checks, the provisions in force require Community airlines to comply with very strict safety standards. The applicable operational regulations have been drawn up by the Joint Aviation Authorities. These rules specify that an operator shall ensure that all personnel assigned to, or directly involved in, ground and flight operations are properly instructed, have demonstrated their abilities in their particular duties and are aware of their responsibilities and the relationship of such duties to the operation as a whole. I have quoted rules that could, Madam President, have been expressed in simpler terms, for which I apologise. I would really like European texts to be simpler, but this is a text by the Joint Aviation Authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say, in response to Mr Pafilis, is that, since the beginning of February, I have taken the initiative of asking the Council of Transport Ministers about the possibility of drawing up a European list of companies that have been subject to bans or flight restrictions. It has to be said that, due to the cautiousness of the Member States, we have progressed less quickly than I would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, this summer, came the air disasters of which you are aware and to which Mr Pafilis referred, and it was at that point that Parliament, presented with this amended proposal for a regulation, adopted, at the proposal of Mrs De Veyrac as rapporteur, some extremely positive amendments harmonising the criteria under which a company can be banned or have its flight options restricted. I think that this proposal can now be adopted fairly rapidly, in November. I will therefore be able to draw up this European blacklist, which, obviously, will enable citizens to be better informed regarding the quality of the air operator they are using.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the problem of third countries. The Commission has also worked to institute stricter controls with the famous SAFA Directive. That is indeed a directive, and it must be transposed in all Member States. It must be transposed before April 2006. By relying firstly on the draft regulation on the identity of the operator, which includes assessment criteria for companies that will enable us to get started on the blacklist, and also on the SAFA directive, transposed in all the Member States, with regard to the aircraft of third countries, this will give us an instrument that, I hope, will mark a very important step in aviation safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the various points I wanted to make to Mr Pafilis who, quite rightly, questioned me on the safety of air transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, sacrifice of human life for the sake of profit. This is not our appraisal; it is the appraisal of the International Air Transport Agency. It is precisely on this point that we consider that the policy of liberalisation, of so-called 'free competition', has created a situation of unaccountability which, among other things, makes victims both of its passengers and the workers themselves. Both the governments and everyone involved, from either the public sector or the private sector, are fully aware of the state of aircraft, just as they are fully aware of the huge problems which crews face with the pressure exerted on them from changes in labour relations.</p>
<p class="contents">You are not doing anything about this; you are doing the opposite. As I do not have much time, I ask you this: why do you not withdraw the directive which allows checks to be carried out by unlicensed mechanics on the aircraft in question, rather than allowing this practice, which has proven to be a disaster? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would simply repeat that you cannot claim that the European Union has not strengthened safety legislation. We now have a European Aviation Safety Agency, which is recognised as having the desired authority, including by the US FAA. My predecessor – and I myself will continue along this path – really did strengthen the whole body of safety legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right: we cannot open the aviation industry up to competition without at the same time ensuring that we have a solid regulatory framework regarding safety. We are, however, making progress, and I would like to pay tribute, Madam President, to the European Parliament, which has helped us a great deal in this matter. I am very happy to see that we are going to have absolutely identical criteria in all the Member States where, as you know, the civil aviation authorities are responsible for safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore have common criteria that will enable us, with regard both to European companies and companies from third countries, to ascertain that a company cannot transport passengers because it does not provide the necessary security guarantees. I think that we certainly still have a lot of work to do in this field, but we have already taken a big step forward and I will tell you quite plainly that I am not one of those who will allow competition to become established outside a precise and effective regulatory framework regarding safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, after all, a very rigorous measure, which means that it will probably have a very dissuasive effect, as companies that do not meet the security standards will know that they risk being put on the blacklist, in other words of being banned from flying over the whole of the European Union. Recent events have shown that, up until now, there were bans issued by national civil aviation authorities that did not apply over the whole territory of the European Union. That was obviously not very reassuring for the people of Europe. However, this step that, I hope, we will take at the beginning of 2006, will give us a guarantee that unreliable companies will feature on the blacklist and will experience all the disadvantages of being banned from flying over the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of this project is to establish a digital database of registered active property rights, which are presently recorded on paper in mortgage offices, together with a spatial reference. This electronic registry of active titles will certainly offer a valuable service to citizens and business. We are confident that this project can be completed quickly and quite cheaply. Also, the project will establish coastal and forest zones according to Greek legislation, where there is a presumption of state ownership of the land except in urban areas. It will be for the Greek state to pursue its claim to ownership, in the manner it considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal validation of active property rights is not included in the project co-financed by the European Union through the ERDF; that action will be financed exclusively from national funds. In our view that is sufficient explanation for the apparently low level of Community funding for the project to which the honourable Member referred.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek authorities requested an ERDF co-financing rate of 50%, a level that the Commission has approved.</p>

The reason is that the remaining part – the legal validation of the property rights – cannot be included in the co-funded project because the Commission considers this a legal matter and one that is therefore outside the scope of the co-funded project. As you probably know, the legal framework in this context in Greece is quite unstable: it changes fairly often. It is therefore the responsibility of the Greeks to finalise the land registries, for which we provide technical instruments through our financing of this project.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that the legal validation work would consist largely of the work of the lawyers, so that expenditure – which would take the form of lawyers' fees and similar costs – would, in any case, not be eligible for finance from the ERDF.

<p class="contents">You referred to something that took place in 2001 and I am not sure that I remember it correctly. There was a previous land registry project in Greece which was a failure – if I may put it that strongly – and that is why the Commission decided to recover the full amount of the contribution. We then started to reach agreement on the second project when we identified the part of the project which we could finance without any doubts or problems. I understand that there are many concerns, which you have expressed here. I can offer to look into it more deeply and, with my colleagues in the DG, to see whether this limited participation is justified on the evidence available. At this stage, that is all I can offer. I will ask to be informed once more about all the details that prompted this funding level of EUR 40 million. That is all I can say at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is too premature to talk about concrete figures because my experience of the last one-and-a-half months of last year, when I took over at the end of November, was that the last months of the year usually see a huge mobilisation of funds in most of the Member States when they are able to catch up. That means there are still three months left to ensure an adequate absorption of funds in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">All I can do is make the commitment that we will work hard with the authorities on this issue and on the basis of the figure I was presented with by the DG, my feeling is that the figure is well below the one mentioned in the question by the honourable Member.

<p class="contents">As you know, for the structural funds the amount which might be at risk is the amount allocated in 2003 because now the N+2 comes automatically at the end of this year, and within the 2003 allocation we have not only ERDF, but also Social Fund and EAGGF funding. It is not for me to impose rapid action on the Greek authorities, but insofar as we can impose and mobilise we are doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">We are holding meetings at all levels and our missions are very often to Greece. Colleagues are working at a current operational level, but they are also very active in helping overcome any difficulties which have accumulated over years. Things like this do not happen overnight, but are usually the outcome of longer-term processes. We are trying to address the problems we have uncovered this year and help the Greeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, there is still some time to go, which is why I am saying that it is too early to judge today which – if any – funds would probably not be taken up, especially since it is always possible that there may be an excellent project that will consume the rest of the 2003 allocations before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you that there is certainly no lack of willingness to cooperate with the Commission. As you may remember, in the first half of the year we managed to resolve an enormously difficult problem. We managed to find a solution, we managed to finalise negotiations that were extremely difficult and painful for both sides. However, the commitment on both sides was strong enough to resolve the problem, which was of a historical nature. Today we are working more on a current basis, but all the necessary efforts are being made on both sides and that makes me feel optimistic that we will resolve this problem. I cannot make any commitments on behalf of the Greek Government, however; I can only offer the help that we are offering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the honourable Member will be aware, this is the subject of an interinstitutional agreement and also the subject of negotiations between the three institutions on the basis of a proposal tabled by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is involved in negotiations but nonetheless it defends its own proposal, if I may use that verb. The Commission has no power when it comes to deciding how a potential reduction of the total budget amount is to be distributed, and it cannot take decisions on how budget cuts are to be spread across the individual headings within the framework of cohesion policy. Each global cut of this nature leads to adjustments of components of the whole budget too.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, however, state that in June the Luxembourg Presidency proposed a budget for cohesion policy that was 10% less than the Commission’s proposal. The proposal envisaged a disproportionate impact on the individual objectives of cohesion policy. Objective I, involving the poorest regions, suffered a 6% cut. Objective II, intended to help create more competitive regions and provide new jobs, suffered a budget cut of about 18%. The most drastic cuts concerned Objective III, which relates to European territorial cooperation, that is, to cohesion. For Objective III the cuts amounted to 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to a reduction in relation to the Commission’s proposal. In principle this would have a disproportionate impact on the so-called old and new Member States, as 80% of the cuts would affect the 15 older Member States and the remaining 20% would affect the countries that have recently acceded to the Union.</p>

In this context I should like to say two things. Firstly, the UK is a source of best practices in Europe when it comes to regional policy and the way funds are used. I have visited many science and business parks. You have wonderful partnerships at local level and achieve unbelievably good results, very often from a tiny catalytic contribution coming from the Structural Funds. Wherever you go – not only in Scotland, Wales or Cornwall, but also in other regions of the UK – you can find excellent examples of this type of best practice. We are also using the UK experience to help us to become more innovative in terms of financial engineering, and the British experience will also be widely used for the events which we will have with the British next month on financial engineering.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we all need a decision on the budget, but it should be appreciated that in the meantime we can work together with the British on all other avenues – regulations, programming and also on those innovative proposals for initiatives for the future of the funds. However, it would be good to have the decision on the budget under the British Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We estimate that from the moment the decision on the budget is made we will need about 18 months to launch the new generation of cohesion programmes and projects. Looking at it from this point of view, now is really the last moment for the decision to be made on the budget, as we are already short of time. That is absolutely clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that once the decision is made and we complete all the other necessary procedures, then we have to negotiate the programmes – the national framework and the operational programmes – and then the Member States have to prepare themselves for the launch of the programmes and projects. If we start the projects in January 2007 – which is now quite unlikely – then there is less time to absorb the money, so the amount of money will just depend on the decision, whenever it is made. The decision will give the money, but how much time we will have to absorb the money is the worrying factor. If the perspective is shortened because of the delayed decision on the Financial Perspective, then the Member States and regions – old and new – will have less time and there is a risk that some money will be lost. It is in the case of this policy that the risk is highest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am satisfied with the independence and integrity of the work of the contractor, the Swiss Institute, and the sub-contractor, the Centre for the Study of Gambling at Salford University.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship with contributing companies to which the honourable Member refers is one that is common to university departments throughout the world. I am assured that donations from contributing companies, whether they be bookmakers or national lotteries, are unconditional donations. I am satisfied with the declaration of the absence of conflict of interest given to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure the honourable Member that my services will give the fullest attention to how this study is carried out and will ensure that the contractor fully meets the award criteria set out in the tender specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member refers to, and I quote, 'the indisputable impact that the study will have on the rules governing the gambling sector in the future'. Firstly I would like to remind the honourable Member that the study, which is looking at a wide variety of gambling services, will report factually on the various laws applicable in the Member States and on economic aspects. This is a fact-finding exercise and the contractor will not advise the Commission on its future policy options.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can assure the honourable Member that I will not be taking any policy decisions purely on the basis of this study. The study will assist us all in gaining a better understanding of the issues involved, but it is my intention to consult fully before taking any decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the contractor will be given to all interested parties and will be published on the Commission's website. In addition, the contractor's findings will be the subject of a public hearing, which is scheduled to take place in early November, at which the views of the interested parties, including the honourable Member, will be most welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if the Swiss Institute for Comparative Law’s study is just a preliminary study on all systems, it is quite clear that contracting all the economic aspects to a university centre with companies such as Stanley Leisure, Gala Group, London Clubs International or the Camelot Group on its administrative board is nevertheless, in my opinion, far from being as objective as it should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Difficulties experienced by gaming operators in advertising their activities in certain EU Member States</span></p>
<p class="contents">In July I tabled a question to the Commission concerning the difficulties experienced by Slovenian gaming operators in advertising their activities in Austria. In its reply, the Commission stated that it would examine the Austrian law (amended in 2003) which bans foreign gaming operators from advertising in Austria, and would establish whether or not it is compatible with Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">What has the Commission ascertained in the three months since I tabled that initial question?</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind the Commission that while Austria prohibits and prevents foreign gaming operators from advertising their business in Austria, no such ban applies to national operators. Austria is clearly protecting the economic interests of national providers and obstructing foreign tourism operators in the single European market. This is a breach of the fundamental principles of a free market, and in particular of Article 49 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which concerns the freedom to provide services.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do in this area to end such discrimination before Austria’s EU presidency begins on 1 January 2006? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has no direct role in the supervision of individual insurance undertakings. That is the responsibility of each Member State and is, in practice, carried out by the supervisory authorities appointed for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, recognising certain weaknesses in the former regime and responding to criticisms in the Penrose report, has launched a major reform of the regulation of life insurance undertakings. In part this reflects the lessons learned from the Equitable Life affair.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the payment of compensation where national supervision has failed, redress can only be sought before the national courts of the Member State in question. With respect to the Community regime for the insurance and pension sector, the Commission is currently working on the Solvency II project, the aim of which is to achieve over time a more harmonised risk-based system for the supervision and prudential regulation of all insurance undertakings across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also continuing its exploratory work with the Member States on insurance guarantee schemes that could deal with situations where an insurance undertaking fails and is unable to meet its commitments to policy-holders and beneficiaries. It should be noted, however, that Equitable Life did not enter into liquidation and continues to operate as an authorised insurance undertaking, albeit one that is closed to new business.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the banking sector is concerned, the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive already obliges Member States to set up schemes which offer a minimum guarantee level of EUR 20 000 to depositors, although the threshold is higher in a number of Member States. The Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive is in the process of being reviewed in order to ensure that it is still in line with market developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the proposal for a directive on services in the internal market, the Commission would like to recall that financial services are excluded from the scope of application of the services proposal. Furthermore, it should be noted that the services proposal includes provisions strengthening consumer protection. In particular, Article 27 requires Member States to ensure that providers whose services present a direct and particular risk to the health and safety of the recipient or a third person, or to the financial security of the recipient, would be obliged to take out professional indemnity insurance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> provides for the protection of foodstuffs the quality of which is attributable to their specific geographical origin. The Czech Republic is seeking to have such protection of designation of origin applied to the product known as 'Karlovarske oplatky' (Karlsbader Oblaten – Karlsbad Wafers).</p>
<p class="contents">Karlsbad Wafers have been produced for some 200 years now on the basis of old family recipes, and they gained their worldwide reputation during the Golden Age of the Bohemian spa resort of Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary). Until 1945, they were principally produced in what was known as the 'Spa Triangle' (Karlsbad – Marienbad – Franzensbad) – the majority of the inhabitants of which were German – and in Austria as well.</p>
<p class="contents">After the end of the Second World War, large numbers of the German-speaking population were expelled from Czechoslovakia, and many of the old-established bakers from Karlsbad and other parts of the Spa Triangle moved to other countries, including Germany and Austria, and used their know-how to start up production of Karlsbad Wafers in their new homelands.</p>

Olmützer Quargel is an acid curd cheese which originated in Austrian Moravia (cf.

In Germany too, for instance, Olmützer Quargel has been produced, and marketed under that designation, since at least 1945, however. As a result of the geopolitical changes after World War II, a large number of German-speaking cheesemakers emigrated from Czechoslovakia, as it then was, to Austria, further expanding production of 'Olmützer Quargel' there on the basis of the know-how they brought with them. Designation protection for the product made in the Czech Republic would make it impossible to continue marketing the Olmützer Quargel traditionally made in Austria.

<p class="contents">On 11 May 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the simplification of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables, in which it urges the Commission to strengthen support for producer organisations and introduce import quotas for the soft fruit market. This came after MEPs had repeatedly addressed the matter within the Committee on Agriculture and in letters to Commissioner Fischer Boel. Unfortunately, there has as yet been no firm response from the Commission with regard to soft fruits. In Poland, the situation in this market has been disastrous in 2005. The buying-in price of strawberries, raspberries and currants has been considerably lower than production costs for the second year running.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Payment of European farm subsidies to large land-owners belonging to the aristocracy</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to recent reports, a substantial proportion of European farm subsidies is paid not to small farmers but to wealthy large land-owners, mostly of aristocratic origin. While hundreds of farmers have been receiving an average of less than € 100 in European subsidies, the landed gentry and food companies have made millions at the expense of the European tax-payer.</p>
<p class="contents">A few examples: the sugar company Tate &amp; Lyle – € 170 m; the Dutch Minister of Agriculture, Cees Veerman – € 400 m; Prince Charles of the UK – € 340 000; the British Parker family – € 1.5 m; the British Baron Rothschild – € 500 000; the Irish land-owner Larry Goodman – € 508 000.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission forwarded to the European Parliament indicative information on the breakdown of CAP direct payments by Member State, the size of payments, and types of farms in 2000 and 2001. It can be seen from those data that there are great disparities in the size of payments for farmers in many of our Member States. Since aid applications are made by the farmer, defined as a person whose holding is situated within Community territory and who exercises an agricultural activity, the Commission does not receive data concerning land ownership or the aristocratic status of the beneficiary. In any case, since it is bound to ensure the confidentiality of these individual data, the Commission is not in a position to make available or to publish the names of beneficiaries of aid from the EAGGF Guarantee Section.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for the variation in distribution of the direct payments is connected with historical production. Since the 1992 CAP reform, the original price support policy has been replaced by a policy aiming at greater competitiveness. The shifts in policy have been achieved by the gradual reduction of the EU support prices and compensation for farmers for the consequent revenue loss in the form of direct payments. Owing to the fact that those direct payments were first introduced by coupling them mainly to production factors through per hectare payments and reference yields in the arable sector, and to headage in the livestock sector, those farmers with larger farms or greater livestock numbers received more compensation in the form of direct payments. During the debates held on all the different changes to the CAP in the 1992 reform and Agenda 2000, and again in the discussions on CAP reform in 2003, the Commission actually proposed a so-called capping of the direct payments to farmers and, as far as I remember, the latest discussions on this issue back in 2003 proposed a cap of EUR 300 000 for each beneficiary. At the end of the day, however, the Council and the Member States rejected this proposal and it is therefore not part of the current CAP reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say to the Commissioner that, following in the UK’s footsteps, the Netherlands has now also publicised the data.
