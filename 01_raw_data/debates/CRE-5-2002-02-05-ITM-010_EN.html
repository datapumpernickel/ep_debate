<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 39 by Antonios Trakatellis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0030_EN.html">H-0030/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Nuclear safety: Bulgaria's failure to comply with EU partnership agreement and agreements to decommission reactors at Kozloduy</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the decommissioning of units 1 and 2 of the nuclear plant at Kozloduy by the end of 2002, Mr Kovachev, the Bulgarian Energy Minister said on 8 January 2002 that his country will not be honouring its commitments to close down and dismantle the dangerous, old-style reactors, as provided by the revised partnership agreement between the European Union (EU) and Bulgaria, and the Sofia Memorandum, which Bulgaria signed with the Commission in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Commission ensure that the commitments contained in the partnership agreement to decommission units 3 and 4 will be honoured, and what stage has been reached in the decommissioning of units 1 and 2, given that all four units are unsafe and cannot be upgraded at reasonable cost? Can Bulgaria ask for the opening of negotiations on the energy chapter under the pre-accession process when it refuses to honour its commitments to the EU on nuclear safety and has not drawn up a new energy strategy to bring it into line with free market rules (production and pricing) and the opening of the market to competition? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Differing opinions have in fact been expressed in political circles in Bulgaria during the current public debate on the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power station – specifically of its units 1 to 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Information available to the Commission indicates that, in a statement on 10 January 2002 on the early decommissioning of the four reactor blocks at Kozloduy, the Bulgarian Energy Minister mentioned 2008 or 2010 as possible dates for the closure of Blocks 3 and 4. The Bulgarian Energy Minister's statement did not refer to Blocks 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is that, in the agreement I reached with the Bulgarian government in 1999, we agreed on the decommissioning of Blocks 1 and 2 by 2002, that is this year, and that we would have discussions with the Bulgarian government on the decommissioning of Blocks 3 and 4 in connection with the revision of that country's energy strategy and that a decision on this would be reached before the date originally envisaged. The Commission made it clear that it understood this to mean that 3 and 4 would be decommissioned by 2006 at the latest. I must, though, say quite clearly that Bulgaria has not yet come to a formal decision on this matter. This means that we cannot, of course, complete the energy chapter of negotiations with Bulgaria as long as we do not have a definite decommissioning date set down for Blocks 3 and 4.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement I reached with the Bulgarian government at that time constitutes part of the European Union's common negotiating position in the energy chapter with regard to Kozloduy. It is clear, therefore, that this chapter cannot be completed without compliance with the content of this agreement. The matter is clear to that extent, and, on the Commission's behalf, I now repeat that the decommissioning of Blocks 1 to 4 of the nuclear power station at Kozloduy in accordance with the agreement entered into is an absolutely indispensable requirement for the conclusion of accession negotiations with the Republic of Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Work has begun on the decommissioning of Blocks 1 and 2 and the right administrative and technical conditions are in place. As an international fund stands ready to finance these operations, I am working on the assumption that everything will go according to plan. I do not share the concern expressed by some that the decommissioning of reactor Blocks 1 to 4 will result in major economic difficulties, particularly as regards competitiveness. The Commission has calculated that Bulgaria has considerable over-capacity in energy production, and, as a new nuclear power station of modern design is being built, any loss to Bulgaria will be compensated for, and any problems are, in our view, perfectly capable of being surmounted.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we have not the least indication that Bulgaria will pull out of the commitment it has made. I would also like to expressly underline that the Bulgarian Prime Minister, at my most recent meeting with him, quite expressly confirmed to me that his government stands by the undertaking given by its predecessor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission stated in this communiqué that it understands that closure will take place by no later than 2006. Formal notification by the Bulgarian government is still required, but it is certain that that is on its way. Moreover, Mr Trakatellis, I have to tell you that energy provision in Bulgaria is a matter for the Bulgarian government.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the issue of energy efficiency in the Balkans and Bulgaria's position in the energy market a matter within the immediate remit of the Commission. I can only reiterate our estimation that the decommissioning of Blocks 1 to 4 will not result in an energy shortage in Bulgaria, where there is, on the contrary, substantial overcapacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with you that it is a matter of absolute necessity to inform the Bulgarian public in precise terms of the need for decommissioning and the measures that are to accompany this, as in fact – as you are no doubt well aware – the people of Bulgaria do not, as a whole, understand this requirement by the international community. We always behave as if these things were self-evident, and so I am grateful to you for addressing this point. The overwhelming majority of Bulgaria's population does not see it as at all self-evident that the country's largest and most important power station should be decommissioned under pressure from the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was a political condition for the opening of negotiations with Bulgaria, one that was laid upon us by the Member States. This political condition was formulated by the Member States in consequence of an assessment carried out by the industrialised States as early as the beginning of the 1990s, in the course of which the safety of nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe was subjected to examination. This determined which of the nuclear power stations were seen by the Western industrialised States as incapable of being retrofitted at reasonable cost. I am, at the moment, unaware of what standards the States applied at the time. If you are interested, though, I would be happy to initiate the relevant research on your behalf. The Commission did not set any enquiries in motion, but performed its political function of achieving a result with the Bulgarian government as regards compliance with a political condition for the beginning of negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following on from your answer to Mr Rübig's question, do you not also believe that we are yet again seeing how urgently necessary it is that we should have common European standards rather than always arriving at decommissioning dates by a process of rough estimation? Blocks 3 and 4 in 2006 – that is what we have said now. Should we perhaps not make that 2004 or 2003? What happens then if something goes wrong in 2005? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if I were able to answer your technical question, I would not be permitted to. Responsibility for the operation of the Kozloduy nuclear power station, for any safety problems connected with it and also for any accidents that might occur, is borne exclusively by the operator, that is, in this instance, the Republic of Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also make it clear that the Commission is not in a position to take on any responsibility as we are not in a position either to have any influence on how this nuclear power station is operated. I have no personal view on how safe or dangerous this nuclear power station is. I am quite happy to give you detailed information on the technical processes involved as soon as such information is available to me. We have to work on the assumption that the time required to complete a project like the decommissioning of a nuclear power station, is to be reckoned in decades rather than years. That means that we are dealing here with a very long-term operation, which may, under certain circumstances, also involve long-term commitments or burdens on the Community budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Progress in this area is being watched within the framework of the Commission’s Internal Market Strategy for Services, approved in November 1999. The Commission examines the Internal Market Strategy each year to evaluate the results achieved and suggest improvements. The evaluation was last carried out in April. One of the aims is to improve the operational environment for companies and special attention is paid to helping small enterprises in much of the action that is taken in association with this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also monitors developments in the business climate for small enterprises with reference to the yearly report on the European Charter for Small Enterprises. The report for 2002 will be coming out in the next few days and will assess the action to help small businesses that the Member States and the Commission have said they are taking. The Conference of European Ministers responsible for SME policies to be held on 23 February in Aranjuez, in Spain, will be reporting on the conclusions of the report for 2002, and they will be submitted to the European Council when it convenes in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage I might say that there has been progress. Progress has been made, for example, in such areas as access to finance and the exchange of good practice. In addition, in December, an SME envoy was appointed whose task it will be to step up exchanges with small and medium-sized enterprises and their representative bodies. He will work in the Enterprise Directorate-General and his job will be to act as liaison officer on issues such as opportunities for SMEs to acquire funding and exploit innovation as well as matters to do with competitiveness, better regulation, implementation of the internal market process, participation in EU programmes and how best to enhance consultation procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year the Commission launched an initiative called ‘Helping SMEs to go digital’. The aim is to make SMEs aware of the opportunities offered by information networks. Six events have been planned for this year in different Member States and there is to be a large-scale conference in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s work to improve regulation is also making headway. There have been a number of proposals to improve the situation, both in a White Paper on Governance in the European Union and in the Laeken communication on improving and simplifying the regulatory environment. The proposals relate to the whole lifecycle of Community acts. Under discussion are, for example, the need for more effective consultation with interest groups and civil society, an evaluation of Community action and costs, and a simplification of current laws. By no later than June the Commission will have put forward a proposal for a straightforward action plan to simplify and improve the regulatory environment, after the Community’s institutions and other interest groups have been heard. The Enterprise Directorate-General will be actively involved in drawing up this plan and drawing on the experience gained from the business impact assessment system and the test project connected with it. The conclusions drawn, as a result of this project, will be ready this month. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Through the annual report we monitor progress on the environment for small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2002 report evaluates actions reported by the Member States and the Commission in favour of small businesses. The conclusions of the report will be presented to the Conference of European Ministers responsible for SME policies on 23 February and submitted to the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, the report shows signs of increasing political commitment and major progress has been made in the field of access to finance. Progress has also been made in exchanges of good practice such as cutting red tape in company creation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the efforts of SMEs to adapt their business practices to the global knowledge-based economy, the Commission launched last year the GoDigital initiative for SMEs as part of the eEurope Action Plan. In some countries this report has received a very positive welcome. We are organising campaigns throughout the European countries at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the end of 2002 a portal to provide SMEs with legal information, guidance and advice will be set up.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also just today adopted a Communication on eEurope Benchmarking, where you can follow how SMEs are being connected and how broadly they use eCommerce.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission communication highlights new challenges in relation to Internet usage: broadband is needed to stimulate new services; schools are connected but the Internet is not yet sufficiently part of the pedagogical process; governments online have to move towards full electronic transactions. The indicators include amongst others Internet penetration in business and the percentage of companies selling online.</p>
<p class="contents">While good progress has been made, the take-up of eCommerce is not as fast as expected. This confirms the relevance of actions such as GoDigital, but also indicates the urgent need to identify obstacles to eCommerce amongst especially small companies as well as consumers. eEurope should be continued beyond 2002 and shift its focus towards effective usage and availability of the Internet for all citizens and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication on the impact of the e-Economy on European enterprises contains proposals to deepen cooperation between all relevant stakeholders to develop a policy agenda for maximising the benefits of the e-Economy for European enterprises, taking into account the needs of SMEs. The Industry Council endorsed this proposal in December 2001 and invited the Commission and the Member States to intensify the debate on the e-Economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency has decided to launch a policy debate with Member States to agree future priorities for the promotion of the e-Economy in Europe and to address this topic at the Industry Council meeting in early June.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end it will be necessary to identify policy changes at national and European level to adapt to the needs of the e-Economy. These activities will be developed in close cooperation with the reflections and the preparatory work relating to the future of the eEurope Action Plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time it also contains a legal basis for spectra. It allows for the creation of what are now new bodies: a committee, to discuss long-term questions, and a working party, to consider the current administration. Now that we have a common legal basis and joint bodies, it will be possible to discuss common aims beforehand and coordinate action. This is obviously no guarantee that everyone in the end will choose the same approach, but I hope that we can at least agree together policies in an open and transparent way and that before the first State starts dividing up the spectra the rules will be known to all. The market will be able to act more wisely when it is known at least how things are moving in different regions of Europe. I believe that the sort of bedlam we experienced last time will not repeat itself, but it cannot always be guaranteed that common sense will prevail at all times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we look back at the year 2000 we can see that the <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe action plan really rewrote the European political agenda. The idea was to set clear targets for the EU and Member States, clear deadlines and follow it up. Has this idea worked? I think it has. To give you a few examples: the telecoms package and unbundling the local loop. We would never have been able to imagine these rapid procedures without high priority being given to information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Internet penetration has increased. It was 18% in March 2000 and 38% in December 2001 – more than double. Nearly 90% of schools are now connected to the Internet. Today 90% of European enterprises have Internet access. We now have the fastest research network in the world. The start of progress in getting government on-line is well under way. A comprehensive overview is now available. It was accepted today in the Commission. I am happy to pass it on to Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the new challenges? First of all, Internet penetration has risen sharply but is still very unevenly distributed across Europe. Schools are massively connected but still the number of pupils per on-line PC varies enormously. We must have more PCs at school per student.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though businesses are more and more connected the reorganisation of business procedures is only starting. Business consumer <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce is still rather small.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments have started enthusiastically to go on-line. Normally there is a question about presenting activities on their website. Real interactivity is still rare. All the interactivities give better services to citizens and increase the productivity of the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not come to the end of its actions because technology moves quickly. Broadband Internet is now a real option. Broadband is the essential physical infrastructure of the knowledge society. Without broadband we will not deliver fully Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Other nations have already made their choices for broadband. The Commission's report to the Barcelona Summit said: "Broadband Internet access will be a key factor for improving the performance of the economy. Broadband networks will form the backbone of an increasingly interconnected and integrated society. <span class="italic">E</span>-Europe should be continued beyond 2002 and shift its focus more towards effective usage and availability of the Internet."</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is particularly happy that the Spanish Presidency shares this analysis and has put the launch of <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe 2005 action plan on its agenda. The first discussion on a possible new action plan will take place at the informal telecoms council in Vitoria in Spain on 22 and 23 February 2002. The Commission is ready to go into pro-dialogue also with the relevant committees in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, my concern is not the work that he has done – for which I commend him very much – but rather, for example, the delays and problems that Member States are experiencing in transposing the electronic commerce directive, passed by this House with great speed. Similarly, I see that as regards copyright in the Information Society – another fundamental plank in the legislation that he does not mention – discussion is continuing on ideas for new levies on computer disks and other issues that will fundamentally hold back the development of the e-society.</p>
<p class="contents">Does he share my considerable concern that Member States do not appear to be taking anything like seriously enough the fundamental principles that he has enunciated and would he give us some indication that he will give positive vent to them at the forthcoming meetings?

They are both within the remit of my colleague, Mr Bolkestein, but we are cooperating here and I am ready to contact him after Question Time.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of copyright, the Commission is organising a workshop in the next few weeks on digital rights management technologies. When content is sold on line it is very important to guarantee a system where the copyright holder can receive proper royalties for his production. New technologies like digital rights management are helpful there.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal wish is that this technology could result in more targeted methods to get proper revenue for copyright holders so that Member States would not need to go for these very broad untargeted solutions such as copyright levy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the follow-up of the Member States, there is often a problem that progress is piecemeal and there is not sufficiently strong coordination in Member States to guarantee that progress will take place in all areas.

<p class="contents">Schools are well placed to bridge the digital divide. Through them we can guarantee education for all. In Europe comprehensive school systems still work. We can guarantee skills for everybody. When the Internet comes to homes via children we can avoid the divide from the start. But we must also look to the older age groups. Here, the combined efforts of the public sector in training, public access points which can be run by local communities, post offices and the private sector provide extremely important backup. Here I hope all Member States will take active measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards usage, we are now discussing flat rates in general. In America, higher usage is often explained by the fact that there are more flat-rate offers on the market, not only for broadband but also for narrow bands. We have not reached a final conclusion on this, but this question is being raised now, as we have seen a tail-off in demand for broadband in the form of ADSL and cable. Should that be a solution? I will reply to that after we have done some more internal work.</p>
<p class="contents">As for content, if the Internet is not in your own mother tongue it will be not the Internet for all. The Commission is now implementing its programme, eContent, which concentrates on multilingual and multicultural platforms in the content area. It brings together different operators from different Member States. There has been huge interest and it is doing fine.</p>
<p class="contents">The Information Society Technologies Programme is shifting attention towards applications. In the future the user will be at the centre. We have often put technology at the centre, but we must now put the user at the centre instead. Users are not looking for technology, but rather for content, services and applications. For that reason the attention of research is moving in that direction. The Commission supports these efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The venture capital market developed very rapidly in 2000, then we saw the difficulties and it went down. At EU level, the European Investment Funds invested in venture capital funds in various Member States. These investments were well-timed because of the lack of venture financing. We have also been using Community budget funds, with part of the multiannual programme credits transferred into the investment funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Through these efforts the public sector has been playing its role. At the same time it is very important to complete the legislation on a genuine internal market for financial services and risk capital. In this regard we hope that the solutions resulting from the Lamfalussy report will be very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Today on the Internet I saw some good news: some new venture rounds for wireless applications have been completed. Perhaps the worst is over, but the market is still very tight compared to the situation in the past.

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 44 by Alexandros Alavanos (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0951_EN.html">H-0951/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Commission recommendations on Greek employment policy</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's recommendations to Greece concerning the implementation of employment policies have remained almost unchanged since 1998. Greece is criticised for low employment rates, high youth and female unemployment, and the Commission's recommendations continue along the same lines for 2002 (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2001&amp;nu_doc=0512">COM(2001)0512</a>/final). In addition, the Greek Minister for Labour recently stated that Greece cannot attain the Lisbon and Stockholm employment targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission say whether the Lisbon and Stockholm targets are binding on the Member States, and whether the targets Greece has set for funding from the 2nd Community Support Framework for measures to combat unemployment have been met and, if not, why not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the target of full employment set in Lisbon was a political commitment by leaders of the Member States, not a binding legal commitment. Except that the political commitment was also highly significant and all the national action plans for employment have been drawn up and submitted on the basis of that commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">In Greece, the second Community Support Framework applied over the last five years was completed in December 2001, so it is difficult to make an overall evaluation of it. Naturally, the job market was reformed and training and proactive employment policy structures and mechanisms were created during the course of the second Community Support Framework. The problem lies with the employment services which Greece started to reform at the end of the second Community Support Framework.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the third Community Support Framework is concerned, Greece is one of the few Member States which has set quantitative national targets under its national action plan, having announced a target of 61.5% for 2005. The third Community Support Framework includes a hefty 2.9 trillion drachmas to fund pro-active employment policies and reforms. The implementation of the third Community Support Framework is a huge challenge if Greece is to introduce the mechanisms needed for employment policy, such as an individualised approach, because the Greek national employment agencies need to be completely overhauled and training mechanisms need to work more efficiently and be geared to regional development objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is working closely with all the Member States and, as you know, it repeats the guidelines every year so that the Member States can take account of European agreements on the application of employment policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By chance, I have before me Eurostat's statistics on the economy labour market. Total unemployment in the European Union in 1990 was 7.7%; in 2000 it was 8.4%. In 1990 unemployment in Greece stood at 6.3%, less than in the Community. In 2000 it was 11.1%, the second highest rate after Spain. In Ireland, unemployment in 1990 was 13.1%; in 2000 it was 4.4%.

I knew that a progressive person of your experience would agree that English – and our mastering it in Greece – are very important. As far as the statistics which you quoted are concerned, we need to analyse the structure of unemployment in Greece. The rate of employment for men is exactly the same as the European average, but there is a huge difference in the rate of employment for women, which is 40% in Greece, compared with a Community average of 56%.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, there is a very serious youth unemployment problem. Here too, in comparison with other countries, unemployment is very high among the young in Greece, 29%, mainly because the various types of part-time employment found in numerous countries, including the country you referred to, are counted as full-time jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission's recommendations, what the Greek government needs to do is to focus more on policies for women and young people and on policies for older workers, because here again very few older workers are actually in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the three main employment policy problems and, according to the national action plan which it has submitted, this is where the Greek government has focused its efforts.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Employment in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to the Recommendation for a Council Recommendation on the Implementation of Member States' Employment Policies (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2001&amp;nu_doc=0512">COM(2001)0512</a>/final), Greece continues to have one of the lowest employment rates in the European Union, and unemployment in Greece has stabilised at 11%, which is considerably above the EU average. These data show that the labour market suffers from structural problems, a finding borne out by the Commission Communication on structural indicators. According to this Communication, Greek indicators concerning entrepreneurial expenditure on R&amp;D, access to the internet, lifelong learning and public spending on education are the lowest of all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission say whether, following the Council Recommendation and the Commission Communication, Greece has taken any specific additional measures or initiatives concerning the above sectors with a view to promoting employability and improving its position? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true, as the honourable Member says in his question, that Greece's indicators on matters such as entrepreneurial expenditure on research and development, access to the Internet, lifelong learning and public spending on education are lower than those of other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to point out that the Commission's philosophy behind these annual indicators is not just to compare the situation between Member States which do not always have the same points of reference; it is to look at the progress made by Member States from one year to the next. If we take the indicator for Internet access, Greece has progressed from 4.5% last year to 11% this year.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the main objectives for the operational programmes for 2000 to 2006. In other words, there are operational programmes for education, vocational training, lifelong learning, the information society and the dissemination of the information society in both the public administration and the business sector. This is one of the major challenges of the Greek government's national action plan and the Community Support Framework. Of course, we must not forget that these programmes have substantial Community funds, but that alone is not enough. Very substantial national funds are needed, together with efficient, urgent policies, especially for the information society, if these indicators are to improve significantly by next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Undeclared work in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, the Commission published a communication<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> aimed at launching a dialogue among the Member States with a view to combating undeclared work which, according to data at the time, accounted for some 15% of the Union's GDP, while in Greece and Italy the figure exceeded 20% of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent investigations by the Greek authorities, together with other available data, reveal that 10.5% of businesses are not registered with the Social Security Institution and that the percentage of non-registered workers fluctuates between 21% and 30%, resulting in a loss of billions of euro from the public purse and, in particular, the social insurance funds.</p>
<p class="contents">What commitments did the Member States make as a result of the dialogue launched in 1998? What progress has been made? What are Greece's commitments and what recommendations have been made to that country? What measures will the Commission take to combat undeclared work, in the context of the qualitative employment policy and the open coordination method, to ensure that pension schemes remain viable? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The guidelines issued by the Commission in 2001 for 2002 call on the Member States to take measures to combat undeclared work and to encourage registration using a variety of means, such as regulatory measures, incentives, reforms of the tax system, allowances, collaboration with the social partners and special plans for relations between the social partners, between employers and employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece's response does, I think, bode well for the future. By which I mean that the Greek authorities have introduced a series of measures dealing mainly with work inspectors, controls carried out by inspectors and the auditing agencies of the various insurance funds have been tightened up and, according to our information, a further 120 work inspectors are to be deployed. The commitments made by the Greek government in its national action plan also include a series of other measures dealing with allowances, that is, incentives to register low-paid workers, the results of which will not transpire until a later date, once they have been applied.</p>
<p class="contents">On 26 February, the Commission is due to present the study started following the 1998 communication to which you refer. Experts from all the Member States will attend this conference and the presentation of the study to discuss efficient practices for dealing with undeclared work which have brought in significant results in certain countries. As far as the impact on pension schemes is concerned, I should point out that one of the parameters for combating the problem of the viability of pension funds is to increase employment. Not to increase employment generally any old how, but to increase employment which pays statutory tax and insurance contributions. This is the only way of boosting the funds and helping them to stabilise their finances.</p>
<p class="contents">The open method of coordination established between the Member States does not, I repeat, involve any legal commitment vis-à-vis the Member States. Political commitments have been made and the Member States are due to submit pension reform plans, together with their economic and social implications, in September 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twenty-five percent of unregistered workers alone are foreigners, in which case there is hardly any justification for the mass influx of unskilled foreign workers into Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you really believe, with this situation, that the ambitious targets set by the European Commission can be achieved, or should you be calling for means over and above political commitment, the means which countries need to have if they are to make progress? Because undeclared work impacts not just on pension schemes, it also impacts on free competition and, of course, protection for workers, because we are hardly talking high-powered jobs here.

Steps have been taken within an institutional framework to increase incentives to register workers and integrate immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">My evaluation of the measures taken by the Greek government, which is why I was cautious, is that its reaction bodes well in that it has introduced a series of institutional measures which are now under way, such as integrating immigrants and paying companies incentives for low-paid workers and, once they have been implemented, these institutional reforms should bring in positive results.

There are two main rights that workers have through these regulations. Firstly they have the right to unemployment benefit; secondly, to look for employment in another Member State and to continue to receive unemployment benefit for a maximum period of three months.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this regulation applies to workers who are Community nationals. In 1997 the Commission presented a proposal to the Council to extend the scope of this regulation to workers who are third-country nationals. The same extension had been included in the larger frame of the Commission proposal of 1998 to modernise and simplify Regulation 1408/71.</p>
<p class="contents">There were many discussions over many years. There was a very complicated discussion in the Council of Ministers. There were many disagreements between the Member States. The main obstacles to progress in this regard had been the lack of agreement on the legal base. It is not a legalistic or technical problem, it is a political one. But the difference in the legal base concerned first the Commission's proposal, which was based on the implementation of Articles 42 and 308, and certain Member States which considered that the basis of this proposal could be Article 63. The political difference is that under the last article there are some Member States that have the right to opt out of the regulation.</p>

Our initial EUR 57 m commitment to reconstruction in Afghanistan includes specific provision for this. The Commission services are currently finalising contracts with NGOs and UN aid agencies to implement 18 projects worth EUR 25 m and programmes to support internally displaced Afghan people and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender is a cross-cutting issue in all projects funded from the Aid to Uprooted People budget. In 2001 more than 50% of the projects directed at health, education and refugee care had specific and significant gender components. The Commission is currently assessing project proposals for the 2002 budget for uprooted people. The amount envisaged is EUR 24 m.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new political situation in Afghanistan the Commission is planning to open an office in Kabul in February or March this year. This office will further enhance the Commission's ability to oversee the performance and delivery of its aid to Afghanistan. ECHO reopened its office at the beginning of last month.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the humanitarian aid provided by ECHO, women are involved in various types of projects; all medical and nutritional projects funded by ECHO aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age, as well as to monitor the health status of women, in particular lactating and pregnant women. NGOs generally organise elementary hygiene education for women. NGOs have access to all beneficiaries, women included, and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medically related programmes. Medical NGOs play a great role in the training of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not least do we hope that women will be centrally involved in a great deal of our development activity, but there are women in the interim administration. I hope there will be in the transitional administration. Women played a crucial role, let us not forget, in the success of the Bonn talks in December and we will be doing what we can to support the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs which will, I hope, be a good example of women managing programmes to help develop society and to help protect the role of women in a society which has abused them for far too long.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member asked a question about the specific security of women and young girls. In the light of recent well-publicised events, I wholly understand that. I hope that the overall improvement in the security situation and the increasing grip of the interim authority with our support will help to prevent things like that happening. But after the ferocious talibanisation of Afghan society over the last few years, and given the position of the country where warlordism is still rife, it is going to be some time before we can promote the sort of strong gender policies we would like to see. However, we will do all that we can. I am greatly encouraged by what the honourable Member has said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our main aim was to take the opportunity, two and a half years into the work of the pact, and with the arrival of a new special coordinator, to build on its achievements by enhancing the complementarity between the work of the Stability Pact and the EU stabilisation and association process, by focusing the pact's activities as tightly as possible and by putting a particular emphasis on encouraging regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council approved the recommendations in our letter on 19 November and asked the new Special Coordinator, Dr Buseck, who took up the reins on 1 January, to assess the current activities and working methods of the pact and to identify five or six objectives to be achieved by the end of this year. The Council asked him to report back to its meeting on 11 March. The Commission is now working closely with the Special Coordinator in the preparation of this report. Detailed consultations are taking place within the informal consultative committee which was established following the High Representative's and my own recommendations in order to improve coordination between the pact and the stabilisation and association process. Two meetings have already taken place: on 11 and 31 January.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, work is well in hand. The Stability Pact and the Commission are working very closely together to deliver the improvements the honourable Member refers to. I have every confidence that the report which Dr Buseck gives to the Council on 11 March will set out a number of practical proposals to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On implementation, it is fair to say that overall we have established an impressive record as far as the Commission is concerned in implementing what we have promised to do in the western Balkans and in south-east Europe as a whole. What we have been able to achieve in Serbia, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and in other countries, is impressive.

This recognises that the Community contribution must be seen as part of the overall donor support in a given country and that a degree of flexibility must be the norm. The Commission is committed to work towards meeting this benchmark in assistance to the social sectors in all its programmes, including Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to honouring this commitment, a number of initiatives will be undertaken. In particular, these will include, first, improved emphasis on the social sector in all Commission programmes, in line with the priorities in the Community's development strategy. Second, the establishment during 2002 – and I know this is a point on which the honourable Member has himself laid great emphasis – of a solid statistical basis allowing DAC sectoral classification of programmes and projects from 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">A reclassification exercise of all 2001 commitments will be undertaken with a view to enabling comparison to be made.</p>

It is important that we do not simply talk about the process in terms of information being available – important as that is, and agreed as we are on that issue – but that the Commissioner actually tells us, as those country strategy papers are passed, as the Quality Support Group evaluates new programmes, as delegations (and he did not answer the point about the role of delegations in this) take their decisions, as new staff are recruited, how will he ensure that real resources are allocated in greater number to basic health and basic education? We need to see some shift of resources during the course of this year. Give us some hope that it will happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to show a great deal of energy and commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as the role of delegations is concerned, as the honourable Member knows, I place particular emphasis, on the deconcentration exercise, which is a particularly ill-starred, euro-gabble way of referring to trying to manage our programmes in the field and as closely as possible to the people whom we want to see benefit from them. The delegations will play a key role in drawing up the country strategy papers, which will have to reflect the priorities of our development philosophy and development strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member asks us to give him hope that we will be seeing a real shift. The purpose of providing a better statistical basis for analysing and planning what we are doing is to demonstrate that we are making an effort to achieve the objectives which the honourable Member and I have in common and which are also the objectives of my distinguished colleague, Commissioner Nielsen. So there would be no point for example in the CRIS exercise in which we are engaged if we were not intending it to have an impact on policy. I think the honourable Member accepts that one is looking for steady trends, rather than being too nailed down to specific figures in specific years in specific countries. One wants to see a shift of emphasis and a clear indication that the Commission's programmes are as associated as other peoples' with the objectives of poverty alleviation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will make one additional point, which I attempted to make yesterday morning in the parliament of the country I know best. There is still a tendency when people look at what we are doing to compare apples with oranges. It is very often the case that other countries or Member States appear to have a far higher proportion of development assistance committed to poverty alleviation than we do because they look at what we are doing in the Balkans, in Russia, in the NIS, in parts of the Mediterranean, and compare it as though it was exactly the same as our more straightforward development assistance programmes. Because we are carrying the burden in those areas, admittedly with Member States' money, they are not having to do as much there as they would presumably have to do for political reasons, and therefore the figures sometimes flatter them at our expense. That is part of the price we pay for having an external actions budget which has development assistance at its core but has other priorities as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Question No 56 by Olivier Dupuis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0007_EN.html">H-0007/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: International Criminal Court</p>
<p class="contents">For several years now the establishment of the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity has been a priority of EU foreign policy. Only recently, the EU, through the Belgian Presidency, reaffirmed its commitment to working to secure, as rapidly as possible, the 60 ratifications required for the Criminal Court to be brought into operation. To date, 48 countries have already ratified the Rome Statute, including all the EU Member States apart from Portugal (which has, however, already completed the relevant domestic procedures), Greece and Ireland. Three candidate countries – Poland, Hungary and Slovenia – have already ratified the Statute and Estonia has announced that it will shortly deposit its instruments of ratification. Given the fundamental importance which the EU attaches to the speedy introduction of this first stage of an international justice system and in view of the tragic events which have occurred around the world over the last few months and years, would the Commission not agree that the ratification of the Rome Statute should be explicitly established as forming part of the 'acquis communautaire' and as a new 'Copenhagen criterion' to be met by any future candidate for accession to the EU? Does the Commission agree that ratification should serve as a precondition for the signing and ratification of any association or cooperation agreement between the Union and third countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He knows that was not meant as a discourtesy, it was for democratic reasons upstairs. I am sure we will be able to lock horns about some of those extremely important issues on other occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for his question, the European Union attaches a great deal of importance to the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. The adoption of the common position of 11 June 2001, which aims to promote early ratification of the Statute and the swift establishment of the ICC, and the ratification of the Statute by 13 Member States underline our commitment to this objective. Ratification preparations by the remaining two Member States are at an advanced stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's commitment to this issue is also reflected in the level of Community funding given to NGOs working for ratification. Since 1995, this has reached almost EUR 7m under the European initiative for democratisation and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the enlargement process, the European Union position on support to the ICC is part of the common foreign and security policy <span class="italic">acquis</span>, which candidates are asked to subscribe to. In addition, in line with the common position, the European Union regularly raises the question of ratification in the framework of political dialogues with accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union and the associated countries Cyprus and Malta aligned themselves with the EU declaration at the Sixth Committee of the UN General Assembly in November 2001, which sought to encourage a swift start to the ICC.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 2002, they also declared that they shared the objectives of the EU common position on the International Criminal Court and undertook to ensure that their national policies conform to that common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Europe has also called on all its members to ratify or adhere to the ICC's Statute as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to his answer to this specific question, I am quite satisfied with the Commission’s position.
