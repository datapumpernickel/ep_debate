<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boogerd-Quaak (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, since March of this year, the European Parliament and the Commissioner have come a great deal closer to each other in this matter. That is to say, Mr Bolkestein has written an excellent letter to Mr Ridge, but the upshot of this is somewhat less convincing. During your speech to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I gathered that you are serious about having Directive 95/46/EC and Regulation 22/99/89 observed. Despite this, Mr President and Commissioner Bolkestein, we yesterday held a lengthy discussion in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs about a resolution in which we want to convey the fact that, in Europe, certain minimum standards must be observed. This resolution could have been approved yesterday thanks to the level of unanimity within the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. I was of the opinion, though, that you should also have the opportunity of reacting to our questions, so that we can incorporate your reaction in our resolution. Our objective is to announce a common position that we could also take to the United States because the negotiations that fundamentally matter must be brought to a successful conclusion over there. In the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, a number of suggestions have been made, such as whether it would not be possible after all to put an end to the existing situation earlier than within the suggested two months, for example by imposing a push system on the airlines at this stage. I should also like to ask you – since I could not make out clearly what you were saying in your contribution in the committee – whether you agree with us that we should develop a European standard as soon as possible on the basis of the recommendation of the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data – Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC. Do you agree with us that we should only transmit limited information, as indicated on the passport and airline ticket? The issue of data storage also requires further attention. In my view, the period of storage should not exceed the duration of the stay. Six to seven years is still far too long. During the purchase of tickets, passengers must be made aware of the fact that this data is required. It is also extremely important to our committee that passengers be given the opportunity of having incorrect data corrected promptly, efficiently and independently and that there be a clear judicial process in the US. It is unacceptable for citizens to get into difficulty over there.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter has, meanwhile, also been raised at international level. As you know, a conference took place in Sydney on 12 September last that involved the members of the data protection committee. A resolution was adopted on this matter, and I should like to hear the opinion of the Commissioner about the proposal to conclude an international agreement in this area. According to this resolution, such an international agreement should in any case contain the following components:</p>
<p class="contents">- the required conditions for data protection;</p>
<p class="contents">- the reason why the data is collated;</p>
<p class="contents">- a defined list of the required data, which should not be excessive;</p>
<p class="contents">- strict time limits for the storage period;</p>
<p class="contents">- adequate information to the people in question;</p>
<p class="contents">- and methods of rectifying any errors in the data.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, in fact, more or less what Parliament wants too. What is your opinion about this and do you consider an international agreement to be a viable solution?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to find out from Mr Bolkestein what he expects to achieve in the next two months with the United States, since hardly any headway has been made in the course of six months? I should also like to point out to Mr Bolkestein that the course currently taken by matters has led to unrest in the US too. A few days ago, I read in the paper that it had become known in the US that the airline company, Jet Blue, has secretly transmitted personal data of more than 1 million passengers to a bureau of the Pentagon. The American Civil Liberties Association deems this a highly ‘un-American system of border controls’. A US citizen who was working in the World Trade Center on 11 September, and luckily survived, says that he can understand that safety is important, but that it should not be done in this way, for that is ludicrous!</p>
<p class="contents">The US is lobbying for its own standards, but should we not be doing the same thing in the US? This brings me to another point which may not entirely fall within this Commissioner’s remit: would it not be preferable for organised crime and terrorism to be fought by setting up a transatlantic system along the lines of the European Schengen system for the exchange of data on potentially dangerous persons?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the solution is two-pronged. First of all, we need to regulate data protection effectively and then look for another way of fighting terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, as I said to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on 9 September 2003, and in accordance with the messages I received from Members of Parliament on that occasion, the Commission is pursuing its negotiations with the American authorities which receive passenger name record data transferred from the European Union with a view to obtaining improved undertakings on four major issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I will touch upon purpose limitation. So far, the United States has refused to limit its use of passenger name record data to the fight against terrorism. The Americans also want to cover other serious domestic criminal offences. So far, they have not been prepared to further narrow these down.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, as far as the scope of the data required is concerned, the United States requires 39 different PNR elements, which it is hard to regard as necessary for or proportionate to the purpose. The Commission is seeking a reduction in the list of 39 data elements from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the data storage periods are still far too long. Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has stressed that they last six to seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, American undertakings are insufficiently legally-binding, since the available extra-judicial redress mechanisms are not fully independent. Therefore we must insist that rights are, to the greatest possible extent, legally-binding and thus actionable before American courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, we are working with the target date of Christmas 2003, the date that I set when I last spoke to the LIBE Committee. Ideally, an adequacy decision should be well on track by that time. An adequacy decision will only be possible, however, if the United States is ready to improve significantly its undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">I must be frank with the House and say that I am not confident that we shall be able to secure the necessary significant improvements in order for the Commission to be able to make an adequacy finding. However, progress in the United States' commitments is in any case necessary for any kind of solution, whatever its legal form - be it an adequacy finding or, if supported by the European Parliament, a bilateral international agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent step in our negotiations with the United States was the meeting which I held yesterday with Under Secretary Asa Hutchinson of the US Department of Homeland Security - he is the number two person in that department. That was a useful meeting in which we discussed all the main issues and agreed to put our officials to work to make further efforts to find a solution in the coming weeks. When I am in Washington in mid-October I expect to meet with senior Homeland Security officials, including, hopefully, Secretary Tom Ridge. I emphasised to Mr Hutchinson yesterday the urgency of finding a solution – and of course I also referred to the serious concern with which PNR transfers are viewed in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it difficult to accept any remark that the Commission is tolerating the situation and not doing its job as Guardian of the Treaties. As far as the Data Protection Directive is concerned, applying the law is a job for the Member States and their data protection authorities. The Commission's immediate role is to ensure that it is the Member States that respect the directive, not the airlines. But the problem, in any case, is not one that we can solve via purely intra-European means. We have a conflict of laws with the United States and that is the heart of the matter. In my talks with the United States authorities, I hope to be firm. But being entirely inflexible on the European side will not necessarily obtain more flexibility from our counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding passenger consent, which was mentioned by some Members as a possible way out - at least in the short term - this would not, in our view, constitute a legally-secure, longer-term solution. First, making consent unambiguous would prove very burdensome in practice. Second, the result would be a transfer of data that – despite being legal in the EU – would still lack any significant protection on the American side. Therefore, securing the best possible undertakings from the United States on the way in which they will treat the data collected from EU citizens is much to be preferred.</p>
<p class="contents">The oral question submitted by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak also refers to what should happen if an adequacy finding cannot be reached by the end of the year. She proposes to stop the data transfers that are not in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination, prior informed consent and an efficient appeals procedure, and to begin immediate negotiations on an international agreement with the United States. These measures reflect to some extent the options for possible courses of action that I outlined in my meeting with the LIBE Committee earlier this month.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I stressed then, we should be very prudent not to shoot ourselves in the foot. Enforcement action may be superficially attractive, but it is not clear that its consequences would be those that we seek. Therefore, let us cross that bridge when we come to it. Political judgments will have to be exercised at the right moment. It is clear that the course we shall follow will fully involve the Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we can all agree on the need to unite to combat terrorism. But we equally agree on the need to avoid security concerns becoming an excuse for dismantling our civil rights and liberties. I should like to assure the House that the Commission will continue to devote its unstinting efforts to finding an agreed solution with the United States on this important but also very delicate issue. The solution needs to be found as a matter of urgency, and must respect the law on both sides of the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is, without a doubt, 5 March 2003, when the United States asked airlines operating between the United States and Europe to make available all the data relating to passengers: absolutely all the data, not just, as had been the case thus far, the data necessary for air transport agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The second date is 15 March 2003. Just a week later, with timing worthy of an even greater cause, Parliament adopted the resolution calling for enforcement of the 1995 directive and the 1989 regulation on the protection of privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The third date is 23 September, today: six months after the adoption of the resolution, it would appear that nothing has changed; the United States has not responded to the Commission’s demands. We might ask whether the Americans are deaf or whether it is the Commission that is unable to find the rights words to get through to them. Thus, still today, travellers to the United States find themselves asked, in addition to the usual general questions, about their religion, their taste in food, where they last went on holiday and their close and distant relatives. That is certainly going too far. It is right that the Commission should raise its voice, that Parliament should call for more resolute endeavours such as an international agreement, perhaps, as proposed by the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, however, seem appropriate to mention another date too: 11 September 2001. As we all remember, it was then that strict controls started to be enforced. Mindful of that appalling incident, I feel that perhaps we ought to be just a little more patient and realise that, behind what is certainly an annoying breach of confidentiality, there is still a great deal of fear. In any case, as the Commissioner said, a little flexibility might facilitate dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no legal basis for giving the US authorities direct, unfiltered access to the personal data of European passengers and it is contrary to Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; it is contrary to the Community provisions on the protection of personal data; it is contrary to the Community Computer Reservations Systems Regulation. Part of the responsibility for this unlawful situation lies with the European Commission, for the US legislation requiring the disclosure of this information dates back to November 2001 and was updated in May 2002, while the system did not enter into force until March 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Commission failed to inform Parliament of any of this and negotiated at senior-official level with the United States to achieve the joint statement of 18 February 2003 which, in practice, allowed the US authorities indiscriminate access to the personal data of European citizens collected by airlines for completely different purposes, even suggesting that national control authorities should not take action against airlines complying with the United States’ requests. Only the firm reaction of the European Parliament and said control authorities induced the Commission, at last, to acknowledge that the conditions of adequate protection required by Article 25 of the directive were not being met as regards the transmission of data collected in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, point out that, in the case of Italy, the ban by the control authority on access to data collected by the company, <span class="italic">Alitalia</span>, has not met with negative reactions or sanctions from the United States authorities. The Commission must, therefore, make more vigorous endeavours to achieve a genuine international agreement with the United States as soon as possible which regulates the matter on the basis of fundamental principles: respect for the principle of reciprocity, on the basis of which, if the Union gives US citizens the same rights as its own citizens, then the United States must do the same for European citizens; respect for the principle of proportionality; respect for the principle of informed consent and the right of the person concerned to appeal to an independent authority or judge. In the meantime, pending the achievement of a satisfactory agreement, a situation of legality must be restored and access to data which violates Community law must be banned.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, then, a centralised system will have to be established at European level for the electronic collection of data relating to flight reservations, containing adequate filters which ensure that only data which may be lawfully disclosed is transmitted to third parties, with due regard for the fundamental rights of the European citizens which we, Parliament and the Commission, are under obligation to protect, not least against terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about the airline company Jet Blue that recently had the dubious honour of being the first American airline company to be able to provide data about its airline passengers to the Pentagon. The latter had requested this information so as to be able to make a risk assessment of passengers based on the CAPS II programme. When this piece of information was leaked, a huge outpouring of indignation in the United States ensued. Apologies were made and the data tap was turned off immediately. Especially serious was the fact that passengers had not been previously informed of the violation of their privacy, but the wrath of public opinion was also directed at the very fact of registration on a massive scale. As already stated, the influential UCLA, the American Civil Liberties Association, qualified this as ‘a highly un-American system’ and condemned the fact that, in this way, every passenger is turned into a suspect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am giving this account of American indignation to press home to the Commissioner that he should not be fixated on striking a compromise between us and Minister Rich and company in the current negotiations with the United States, because the playing field is much wider and it is up to us to make it wider still. Apparently, the American public does not deem the actions and measures viable, and we must therefore also raise our objections.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to ask you to try out an alternative route using an alternative strategy. You have easy access to the Anglo-Saxon press, and I therefore count on your written powers of persuasion, via American public opinion, to put the administration effectively under pressure. Consider it to be a kind of hearts and minds campaign<span class="italic">. </span>What are our specific problems? It would be useful to clarify this, because I think that we will find a ready audience in this respect, also among the public in the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the second point that I should like to bring to your attention is the proposals that are circulating to develop a passport with advanced electronic chips in which biometric data, including somebody’s past travelling history, can be stored. If this travelling history is stored on this chip and somebody travels to America, then Bush will still have unfettered access to the information which is the subject of our bickering. My question to the Commission is therefore: how can we ensure that we are not fighting a rearguard action today? How much progress has been made with the discussion about these passports, and are you considering how this might affect the privacy of our citizens? This is, after all, how we can avoid being faced again with <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span> in a year’s time and being indignant on a massive scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Article 2 of Regulation 22/99 bans the disclosure to third parties which are not party to a transaction of personal information on a passenger without the passenger’s consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you stated that responsibility for enforcing legislation lies with the Member States. This is true where directives are concerned but not when it comes to regulations. You are vested with all the necessary authority to intervene and ensure that the law is enforced, under Article 11, which states that the Commission, when appealed to or acting on its own initiative, is to instigate proceedings in order to stop all violation of the provisions of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we want to require respect for the law when that would actually be counterproductive? I believe, first and foremost, that where there is a law, it must be respected, and that a condition of any reform - even reform of an international agreement - is compliance with procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you would acquire greater clout in international negotiations if the Commission were to demand respect for the law without delay, for it has the power to do so as well as the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The timeframe is not for us to decide: it is – and, in my opinion, should be – the timeframe laid down by Article 232 of the Treaty, which stipulates a period of two months from our request for action. If no action is taken, we have two months in which to appeal to the Court of Justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, superfluous data, the storing of which has already – in the GDR and elsewhere – caused intelligence services and whole states to collapse. In the interests of the fight against terrorism this data should not be saved. Secondly, useful data which would, on entry, be removed anyway. This data can be used in an appropriate and legal manner. Thirdly, however, there is sensitive data, on which we need precise rules, and which must either not be recorded, saved and passed on at all, or it must at least be deleted after a deadline, after the person leaves the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are all vehement advocates of the fight against terrorism, terrorism cannot be fought with anarchy, but rather in two ways. Firstly on the basis of the law, and this – rather than arbitrariness – we should step up. I regret to say that at the moment in transatlantic relations there is arbitrariness regarding these questions of data, and an absence of any legal basis. Secondly we can fight international terrorism only on the basis of trust between the USA and Europe, trust that was damaged through both sides apportioning blame and must be re-established. Trust can only arise when genuinely transparent rules are created, ones that the public can understand, otherwise we will fuel mistrust of both the USA and the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I do not think that we can wait until international rules are in place, nor can we rely on the current fifteen and future twenty-five Member States implementing the law. It is much more a fluke that the Commission, with you as a spokesman for the European Union, which will soon have more inhabitants than the USA and Russia together and must be a partner of the USA, is acting on this important issue, but intentionally and on the basis of the law. Therefore, Mr President, I would like to call out to the Commission: be tough in your conduct of the negotiations, Mr Bolkestein! Be firm, or be tough on these important questions of trust and the law! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
