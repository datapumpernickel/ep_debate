However, the Commission does not believe that the system of ecopoints is a valid long-term system for resolving the problems of traffic associated with sensitive regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The text we will present contains certain significant elements, such as the removal of the 108% clause, which imposes an annual limit on the number of transit journeys by Community lorries through Austria. On the other hand, the proposal maintains the system in force throughout Austrian territory and also the number of ecopoints available for 2003. In fact, in 2003 the objective of the system will be achieved, which is to reduce pollution by 60% over the last twelve years.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal therefore responds to the desire of the Heads of State and Government and implies an extension for a limited period – one year renewable for two further consecutive years, that is up to a maximum of three years – but under no circumstances can it be the definitive proposal, but simply a transitional solution until we can implement other solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, before I go any further, I would like to say that, as a mountain-dweller, I fully understand the Austrians’ concerns. Furthermore, the situation of Austria and the Alpine question as a whole have come about as a direct result of a transport policy which needs to be completely overhauled, as is clearly indicated in the White Paper which, by pure coincidence, we are going to discuss this very afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two requirements: on the one hand, free movement of goods and the single market, and, on the other, environmental protection, road safety and public health – basically, what is meant by the catchphrase ‘sustainable development’. What should our strategy for transport be? Fewer lorries, more trains, a shift away from the transport monoculture, more intermodal transport, fewer roads and road tunnels and more rail tunnels, an overall rebalancing of the situation with due regard for freedom of the market but also taking into account the need for guiding parameters, including clear information on the real costs of transport, and consistent pricing, the freeing-up of resources for rail investments, the development of a European structure for the rail networks through the railways packages, safety guarantees provided by the relevant directive on tunnels and by common rules to make road transport safer; lastly, a growing effort to introduce less-pollutant transport systems, and also, I would say, to finish with, the use of systems such as the satellite system, Galileo, to track fleets of lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian question relates to the Alps but the situation is similar in other mountain ranges such as the Pyrenees too. We are faced with a boom in freight transport, which will expand even further with enlargement. In the past, Austria used this ecopoints system – which was soon to be abandoned – and, after Laeken, the European Council remained strangely undecided until the very end of last year, when a solution was found that was described in committee as a virtual solution, meaning that, in actual fact, the figures were theoretical. That is why a broad majority of the European Parliament, in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, decided on a plan of action, starting from the assumption that we need to work towards a legal basis consisting, first and foremost, of the Alpine Convention transport protocol, which appears to be the only instrument which would compel the European Union to regulate the flow of lorry traffic in the Alpine region as well. There is a need for a new policy based on the Swiss model.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee of which I am Chairman has made every endeavour to find a balanced solution. We have consulted the Ministers. We have even had the date for the construction of the Brenner Base Tunnel brought forward definitively from 2021 to 2012. Above all, through the amendments we are tabling before the House, we have endeavoured to find a solution which gets away from the ecopoints system, in any case to find a solution for the period stretching from now until 2006 based on the need, as I said, to take into consideration the provisions of the Alpine Convention and, I would say, more generally, the sensitive areas of the Alps. It is not by chance that Amendment No 15 refers to other areas such as Fréjus in the Alps to the north-west of Italy, to the Mont Blanc region and to the Austrian Alps, in other words to the whole of the Alps, for I believe that this is the overall picture which we must consider. Particularly in Article 13, we have taken great care to achieve the phasing out of heavy goods vehicles, introducing a quota system for 2004, 2005 and 2006, which in 2005 – 2006 will lead to a ban on EURO 0 and EURO 1 lorries, a quota system for EURO 2 lorries and free transit for EURO 3 lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards the amendments, I feel that the Swoboda and Simpson amendments cannot be accepted in that they considerably alter the proposal endorsed by the majority of the committee and that the Rack amendment cannot be accepted because it too completely changes the parameters. I can accept Amendment No 19 tabled by the Greens, which calls for further debate. Lastly, I feel we must reject Amendments Nos 20 and 21 because they too change the proposal completely.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying that, as Committee Chairman and rapporteur, it was my duty to find a balance. As a mountain-dweller, I might have preferred to go further, but I felt it was right for Parliament to be able to see the current state of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the rapporteur's coordinating work has enabled us to achieve a great deal of agreement in Parliament. A new regulation is being proposed to replace the old eco points system. Because the objectives of the old system, which expires at the end of 2003, were achieved in 2002, we came to the conclusion that it would not be a good thing to continue the old system. The present regulation provides a good balance between protection of the vulnerable Alpine region on the one hand and the wishes of the Austrian population and the absolutely fundamental principle of the free movement of goods on the other. It is not easy for anyone to arrive at a balanced solution for transit traffic through the Austrian Alps. The concerns about environmental pollution and public health are understandable. Geographically speaking, Austria is, after all, a transit country, which is why we suggested excluding from the area the lorries that produce the most pollution. At the same time we call upon the Council and the Commission to promote clean and quiet EURO-4 category lorries as soon as they are on the market by providing a purchase subsidy for transport companies, thus helping them to bear the considerable financial burden these lorries will represent.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is one of the major advantages that Parliament’s proposal has over that of the Council and the Commission. If we promote cleaner lorries, transport companies will be encouraged to buy environmentally friendly vehicles. Cleaner lorries, the so-called EURO-3 and EURO-4, are therefore not subject to the quota system but have free passage. The proposals of both the Commission and the Council do not promote the use of clean lorries in any way whatsoever. In fact they even go so far as to penalise the use of the clean EURO-4 by reducing the number of points that will be available.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be crystal clear to all parties concerned that it will really be over after 2006. There can be absolutely no question of an extension or any other form of quota system. Austria’s unique position cannot continue, certainly not given the discriminatory nature of the old system. Only 10% of the ton-kilometres driven on Austrian territory relate to transit traffic through Austria, while there are absolutely no requirements for national transport to tackle hazardous NOx emissions. The entry into force of the directive on infrastructure charging and the end of the points system will therefore be linked only if the charging directive enters into force before the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two urgent requests. The first is that the Commission should make it possible for the Council to put forward a supporting regulation for EURO-4 to Parliament without the risk of accusations of state support. The second urgent request is addressed to Austria: do something from your side too, by increasing the number of trains and ensuring that they are cleaner. Finally, get a move on with the Brenner Base Tunnel: 2021 is absolutely unacceptable. I am firmly convinced that my colleague Paul Rübig will agree with this support, which is also aimed at smaller and medium-sized transport companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also uncomfortable with the decision to offer two countries, Greece and Portugal, a free exemption for some categories of lorry, as if we were still at the very beginning of the integration process and it were necessary to proceed by means of derogations and exemptions.</p>
<p class="contents">My unease, Mr President, is also due to the great contradiction which this ecopoints system represents without resolving the issue which Commissioner de Palacio also mentioned. Indeed, we are continuing to extend a transitional system which was only accepted when Austria joined the European Union on the basis that it was transitional, precisely because it is a derogation from the provisions of the Treaties on the free movement of goods and, in this case, also because it is a question of the Alpine arc, which is, in any case, a natural obstacle that penalises some countries in terms of the movement of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has rightly pointed out, the solution still has to be transitional, and this is the third reason for our unease – the slow rate of our progress towards the natural solution of the Brenner Base Tunnel, of intermodal transport. However, it is already positive, as Mr Caveri pointed out, that the date for the construction of the tunnel has been brought forward a little from 2021, which was the uncertain date initially proposed to the Austrian Government for work to start.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, our unease is also due to the heavy-handed attempt to make a rather over-simplistic distinction between those in Parliament who uphold and wish to safeguard respect for the environment and the quality of the environment and those who are concerned for the interests of road haulage companies. This is not the case. It is an unacceptable simplification of the facts. Our group – and Parliament as a whole, I believe, which has not spared any effort in the quest for compromise amendments – has focused as a priority first and foremost on sustainable development and the quality of the environment in the Alpine arc. The merit of the Caveri report, which is to the credit of all the Members who have contributed to it, is that it contains compromise amendments which reconcile and achieve a balance between the demands of environmental protection and the fundamental principle of free movement.</p>

Just for the record and for the translation: this is not serious. The ecopoint system for the Alps, which aims to protect the local environment, sets the unjust local Austrian special position against the right of free movement of goods, and means that I am no champion of the current system. I was therefore not enthusiastic when I heard that the Danish Presidency had succeeded in extending the system until 2006. France and Italy also have Alps, and the Pyrenees are also very vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Mr Caveri’s report managed to bring this unexpected extension of a bad system by the Council back down to reasonable proportions. If it has to be, then let it be like this. The polluter must pay and the most environmentally friendly lorries must continue to be excluded from the full impact of the ecopoints. I am also pleased with the approach that involves no longer regarding the Austrian Alps as a single entity but looking specifically at those areas where there actually are extremely fragile environmental conditions. If Austria seriously wants to tackle transit traffic that pollutes the environment, she will have to invest in infrastructure, invest in railways, and invest in tunnels. Passing the buck by pleading for a stricter ecopoint system seems to me not to be acting in solidarity with neighbouring countries. It would just create extra traffic in these countries, with too little benefit to the European environment, as traffic would have to make detours. I am fervently hoping for a good result in the voting tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Austria would probably like to do the same for north-south traffic, but membership of the European Union puts obstacles in the way of this. German and Italian road transport operators would prefer to have a free passage, as would the Dutch operators that are strongly represented in the sector. When Austria joined the European Union, a compromise was reached on a distribution arrangement. Since then, the country has been put under pressure to allow more and larger lorries through. As a result, anyone wanting to protect those living in the area and their environment against the air and noise pollution from large flows of lorries now has cause to mistrust the motives for each new arrangement. Because the solution that is now being proposed consists of a combination of quotas, bans and charges, the majority of my group will still give it the benefit of the doubt for 2004, but the problem cannot be solved without building a railway tunnel under the Brenner Pass. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a matter of concern for us all, and both the Austrian Greens and their counterparts in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in this European Parliament regard this as an area in which more information is needed. This is not merely a problem for Austria alone; the whole of the Alps – a sensitive area – is also at stake. This is where I disagree with Mr Vermeer.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be playing off the free movement of goods against the balance of the ecosystem. I agree with Mr Caveri that this is a problem for the whole of Europe, and so it is Europe that must make an attempt at resolving it.</p>
<p class="contents">Austria cannot solve on its own something that is a problem for the zone as a whole. Opinions can differ when it comes to the ecopoints. They were an instrument. Austria is open to accusations of not having done its homework, of not having found or even sought out allies. It may have been too cautious in what it did, in that rail capacity was not fully utilised. That may well be so.</p>
<p class="contents">We are waiting, however! We are waiting for a proposal from Europe. Today's debate would not even have been necessary if we had got a grip on the complex issue of transport in good time, with a fixed tariff for infrastructure costs, and with the transport infrastructure costs directive that we are so keen to have; it is even rumoured that the document actually exists, but nothing is known about it. Nor do we know whether there are measures specific to the sensitive areas in the Alps, or whether there are specific measures for sensitive zones in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you to consider our amendments as an expression of our desire to thereby do justice to the problems with transport, the environment and health arising from both travel within the Alpine region and across it. Without an upper limit, it will not work. Limited and transitional solutions are not what we want. We need an effective solution until such time – the sooner, the better – as a directive on transport infrastructure costs enters into force.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you to consider our proposals within the complex framework of a common European transport policy, which, if it were to be along the lines of the Alpine Convention, could be a model not only for the Austrian – or any other – Alps, but for all of Europe's sensitive areas. That would earn us the gratitude of all the Europeans who live in these regions.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, crucial Austrian interests are at stake when we vote on the extension of the ecopoint system. The objective, as formulated in the Transit Agreement, of a long-term and sustainable reduction in pollutants has not, as yet, been achieved. In parts of the country from which I come, transit traffic has come to constitute an intolerable nuisance.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in Mr Caveri's report reduce the ecopoint system to an empty shell. I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 18, which has been tabled by a number of Austrian Members from all parties and builds on the Danish Presidency's compromise proposal. Even though I do not think this proposal goes far enough, it represents a middle way acceptable to all parties involved. Austria does not simply want to keep its ecopoint system well into the distant future. We, too, want a fair and, above all, sustainable solution to Europe's transport problems, but so long as one is not in sight, and pending the adoption of the new infrastructure cost directive, the transit issue requires a transitional arrangement that takes account of Austrian concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was important when what was known as the Transit Agreement was being negotiated between 1992 and 1994, a time when we even made our consent to membership of the Community conditional upon the finding of a sound and forward-looking solution to this problem. Just as we did then, we see the Transit Regulation as a sort of leading issue. Neither then nor now did we, or do we, want some sort of preferential treatment in the form of special arrangements for our country that would amount to long-term derogations from the Internal Market. What we then wanted, and what we continue to seek, is an EU transport policy that points the way for others to follow by taking into account, along with the freedoms of the internal market, concerns relating to those parts of the environment affected by the traffic, especially in sensitive areas, and the concerns of the people who live near such traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard these concerns of ours as being in harmony with the Commission's objectives as regards transport. In its Transport White Paper, which we shall soon be discussing, it promises that the planned new transport infrastructure costs directive will include provisions on the imposition of charges for the use of the infrastructure as well as on the integration of the external costs, with such provisions reflecting serious consideration of the use of cross-subsidies to benefit more environmentally friendly means of transport. We want all those things, too. That is why it is so important that no gap should be allowed to occur between the expiry of the transit regime and the new directive entering into force. That is also why we need an appropriate transitional regime. The Danish Presidency of the Council, which worked hard to achieve a compromise at Council level between all those concerned with this highly touchy issue, came close to achieving its objective, narrowly missing it only because there were no longer sufficient transport ministers coming to Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, following our resolution in Parliament, we will be calling on the Council, at the meeting of its transport ministers, to pass a formal resolution adopting the compromise which has already been arrived at in this matter, and it would be important in view of this if we in this House were also to be able to express our belief in a joint, sound, and forward-looking solution to this problem. On behalf of all the Austrian Members of this House, I therefore ask you to give every possible support to Amendment No 18, which enjoys the essential backing of all four of the political groupings in Austria. The environment, and the people who live in the affected areas, will thank us for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not, though, as an Austrian that I am disappointed by what we have in front of us, but as someone who has an especial concern for the environment. I believe that we are right to start from the belief that we can achieve a lasting solution on transport, and, indeed, that we have to work on the basis of that assumption. It just happens to be the case that transit traffic presents a particular problem, bringing as it does practically no benefits to the country, but a great deal of expense and environmental damage in its wake.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, I join with all the other speakers today in agreeing that we have to achieve an all-round and lasting solution applicable to all HGVs that pollute to the relevant degree. I agree with the Member who said that we may well want environmentally friendly HGVs, but they do not yet exist; we know perfectly well that the Euro-4 lorry is scarcely yet on the market, and that is another reason why we need a transitional regulation. Here and now, we say in the clearest terms that what we need is a transitional regulation! Yes, indeed, the railways have to be developed, but, my dear Mrs Peijs, in 2000, on the Brenner route alone, 36 million tonnes of freight capacity were going free – and nothing has changed since then. Railways are not being used to their fullest capacity. The simple fact is that, so long as there is no proper system of tolls, they are too expensive. There is one Member who has given it as his opinion that it is unfair to impose conditions applicable only to Austria. We are ready and willing to stand in solidarity alongside the other regions of this continent, but it is surely not acceptable that only the Swiss are in a position to levy an appropriate toll and invest the money in tunnels. We are also ready and willing – and I am unreservedly in favour of this – to make an earlier start on building the Brenner base tunnel, but we must have the means of financing it. If, on the one hand, we fail to make the finance available whilst, on the other, asserting the need for railways to be developed, yet not even using them when they have been for lack of the necessary incentives, then the whole system cannot work.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much hope that the transport infrastructure costs directive will come into being, but I am already curious as to what the debate on it will involve and can see a number of people here in the Chamber who will say that environmental costs also have to be taken into consideration, that they do not add up to much, and that we have to be very careful with cross-subsidies. I can already see the amendments to the next Izquierdo Collado report, in which a commitment will be made to cross-financing – at least in principle. But our Members from the Group of the European People's Party are already rejecting the idea of following the Swiss example, as taking account of the environment in that way is too radical for them. This leads me to believe that we should not only be doing united lip-service to sustainable development, but should also be creating the instruments for it. We know all too well that an environmentally-focussed transport policy is one of the essential instruments for bringing about sustainable development in Europe. So, rather than this being a special arrangement for Austria, it may be that our country is playing the part of an outrider, a role we will abandon only when an alternative is available to us, although we are willing to campaign for an alternative and to make full use of it.</p>

It makes no mention of the people of Austria and the Alpine region. Whether or not <span class="italic">they</span> were on top of the world plays no part whatsoever in this song, but it does in this report. This report epitomises European transport policy. Its significance goes beyond Austria and even the Alpine region as a whole. It is a tool in the hands of sustainable development in European transport policy. For this reason, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, via Amendments Nos 19, 20, and 21, is calling for a quick, lasting and comprehensive solution to the ecological, economic, social and safety problems which the traffic through the Alps has been causing for decades and of which the European Union is aware.</p>
<p class="contents">The end of Austria’s ecopoint system is only acceptable if another kind of protection is brought in for the whole of the Alpine region and not just for Austria, one which has its basis in the Alpine Convention. No time vacuum should arise as regards this protection. There must also be some restriction of the number of lorries passing through the Alps. Without a clear target, there is little point to all of this. We are therefore calling for the imposition of a permanent 8% limit on growth compared to the figure for 1991. We are unable to endorse this report until a solution is found in the medium term for the Alpine region as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is primary legislation enacted by Austria and the EU. Today, we have not achieved the 60% target, nor has any reduction in pollutants been either long-term or sustainable, facts observed both by the Commission and by the European Environmental Agency in its 68th technical report. Instead, there has been a massive rise in the number of transit journeys, and the nuisance from pollution has increased by 52% in comparison to 1992.</p>
<p class="contents">The ecopoint regulation will lapse at the end of 2003, even though its objective, the sustainable reduction of these pollutants, has not been achieved. As the transport infrastructure costs directive, often heralded by the Commission, has still not yet seen the light of day, a transitional solution was agreed on with Austria, having the form of a regulation on traffic from 2004 onwards. This agreement must guarantee that there will be no further increase in emissions from transit traffic over against the 2003 levels. Adoption of this report would have the opposite effect, that is, a dramatic increase in the levels of emissions from transit traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing to be said about the report is that it is worse than the Commission proposal, worse than the Danish council decision, and worse than the decision taken at the Laeken Council. Secondly, the report entirely ignores the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which that body adopted by a large majority. Thirdly, it goes counter to the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and of the Alpine Convention, as well as to the European Union's environmental goals in general.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the primary task of the European Parliament to defend the interests of Europe's citizens. If we fail in this task, the hard-hit public will do as they have already announced their intention of doing, and use road blockades in an attempt to secure their rights.</p>

After all, they should be satisfied with the way in which the Caveri report gives them another sensible transitional regulation. I want to remind you of one thing, something previously approved by the Council and endorsed by the Commission, and that is the fact that this special arrangement for Austria applies just as much to those parts of the country that are not in the Alps and from which, indeed, the Alps are not even visible, parts that are quite simply flat. I will remind the honourable gentleman and the honourable ladies that this is a special case, and a quite unjustified one at that. Do you imagine we do not get transit traffic in the north of Germany? Do you imagine that other parts of Germany, or of Belgium do not suffer from it? They are even worse off. What you are after is special treatment! In no way can you justify that!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protest)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Excuse me, my good sir, but why do not you behave like a parliamentarian for a change? We are not here to represent the interests of Austrian citizens, but the interests of the European Union's, all 370 million of whom also have a right to avail themselves of the free movement of services. This is not just about the Austrians' unilateral rights; the other 360 million citizens are also entitled to see Community law adhered to. The great thing about the Caveri report is that in it, we are proposing that there should again be a three-year transitional arrangement for the Alpine region. Just take a close look at that: in 2005, according to the Caveri report, even category 0 and 1 heavy goods vehicles are to be banned from passing through. That shows that we are meeting your people and their interests halfway! What you are doing here is constructing a fictitious bogeyman by claiming that the remainder of the EU is against you and the environment, which you alone allegedly care for. Ladies and gentlemen, that is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Caveri report proposed a sound compromise between the interests of 360 million citizens of the EU and those of fewer than 10 million other EU citizens. That has to be weighed in the balance. I believe that the Caveri report ends up making you a good offer, in the form of a transitional arrangement. But it is not on for the Austrians to say that they want special rights, for, my good friend from the Austrian Socialist group, what has happened over recent years? You kept on wanting cross-subsidies.

I too am convinced that the outcome of the deliberations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is the right solution, unlike that presented to us by the Council, and it is a good solution precisely because it reconciles two things which are difficult to reconcile: on the one hand, respect for and enhancement and stepping up of all the efforts to preserve the environment on both sides of the Alps – for there is an Italian side of the Alps as well as an Austrian side – and, on the other, respect for one of the fundamental principles of the European Union, if we really do believe in a European Union, in other words the internal market, the free movement of persons and goods, which are the minimum conditions necessary if there is to be a community of people as well as a community of economic principles. It is therefore a balance which settles once and for all – and it could not be otherwise if we were to avoid making a mockery of the Treaties and the law – once and for all the question of ecopoints, while recognising that a transitional period is still needed, introducing a time frame which we feel to be preferable to that proposed by the Commission and which we would ask the Commission to evaluate.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore fully support and endorse this approach, to which we contributed, moreover. However, quite frankly, there is something I must say in conclusion to the Austrian Members. I am rather saddened by the fact that the Austrian Members receive great support in this House from their fellow countrymen, of all political parties, of course, but that they do not enjoy any support at all from the Members of other nationalities. I invite them to reflect on this. Ladies and gentlemen, as part of our responsibility as Members of the European Parliament at such a difficult time for the European Union – in terms of this and other matters – we have to explain to our citizens that belonging to a Union brings advantages and benefits but that it sometimes brings problems too. We will not find a European solution by accentuating the problems. I urge you strongly to think about that. We too could have taken up a stance and refused to budge on this matter but we decided to adopt a more reasonable approach instead. I feel that, for the good of Europe, your attitude should be more tempered and more conciliatory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is this about? Firstly, Parliament accepts that Austria is entitled to have a derogation extended. I consider this a quite extraordinary course of action, one which has not enjoyed my support for a long time, and one that, tomorrow, we will adopt by a large majority. That is something of which we must not lose sight. I warn, though, that we must not now start attaching a very high value to one section of the human race and a lower one to others.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the honour of representing an electoral district right on the border with Austria, that lovely country, and I would like, here and now, to make it very clear that I cannot accept that people in the Tyrol are worth more than the people on the estate near Lindau's customs house, who, every day, by night and day, have to endure traffic making a detour on the short route from Bavaria to Switzerland. This has nothing to do with crossing the Alps or with ecology; it is because they would be liable to ecopoints if they went via the autobahn.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not acceptable; you simply must see that. Having traffic doing such things as taking detours or going elsewhere altogether is just not on. Only 11% of HGV traffic in Austria is liable to ecopoints. It is not on when, in the Tyrol, representatives of citizens' initiatives tell me that they have no problem with this if the HGVs have Austrian number plates, but that they do have difficulties if the vehicles are registered elsewhere. That is no longer acceptable, and I want to make that clear here and now.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption)</span></p>
<p class="contents">These are not tall stories. I have had such conversations. After all, I live there and have contacts there. I cannot accept that a certain segment of Europe's population is being treated as being worth more. You can see from the figures that what matters to the Austrians is that their own haulage firms should be put in a stronger position, and that is precisely what they have used the ecopoints regulation to achieve. It cannot, though, be one of Europe's tasks to step in for the benefit of one region's economic interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Lisi, who spoke just now, has already said that we would have expected more generosity, at least in the exercising of our function as Parliamentary representatives of the European peoples – and I repeat, the European peoples – because it is possible to address problems of whose cause we are all, all aware without being hijacked by the martyr-like, exploitative or resigned attitudes of national interests. We will make no progress at all for as long as we think that the sacrosanct protection of legitimate interests – the protection and preservation of the environment – can only be achieved by riding roughshod over and obliterating others. We will make no progress at all!</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the solution adopted, once again as a transitional measure, by the Caveri report is the best solution possible under the given circumstances. We are now attempting to increase what needs to be encouraged rather than what needs to be reduced: on the one hand the use of less-pollutant vehicles and, on the other, what can only be a positive process towards the definition of long-awaited pricing systems which will allow us to provide an organic response to the problem, towards the solution which can further our cause, adopting an approach certainly of recognising European priorities, which, however, presuppose the consistent shouldering of national responsibilities, those investments which, in the future, will make compatible the sacrosanct need for environmental protection and the free movement of goods, the rights, not least, of producer communities which live south of the Alps and could not be fobbed off with solutions which they considered to be merely uncalled-for restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we all decide to uphold responsibilities of this kind that the national governments have disregarded for too long and the committee’s related proposals, I believe that the next debate on this matter will be more worthy of the collective role we have to play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That no longer has anything to do with the free movement of goods, nor indeed do the thousands and thousands of journeys by unladen lorries thundering at excessively high speed through Bavaria and Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austria/Tyrol Transit Forum, one of Austria's largest NGOs, sums it up in precise terms: the fact is that, in 1991 and 2001, on the route through the Brenner Pass, NOx emissions from heavy goods vehicles increased by 18%. The fact is that journeys undertaken by HGVs travelling through Austrian territory have gone up by 50%. The fact is that in not one of the years since the Treaty was signed has any traffic been transferred from road to rail. On the contrary, the tonnage on the road over the Brenner has increased from 15 million tonnes of freight to 26 million. That amounts to an increase of 73%.</p>
<p class="contents">The people living along the transit routes are in despair. Many of them are farmers whose families have lived on their farms for centuries. It is not a matter of them being given a higher value, but they do live higher up. I beg you not to rob these people of their last hope.</p>
<p class="contents">My dear Georg, the ecopoint system was always, in essence, a compromise. I saw the Council's New Year's Eve resolution as the very last chance for us to find a common way ahead. By contrast, I see the Caveri report as the devastating result of the work of a lobby that is as hard as nails, a group with financial clout and much other power besides, by which I mean the hauliers.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that, in Austria too, there are groups trying to get their justified demands incorporated into policy. But the brutal and shameless way in which I saw this happening in the European Union was something really new – and I have quite a few years in politics behind me! I could well name several Members of this House – do not worry, I am not actually going to – who told me that they understood us Austrians, and were also on our side, but asked what else they could do, as their hauliers would finish them off.</p>
<p class="contents">I beg you, I beseech you, to reject the Caveri report and adopt the Danish presidency's compromise proposal. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from my speaking time, I would like to correct the young man over there; if he wants to regard the Alps, this wonderful work of God's hands, as nothing more than an obstacle to transport, then that is his business!</p>

I think it important to emphasise at this point that what it is proposed to extend is a derogation for Austria, a derogation to which Austria has been entitled ever since it joined the EU, to which was attached the condition that Austria was to improve its transport infrastructure in such a way as to have a positive effect on the free exchange of goods guaranteed by the Internal Market. If we are now to discuss the extension of a derogation, it must be clear to us that one does not simply maintain the status quo for another three years, so that the decision we are about to take must envisage the derogation coming to an end by 2006 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">My electoral district in the southern part of Baden-Württemberg borders on Austria, which is admittedly a very beautiful country, and, being well acquainted with haulage companies' complaints about the incomprehensibility of the ecopoint system, I agree with my group that the prevailing system has to be changed, and changed in the following respects. The first thing I want to say is that derogations are justified in the Alps, which are a sensitive region. The ecopoint system should therefore apply only, as was originally intended, to transit through the Alps and not also to journeys in the rest of Austria; the alternative would be that the ecopoint system would constitute an arbitrary measure, and other Member States would be able to claim the right to impose their own. Secondly, the system of ecopoints must definitely come to an end in 2006. Thirdly, the state of technological development means that HGVs in emission categories 3 and 4 should lose their ecopoint liability altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I demand, specifically for what I will call ‘Hörbrenz-Transit’, which particularly affects my electoral district – that is, traffic passing over a connecting stretch, only 16 kilometres long, between the German A 96 and the Swiss A 14 – special treatment in the form of the provision of an adequate number of ecopoints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, what happens to one pass immediately affects all the others. As far as the Brenner tunnel is concerned, recent progress has been spasmodic, to say the least. I would point out that, apart from its natural appeal as a direct vertical line connecting Northern Europe to the Mediterranean, just recently, traffic going to the Brenner tunnel – in Austria, therefore, but in Italy too – has increased immeasurably for very long periods because of the closure of first the Mont Blanc tunnel and then the St Gotthard tunnel and because of the acute crises at the Fréjus pass and the Swiss passes. All this has helped to make the question of the environmental protection of Austria desperate, but we must not forget – and this has never been given any consideration – that there is another side of the Alps, the Italian side, and it will not surprise you to learn that that is where I live. We have never received any recognition of what is exactly the same problem as that of Austria, whereas Austria has been allowed to use the ecopoints system and other systems mentioned by a number of speakers. We have never been allowed to use an ecopoints system or tolls like those for the ‘Ponte Europa’ or the Austrian stretch of motorway, which are among the highest in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore reached the conclusion that the solution proposed by the Caveri report is fair. It is right to apply the ecopoints system to EURO 1 and EURO 2 lorries and it is right to exempt EURO 3 lorries and all subsequent generations of vehicles, but it is also right to abandon ecopoints after 2006 and find alternative ways of offsetting external costs, and not just where Austria is concerned but with regard to all the critical and sensitive areas of Europe. Lastly, it is right to focus on implementing major rail and intermodal transport projects, starting with the Brenner Base Tunnel, for now it really is time to get to work not just on projects but on implementing them too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a range of interests, all of them legitimate but entirely contradictory, which are in opposition to each other. I would simply like to point out to certain Members that we need a quick resolution, because the current transitional situation ends on 31 December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the current situation is transitional. In other words, what appears in the accession Treaty, the protocol on which the whole system of ecopoints is based, lays down a limited time period.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must be aware that the other fourteen countries of the European Union are accepting the idea of making an effort and an exception in order to satisfy Austria with regard to what is one of the essential freedoms of European integration – initially of the Common Market and now of the European Union – which is freedom of transit for people.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the Commission presented a proposal which suggested an extension for a maximum of three years – year by year – of the current system, in order to allow time to seek general rules which of course will not mean for Austria or anybody the maintenance of the ecopoints system or any similar system. I say this because it is obvious that it is not now a question of seeking a system which is radically different to the ecopoints system, since it is going to have a restricted minimal period in force. I would insist that we are seeking a transitional system so that Austria, which participates in the ecopoints system, may arrive, together with the other 14 countries – 24 within a few months – at a common system and a better assumption of the external costs of the different infrastructures throughout the European Union, without exceptions for anybody. It is therefore a transitional exception which must be based, in principle, on the current system because for two or three years it would not make much sense.</p>
<p class="contents">In Mr Caveri’s proposal there are points which take the same approach as the principle for agreement proposed by the Danish Presidency on 31 December. This represents a compromise and I am happy that there is agreement, for example, on the idea of banning the most polluting lorries; on the idea of freeing the least polluting lorries from the ecopoints system; on establishing an annual duration of a transitional system up to a maximum of three years. However, there are provisions which we believe will make it difficult for the Commission to reach an agreement with the Council – I would make this very clear – and which would provide more problems than solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the case with the reduction of the scope of the system to just the Austrian Alps, which are genuinely of the greatest sensitivity, because in the other areas of Austria the sensitivity – and many of the speakers were right – is identical to that of other areas of Europe. However, while I understand this in principle, it would create enormous difficulties in terms of managing the project. I would therefore ask that the general area of Austria be maintained. Furthermore, in the Council we have debated whether or not to exclude the Hörbranz Pass, the Lindau-St. Margarethen, which involves a stretch of road of less than 15 kilometres, a very short distance. That would also raise problems. I would therefore ask you not to retain this part, please.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions of the system of contingents, which vary according to categories, would also raise difficulties. Furthermore, the number of ecopoints set relates to the current Member States, and to apply the system now to the future countries would complicate matters even further.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that before they join as full Members this problem has been resolved definitively.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we ask that you do not insist on the reintroduction of the 108% clause, because we cannot maintain and represent something which – I can tell you – the Council would never accept and which the Commission also rejected. Furthermore, that clause did not appear in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can accept six amendments, one of them a fundamental issue and, if necessary, with some modifications to the wording of the text, Amendments Nos 1, 5, 11, 12 and the first sentence of No 15 and of No 18.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to you that the real solution is to build the Brenner, to build the Lyon-Turin, that intermodality truly be established. Those are the solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">You must understand that we have to seek a compromise and that a solution is urgently required. We do not have many months. And the perfect is always the enemy of the good. I say this to everyone. I would ask you to cooperate so that, amongst all of us, we can resolve this problem, which is very sensitive in one of the countries of the Union. We must seek a response and achieve a result which allows progress to be made, while we present proposals which serve to provide a more rational system of charging for infrastructures throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to congratulate Mr Caveri on the difficult work he has done in trying to seek a formula acceptable to everyone and, in any event, the Commission will, of course, take very good note of what Parliament says as always and will try to include these elements in the basis of an agreement acceptable to Parliament and to the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
