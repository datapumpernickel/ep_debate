<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, one of the consequences of the terrorist attacks of 11 September has undoubtedly been to draw attention to the Middle East and, even if it were only in our own interests, the European Union should contribute to calming the turbulent waters in that region, creating political and economic cooperation and, in general, stimulating the framework of Euro-Mediterranean relations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the work to create a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly would be a valuable contribution, and I would encourage our Lebanese colleagues to join in with this task together with the European Parliament and the Parliaments of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The country with which tomorrow, by means of our vote, the European Parliament will open the doors to privileged cooperation, Lebanon, is unquestionably a key player in the region. Today, after 16 long years of war on its territory, Lebanon can be a travelling companion of the European Union in its enthusiastic attempt to find a solution to the regional conflict. Let us be Mediterranean partners for peace!</p>
<p class="contents">The association agreements such as the one we are discussing today are an essential element of the European Union’s external action, which go further than mere commercial considerations, since they are intended to establish a framework for political dialogue. It is my hope, and I am sure the whole of Parliament agrees with me, that the exception of Syria will be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this agreement, I would like to comment on certain issues which have been raised during the debate in committee. Firstly, although we were undoubtedly delighted by the Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in May 2000, the issue of stable borders with Israel has still not been finally resolved, and we therefore urge the parties to reach an agreement on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, since October of that same year, 2000, the Hezbollah group has been holding four Israeli citizens as hostages and, in this specific case, and with regard to the people captive or disappeared in the various countries of the region in general – it is calculated that there are 17 000 Lebanese citizens – we must get involved – I would like to ask the Greek Presidency whether it is going to do anything to mediate on this regrettable issue of the disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">In our committee, we have also expressed the need to complete the withdrawal of Syrian troops based in Lebanon, in application of Security Council Resolution 520, in order to guarantee the sovereignty and integrity of that country. We therefore appeal to the Lebanese Government to submit this issue to the consideration of our colleagues in that country’s parliament, so that a debate can be opened to allow progress to be made on this crucial issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to support and acknowledge the efforts the Lebanese authorities are making in the fight against terrorism, particularly in application of United Nations Resolution 1373.</p>
<p class="contents">These and other matters will form part of the political dialogue which will be opened up between the European Union and Lebanon, particularly in application of the clause contained in Article 2 of this agreement. And, in the presence of the Council and the Commission, I would like to ask that an in-depth debate be held on the effectiveness of the application of this clause and on the possible mechanisms for its parliamentary monitoring and evaluation. Within this context, the issue of respect for human rights and democratic principles is essential to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this is unquestionably a fundamental instrument which will be extremely useful in terms of supporting the enormous efforts the current government of Minister Hariri is making to improve the economic situation of Lebanon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lebanon, which was once known as the ‘Switzerland of the Middle East’, has for many years sustained great blows, both internally and externally. As a European Union, we should be making a proportionate contribution to restoring stability to this country and hence to the achievement of stability in general, and I believe this Agreement to be a means towards that end. That this should be done in relation to agriculture and agricultural products, to free trade in industrially produced goods, to legislation on trade, and also in relation to issues concerning the rules on the determination of origin, constitutes important progress, and we also welcome the way in which it has proved possible, by means of a separate exchange of letters, to incorporate cooperation in counter-terrorism in this project as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As my predecessors on the floor have said, however, there are a number of points to which we are keen to give further attention, such as the issue of the Syrian military presence. There is no doubt that this problem has to be resolved, both in order to promote stability by making full use of the country's authorities' capacity for change, and also in order to help bring peace to the region as a whole. I believe that it is also important that we who belong to the European Parliament, being desirous of building up still further our cooperation with the Lebanese Parliament, should indicate that the abolition of the death penalty, the ratification of the United Nations Convention against Torture, as well as the signing of the ICC's Rome Statute, will have a major part to play in moving this development further forward.</p>
<p class="contents">As it will do again tomorrow, this Parliament has expressly welcomed Lebanon's efforts at participation in the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1373 by freezing the assets of terrorist groups. We would request the Council and the Commission to cause an anti-terrorist clause with similar content to be included in all future agreements, as decided at the Seville European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we see the position of the Palestinian refugees as being a most particularly serious problem. We have to be clear in our own minds about how great a burden they are on Lebanon. I believe that this is where we have to work closely with Lebanon in order to enable this problem – which is not just about their living conditions, but also has to do with the possibilities for bringing peace to the whole area – to be resolved in a reasonable way, in order to establish proper relations between Palestine and Israel and to secure a lasting peace between them. There are also many other associated problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is our wish that the transitional period of twelve years should not be exceeded until we have established a free trade area with Lebanon, and we hope that this Agreement can be implemented accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in Lebanon is still extremely complicated, mainly because so many different communities live there, meaning that problems require a multiethnic, multilingual, multi-religious approach, not forgetting that Lebanon offers shelter to a great many – about 370 000 – Palestinian refugees. These communities are represented at institutional level. The application of the arrangements in the Charter of National Reconciliation of 22 October 1989 allowing Syrian forces to be stationed in certain areas of Lebanon, basically comes within the framework of relations between Lebanon and Syria. The Council is closely monitoring internal political dialogue in Lebanon. The first step was the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000, followed by a partial withdrawal of the Lebanese-Syrian army in June 2001. At the same time, there is a risk that the presence of Hezbollah forces in the south of the country will become a destabilising factor in Israeli-Lebanese relations. The free parliamentary elections held on 3 September 2000 indicate that things are moving in the right direction, towards the normalisation of the situation in Lebanon, and we must not therefore underestimate the destabilising effect on Lebanon of the conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has stated on several occasions that the fight against terrorism is a priority and the recent terrorist attack in Bali highlighted once again the need for close international cooperation on the fight against terrorism. Implementation of the action plan adopted by the European Council in September 2001 is progressing well. As far as its foreign dimension is concerned, the Council has decided to include the fight against terrorism in the agreement between the European Union and third countries. The fact that Lebanon was one of the first countries that agreed to sign the agreement with the European Union on this issue demonstrates that it is prepared to cooperate actively with the European Union, including in the field of information exchanges. The link between the Cooperation Agreement and the Association Agreement with regard to the fight against terrorism is emphasised by the fact that both agreements were signed on the same day, in Luxembourg on 17 June 2002 to be precise, and will enter into force simultaneously – and soon I hope.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as respect for human rights is concerned, the Council is monitoring this issue closely. The Council expressed its concern about action by the Lebanese army against Christian activists in August 2001 and about the closure of the independent television station ΜΤF last September. The Association Agreement will also strengthen the potential for monitoring this issue and will encourage the authorities in Lebanon to have greater respect for human rights. As you know, the agreement requires respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be a basic element in both sides’ domestic and foreign policy. In addition, regular political dialogue will be established at various levels, mainly in the Association Agreement, on all matters of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to make a number of comments on the Association Agreement, to which the European Parliament is being invited to give its assent. The signing of the Association Agreement is an important development and marks the start of a new chapter in our relations with Lebanon. Although it refers mainly to intergovernmental relations, the agreement also offers an operational framework for the business community and civil society. This agreement is vital to the European Union’s entire Mediterranean policy and is yet another step towards the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone. I should point out that Lebanon has just ratified both the Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement which comes into force on 1 March 2003. Good communications channels between politicians on both sides of the Mediterranean are an important factor in building constructive relations between the ΕU and its Mediterranean partners. At bilateral level, the Association Agreement makes provision for an EU-Lebanon Association Council, to facilitate cooperation and contacts between the European Parliament and parliamentary institutions in Lebanon. The Members of Parliament involved will have to set the framework for this dialogue which, as far as the Council is concerned, will supplement Euro-Mediterranean dialogue in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the results of the last meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, which highlighted the parliamentary dimension of our cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently examining cooperation mechanisms in order to create a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. The European Parliament has started working on just such an assembly, which will include members of the 27 national parliaments and the European Parliament. The Euro-Mediterranean summit in Valencia proposed strengthening the parliamentary dimension of Euro-Mediterranean dialogue by creating a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the recent meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari on 17-18 June 2002, which supported the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and decided to form a working party to set up this new assembly. For their part, the senior officials responsible for the Barcelona process also agreed to set up a group to coordinate with the Bari working party.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the objectives of the Greek Presidency is to use the dynamics of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in order to strengthen its parliamentary dimension. One of our presidency’s priorities is to achieve new levels of integration and boost the credibility of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, which is why we are currently examining the cooperation mechanisms and measures needed in order to create this assembly. What we want, not to say need, is for the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum to decide at its next meeting in Crete on 27 March 2003 to evolve into a parliamentary assembly. If it does, the summit of Foreign Ministers meeting in Crete on 26 and 27 May 2003 would be able to welcome their decision and this new institution could be set up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When Prime Minister Hariri was elected to office in September 2000, he set his government an ambitious deadline – to conclude the negotiations with the European Commission by the end of 2001. I am very pleased that he has delivered on this promise and I call upon Members of the House to vote favourably on the resolution, and to endorse the Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has before it, in my judgment, the means to provide Lebanon with a firm foundation for building its future. The country has experienced a terrible civil war. It has been the victim of outside interference, it still remains vulnerable. Lebanon is now grappling with recovery and with modernisation under difficult economic circumstances, faced with poor immediate prospects for peace in the Middle East, smouldering tensions along the border with Israel and the unsettling possibility of a military conflict in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">There is broad support in Lebanon for this new strengthened relationship with Europe. The Lebanese Parliament ratified both the Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement in December. The interim agreement allows both sides to start the 12-year transition period from March 2003, leading to the gradual introduction of free trade. This is a clear sign that Lebanon is serious in meeting at an early stage its commitments to opening up large areas of its trade and approximating its legislation to that of the European Union. It will also be bound by its engagements on respect for the fundamental principles of human rights and democracy from this date and I want to return to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The free-trade area will bring about profound changes to Lebanese commerce. Lebanon is rightly prized for the entrepreneurial skills of its work force. Its economic strategy is already liberal. World Trade Organisation membership has been requested. The opening of markets and economies will bring benefits through economic liberalisation and increased competitiveness. Lebanon will benefit immediately from market access for its agricultural and processed agricultural products. And the Union will gain from improved access to service sector industries in Lebanon, once these arrangements have been concluded. By signalling Lebanon’s commitment to economic and social reform, this Agreement will send a clear and positive message to the international and European investment community of the opportunities for direct foreign investment in Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">The successful outcome of the Paris II donor conference in November last year, organised with great commitment and success by President Chirac, suggests that this message has already struck home. Of the 18 governments participating, six were Member States and the Commission was also represented at its highest level. There is a clear interest in seeing that Lebanon weathers the economic storm of post-war recovery, and reduces its debt. The amount pledged to assist in debt relief matched expectations (about $ 4.3 billion were pledged in all).</p>
<p class="contents">But, the Association Agreement is first and foremost a political agreement, which is why it devotes so much importance to political dialogue. The Agreement is a potent expression of shared values and common objectives. It is through dialogue that members of this partnership can pursue the shared commitment to achieving peace in the Middle East. Our dialogue, and this was a point which Mr Galeote Quecedo referred to, will embrace the fundamental principles of human rights and democracy with an honesty and appreciation born, I hope, out of close partnership. Lebanon’s pluralist society, embracing numerous sectarian and religious groups, has functioned most effectively when there is consensus, tolerance and open debate – a unique feature in the region. We are, however, conscious of the concerns expressed by the Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee on specific points of the human rights situation in Lebanon. The agreement provides an additional forum for tackling these concerns. By ratifying the Association Agreement, the European Union will trigger the important commitments from Lebanon concerning human rights and democracy, migration and re-admission, money laundering, the fight against organised crime and illicit drugs, and judicial cooperation. And I know too the concerns which have been expressed about freedom of the media. I can reassure you that the Commission will continue to monitor and follow these concerns wherever and whenever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agreement will also, as the Minister pointed out, trigger Lebanon’s undertakings on cooperation in counter-terrorism, set out in the exchange of letters to which he referred.</p>
<p class="contents">Our partnership will extend well beyond trade and politics, and will be wide-ranging, covering areas as diverse as cooperation in the fields of science, education, energy, tourism, the environment and industry. Social and cultural cooperation is also central to the Agreement, in terms of rights of workers, and social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Our partnership will be sustained by contributions under the MEDA programme which I hope will be focused, as far as possible, on implementation of the Agreement. So we are moving towards our overall ambitions in the southern Mediterranean with the agreement that we have put before Parliament with the Lebanon and I very much hope that we can move on from this to completing the grid of association agreements by successful negotiations with Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend this agreement most warmly to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have not forgotten that the Lebanese people have suffered the same hardships and I welcome the fact that at the end of these troubles they have been able to find the necessary resources to begin to rebuild the model of multicultural, multiethnic cooperation you told us about, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and which the whole world admired before the disease that is the fear of otherness, the fear of being dominated, spread there, as it was to spread later on in the Balkans, where I personally was able to observe the devastation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not forgotten this ‘Balkanisation’ of Lebanese territory, which was as destructive as the ‘Lebanonisation’ of the former Yugoslavia was later to be. That is why I can only rejoice in the progress accomplished, which has allowed this association agreement to be concluded with the Republic of Lebanon, about which you rightly said, Commissioner, that it would be political first and foremost. I am sure it will be adopted tomorrow, by a strong majority of Parliament, following the proposal of Mr Galeote.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware, however, of the remaining difficulties which both you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and the Commissioner and Mr Brok and Mr Galeote have raised in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I would say that the Lebanese model – where everyone, whatever their culture and religion, is enriched by contact with otherness – has begun to be built, but only begun. I would like to say that I do not believe it will be completed until the Lebanese people have, as they would like to have, their total independence, which they are still deprived of by the presence of foreign troops on their soil. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly asked for them to be withdrawn. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you told us that a first step had been taken by withdrawing some of these troops. In my eyes, that is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I unreservedly support the request made by our rapporteur, namely for Resolution No 520 of the United Nations Security Council to be taken into account and the matter of the presence of Syrian troops on Lebanese territory to be subject to the judgment of the Lebanese Parliament, which, as we know, is in favour of complete respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and the political independence of their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napoletano (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, Mr Patten, the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement marks a step forward in our long-standing relations. It has already been pointed out several times that Lebanon is a country which has seen 16 years of civil war and which has now managed once again to turn its ethnic, cultural and religious pluralism into the basis for a peace process: it is a country both complex and important, owing to its history and geopolitical position. We hope that the closer relations which this Agreement formally marks, will help make this process irreversible and represent further progress in the respect for human rights and the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely for this reason that the article in the Agreement which refers to human rights must be taken seriously by the Lebanese authorities and the European institutions. Parliament is persevering on this point since the economy and trade must be able to advance at the same pace as advances in freedom, democracy, the role of women and freedom of information. We are pleased to note that Lebanon has signed the International Convention on Women’s Rights and the Convention against Torture. We hope that ratification will follow these signatures and that by continuing along this path, we will see the abolition of the death penalty, Lebanon’s participation in the International Criminal Court, the truth about missing persons and a revised legal system which specifies the limits and role of military jurisdiction. This process should be supported by the MEDA programme, with clear support for the autonomous development of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Another crucial issue is an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and pacification of the region, where a lasting solution can only be found by creating a Palestinian state. The Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon was an extremely important event, but peace was not a consequence. But it is precisely because peace is never automatic but requires great political will that it is important to state the desire to achieve it, starting with the countries in the region. To this end, the tension on the Lebanon-Israel border must cease, Syria should withdraw its military presence from Lebanon and the Palestinian refugees should be given prospects for the future, starting with the provision of better living conditions; I would point out that responsibility for this does not only fall to the host country, but to the whole international community. In pursuing this aim, it is therefore essential for the refugees to be able to benefit from the MEDA programme and for Europe, taking all of this into account, to be especially generous. Lastly, we hope that the Agreement will support economic reforms and trade, which were already important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s opportunity is, however, also a chance for us to make a more general appraisal of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership – as the President-in-Office of the Council did – following completion of the enlargement process, in the context of the reform process which started with the Convention. We must now redefine the enlarged Union’s external relations and we must give Europe a more significant role in the world. The Partnership, launched in Barcelona in 1995, was created with 12 countries. We now have a broader, more systematic view of this process which encompasses the Mediterranean, the Balkans and the Gulf states. Secondly we must ask: which policies? President Prodi has often stated: ‘Everything but institutions’. The European Parliament, for its part, came out in favour some time ago of a Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which includes all the policies which we subscribed to with the candidate countries. I would therefore urge us to go further than the – albeit important – decisions of the last Interministerial Conference in Valencia.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly the institutions: in Valencia – as you, Mr President, pointed out – it was decided to grant the Parliamentary Forum the status of a real parliamentary assembly. This change could be truly significant, and to be a success it must take into account the remarks already made on the geopolitical dimension and policies. By becoming a true institution, the parliamentary assembly should acquire real powers concerning the decisions which this process involves and should be an active participant in the great meeting of cultures. The most important thing is for it to have instruments in order to make real progress in the field of rights, democracy and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wish to highlight a number of these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Lebanon is very uncertain and complicated, and the Syrian presence in the country means that the question may sometimes arise as to whether Lebanon is a completely independent state. There are extensive infringements of human rights. I only have to mention the 17 000 missing Lebanese, the restricted freedom of expression, the violence against demonstrating students, the death penalty and, of course, the situation concerning the Palestinian refugees, referred to by quite a few fellow MEPs. These refugees too must come to enjoy the positive advantages that the association agreement can provide.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group has tabled a number of amendments concerning, for example, the 200 Lebanese held prisoner in Syria. There are also a dozen in Israel. The situation concerning these refugees must be clarified. Lebanon must also ratify the Geneva Convention. We are very concerned about the situation of the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade and the exchange of goods are nonetheless to be welcomed. In the long term, they promote democracy and development – political, economic and social. The association agreements are also an important part of the Barcelona Process. We are therefore voting in favour of this association agreement in the hope that it will lead to development in Lebanon. We nonetheless feel a certain hesitation in doing so because Lebanon is far from being a democracy, and there are flagrant breaches of human rights. We also feel a certain unease, or frustration rather, at the fact that there is always talk about human rights clauses that can be applied if a country infringes an association agreement with the EU. These clauses are nothing other than a resounding shot in the dark. I really want to appeal to Commissioner Patten to ensure that mechanisms can be developed whereby, in the event of breaches of human rights that we know are being committed, Article 2 of the association agreement can be invoked and applied in a meaningful way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boudjenah (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> First of all, at a time when the enlargement of the European Union is underway, I would like the Euro-Lebanese rapprochement to contribute to creating an outline for genuine joint Mediterranean construction. This must take place through a dialogue between equals. It is even more urgent as the risk of war in Iraq weighs upon relations with the Arab world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, as has already been said, we need to use all available means to escape the spiral of violence in the Middle East. Europe and Lebanon could play a more active part with regard to compliance with the United Nations resolutions, the creation of a Palestinian State and Israel’s full, and universal recognition in the region. I am thinking in particular of the serious basis constituted by the offer of peace adopted by the Arab countries in Beirut.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the war in Lebanon is fortunately in the past, the absence of peace throughout the region is a barrier to genuine reconstruction and development in the country as a whole. This is especially true in southern Lebanon, where problems of borders with Israel have not been solved. Almost three years after the Israeli withdrawal, needs are still great: for example, rehabilitation of infrastructures, rebuilding homes and irrigation projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of the Syrian presence: although it does not explain everything, it probably prevents the Lebanese from effectively erasing all the scars of war. Lebanon exists in the mind of the Lebanese, but many would like to see a stronger affirmation of their State, which would take place in particular through a truly independent, democratic State, in order to establish and develop coexistence between the Lebanese. I am thinking in particular of respect for freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, the rights of asylum seekers, those who have disappeared, and the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also true of the situation of Palestinian refugees. Although Lebanon is still, fortunately, a country of refuge for Palestinians, the absence of a foreseeable fair, sustainable solution aggravates the situation of great social distress in which hundreds of thousands of refugees find themselves. The right to return should be recognised as legitimate, but the discrimination that actually affects Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is unjustifiable. Access to work or social protection should be guaranteed more effectively, with our help.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we cannot ignore the social and economic aspects. While the period immediately following the war required the implementation of an ambitious reconstruction programme, the current situation is bleak. Some would say that the Lebanese economy is somewhere between the developing world and the City. The debt is USD 30 billion. There is glaring inequality. The high consumption of the wealthy goes side by side with raging poverty, intensified by an extremely high cost of living and widespread low income. The Lebanese Prime Minister did obtain aid of over EUR 4 billion in Paris last November from some European and Arab countries as well as from international financial institutions. I remain more than sceptical, however, as to the positive effects of creating a free-trade zone. The loss of customs taxes could have significant consequences for useful public spending. European aid should therefore be given through active support for the organisations operating in humanitarian and social fields.</p>
<p class="contents">I still think that modernity and social progress consist of making the focus of Euro-Mediterranean relations human factors rather than goods and capital. The Euromed civil forum considers the social and economic assessment of the partnership to be negative overall: we should heed the critics! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All the organisations fighting for democracy in this country, however, support the idea of this association agreement. This, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and President-in-Office of the Council, goes to show the tremendous hope generated by this agreement, as well as the scale of the challenges we must accept in order to respond to these numerous expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution submitted to us on which we shall vote at the same time as the association agreement is a relatively comprehensive text – and I would congratulate the rapporteur on that, moreover – which addresses numerous problems that Lebanon must now face in order to play the role we expect it to play to ensure the stabilisation of the situation throughout the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Verts/ALE Group has duly contributed to this and we, together with other Members, in fact, would like to add a few points that we feel are important today. First of all, we would like to invite, to call on the Lebanese Government to ensure respect for the rights of refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, who are present on Lebanese soil, and to cease all kinds of discriminatory measures in particular against Palestinian refugees. We would also like the Commission and the Council to ask Syria and Israel officially for information on Lebanese nationals who are being held in these states. According to the information provided to us by Solidar, whose spokesman, moreover, was invited to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Israel is allegedly holding 12 Lebanese nationals and 200 nationals of other countries are allegedly being held secretly in Syria. I believe the European institutions can help to shed light on this matter, which weighs heavily on relations within the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Verts/ALE Group in the European Parliament would also like to draw the attention of the House to the pressure exerted on the Lebanese press. We call for strict respect for the freedom of the press, in all its forms, moreover, in particular for journalists or other media that criticise government policy. We call for this country to respect the right of the opposition, which we all know receives extremely poor treatment. Lastly, we call for the Members of the Lebanese Parliament to be associated with and play an active part in the work of the fora of the future Euro-Mediterranean assembly. That is clearly a condition if we understand that this agreement with Lebanon is even more important in stabilising the region and finding a solution to the problems in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this association agreement constitutes a challenge, which we must meet. I believe that its effect would be greater if we were in possession of all the instruments necessary to monitor, follow, propose and assess, regularly and seriously, in particular the implementation of Article 2 of this association agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all happening at a time when plenary is being led by a colleague of same nationality, which is making this sitting a veritable Greek political Olympiad, which I am delighted to share in.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Parliament today has the task of delivering its opinion on the conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States on the one hand and the Republic of Lebanon on the other. This agreement clearly forms part of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership launched by the Barcelona Declaration of 1995, whose progress we have a duty to promote, despite the uncertainties in the political situation in that region with regard to peace and security. One of the most noteworthy aspects of the process opened in Barcelona is that it enables complementarity to be established between the dimension of bilateral cooperation involving the Member States with Mediterranean connections, including Spain, France, Italy and Portugal – although Portugal borders the Atlantic, it has significant economic and geographical links with the Mediterranean countries of the Maghreb – and the multilateral dimension taken on by the European Community, which can and must mutually strengthen one another.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt, Mr President, that, to a large extent, the stability of the Mediterranean region, and in particular of the Middle East, depends on appropriate partnerships for economic, political, social and cultural development, for which the Union is particularly suited. Other types of problem remain, however, which are today entirely undeniable, especially concerning security and the fight against terrorism, but also concerning the fight against corruption and money-laundering as well as promoting democracy and human rights which, in the particular case of Lebanon, are a cause for concern. This is why we believe the questions raised by Mr Brok, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to be of the greatest relevance and to require tangible and consistent answers from both the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the fact that the political leanings of the Lebanese authorities are still dominated by Syria and that Damascus has a decisive influence over the position of the Lebanese Government in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, despite the Israeli army’s withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in May 2000. Unlike Lebanon, whose government has fortunately been moving towards democracy and the separation of powers, despite its obvious institutional weaknesses and intricate political and religious imbalances, Syria is a dictatorship, with a singularly Monarchist bias, which has remained technically at war with Israel since the Six-Day War, with all the dangers that this situation entails for the Middle East peace process. Even worse, it maintains a significant military force in Lebanon, of around 30 000 men, in addition to the 300 000 immigrants there, who work mainly in farming and construction.</p>
<p class="contents">If we add to this presence – or perhaps we should call it an ‘occupation’ several more Palestinian refugees, who are by and large poor and poorly integrated into Lebanese society, constituting around 3.5 million people, and the presence in the country’s parliament of Hezbullah, the extremist movement – since it cannot be called anything else – it is easy to understand Lebanon’s delicate situation, to which the Union must be attentive and in which it must play a moderating role in order to achieve peace, security and development. This Euro-Mediterranean partnership is all the more important at a time when the Union is enlarging into Central and Eastern Europe and will be focusing the lion’s share of its financial resources there.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that Europe is or should be polycentric: it is Nordic, Mediterranean, and Atlantic; it is also ultraperipheral and certainly continental. It is, however, by balancing its components and respect for its diversity that it will become a Europe that is more democratic, safer, more developed and definitely more respected on the international scene. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As recently as at the last European Council, the Council of Copenhagen, the Council again acknowledged Israel’s legitimate concerns about her security. The Council also committed itself to the fight against international terrorism. The two central points of the foreign policy of EU Member States are not compatible with the power base that Hezbollah is forming in Lebanese politics. It is not for nothing that Southern Lebanon is known as ‘Hezbollahland’ these days. The party of Allah has been lord and master ever since Israel’s military withdrawal from the border area in May 2000. This Shiite terror organisation has built up an impressive military presence thanks to the combined cooperation of Syria and Iran. Including a large arsenal of missiles within range of the whole of the north of the Jewish state. All within easy reach of Lebanese Islamicists who unremittingly and openly advocate the physical destruction of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The attention being paid to the depressing situation on Israel’s northern border in the present resolution of this Parliament deals with the cause and effects and ignores the political reality in situ. This European unease will not upset Hezbollah. The party of Allah is simply not mentioned. How does the Council view that? I would like to ask the Greek Presidency what steps it intends to take against Hezbollah in Beirut, Damascus and Teheran. Diplomatic inactivity gives the EU absolutely no credibility as a peace broker in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Hezbollah is just as unlikely to be intimidated when it comes to direct and indirect involvement in terrorist activities against the state of Israel, including forming terrorist cells amongst Israeli Arabs and complete identification with the second Palestinian intifada. Or, as the secretary-general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, puts it: the intifada in Palestine now forms their front line.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, if the common fight against terrorism is to have real credibility, the EU must immediately place Hezbollah on its list of terrorist organisations – hence my amendment – and the Lebanese authorities must assert their authority over the whole country. Only these measures will have the effect of stabilising the whole region and promoting peace in it, as they simultaneously send a signal to the destabilising regimes. A powerful stance such as this would also set the right tone for the negotiations on the EU’s future relationship with Damascus and Teheran.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise the European institutions would only be paying lip service to the bare fact of Israel’s existence and the global fight against terrorism. Until such time as the EU shows that it is taking these points very seriously in its relations with these countries, I will vote against an Association Agreement with Lebanon. What makes me even more resolute in my stance is that the European institutions are demanding virtually no genuine guarantees from Beirut regarding the observance of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were made as welcome by the Lebanese press as by such well-known figures as the Maronite patriarch Monsignor Sfeir, or the former Head of State Mr Amin Gemayel. How can we fail to feel considerable affection for this refined, friendly people that has overcome with great courage the suffering of almost twenty years of frequently horrific foreign and civil war? It should encourage us to consider the dangers of removing borders when, in Lebanon, the refugees have begun to speak as if they were running the country. Consider also the risks posed by many aspects of the multicultural society that some would like to see developing at all costs in Europe, where it did not exist until now.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle we are in favour of developing relations with this country of great culture and ancient traditions, that is so close to Europe in general, and in particular the French-speaking tradition that I, amongst others, represent here. We can only deal, however, with a sovereign State, a peaceful, honest and impartial State.</p>
<p class="contents">A sovereign State naturally means the withdrawal of the Syrian troops, whose presence is no longer justified, as almost all the previous speakers have said, since the Israeli occupation ended in southern Lebanon. The resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, in particular, should be followed by practical action and this withdrawal should be complete, just as Syrian pressure on Lebanese domestic policy should cease.</p>
<p class="contents">A peaceful State means an end to the repression, also mentioned by other speakers, practised against students, political dissidents, and Christians in particular. That means that certain post-war procedures or processes, which could legitimately be described as Stalinist, should cease; that the general amnesty should be extended to all. Saying this, I am thinking in particular of the terrible fate of the former leader of the Lebanese forces, Samir Geagea, the only leader of a faction to have taken part in these conflicts who has now been in prison, on military premises, in a building with no light, for eight years. Nobody there understands, or rather everyone understands only too well, why Samir Geagea is in prison, while the leader Walid Jumblatt, whose excesses were every bit as bad as the worst offenders in this conflict, occupies a quasi-official post.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, an honest, impartial State means an end to the political racketeering that results all too often from reconstruction in this country ravaged by war. These are the three conditions for the agreement that we want with all our hearts to reach optimum effectiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was the occasion when the Palestinians were expelled from Jordan by King Hussein and swept into the Lebanon, destroying what had been up till then a haven of relative peace and civilisation in the Middle East. It had, from the point of view of the visitor, whether a journalist or a tourist, three great advantages: the charm of the Lebanese people, the fact that the electricity and water had been put in by the British and that the cuisine had been installed largely by the French.</p>
<p class="contents">On my most recent visit there I was encouraged to see that those three great traditions are reasserting themselves in the rebuilding of that country. It is, as the Commissioner has said, undergoing this process of rebuilding in possibly the most difficult times, especially from the economic point of view. But I am confident, as are many other Members of this House who know the Lebanon well, that the energy and the determination of the Lebanese people will win through. They have survived the past in an extraordinary fashion and remained civilised and perennially charming. It is very important that we maintain the closest links, as the previous speaker mentioned. The francophone connection is only one of many which we have between the members of the European Union and the rest of the Middle East. The Lebanon is a focal point from which we can operate and through which we can operate.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward in the not too distant future to returning to Beirut, a city of which I have the fondest memories, but also to welcoming more people from the Lebanon, especially parliamentarians, here. We can do so much by example that it is important for this House to maintain these links.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would point out that it was always through the Lebanon that many of the contacts were made with the other Middle Eastern countries. With the tensions that we have in the Middle East at the moment, it is essential for us to maintain those links, especially for the Commissioner who, no doubt, has fallen in love with the Lebanon in the same way as many of us have, and for the Commissioner to be able to use the Lebanon as a bridge through which he can talk to sensible, democratically-minded people in the other countries of the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that the European Union has negotiated with an official Lebanon, a somewhat theoretical Lebanon, not to say mythical, that the situation in Lebanon today is sadly still a long way from the idyllic visions that some wish to use in order to justify the agreement, and that, fortunately, our debate re-establishes the harsh reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Lebanon is a State whose independence still poses problems today. More than ten years after the Taïf agreements, the Israelis have withdrawn but the Syrians remain and are still very present in a country over which they maintain a protectorate and whose independence they have never really recognised. The warlords remain, there is still no Rule of Law or free media, as we saw again just recently at the last summit of French-speaking countries, drug-trafficking and corruption remain, and terrorist bases, in particular, as has been pointed out, Hezbollah bases, still remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are therefore in a paradoxical situation, because an assessment of the Lebanese situation gives rise to a whole string of reasons that would be cause to suspend the agreement if it existed and was still operational. That is the paradox we face today. Is there a need for an association? An association, Mr President, can only exist between two parties. Does the European Union currently have a fully credible partner? Unfortunately that is still in doubt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been many years of war with Syria but also with Israel, with external interference and invasions, which have not yet been definitively settled; also a civil war which has devastated social and family relationships, though the International Community’s neglect has done damage too. Lebanon’s rebirth could lie in that strength which previously was its weakness: the intertwining of cultures and religions, rooted in the country but different from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lebanese Government should be acknowledged for having managed to maintain a balance between the parties and for wishing to rebuild a sovereign country in a difficult democratic process, because there are still clear violations of freedom of expression, human rights, social inequality and corruption. In particular, I am referring to the situation of the Palestinian refugees, who have been prohibited by law from having any opportunity to work, for healthcare or for travel and it is hypocritical of the Lebanese to assert that this is because the refugees have to return to Palestine. In this connection, when developing relations and projects with Lebanon, we have to persevere and find means to ensure compliance with the agreements and commitments which are made, even if the example of the EU-Israel Agreement and Israel’s blatant violation of Article 2, certainly do not provide a guarantee that this will be respected. I nevertheless consider it extremely important for this step to be taken, in the clear and certain knowledge that it is essential to help rebuild this country; but it is essential that this country is rebuilt on the clear basis of freedom of expression and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although Europe is Lebanon’s main trading partner and one of the important backers supporting its economic modernisation programme, it also guarantees respect for fundamental rights on the road to establishing democratic freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of expression has once more been seriously attacked, as shown by the enforced closure of the television channel MTV last September for having allowed the opposition to speak at the time of the by-elections. The confirmation of this decision by the courts only serves to increase concerns over this situation. The deregulations of the legal system do not encourage respect for freedom of expression as the courts are increasingly instrumentalised in order to act as means of applying pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">More than 17 000 people have disappeared since the beginning of the Lebanese war. Ten years after the end of the conflict, no serious enquiry has been carried out to discover what happened to them. Some were probably executed in Lebanon, but no search has been undertaken for the bodies. It also seems that the victims of kidnapping were handed over to Syria and then transferred to Syrian prisons. The association of families was recently received by the Syrian authorities, who promised them an enquiry but have done nothing as yet. The Lebanese authorities, for their part, remain silent. Public opinion is increasingly calling for the total withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Their presence, in addition to corruption within the Lebanese political class, contributes to maintaining a climate of instability dominated by a catastrophic economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent the democratic clause from being nothing more than a dead letter, it is vital to establish mechanisms for the regular monitoring and assessment of its implementation, from the very entry into force of the agreement, in partnership with the NGOs that are close to daily reality. In this country where fundamental rights and democratic freedoms are often ignored, Lebanon’s people are placing great hope in these agreements as they represent an essential means of pressure for the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The signing of the Euro-Mediterranean Accession Agreement with Lebanon is, without doubt, an important move in furthering our strategy to create a free trade zone in the Mediterranean and a zone of peace, security and sustainable development for all its citizens. I think we can take an optimistic approach to cooperation with Lebanon. Lebanon is a country with a history of being open to the outside world, a country which looks to Europe and European culture; it has cooperated with the European Union since 1978, even though the Union went by another name at that time. However, we must bear in mind that Lebanon is in the middle of reconstruction, both economic and social and ideological reconstruction, following the civil war. Anyone visiting Lebanon has the distinct impression that it is still in search of cohesion and an identity. At the same time, it is an interesting experiment in the coexistence of different cultures and religious communities and we need to back this experiment if it is to succeed. I think that the Accession Agreement will help Lebanon consolidate the rules of the burgeoning free market, democracy and economic and social development. At the level of the European institutions and Member States, we need to make full use of the potential of this agreement and give Lebanon the chance to participate in cultural exchange programmes and galvanise its civil society. At the same time, we need to start improving the human rights situation, as numerous previous speakers have said, and the situation of the 350 000 Palestinian refugees there.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore all in favour of the references in the draft agreement to promoting the role of women in economic and social development through education and vocational training and facilitating economic investment. Unfortunately, these references alone are not enough to bring about real progress in respect for women’s rights and I am sorry that neither the President-in-Office nor the Commissioner made any reference to this issue. May I remind you that the European Parliament called in a resolution on respect for women’s rights within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation for an express provision on the protection of women’s rights, together with a policy for monitoring that protection, similar to the provision applied to the candidate countries which are now about to join the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, we urge the European Commission to introduce progress monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and to call on the Lebanese Government – and this should apply in all association agreements – to demonstrate the political will needed to carry out the legislative, administrative and other reforms needed to anchor equality between men and women in the law and to mainstream gender equality in all its policies, thereby paving the way for the development we all wish on Lebanon and good cooperative relations with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for adding some very detailed and useful comments on aspects of the situation on the ground in Lebanon and the policies of the European Union and the Commission’s efforts in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is that Lebanon was hit by tragedy about twenty years ago. Today we have a very different country which is struggling hard to overcome huge structural problems. Lebanon forms part of the whole puzzle of the Middle East and part of European policy on Mediterranean countries. It is on our very doorstep and obviously we have a keen interest. Because of these two aspects, the European Union and the Council are keeping a very close eye on it and supporting its new policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I have made careful note of what was said about human rights, and disappearances in particular, and I shall inform the Council accordingly. However, I would point out that we are trying to include neighbouring countries, such as Syria, in efforts on the human rights front, precisely so that we can deal with these issues more efficiently and influence developments in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Hezbollah are concerned, may I say that the Council pays a great deal of attention to terrorist issues at its regular meetings and discussions on the Middle East. As you know, a great many measures and a great many decisions have been taken. The Council weighs all the factors very carefully and I am sure that, as and when it judges that it is expedient and necessary to do so, it will take stronger action. It has already made a number of moves.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by saying that an association agreement is an important tool. It can have a significant impact, but only under certain conditions. These conditions are that there must be a functioning economy, there must be a strong productive sector, there must be employment, there must be confidence and there must be the potential for cooperation. Where there are armed conflicts and insecurity, it obviously will not have the same results. However, what we are trying and aiming to do is precisely to use multiple means of cooperation, of which the association agreement is one, to do our best to support developments in the area, prosperity and better prospects for the area and relations with a country which belongs to the Mediterranean, which belongs to an area on our very doorstep. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
