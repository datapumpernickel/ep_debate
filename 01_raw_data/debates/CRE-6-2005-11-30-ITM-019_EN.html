<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission has been reviewing Council Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 applying EU competition rules to liner shipping for the past three years. After extensive consultation with carriers, transport users, Member States and third countries, we believe that the ability that shipping lines have to fix prices and regulate capacity is no longer justified in today’s market circumstances. The current exemption is unique. No other economic sector – even those that directly compete with liners – benefits from such a generous exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">Collective price-fixing and capacity regulation are by definition hard-core restrictions to competition. These types of restriction have as their goal the artificial maintenance of high prices. Participants in such a cartel may benefit. Their customers most certainly do not. And nor does the wider economy. The present system can only be explained in an historic context.</p>
<p class="contents">Price-fixing by liner conferences actually results in higher prices for exporters. EU shipping lines are faring well. Four out of the top five world carriers are EU based. Yet our exporters repeatedly draw our attention to the need to stop allowing price-fixing.</p>
<p class="contents">As regulators, our duty is to ensure that the rules are in tune with market conditions. The exemption from competition rules for liner conferences is a relic of the past. The last twenty years have seen considerable changes in the liner market, with an increase in cooperative arrangements between shipping lines in the form of consortia and global alliances that do not include price-fixing. This goes to show that conferences are not central to the continued good health of the maritime industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector is important for the health of the economy as a whole. Scheduled services in container transport account for approximately 40% of the EU-25’s external trade by sea in value terms. Today, conferences are allowed to fix prices on all major shipping routes and these prices are generally assumed to act as a benchmark for prices on all shipping routes to and from the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the benchmark effect of the conference tariff, an average of 30% of the price of transport is made up of charges and surcharges jointly fixed by lines participating in conferences and the same levels of charges are very often applied by non-conference carriers. This means that 18% of imports and 21% of EU-25 exports are affected by carriers’ ability to jointly fix prices in the liner conference block exemption. These figures show how important it is to unleash further competitive forces in the liner sector, much in line with the Lisbon Agenda and in keeping with the goal to transform Europe into the most competitive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the work carried out by Parliament in reacting to the Commission’s White Paper of October 2004. I welcome in particular Parliament’s recognition that the rules for the sector must comply with Article 81.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the concern in certain quarters about the consequences of abolishing the conference block exemption. What does abolition of conferences mean? It means reliance on market mechanisms to determine price and capacity as in all other sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have carried out an extensive economic impact assessment: three independent studies were commissioned. The results show that if shipping lines are no longer allowed to operate as a cartel, that is likely to result in lower transport costs to the benefit of exports throughout the EU and with a positive impact on developing countries. Service quality and innovation are likely to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">A more competitive environment should allow EU carriers to compete and grow. Smaller carriers will also have an opportunity to grow if they follow an innovative business model. No impact is foreseen on employment or in investment in new vessels. Both carriers and shippers recognised that the most recent study by Global Insight was of a high standard and that its results were based on thorough research.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the solid backing of the European Shippers’ Council representing more than 100 000 European exports from the smallest to multinationals. We have the support of UNICE. The liner industry itself is more divided. This is only to be expected as the industry has been insulated from competition and benefited from a legalised cartel. But even so, much of the industry now accepts that the future must be based on competition and that the days of special regimes are counted.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, as regulators we have to look at the larger picture. Our concern is the competitiveness of EU industry. This includes shipping lines as well as their clients, our exporters. If we look at the majority of shipping lines, price-fixing is becoming less and less relevant to their business strategies as they seek more effective ways of ensuring their survival in a changing and challenging environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to assure Parliament that the Commission pays great attention to the international implications of any regulation that touches the shipping industry. We are aware that liner conferences are tolerated in other jurisdictions and have engaged in bilateral contacts so as to ensure that our partners are aware of whatever changes are brought to our legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission is firmly convinced of the benefits of putting an end to the conference system, it is equally convinced of the need to give the industry sufficient time to adapt to a fully competitive market. I intend to put a proposal to the College of Commissioners for the repeal of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86, including a substantial transition period before the conference system is abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission is committed to better regulation and to the Lisbon Agenda. I believe that abolishing the conference system will make the application of competition rules to the maritime sector simpler, more cost effective and fairer. Abolition of the conference system will bring significant opportunities. I am confident that both the liner industry and its clients will reap the benefits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wanted to thank the European Commission for its willingness to cooperate throughout the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the initiative to draft the White Paper. It gives us the opportunity to evaluate the current situation and to study the real challenges to European shipping in relation to the competitiveness of the European Union and the Lisbon objectives. That is why the report which I am presenting to you takes account of the proposals in this White Paper and of the demands of the White Paper for transport and the trends emerging in the international environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The bone of contention on which my honourable friends focused their attention was scheduled services between ports in different Member States or between the European Union and third countries, especially the conference system. I shall not comment specifically on this, because the Commissioner set the conference framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Over all these years the conferences have safeguarded efficient services and price stability on the market, contributing to the development of European and international trade, to the good health – to use the Commissioner's expression – of the maritime industry, providing the opportunity – and this is important to us – for all sizes of shipping companies to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, it is right that we should look at the adjustment of the system to new circumstances by revising Regulation 4056/86, a review that will allow flexibility, price competitiveness, stability and quality services and will allow real competition, in that, in one way, it will be protected from the dominion of the oligopolies. There are clear tendencies to merge to create colossal companies which can impose their terms and conditions on trade and industry. The top three European companies account for 35% of the world fleet, while at the same time new maritime powers have emerged, such as China, South Korea and Taiwan. None of the studies presented by the European Commission convinces us that these fears are unfounded, nor have they convinced us of the important benefits which trade and industry might reap from the abolition of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal is that the European Commission should not propose the abolition of the regulation and should continue the dialogue with the interested parties, both carriers and shippers. It should propose a review of the existing system, mainly by excluding the facility for freight rates to be fixed directly at the conferences, but allowing indicative prices to be set on the basis of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and calculating additional loading and despatch charges transparently and following dialogue with shippers.</p>
<p class="contents">We also propose, irrespective of the solution selected, that provision should be made for a transitional period which will allow all the factors to be adjusted. </p>
<p class="contents">To close, I wish to call on the European Commission to take account, when processing its proposal, of the legal and operational systems which apply in other countries, such as the United States of America, Australia, Canada and Japan, because a deviation in the European system could create destabilising trends at global level and bring about protectionist action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What you have said may well be true of firms like Maersk, the little outfit that has just bought up PNO, but what primarily interests me, and Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou too, is what happens to the small and medium-sized shipping lines whose situation is quite different from that of PNO, and have not been bought up by Maersk or by any of the other big players whom you might care to name.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our belief that Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 cannot be deleted without being replaced. Yes, of course, Commissioner, it must be adapted; that much is perfectly clear, and we all know it. It has to be adapted, and the principal object of the exercise must be to do so in such a way that the small and medium-sized companies are enabled to reach agreements on technical matters and to exchange information in order to be able to see where they stand the best chance of succeeding on the world market. That, Commissioner, is something to which you have paid no attention.</p>
<p class="contents">A group calling itself the ‘European Liner Affairs Association’ has come up with some good proposals, which contain not only a markedly more limited exemption, but also unambiguous rules to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. There is actually a proposal for the opening of discussion forums with participation not only by shipping lines but also by shippers and the other stakeholders in the sector. We do not want price-fixing any more than we want hostile cartels, and you must never suggest that my colleague Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou does! What we want is technical agreements that make it possible for small and medium-sized enterprises to survive in shark-filled waters, that is to say, alongside the big conglomerates and alliances. If such discussion forums are facilitated, there really is a chance of our managing to keep the small and medium-sized shipping industry afloat.</p>
<p class="contents">It simply has to be clear to us that, even though our big players dominate business worldwide, we do also have good reason to fear attacks by the Koreans and the Chinese shipping lines. This, Commissioner, is where we have to do something for European shipping! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission will be presenting its legislative proposal next Wednesday. Is it already ready? We can only hope that the echoes of our debates will reach the Commission nevertheless. It would be a pity if they did not, because the report we have before us, late as the hour sadly is, is of a high standard. I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa for the quality of her report and for her courtesy.</p>
<p class="contents">No one here disputes that healthy competition needs to be introduced into maritime transport, where most of the players are private operators. Do we need to go so far as total deregulation, however? That would be to overlook the changes that have taken place in the last few years and to deny the benefits of the present system. As a result of the Court of Justice’s and the Commission’s decisions, maritime conferences have in fact ceased to be cartels. They play a useful role, ensuring the stability and quality of the service and strengthening maritime safety through the regular renewal of fleets. They also guarantee the diversity of operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the present system can still be improved. The exchange of information could be rationalised. There is also a need for clear rules for calculating excess loads. On the other hand, it seems to us dangerous to repeal Regulation 4056/86 without proposing even a provisional replacement. Simply abolishing the present system would accelerate concentration in the sector. Reducing the number of operators could have a negative effect on services to some ports and on prices. We understand review to mean ‘improvement’ not ‘repeal’. That is the message that Parliament should be sending to the European Commission and the Council with this report. We hope it will be heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite it being a majority, it is striking how many Members abstained from the vote; 20 voted in favour, 7 against and there were no fewer than 19 abstentions. Needless to say, I was, despite the outcome, very disappointed about that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore beg to differ with the previous speakers. Article 81 of the Treaty stipulates that cooperatives that distort the market are not compatible with Community law. Paragraph 3 of the same article formulates, however, a number of exceptions which must be met in order to allow those cooperatives to go ahead after all. On that basis, a block exemption shall apply to the liner trade under Regulation 4056/1986. The Commission has launched an inquiry into the question to what extent this block exemption is still admitted in 2005. Are the conditions of Article 81 (3) still being met? The Commission has reached the conclusion that that is not the case and would thus like to review the rules. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the Commission in this, and our Amendment 10, among others, is evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 9, the rapporteur flags that the four cumulative conditions of Article 81(3) are only partly being met. At the same time, the rapporteur calls for the enforcement of a cooperative. This raises some question marks, to put it mildly. After all, if the conditions are only partly being met, we can quite clearly state that they are not being met, because the four conditions are really cumulative in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament were concerned about the impact a possible review may have on the shipping companies of the SME sector. What businesses are we talking about then? The likes of Pino Nedlloyd, Hapag Lloyd, APL, MYK? To include these businesses under the heading of SMEs is, to my mind, going too far.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission has taken this on board and commissioned a study, among other things, to clarify the impact on the so-called smaller businesses. This study has now been published and what is the conclusion? The repeal of the regulation leads to lower transport prices and better service, and smaller shipping companies have not experienced any drawbacks. This stands to reason, for the SME sector is mainly on the side of the consumers and shippers. However, if Amendment 17 is anything to go by, both the Group of the European People’s Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament remain unconvinced.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to call on my fellow Member to have another careful look at paragraph 1. According to the text before us, the objective of the review is to maintain and extend the European line trade sector in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy. This strikes me as a misconception. The objective of this review, as indeed that of the Lisbon Strategy, is to create a competitive climate in which the sector can operate as efficiently and effectively as possible. It has never been the intention to protect the sector on the basis of improper arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask my fellow Members to have another closer look at the amendments – namely Amendment 1 to 14 – that I have tabled together with the Group of the Greens; I probably did this against my better judgment, but I did it all the same. In this respect, the Commission does deserve more support than it is currently getting. Finally, unlike the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, I wholeheartedly endorse Commissioner McCreevy’s conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within maritime transport, the situation is characterised by a few large companies making a packet, precisely because there are price agreements in this area. There is no free competition. This is a peculiar feature of the EU system, and a regrettable one when it comes to maritime transport, which could become a good alternative to air and road transport if prices were fairer.</p>
<p class="contents">If prices are to be regulated at all, it must be in order to take due account of the environment or of employees. It is not with that kind of price regulation that we are concerned in this case. What we have here are some of the richest people in the EU, including Greek and Danish ship owners. It is they who take the lion’s share because of a lack of competition and excessively high prices. That they are doing this is obvious, and we can also see who is involved. The Verts/ALE Group supports the Commission or, to be more precise, that part of the Commission that is present in this Chamber, against the Transport DG, and we very much hope that the most important amendments will go through. If Amendments 3 and 12 are adopted, the Verts/ALE Group will be able to support the report. Otherwise, we shall, emphatically, not be able to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, the same monopoly business groups are calling for a change to Regulation 4056/86 and the European Commission also agrees with this approach, repeating the same argument, namely that these changes are necessary in order to provide users with cheaper services. However, life itself has shown us that the major monopoly business groups which participate in maritime transport have emerged as the winners and the workers have emerged as the losers from this entire procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, things have changed. Companies are merging or buying each other out. Behemoths are being created which impose their terms; in other words, we have a monopoly situation. Today mergers and concentrations of capital in this specific sector have progressed to the point at which, essentially, a few companies – which you can count on the fingers of one hand – control scheduled transport. Typical examples are a European-owned shipping company which operates 550 ships and an Asian-owned company which operates 112 ships. To talk of competition under such circumstances is pure hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">For cabotage, despite the fact that Regulation 4056/86 has been overtaken by Regulation 3577/92, we do not agree that domestic transport should be integrated into competition rules because, to judge from experience in my country, with its island configuration, the repercussions are dangerous, both for seamen and for island residents.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sector was excluded from certain provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community by means of a Council Regulation. In particular, the sector was excluded from Article 81, which prohibits the conclusion of competition-limiting agreements, and from Article 82, which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p class="contents">I would note that our work and deliberations on this report, which focuses on Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86, are concerned with issues that have been dealt with in a separate legal opinion drafted in November 2005 at the request of the European Commission. As I see it, therefore, it would be reasonable to examine the conclusions of this new analysis in some detail before taking any further decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We should exercise great caution in taking any subsequent steps, and avoid any premature or rash decisions. Such caution is all the more warranted given that any changes we make might fail to comply with the standards of the European Union’s partners, or in other words the USA, Australia, Japan and Canada. This would pose a threat to the stability of economic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to alert Members to another important point, namely that any changes in this sector could have an adverse impact, especially on small and medium-sized shipping lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has already been said, the exemption for liner conferences has traditionally given balance to the maritime sector, but it is also true that the decline in conferences has been made obvious by the figures on individual shipments – the 1994 law – and by the appearance of effective and independent major carriers.</p>
<p class="contents">In general nowadays, freight rates decrease when demand falls and increase when supply is limited, and it is well-known that conference agreements do not seem to have made it possible to impose coordinated increases on shipments affected by a decrease in demand.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to abolish the prior fixing of freight rates – which is the principal effect of conferences – is sensible and therefore to be welcomed. It is necessary, however, to be vigilant and to check that, when all is said and done, this does not mean that ports of call are cut out or are selected exclusively on the basis of shipowners’ interests, and that it does not bring about an artificial decrease in freight rates. This is already happening in consolidated trading practices: we know that Chinese exporters are arriving in Europe with negative quotations for their goods but are making up the GAP differential through the payment of exorbitant selling rights on handover which are then transferred back to the same Chinese exporter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary, therefore, to pay very close attention and to monitor any aspects of artful liberalisation practices – as they could become – if our mutual aim is to have a competitive European merchant shipping sector along the lines drawn by Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am committed to finding a balanced solution, one which furthers the interests of both shippers and carriers. I believe that the way forward is to repeal Council Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86, which would lead to lower prices and would not negatively affect carriers.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be important to continue discussions with the liner industry. This should ensure that the few positive effects of the conference system are retained.

On this basis, I believe we can find a fair and reasonable way forward to the benefit of liner carriers and of the EU economy as a whole, and one which all participants in the market can support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
