<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swiebel (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>The annual report on human rights in the European Union engenders many differences of opinion and much confusion every year. There are two problems causing this. Firstly, it is not easy for any Member of this Parliament who has been elected on a national list, but who wants to be re-elected, to agree with criticism about his or her own country. If they wanted to act in accordance with their own consciences, they would have to distance themselves somewhat from national and party political loyalties, and that is sometimes expecting too much. Secondly, until recently it was unclear which human rights these reports were actually supposed to be about. What is the yardstick; what are the terms of reference?</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, various rapporteurs have made their own selections from the problems, and that has not always benefited continuity and credibility. The decision by the committee mainly responsible and by Parliament as a whole to make the Community Charter of Fundamental Rights the starting point for these reports was therefore a good one. The European Parliament’s control function is of a political and not a legal nature, however. For the purpose of these annual reports, therefore, we must view the Charter as a political reference framework, a sort of table of contents. That gives us the scope to use this Charter to check whether the Member States are observing the provisions relating to human rights, which are in fact binding and which are included in innumerable conventions of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the ILO etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights are universal, indivisible and interrelated. The human rights discourse is by definition global. The European Union’s human rights policy is therefore only credible if human rights violations at home are measured against the same yardsticks as failings elsewhere in the world. The European Parliament speaks out against specific human rights problems elsewhere at every session, and correctly places great store on human rights in discussions about the candidate countries. We must, however, take an honest look at ourselves as well. That is why I have consciously chosen the naming and shaming approach in my report. It may not be pleasant but it is certainly honest.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a community of values. We hear that ad nauseam. We must also be willing, however, to regard serious human rights violations in one or more Member States as a European matter and to ask ourselves what the European Union as such can contribute towards improving the situation. That is why the recommendations in my report are not only aimed at one, several or all the Member States; they are also aimed at the Commission and the Council where applicable. I am delighted, as usual, to see Commissioner Vitorino sitting here again, but I am naturally disappointed that the Council is conspicuous by its absence – or perhaps there is an official hidden under the seat.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the main human rights problems in the European Union? I name some of them and I pose a number of specific questions relating to them. First and foremost, there is the risk of civil rights being compromised in the regrettably necessary fight against terrorism. It is therefore important to couple specific legislation with a sunset clause and to list and evaluate these anti-terrorism measures. My question is: are the Commission and the Council willing to list and evaluate them in this way?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, misconduct on the part of police and prison staff, which we observe year in, year out and in which the most vulnerable groups are often the victims, happens in all EU countries to a greater or lesser degree. Internal correction mechanisms are not particularly effective. In my opinion, the time has now come for this problem to be placed on the agenda of the European Union and for an extensive investigation into these abuses to be carried out at the very least. My question is: will the Commission investigate the opportunities for doing so?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, racism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination are on the increase, but protection against them is a patchwork quilt which suggests a hierarchy of forms of discrimination rather than a coherent approach. I would like to see a coherent and uniform European strategy of equal treatment. My question is: will the Commission take the lead in this?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, partly thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, I have observed a significant lack of compliance with the European Social Charter, the ILO treaties and so on by all the Member States. We need to clarify how these treaty obligations in the social sphere relate to the same Member States’ obligations under secondary Community legislation. My question is: will the Commission take the lead in this as well?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to ask the representative of the Council – who is not here, but perhaps the official who is hidden away somewhere can pass this on – what has become of the decision by the General Affairs Council in June 2001 to coordinate our internal and external human rights policies better? The Commission and Parliament itself should in fact also be able to answer this question. If you would allow me to make a final comment on Mr Ribeiro e Castro’s alternative draft proposal, I must say that I find it rather funny. You would have to be a true optimist to put forward that proposal. Anyone who supports this resolution obviously wants to shut their eyes to reality. It is a nice example of wishful thinking, but it is too good to be true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and Mrs Joke Swiebel for this opportunity to discuss the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union in 2001 in plenary today.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that has been presented to you today is a document that is both vast and ambitious, because it attempts to provide an overview of the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its Member States and because it calls on the national authorities and the European institutions to adopt practical measures. By way of example, I might mention the need to pursue a consistent policy of combating discrimination – all forms of discrimination – and of promoting integration in European societies in order to prevent demonstrations of racism and xenophobia and to protect the rights that underpin European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s Annual Report on the situation of fundamental rights in the Union is an important instrument in terms of due regard being given to these rights, both at European level and at the level of every Member State, either within the current Union or in a Union of 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, for its part, has a direct interest in the report that Parliament will be voting on, since, as Mrs Swiebel has just stated, we are also required to adopt a set of practical actions. For my own part, I give a commitment carefully to study whatever recommendations Parliament wishes to make to us, and we shall, of course, adopt the appropriate measures to ensure that these are followed up. The Commission has always been equal to the challenges Parliament has set for it and I believe that we have together taken up these challenges in a positive way, in order to develop fruitful cooperation between the two institutions in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">An excellent example of this cooperation is surely the Commission’s creation, following Parliament’s resolution of July 2001, of a network of experts in the field of fundamental rights. In this resolution, based on Parliament’s report for the year 2000, drawn up by Mr Cornillet, Parliament clearly expressed its commitment to adopting a serious and practical approach to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, calling for an appropriate control instrument to be set in place and for an assessment to be made of the situation of fundamental rights, both at Member State and European Union level. The Commission, like Parliament, is convinced that being well-informed about the state of protection of fundamental rights is crucial to our being able to assess the quality of this protection, and this assessment must always be rigorous and efficient. This is the task of the Network of Experts on Fundamental Rights. This network will enable both Parliament and the Commission to remain vigilant and to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is complied with and given due consideration. We are of the opinion that the network must be allowed to work and to start publishing its findings before we move ahead with more complex institutional solutions, such as setting up a monitoring centre.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, this network will be obliged to provide Parliament and the Commission with information on the sensitive issue of the balance between security and freedom in the context of the fight against terrorism, an area that will receive particular attention in the report that is currently being drawn up as part of the network’s work. This network of experts in the field of fundamental rights became operational in October 2002, and the report that it is drafting must take account of changes in national law, the case law of the Luxembourg and Strasbourg courts and significant case law of the constitutional and other courts of the Member States. In this context, the importance of the role that Parliament and the Commission are called on to play has two strands: on the one hand, to have an even clearer view of the situation in the field of fundamental rights in the Member States in order to adopt the actions and decisions necessary in this area in a targeted and precise way by virtue of the powers conferred on the European institutions by the Treaties; and, on the other, to show Europe’s citizens that the protection of fundamental rights is more than just a political declaration; it is a real concern of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I should like to recall that placing fundamental rights at the heart of European integration means defending the thesis that the Convention on the Future of Europe and the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference must include the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty of the Union and give it binding legal force.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is an area of freedom, security and justice which fails to provide a rigorous protection of fundamental rights. Drafting a Treaty of a constitutional nature, an authentic European Constitution, of which the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an integral part, and which at the same time and in parallel authorises the European Union to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights, is a major challenge facing us and one that we must overcome. At the same time, however, a pragmatic and effective assessment must be made of the quality of protection of fundamental rights. This report, the debate in this plenary and Parliament’s final resolution will certainly make a major contribution to the Commission’s actions over the next year in the field of fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without wishing to deny that the work carried out by Mrs Swiebel is indeed considerable, I would nonetheless like to be slightly critical of this report, as I feel it has missed its opportunity and might even serve no purpose at all.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Vitorino pointed out, last year, Parliament clearly established a number of points based on the new fact of the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we hope and pray for, to make them the preamble to a constitution. There are three points therefore: drawing up a procedure, which I shall come back to; establishing resources, either parliamentary resources or external resources which could help us, without replacing us, however, which would be available to the network of experts; and the call for joint action, in other words, in fact, to work with the three rapporteurs, namely those from the year underway, the previous year and the following year, so that a consensus might be established, provided that this work concerns facts and is therefore not, a priori, too controversial.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the idea was not followed up and I feel that this report is more a reflection of the rapporteur’s views than the extensive analysis that would have been desirable. The methodology could be summarised as follows: the whole Charter and nothing but the Charter. The whole Charter, meaning that we therefore need, first of all, an analysis carried out article by article, State by State, of which there are fifteen this year, and of which there will soon be twenty-five, providing an opportunity to check whether or not they were respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and then value by value, on the solidarity and justice chapters, making it possible to provide an overall view of these great values, to find out whether they are observed within the European Union. This is an opportunity to go beyond the strict application of the Charter with regard to the legislation of the Union of States derogating from the legislation of the Union, and Parliament had an opportunity there to acquire the power to control the actions of the States, which nobody can challenge in a Parliament, with regard to public freedom. I therefore believe some humility was needed to accomplish this painstaking task. Naturally this did not prevent the emphasis being placed on a number of subjects dear to the rapporteurs, which terrorism allowed this year, following the events of September 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole Charter, therefore, and nothing but the Charter, in other words the articles as they are and not as we might like them to be; this Charter was subject to a consensus and I should point out that the report upon which we are going to vote tomorrow has absolutely no effect on the Charter, since only a new Convention, which would have to be convened, is able to change the articles of the Charter. There are other means of action, resolutions, on occasion, directives, etc. We can also call a new Convention, as I have just said. We can also protest in our own countries since each Member State is free to go beyond the minimum standard constituted by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to criticise very briefly a certain attitude that I consider to be irresponsible and populist, and which has enabled some amendments tabled by the far left and the Verts/ALE to be reconsidered, thanks, I would say, to the complicity of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I abhor this, because by acting in this way, it has accepted things that are not found in any programme of any socialist party in any country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in brief conclusion, I would like to express my regret. Here we have a report which could have been much anticipated by the press and feared by the Member States, which could have served as a beacon to mark our position. Sadly, I am afraid that the 2001 report, which, moreover, was adopted too late, might be buried with other useless reports; as the PPE-DE does not intend to join in this burial, it will vote against it.</p>

This has historically been a conflictive report, to the shame of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In this house we are capable of deciding on a weekly basis what the human rights problems are in any corner of the world, but we are not capable of agreeing once a year on what standards should be complied with within the European Union in relation to fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The charter should be a good instrument for measuring them. We are moving in the right direction, formulas are developing so that we can work jointly with the Commission. This work involves the political control, as the rapporteur said, of the degree of compliance, in each of the Member States, with the fundamental rights in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">While this is happening, while we are evolving, we should have the generosity to do it together and to do it well. I believe Mrs Swiebel’s report is a balanced report, because it is sincere and transparent, it mentions sources, without judging them, it does not oblige us to vote against or in favour of certain facts, but it draws attention to existing complaints which the executives must investigate and assess.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out to Mr Cornillet that this report has always been controversial. Just last year, Mr Cornillet, your report, which, according to you, moved in the right direction, was approved unanimously by the Socialists and with more than one hundred votes from your own group against and only 38 in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that amongst all of us we can make an effort to find the main route to the positive development of the control of human rights within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports Mrs Swiebel’s report. We think that the report provides an important and useful survey of the situation regarding fundamental rights within our own European Union. Certainly, the issue can be raised of the scope of the report as regards both choice of subjects and political content. We can also dispute a number of the wordings and examples, but I believe we can probably learn from the work in time for next year’s report. We do not therefore agree with the basic criticism made of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">We require many other countries to comply with the demands concerning fundamental rights. That is why it is all the more important for us to examine what kind of order our own house is in. It is good to look elsewhere, but sometimes it is good to look at one’s own situation. Unfortunately, there are all too many indications in this report that the situation could have been significantly better in our own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree about the importance of doing everything in our power to combat those who would use violence and terrorism to damage the foundations of our society. There is of course a broad consensus on this issue. There is perhaps, however, cause to stand up and ask ourselves whether the end always justifies the means. Might the repressive means that the democracies are sometimes compelled to use in the fight for democracy and the open society also constitute a threat to the values we are defending? The question deserves to be asked. To make it a rule to introduce sunset clauses, that is to say time-limited legislation when it comes to this type of special legislation infringing personal privacy, is, we believe, a reasonable route to go down.</p>
<p class="contents">An adjacent and current topic that is really only indirectly related to this, namely the debate on torture in the United States, addressed by, for example, The Economist, obviously influences us too here in Europe. We Liberals also welcome open discussion of the inadequate conditions in many EU prisons, as well as of action by the police. It is my conviction that the democratic institutions are sufficiently robust to cope successfully with such a discussion. Our democracy is also strong enough to enable its expedients to be discussed openly. My own country too is criticised in this report. Mrs Swiebel’s report is important, and it is important that the debate on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism be conducted here in Parliament. Let us not therefore turn the discussion into an internal and national affair. It is about something much larger.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me in conclusion to emphasise asylum and refugee policy within the European Union. Many crimes against fundamental rights have taken place, and continue to take place, in these spheres. In particular, the children of refugees have a bad time of it, something which should cause all governments to feel ashamed. If we cannot agree on anything else, we ought in any case in this Assembly to be able to agree that all children require additional protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinion forming is important. Let us not forget that. Let us perhaps look at what happened at the weekend in the United States as evidence of the fact that opinion forming can in actual fact also be effective. We have amendments by the ELDR Group on the subjects of family relations and the concept of the family. These are by way of clarification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report points out quite correctly that seven Member States are failing to comply with the principles of the European Social Charter, for example in relation to access for foreigners to employment, their rights of assembly and trade union rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for the Committee on Social Affairs also says, there is a tendency to restrict social and economic rights within the context of reforms of the labour market. I will only comment on certain aspects, Mr President, given the time available.</p>
<p class="contents">The UNHCR also expresses its concern at the increasing tendency to link asylum seekers to possible crime and terrorism, particularly following 11 September. I believe that a common asylum and immigration policy that respects human rights is essential, as the rapporteur also points out. The repercussions of anti-terrorist measures on the Rule of Law and human rights should be assessed, above all in terms of the rights of asylum seekers and immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, every day in Spain we see a horrendous tragedy involving people who come looking for a better life.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the Committee on Petitions, by means of the report by its rapporteur, points out that family grouping, the right to asylum and free movement are daily problems in the European Union.

We consider it to be a thorough and wide-ranging piece of work that highlights many positive points about the state of human rights within the European Union, even if many parts of it make extremely uncomfortable reading.</p>
<p class="contents">As others have said, it is essential that we look at ourselves very critically, at least as carefully as we have been looking at accession countries and indeed third countries. We are critical about the human rights records of other governments, but seem very unwilling to criticise when it comes to the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick out some examples, such as the treatment of the Roma people. My country sees no problem in sending the Roma back to their countries of origin. It threatens to break up families. It lays on special chartered aircraft in order to deport them <span class="italic">en masse</span> and there is no follow-up to see what happens to them when they get back to their countries of origin. And yet we have criticised accession countries heavily for their treatment of the Roma people.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has already been made of the asylum issue. When you read the comments in the explanatory statement, about my own Member State and others, many of them are critical. The UK Government, for example, recently introduced a human rights act. All proposed legislation is to be benchmarked against that act. Yet virtually everything that comes through is stamped as being fully compatible, even though it is obviously not. I hope that in Conclusion 9, where we refer to the Commission's decision to review its own legislative proposals against the criteria of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Commission will be more rigorous in this than some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The comments about the accountability of police services make very uncomfortable reading, particularly when we are concerned with the core standards that people should expect across the European Union in, for example, the implementation of the European arrest warrant. I know that this report will be at least a recognition of some of the battles being fought in my own country by organisations such as INQUEST, where families are still trying to find out after many years what exactly happened when family members died in police custody, yet nothing is being made public and there is no proper retribution.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome many of the recommendations in this report, particularly Conclusion 5, where we are looking at this report being incorporated in future into an early warning system on Articles 6 and 7 of the European Union Treaties, picking up petitions we have also had in the Committee on Petitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, we should take a good look at ourselves before we point a finger at others. In the light of the situation the world is in, however, this statement is a long way from reality. I do not want to play down the violations of human rights in EU Member States. We need to remain vigilant so that the relatively good human rights situation in the EU does not deteriorate.</p>
<p class="contents">Any layperson can, however, see that the violations of human rights that take place here and also the human rights themselves that have been violated are of a different order from those taking place elsewhere. In Pakistan people are being sentenced to death for belonging to a religion. Mrs Swiebel mentions a political party in the Netherlands that does not admit women as members as a serious case of violation, along with the fact that it takes too long to take legal action in some states. This kind of occurrence cannot be compared with the others. At present, the reality is that Europe is imposing stricter standards on itself than on others. The very suggestion that it might be the other way round makes us lose credibility in the eyes of the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swiebel report pleads for a clear framework, preferably a constitution, as we would otherwise not be able to arrive at an independent, unambiguous assessment. In fact, this report reveals a clear political colour and the ‘values and standards’ tag that goes with it. That these standards and values are obviously not universal is demonstrated not least by the number of opponents in the committee responsible and by the alternative proposal put forward by the UEN.</p>
<p class="contents">A constitution of our own would be undesirable and unnecessary. The EU consists of solid nation states with their own perfectly good constitutions. These are contained in an existing democratic order with a process of judicial review and an involved civilian population.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union were to get a constitution of its own, this would at most be able to supplement the national Member States’ own constitutions. What is more, in Europe we have the excellent ECHR and the Court associated with it. So now we are supposed to go and review ourselves when the need arises?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a community of values, not only an economic community, as Mrs Swiebel rightly says. Our Member States’ constitutions and the ECHR prove that. The review framework and the review process already exist. We do not need a politically tinted report from the European Parliament or a European constitution for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, it seems that not everybody enjoys this freedom. As proof of this, I need only give an example from my home town of Lyon: a young historian, to whom I have already drawn your attention, Mr Jean Plantin, is currently at risk of having his suspended sentence withdrawn and becoming the first prisoner of conscience in France.</p>
<p class="contents">What crime has Mr Plantin committed? He edited a journal. A perfectly proper journal. A journal that does no harm to anyone. A serious, scientific journal. It is true that this journal freely discusses history, and in particular, what appears to be a taboo chapter in history, the history of the Second World War.</p>
<p class="contents">The interests of certain lobby groups, certain pressure groups, certain political forces and certain foreign States are so great that it is easy to understand their desire to ensure that there is an official, unilateral version of this part of history. Allow me to say, however, that the magistrates of the Court of Appeal in Lyon, in sentencing Jean Plantin, have passed a judgment which – at the very least – fails to honour our fundamental freedoms and which will go down in the annals of history as an example of the unacceptable thought-policing denounced by one of our greatest journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept that historians today might be imprisoned, as in other European countries, for their ideas, their beliefs and their analyses. This situation is absolutely intolerable, as is the withdrawal of the university degrees awarded to Jean Plantin over ten years ago. This unacceptable situation must not be allowed to continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in December 2000, was an unprecedented event in terms of the recognition of a Union which is increasingly close to the citizens and sensitive to their needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, an institution which is particularly sensitive to the issue of protecting our citizens, had no hesitation in making it the key element of its annual report on respect for fundamental rights in the Union, the aim of which is to assess the degree of compliance with the rights contained in the Charter in any particular year.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I believe that this annual resolution is a wonderful opportunity for the European Parliament to demonstrate its interest in safeguarding fundamental rights, as well as controlling their application, especially with the invaluable support of the network of experts which the Commissioner referred to and whose work I had the honour of inaugurating together with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, so that we are not hindered in this task, I believe it essential that the European Parliament tries to achieve the greatest possible degree of consensus, seeking to bring together the positions of the political groups and thereby becoming a genuine institution for controlling compliance with the fundamental rights of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must unfortunately acknowledge that this has not been the situation, quite the opposite. Opting to include party-oriented versions on issues such as the family or the treatment foreigners must receive within European territory simply overshadow the other extremely important issues referred to in the text, such as the fight against terrorism or against torture.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the report which we are to vote on in the plenary goes much further than its own objective and diverts attention from the important thing – assessing whether or not rights have been respected – towards party political issues, which consists of adopting positions on certain issues which are still under discussion within the framework of other reports and which also reflect positions which are different from that which the government of the colour of the rapporteur maintains in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore unfortunately say that my group will be obliged to vote against the report, since it is impossible to support a text which is not suited to its purpose or the continuity set by its predecessors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have only just arrived in the Parliament because of delays.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that we are able to have a debate on the fundamental rights within the European Union. It is very important, particularly when we are urging the applicant countries – and indeed countries which are not yet applicant countries – to address certain issues, that we should be prepared to look openly at ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I regret some of the statements made in the report criticising the United Kingdom and other countries, on matters to which there are no easy answers. I refer particularly to the points about asylum and immigration with regard to the United Kingdom, which is not perfect on these issues, but which is faced with a real challenge. This is not an easy situation. The United Kingdom, along with many other countries within Europe, has many applicants for asylum, and there are large numbers of people on the move, seeking to migrate from one country to the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to work towards a common European asylum policy. When this is in place, we will be able to make certain that not just the fifteen Member States, but twenty-five countries, have policies that are working and are fair to the countries themselves and to applicants.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains references (at second hand) to prison facilities in the United Kingdom and indeed in other Member States. However, it is very difficult to spend huge amounts of money on prisons when there are demands from other areas. It is indeed a mark of a civilised country that it takes its prison service seriously, and all allegations in the United Kingdom, and I imagine in other countries, against malpractice or cruelty in prisons are properly investigated. The same is true of the police service, and the British police take seriously any allegations of malpractice or racism by police officers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that we are able to have this debate, it is right that these issues are being brought to our attention, but I do not believe that the United Kingdom should be singled out any more than other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Briefly, I just want to mention and explain why the Liberal Group is seeking to remove the wording in paragraphs 83 and 84 which urges the Member States and the EU to ensure marriage is open to same-sex couples. We are certainly not opposed to this in principle, but this really is a matter for national decision, as in the Netherlands. Introducing the marriage issue distracts from the real priority, to which Liberals are absolutely committed, which is to give legal recognition to same-sex and unmarried partnerships: that really is a matter of fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can we speak of fundamental rights, however, when the right to employment and the right to a decent salary are not guaranteed because decision belongs to a moneyed minority who have the majestic power to close their businesses and plunge their employees into poverty?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the point of comments on solidarity when, in France, for example, on the pretext of security, we exacerbate laws against the poor instead of fighting poverty? The report itself illustrates what these calls for equality and dignity are worth, as it would like to increase the fight against illegal immigration on the basis that it considers this to be the source of workers who are deprived of their rights and subjected to unacceptable conditions of employment and exploitation. Why, then, does the report not propose to fight those who impose these unacceptable conditions of exploitation? Why does it not propose to fight the governments who deprive migrants of fundamental rights?</p>
<p class="contents">You speak of rights and freedoms. For the most impoverished, however, and even for the working-class majority of the population, these are hollow words. In this society, which is based on trade, money confers all the rights, including the right to crush the rights and freedoms of others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We endorse the content of the report and, above all, the courageous approach the rapporteur has adopted in naming, giving specific, practical details, the States which have violated human rights or have not signed or ratified international conventions on the protection and safeguarding of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the many issues raised in the report, as this debate shows, there are two which are particularly important and sensitive. Firstly, the concern that blindly waging war on terrorism might lead, if this has not already happened, to less care being taken to promote, protect and safeguard sacrosanct civil and human rights. In this regard, there are already people in the United States who would like to see torture legally introduced. This is a debate which greatly concerns us and which we must vigorously oppose, using the weapons of the law and legislation to oppose the weapons of violence, insofar as this can be deemed lawful.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue which the rapporteur has courageously highlighted is the recognition of same-sex marriages. In our opinion, we also need to enshrine in legislation the individual’s right to freedom in a broad sense, which is true freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">As other Members have pointed out, it will be necessary to pay greater attention to the Commission and the Council’s work in the area of human rights. We radical Members condemn the fact that, all too often, the failure of the European institutions to take action in the field of respect for human rights, both in third countries and the countries of the Union, has serious, catastrophic implications for the citizens and for the institutions themselves. Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union, and what is known as the democratic clause too, are now completely devoid of meaning, thanks, primarily, to the Council and the Commission. To put it more simply, the principle of respect for human rights and the safeguarding of human rights are wholly theoretical. Once again, as regards Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty, the European Parliament has, for the first time, used the procedure laid down in Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure to call for Community measures to be taken against Italy for the serious, ongoing violation of human rights and the rule of law with reference to the ongoing, unlawful failure to establish the plenum required by the Constitution, by the Italian Parliament and by the Constitutional Court. Violations in Italy continue to be very frequent. A few days ago, the Italian Parliament established what is known as <span class="bold">‘</span>41 <span class="italic">bis</span>’, the special incarceration regime, whose application we have documented evidence consists of genuine torture within a democracy. The Italian Prime Minister himself, Silvio Berlusconi, has declared this law to be illiberal but necessary. We will discuss this matter another time, however. Meanwhile, the radical Members will vote wholeheartedly for Mrs Swiebel’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will take these two adjectives as the basis for a number of minor points for reflection. It is certainly wide-ranging – too wide-ranging in terms of the issues addressed. Is it ambitious? It is not ambitious enough in its conclusions, which are limited to a few political objectives – the same objectives as always. Indeed, the rapporteur puts ingredients that are too different and too unrelated into a cocktail shaker in the hope that the result will be a digestible, well-balanced cocktail with an approach that can be submitted for the approval of all the Member States, an approach including shared, common principles on which legislation and positions can be based in the endeavour to guarantee the fundamental rights of all the citizens. Alongside a few principles which we support, for example in the field of combating discrimination and xenophobia, the rapporteur actually includes an undertaking which is too partisan in the section on freedom, going so far as to place in the stocks the police, the legal systems and the media of some – only some, take note – Member States for events connected with street riots caused by the Black Blocks and their supporters in white overalls.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has been influenced by bad counsel of the sort we can easily imagine – by partisan and party interests – and has wasted and bungled the opportunity she had to present a serious discussion on human rights, losing herself in empty tirades and gratuitous accusations worthy of a low-profile debate. The judges and police officers of some of the Member States are described as torturers, accused of beating up innocent people. This is a line which is unacceptable as well as out of place in such an important report as this one, just as the family model the rapporteur proposes is entirely unacceptable. It is in line with her own personal beliefs, but it contrasts with the attitude of the vast majority of Europe’s citizens, who certainly do not see homosexual unions and the right to adopt as the ideal formula on which to build the European society of tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She levels her criticisms regarding failures in the area of human rights directly at countries that are mentioned by name. The method provides a specific context for any evaluation of the human rights situation in Europe but anyone who employs such a method has an enormous responsibility for ensuring that the picture presented is an accurate one. Unfortunately, this has not entirely been the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">Item 27 gives the reader the idea that there is no viable alternative to military service in Finland. In it, Finland and Greece are called on to recognise the right of conscientious objection to military service without restriction and without reference to any religious grounds. There has been such a right in existence in Finland, however, since 1931. Under the law at present anyone obliged to do military service can in practice choose a non-military form of service. Every year approximately 2 500 people exercise this right, which is 7% of those liable. Around 80% do their military service and a little over 10% are excused.</p>
<p class="contents">The concern expressed in the report presumably refers to the fact that in Finland the period of time spent doing alternative, non-military service is twice as long as the minimum period of service. There is also concern regarding the fact that there is a total of 20 people in prison who refuse and are unwilling to fulfil their civic duties in any way. The reason why in Finland the period of time spent doing non-military service is longer is that those concerned are obliged to work eight hours a day, during a normal working week, whilst those doing military service are on duty 24 hours a day. I think that in the future it will be the task of the Finnish Parliament to get the balance right.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the vast majority of young men in Finland do military service is not because there are no alternatives to it. In Finland we still remember all too well how important a conscripted army is for the country’s independence. During the Second World War, apart from London and Moscow, Helsinki was the only capital city of a country at war that was not occupied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has no problem, for example, defending the rights of homosexuals, but has nothing to say about the right to a job, to health care, to an education, to culture or to sport. At the same time, it systematically encourages existing democratic rights to be undermined or abolished, using terrorism and illegal immigration as its pretext.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s version of human rights is set out in the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights which the Communist Party of Greece has denounced as inadequate and misleading. The report measures human rights against this charter, which is why there is not the slightest reference to the slavery introduced with new forms of work and to the decimation and commercialisation of social benefits. It has no objection to the plethora of new terrorist laws and it ignores the personal electronic files kept by the Schengen system and the fact that ideas which upset the system are passed over, distorted or even expelled and persecuted. The good thing about the report, however, is that it identifies a whole series of infringements, such as the torture of prisoners, trafficking in human beings and the suppression of rights in Genoa. Another good thing is that it calls for church and state to be separated, criticises child labour, highlights the adverse impact of measures to combat terrorism and asylum and immigration laws and discusses the social emancipation of women.</p>

In other words, European integration has been achieved on the basis of fully respecting, guaranteeing and promoting fundamental and human rights, in which the well-being and dignity of its citizens must be the inspiration and goal for every and any action taken by any Member State and by the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the importance of the European Parliament’s Annual Report on Human Rights, which has provided the ideal opportunity to take a close look at the EU’s human rights policy, within the Union and beyond it, and at the role that the European Parliament has played, of which we can be proud. Hence my disappointment with the report that has been presented; with its lack of balance and rigor.</p>
<p class="contents">The report presented to us last year by Mr Cornillet was rich in ideas and analysis and constituted a milestone and an extremely positive step towards defining a methodology for monitoring and evaluation, which should underpin any human rights policy, based of course on the European Charter covering these rights. Whilst containing aspects that deserve our support, such as the issues of terrorism, trafficking in human beings and human rights and the highly topical problem of achieving the necessary balance between security and human rights, the report we have been presented with this year<span class="bold">,</span> however, gives way in some points to demagogy and generally shies away from the rigorous principles which a resolution adopted by the European Parliament should uphold.</p>

I believe it to be a cornerstone of the work of this Parliament because it enables us to take a step back, which is so unusual here, and consider a clear, coherent policy with specific actions to achieve the goals we proclaim so often. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall not insult you by citing the various conventions and treaties that we must observe or by restating our will to anchor the Charter of Fundamental Rights unconditionally in European consciousness in order to establish the rights and freedoms of these European citizens. Each year, however, when we draw up a report on human rights, when we lament the violations that have taken place, when we adopt resolutions, we only talk about third countries. How can we have credibility and impose these rights in our relations with these countries, if we ourselves do not respect them?</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members here will be horrified at the thought of naming certain countries in this report. We must not, however, shy away from this. As democrats, we are representatives of our citizens; we are not protectors of the policies of our national governments. We must confirm, here in Parliament, that the defence of fundamental rights and freedoms in the European Union is more than just words; it affects every aspect of life, for all human beings, wherever they may be, whether or not they live in an area of freedom. Defending human rights is a duty and a right which must not be hampered by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the Member States. The purpose of this report is therefore to assess the situation. It is our role to act if this situation does not satisfy us, so that these fundamental rights might be a fact of everyday life in our own Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end on two points: first, I am very happy that economic and social rights are assessed at European level and I believe this Convention should take inspiration from that. I would then ask our Member States to do what it takes to establish clear statistics, sorted by gender, in every area, and provide them to our next rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, there is a dangerous tendency to put democratic freedoms such as freedom of expression and thought and the freedom to vote, on an equal footing with far-reaching social requirements. This weakens the basis of democracy. If all rights are equally important, no right is in the end especially important.</p>
<p class="contents">An annual report by the European Parliament is of doubtful value if it is a spectrum of subjective views. Political wish lists easily result in new topics being lighted upon instead of there being a focus upon the really fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In tackling these issues from a perspective other than that of this broad spectrum of views, I am amazed that there are no rights to good governance and democratic elections. These rights should be more to the point than many of those included in the report. It has become apparent that existing Member States too need to be reminded of them. The EU should impose sanctions on Member States that fail to uphold democratic elections and in which there is proven electoral fraud. The Convention should reflect upon these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, positive new things in the report worth mentioning. Data protection and transparency are included. Rights to these must be developed in the Treaty. Data protection and the right of access to documents are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The time is now ripe for citizens’ right to information under Article 255 of the Treaty to be made more specific.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the European Parliament has an important role to play in issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and rights. I hope that the Convention consolidates this role by creating a democratic system of decision-making and a right for people to go to court and, in certain cases, obtain damages if their rights have been infringed. The issue clearly needs to be explored further. Mrs Swiebel has made this clear. That is good, but there should preferably be a more concentrated approach next time, with the issue explored more deeply rather than just broadened out. We must clearly develop our methods for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that we in the EU are well off when it comes to respect for freedoms and rights. That is precisely why we are having this debate, that is to say with a view to constantly improving the situation, retaining a high level of protection and openly debating the deficiencies that exist. It is an important issue that affects what is most basic to a properly functioning EU – mutual trust between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not perfect. Rights are infringed, and there are failures to respect fundamental freedoms and rights, and it is not just ‘everywhere else’ that these things happen. My own country, Sweden, has, for example, been singled out in connection with a high-profile death in which the actions of the police, prosecution service and coroner have been sharply criticised. I want to make it clear that the Swedish Government had been responding to the criticism for a long time and had instituted an inquiry that was completed last year. The perspectives from which the inquiry was conducted clearly included that of citizens’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Another very important issue is that of the rights of European citizens in legal processes such as arrests. There are Member States in which people are held without trial for long periods; we must debate this issue. Our young people travel throughout Europe. No one on EU territory should need to feel anxious that their personal freedom may be infringed because of inefficiency at police stations and in prisons. We must therefore emphasise very clearly that all European citizens are guaranteed certain rights in legal processes in all the EU countries. I look forward to the Commission’s continued work on this issue and to its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Trafficking in human beings, particularly women and children, is a fact in this EU of ours. The EU is in many cases the final destination for people who, in desperation and confusion, are taken away from their home countries. It is a modern slave trade, and we must ask ourselves how that trend can be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about the fact that many EU countries accept various forms of prostitution. It turns the EU into a favourable market for traffickers in human beings throughout the world. There is an unambiguous link between human trafficking and prostitution. They are two sides of the same coin. I should have liked to have seen the report be clearer on this point.</p>

Inevitably, it makes many of us feel uncomfortable when we find our own countries being referred to as not having ratified many of the human rights conventions. On a day in which we celebrate the action of the governor of Illinois on the death penalty, I am glad to see that Mrs Swiebel congratulates the Irish Government on having finally abolished the death penalty. Of course, it has not been used for a great many years and was maintained on our statute books only for the killing of policemen. But I would particularly like to welcome her section on the rights of children. I have been a Member of this Parliament probably longer than most people here at the moment. Until the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was drawn up, the rights of children, the intrinsic rights of children, were not recognised, discussed or seen as part of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the UN optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography is also referred to. We did not consider any of these issues when we started discussing human rights and holding the annual discussion on human rights. For example, the issue of the exploitation of children on the Internet was not even a twinkle in the Commission's eye until relatively recently. It was not an area about which we actually had a great deal of knowledge or information. The section recognising these as important rights for children that have to be protected is to be warmly welcomed. I hope we will see this section enlarged as the years go by and as we discover, unfortunately, just what a dangerous world it is for many of our children. I would like to thank Mrs Swiebel for making this such an important part of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE). —</span></span>   <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mrs Swiebel’s report contains a couple of interesting points. I endorse what Mrs Banotti has just said about children’s rights. Examining this in detail in a parliamentary report is an excellent idea. I would like to add something to Mrs Swiebel’s wish to see such reports play a role in criticising and possibly punishing Member States who fail in their duties when it comes to enforcing the constitutional state and democracy. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, then the Treaty of Nice and possibly as part of the Convention, we do in fact have more opportunities to give Member States a good ticking off if they make mistakes, and even to kick them out of the Community. It would be excellent if Parliament had a role to play in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Her suggestion that the European Social Charter be compared with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is also a very good one. I think that the Charter of Human Rights should be given priority, but it is a good idea to measure everything we do against both of these charters. That must be an absolutely basic requirement. The European Parliament would then win the confidence of the Council, for example, with a view to communitisation. The Council, the people, the Member States and the parliaments of the Member States must know that we are using our powers in the proper manner. In the event of a procedural opportunity – in other words if we were to play a role in criticising Member States – I would be in favour of personally coming clean if we make a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does, however, fall short when it comes to the severity of the treatment, and could thus become a millstone in the struggle for the communitisation of the third pillar. There is, after all, no real consistency in the application of the Charter of Human Rights. You could much rather regard Mrs Swiebel’s ideology and views as a guide for assessing Member States. A country can easily be respectable even if it is criticised by Mrs Swiebel. Certainly if I read paragraph 133. If you tell the public that a climate of immunity from punishment is developing in Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, they will laugh their heads off. That really is too ridiculous for words. Nevertheless, you also cannot say – to give you yet another example of sloppiness – that unmarried couples should have the same rights as married couples. That is idiotic; it will not make you popular with unmarried couples. The fact is they do not want all these rights. I am very much in favour of promoting gay rights, but not by saying that you will also get the rights you do not want. The report is thus riddled with all sorts of examples that are also impossible from a legal point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has selectively presented a list of areas which are not only deeply controversial politically – for example, in their view of the family and of family legislation – but also demonstrably do not belong among the European Union’s areas of competence. Mrs Swiebel would have to search high and low in the UN Charter on Fundamental Rights, the European Convention’s Charter of Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights for a reason why these issues should be included in a report on fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Swiebel, does, for example, the fact that polygamy is not accepted in the European Union mean that Muslims resident in Europe are discriminated against? Is this a crime against human rights? The question no doubt needs to be answered when so many new subjects have been added to the topic of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask Mrs Swiebel why, in addressing so many new subject areas, she makes no mention, for example, of the fact that the Netherlands has legalised prostitution. There is therefore a need to ‘import’ women into a country in which prostitution is, strangely enough, considered to be a lawful and approved activity. Why does Mrs Swiebel make no mention of her own country’s assisted euthanasia policy, which is abused by some doctors and which leads to people ending their lives without dignity? There are instances in which so-called assisted euthanasia is abused. Why is no mention made of parents’ right to allow their children to grow up in a drug-free society in which parents know that the law is on their side?</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Swiebel has been very selective. We Christian Democrats will of course vote against this report, because Mrs Swiebel has failed in an important task of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first concerns the ban on women pilgrims entering Mount Athos in Greece. This ban has been in place for 1200 years and is enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union and the Greek constitution. It cannot therefore be changed, nor should it, because to do so would be to accept that the home is not inviolable. Mount Athos is home to 5 000 monks and it is their right to receive whomsoever they please in their home, just as it is our right, as simple citizens, to receive and offer hospitality to whomsoever we want in our home and keep out anyone we do not. This is not a tourist area and any women interested in how Orthodox monks live need only visit the hundreds of other monasteries in Greece and other Orthodox countries in order to satisfy their curiosity.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns conscientious objectors. Unfortunately, religious convictions or an aversion to the violence which the army may stand for are used as a pretext by a number of people to avoid military service and while away their days in the civil service at the state’s expense, even though some of them have no hesitation in using violence if it serves their ideological purpose. May I inform you, my honourable friends, that some of the November 17 terrorists who were recently arrested in Greece, whose much-publicised trial is due to start in a few days’ time, and who have so far murdered some 50 foreign diplomats, ministers, politicians, journalists and judges, have stated that they are conscientious objectors and have been exempted from military service, while another conscientious objector serving in a mental institution has been getting his kicks out of torturing the inmates. It is a pity that we always go too far and end up ridiculing fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In choosing to give, in the explanatory statement, a lengthy and detailed description of possible breaches of fundamental rights by some Member States, this report has led to claims and accusations against these Member States that cannot be refuted and have not even been submitted to a democratic vote because they are not included in the text of the motion for a resolution. These claims are therefore unfair, because they do not allow for any response, even though they clearly have no validity in plenary since they are not included in the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to the sources the report has used, and without wishing in any way to call into question the credibility of many NGOs, I must point out that a report drawn up by the European Parliament ought to distance itself from and even reject the conclusions of each of these organisations, and avoid including, sometimes inaccurately, aspects of these studies. For example, regarding Portugal, it is claimed that discrimination exists on the grounds of sexual orientation, on the basis of the conclusions and observations of one NGO, which I shall not name as it appears in the text, and the rapporteur states that the Portuguese Penal Code contains legislation that discriminates in this field, an assertion that I reject on the grounds of a simple reading of the law. In fact, the Portuguese Penal Code makes no distinction in the field of sexual orientation with regard to the age of consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that the European Parliament must responsibly assume its powers for safeguarding human rights and should never confine itself to simply transcribing the opinions of third parties. This will clearly always be the case until we have a legally applicable Charter of Fundamental Rights; only then will things be done differently. We all want to ban breaches, but there are no political breaches of rights – there are legal breaches or practical breaches and these either exist or they do not. No amount of political flexibility, no interpretative criteria will enable us to uncover breaches of rights where these are not considered to be breaches under the law. Nor, on the other hand, can we allow any breach of rights to be justified by political criteria. This is why I shall not be voting in favour of this report: the fundamental balance that is needed for delivering an opinion on such sensitive matters is absent from this text and it has therefore failed to win my support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur invokes the ‘decision taken last year by Parliament's Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to use the Charter as a guideline for the annual report on the human rights situation in the EU’, and adds that ‘Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (…) has given [this work] greater focus and direction’.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if this is the case, we should stick to this particular guideline very closely, not going too far, exceeding the rights set out in the Charter; not allowing ourselves to be side-tracked into an endless course of nit-picking, taking the report away from its aim and from what it should confine itself to and seeking to make the resolution on which we are voting an instrument for abuse – something truly insane – for passing endless judgments on the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament does not, in fact, have the power to do this, except in very specific situations; situations so serious that they could be seen as potentially having the punitive effects of Article 7 of the EU Treaty apply to them. Furthermore, we all know that it is the Charter itself that sets out its own scope: ‘The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union with due regard for<span class="italic"> </span>the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law (Article 51).</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, both the report and the resolution should directly consider the institutions and bodies of the Union; and, with the exception of the specific comment relating to Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty, should consider the Member States only indirectly, when they are implementing Union law and only in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore all quite astonished, when the rapporteur finally said that exactly the opposite was true: that, on the one hand, the ‘report deliberately addresses only the human rights situation in the EU’s current Member States’– which is exactly what it should not be doing, and on the other, that the report ‘does not include any detailed list or assessment of the actions of the Council, the Commission or Parliament’ – which is what it should be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">If we add to this flagrant methodological deviation the regrettable inconstancy with which many of the comments about these Member States are made without sufficient objective and appropriate grounds (as the rapporteur herself admits), we have a set of basic reasons why in accordance with its own premises, the Swiebel report must be rejected. In its place, the alternative resolution that I tabled should be adopted, setting things back on a proper footing and enabling this Parliament to fulfil the recommendations that we ourselves defined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
