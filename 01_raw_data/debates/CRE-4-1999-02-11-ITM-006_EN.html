Firstly, I apologise that there are more than 200 amendments; we tried as best we could to reduce the number.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to explain the meaning of ‘compromise amendments" in connection with tonight's vote. They are not compromise amendments in the way we normally understand them, that is to say compromise amendments between political groups. They represent the results of an informal trialogue which took place in Brussels over the last couple of days and weeks and amount to a considerable amount of work put in by myself and the other water rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely imperative that we, having agreed those compromise amendments between the water rapporteurs, now agree to endorse them because the German presidency, which was not represented at last night's debate, has stated in a letter: ‘The German presidency is hoping to achieve a common position on the draft directive at the March Council. They will do their best to include in that common position the text that came out of the informal consultations."</p>
<p class="contents">A prerequisite will be that this text is included in the decision on the proposal that Parliament will be taking tonight. So we need to fulfil our side of the bargain: endorse the so‐called compromise amendments, and then we have the beginnings of something we can take further after the second reading when we move to co‐decision.</p>

But I want to stress that it would not have been possible without the cooperation of his fellow rapporteurs on water, Mr Eisma and Mr Florenz; it would not have been possible without the coordinators of all the political groups; it would not have been possible without close cooperation with Commission staff, with the chairman of the German presidency's Working Group on Water and without the secretariat of the Environment Committee.

The river basin approach enables the Member States to pursue policies which are specifically tailored to river basins, which we think is an excellent idea. If the best use is made of local knowledge, such as the water boards can provide, it will help to achieve better results. Involving those who are directly concerned makes it much more likely that new policies will be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Establishing a new framework directive is certainly going to take some doing: the way it was dealt with at first reading was extremely confusing. Our examination of the draft framework directive was postponed several times, mainly because of the ‘premature position" that the Council adopted last June. All in all, it was a strange state of affairs. After that, with the Amsterdam Treaty in mind, progress started to be made towards reaching a political agreement, though this has only been successful in a small number of areas because certain Member States refuse to be flexible. This is a pity, because it is often much easier to reach agreement at an early stage before opinions become too firmly entrenched.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise amendments which I and others have tabled are a rather disappointing result after a very promising start. Amendments Nos 189 to 193 on the wetlands are designed to maintain a buffer water capacity which is essential in order to prevent floods and drought.</p>
<p class="contents">Compromise Amendments Nos 194 and 195 take account of the fact that the protection of marine waters is already covered by international agreements. We are in favour of organising occasional conferences on water policy, which all parties concerned, including NGOs, should be able to attend, as proposed in Amendment No 198.</p>
<p class="contents">The re‐injection of water for certain necessary activities must still be possible, provided that it is done in a responsible manner, and Amendment No 201 creates adequate safeguards here.</p>
<p class="contents">With the emission limit values, all the various sources must be considered, not just the major polluters. The difficulty here is in enforcing the polluter pays principle, and we therefore wonder whether Amendments Nos 65, 67 and 68 can really be implemented in practice.</p>

<p class="contents">In addition to simplifying the situation, the main new feature of this proposal for a directive is its underlying approach, which is based on the notion of river basins. Good management of these will ensure that the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater are safeguarded, whether these waters belong to one Member State only or straddle a border.</p>
<p class="contents">By the end of the year, the Commission is to put forward technical specifications which will form the basis for all data collection and analysis operations, notably regarding the definition of river basin districts and the analysis of their physical, demographic and economic characteristics, analysis and monitoring of water quality, and the evaluation of water quantity and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Each management plan will consist of a programme of measures to be fully operational by 31 December 2007 at the latest. The objective of ‘good status" must be achieved by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for implementing these requirements will very largely rest with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to this proposal, I tabled 17 amendments on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group, most of which were adopted either on their own or as part of a compromise amendment. These amendments naturally included wetlands and their specific ecosystem in the context of these Community measures. But we also pointed to the importance of agriculture and the specific link between this industry and water. We needed to take account of the special features of agriculture to ensure that it was not restricted by too bureaucratic an approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We voted against compromise Amendment No 201 on the underground storage of natural gas and LPG. The Commission proposal introduces a derogation for existing stores, but would ban any plan to develop further storage of natural gas in aquifers, whilst the French experience of storing gas underground (since 1957) and LPG in abandoned mine workings (since 1965) indicates that all requisite measures for protecting the environment are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">We did, however, vote for Amendment No 160, which authorises underground storage where this does not compromise the environmental objectives of this directive.</p>

<p class="contents">There is a serious shortage of water in southern countries, which means that it is becoming a limited resource.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore restrict the temptation in wealthier, more developed and more powerful regions to transfer water from other areas, as is the case with the River Ebro.</p>
<p class="contents">Through Amendments Nos 16, 18 and 75 the White report puts an end to such practices by limiting this water policy. I was therefore happy to vote in favour of these amendments and the entire report.</p>

This text will clarify and simplify the existing Community legislation, which is fragmented and labyrinthine.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I must deplore once again the fact that political agreement was reached in the Council before Parliament had had its say. Moreover, after his report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, Mr White, outside all the normal channels of official procedure, negotiated 12 ‘compromise" amendments with the representatives of the Council. I find it most regrettable that he did not take the trouble to inform the Committee on the Environment at any stage of his dealings.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above that, I deplore the fact that he added on his own initiative a thirteenth Amendment No 201 which was never agreed with the Council delegation. The rapporteur made this addition without respecting the elementary rules of transparency, and without even consulting the authors of the amendments which his compromise proposal was designed to replace. This is no way to do things. On principle, therefore, and also because the content of Amendment No 201 was not consistent with the wishes of the PPE Group, we voted against this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite Mr White"s best efforts, his attempt to reduce the number of amendments to this text as far as possible only succeeded with the Council on points which, whilst useful, were thought to be of minor importance. We have had to vote in today"s sitting on nearly 200 amendments. That proves, Mr President, that Parliament is using the powers granted it under the Treaty, despite the dubious practices employed by the Council of Ministers.</p>

However, the highly intensive exploitation of freshwater resources that has taken place over the past 25 years has created major problems for animal and plant life in European rivers. It is therefore gratifying that the Commission has taken the initiative of a directive establishing a framework for EU action in the field of water policy. The Commission's proposals for a phased solution to the dual problems of pollution and supply bear witness to a legislative proposal that has been prepared with great care. Through the discussion in Parliament and the Council, I hope that it will be possible to satisfy the demands of both the environment and supply.</p>

Although we appreciate that PVC is not the only issue here, we are ready to back those amendments which seek either to ban or to restrict the use of PVC. We naturally support reduced use of traditional PVC, but we do feel that today"s technology offers ever more ways of cutting back on those component substances in PVC that are a danger to the environment and health. We also know that industry, and in particular the automobile sector, is working actively on many fronts to find alternatives to PVC, or to use less hazardous forms of it. We therefore hope that the Commission will very soon come forward with a proposal for a directive on the whole issue of PVC, without this being restricted to any particular sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the disposal of PVC, we believe that the optimum solution is reuse or recycling; the second‐best choice would be incineration, coupled with energy production. Landfill has to be seen as the option of last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">Adopting Amendment No 25 fails in our opinion to do justice to the important area of producer liability. We therefore voted against this amendment.</p>

The same order must therefore also be used in disposing of vehicles, particularly when we consider that there are huge numbers of end‐of‐life vehicles each year and that the first priority must be to ensure that the dangerous substances they contain are given appropriate treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the prevention of PVC waste, we feel that this would be better dealt with in a horizontal directive, and we are expecting a proposal from the Commission on this shortly. This is why we voted against Amendments Nos 8, 19, 21 and 56.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way of ensuring successful collection is to enable the last owner to deliver the vehicle to an authorised treatment facility free of charge. The treatment costs can then be passed on in the price of new vehicles. In many countries, however, it happens all too often that vehicles are dumped illegally, even in surface water, with all that this implies. We voted for Amendments Nos 22 to 25, even though they do not take adequate measures to prevent these problems from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing arrangements for the collection of two and three‐wheeled vehicles must be left in place, and it is therefore a good idea to exclude them from Article 5. We voted for Amendment No 18, despite the fact that all the provisions on prevention, reuse and recovery have been dropped.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of treatment, we wholeheartedly supported Amendment No 30, and the same applies to Amendment No 34 on the percentages for reuse and recovery. As everyone probably knows, the complete dismantling of end‐of‐life vehicles is currently possible and economically viable. This would mean a reduction in the shredding of such vehicles. The targets set out in Amendment No 34 are certainly attainable: in the Netherlands, for example, we have already reached 86 %.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of Member States concluding agreements with the economic actors concerned, so that the directive can be implemented flexibly.</p>

Motor vehicles are one of the most important areas of capitalist production. In the European Union, as we approach the year 2000, close on 10 million vehicles are scrapped every year. To quote just one of the many eloquent figures, the non‐recyclable waste which remains after crushing and shredding makes up 10 % of the total volume of hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of vehicles and other major consumer items, a fundamental principle could usefully be adopted on a large scale. The producer should also be made responsible for disposing of and recycling his products. The purchase price would of course reflect the cost of this responsibility. In this way numerous pollutants, often harmful to the environment, would be eliminated and this would enable the process of recycling and disposal to be organised more efficiently. European standards should be put in place for the various product categories to regulate their collection, processing, reuse, recycling and the monitoring of these operations.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this idea will also enable many pollutants to be eliminated at the production stage, since the producer himself will have to make provision for recycling his products in the simplest and safest way possible.</p>

This text is of prime importance to the environment. Sadly, we are all familiar with the eyesore of abandoned car wrecks on our landscapes. This proposal is very important too for producers in the industry concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many sectors directly involved in the treating of end‐of‐life motor vehicles: the car makers, the suppliers of parts and fittings, the plastics and metal components sector, the recycling and salvage professionals, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers, the current or future owners of a vehicle, are of course the people primarily concerned: on what terms will their vehicles be taken back and treated? We ought not to be dogmatic here. Taking back vehicles free of charge, as envisaged here, is to my mind a snare. The real cost of collecting, free of charge, an old vehicle which does not comply with recent environmental standards will have to be met sooner or later. The intention of my Amendment No 54 was to make it compulsory for vehicles type‐approved after the date of the directive"s entry into force to be taken back free of charge. At the same time, Member States would have to provide incentives so that all vehicles could in fact be taken back free of charge.</p>
<p class="contents">With the same ideas in mind, I supported the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection which seeks to set differentiated objectives according to whether the vehicle is an old one or one which meets the standards of the present directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel strongly about the amendments seeking to ban the use of PVC. Firstly, there is no way one can suggest banning the use of a material in a horizontal text on end‐of‐life vehicles. Secondly, we have to be consistent; this House has always strongly advocated measures to control atmospheric pollution. In that context, it encourages the use of light materials in vehicle construction, so as to reduce fuel consumption. At present, given that there are no alternative materials, it is neither meaningful nor realistic to seek a ban on the use of PVC in motor vehicle construction.</p>

Clearly, the waste which results from lack of control in the motor industry has become unacceptable, and measures are needed to address the problem. To that extent, I support the report and the means of improving waste management contained in it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not satisfied that due regard has been given to motorcycles. Motorcyclists, if anything, have been more environmentally friendly than those of us who travel on four wheels. There is a strong tradition of recycling motorcycle parts. I was therefore concerned when the original proposal was put forward that it appeared to ignore this tradition by putting two‐wheeled vehicles in the same category as four‐wheeled vehicles. My own view is that motorcycles, as well as vintage cars, should have been excluded from the legislation and that separate legislation should be drafted which would ensure compliance with genuine environmental concerns.</p>

There are pollution problems associated with the types of waste that are separated from scrap vehicles during shredding, but abandoned vehicles in particular are a major environmental problem in nature. It is therefore necessary to ensure that end‐of‐life vehicles are managed in a lawful and responsible way. Common EU rules in this area will help to reduce substantially pollution from hazardous substances. In addition, end‐of‐life vehicle treatment undertakings can become more viable and generate more jobs. The proposed directive is therefore an immensely positive initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">An appropriate means of preventing the use of certain hazardous substances in the manufacture of new cars is an important element in the proposed directive. However, it is not realistic at the present time to introduce a total ban on certain substances which are necessary – in small quantities – in connection with certain alloys and rust‐protection procedures. Moreover, the demand for a horizontal directive providing for a total ban on PVC in the EU before 2000 is unrealistic, and therefore cannot be given Conservative support in the European Parliament.</p>

We believe that the text remains excessively one‐sided, containing too much simplistic and inflexible analysis, a black and white approach left over from the cold war, with its ‘good guys" and ‘bad guys", and a measure of inability to grasp properly the complex historical, cultural and religious realities which a resurgence of Communist ideology has caused to resurface and which nevertheless now form the very heart of the problem on which an agreement is being sought.</p>
<p class="contents">What our resolution should have done was to welcome the fact that, firstly, the advocates of a diplomatic solution have for the moment won out against the irresponsible hotheads and, secondly, that two European countries are playing a leading part, for the European Union as a whole, in the search for that solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council clearly recognised that the best way to help achieve a diplomatic solution was not to use the complex and uncertain machinery of the CFSP, but to lend resolute support to the work of the ‘contact group" made up of the powers inside and outside Europe which are best placed to play a decisive role in finding a way out of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rambouillet talks confirm the major role played in the ‘contact group" by the two European countries most heavily and specifically engaged in the search for a peaceful solution: France and the United Kingdom, the two European members of the UN Security Council. This House can only hope that the two European co‐chairmen of the Rambouillet conference, helped by the negotiators of the ‘contact group", will bring both their diplomatic skills and the utmost political determination to bear in persuading the protagonists in the fighting – despite the absence of Milosevic, which weakens the process – to reach an agreement which will allow the question of Kosovo"s independence to be managed as peacefully as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the report does have the merit of drawing attention to real problems, and that means it can initiate the legislative and decision‐making process applying in the European Union, as the Commission may implement some of the report"s highly positive recommendations for the ultraperipheral regions, namely: </p>

Secondly, we deplore the apparent willingness of certain European Member States to sacrifice European solidarity on condition that the US exempts them from its sanctions. Lastly, the attitude of the German Presidency does not seem to be altogether unambiguous, in that it has sought a direct settlement with the US without consulting its partners.</p>
<p class="contents">We for our part wish to encourage the European Commission to show the utmost firmness – which for once it seems intent on doing, albeit very late in the day – and consequently the Europe of Nations Group chose not to sign the compromise of the PPE and PSE Groups, the content of which seemed to us insufficiently robust, but proposed a more forceful compromise text instead, together with four other political groups.
