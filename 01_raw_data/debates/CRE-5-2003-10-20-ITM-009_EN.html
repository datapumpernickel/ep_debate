<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Sarnez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been working together for two years on the birth of Erasmus Mundus. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, the Council and all of my fellow Members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for the work that has been accomplished.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting the Erasmus Mundus programme for the period 2004-2008, the European Union will be creating a new instrument of exchange and cooperation in the field of higher education, with a view to forging links between European universities and creating a genuine European Higher Education Area, which alone will make it possible to attract students, teachers and researchers from across the world. I should like to remind you briefly of the main features of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The first action consists of creating 250 European Masters Courses, known as 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses', with the label and support of the European Union. These Masters Courses, which will be selected for a period of five years, will have to involve a minimum of three higher education institutions from three Member States. They will lead to the award of officially recognised dual or multiple diplomas. The students following these Masters Courses will have to pursue their studies in at least two of the three associated universities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second action consists of creating Erasmus Mundus scholarships for 4 200 students coming to Europe from third countries. The value of these scholarships is significant. They are on a par with the scholarships granted under the Fulbright programme in the United States. These students will receive an average of EUR 1 600 per month to study on a postgraduate course within Erasmus Mundus.</p>
<p class="contents">The third action focuses on teaching staff. One thousand lecturers or researchers from throughout the world will be able to visit European universities for teaching or research assignments of an average of three months. They will receive a bursary of EUR 13 000 for the assignment.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth action consists of developing partnerships between higher education institutions in third countries and European universities. These partnerships will be based on joint projects lasting a maximum of three years. They will focus mainly on the mobility of European students and teaching staff outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth and final action is to promote European higher education on the world stage. To publicise Erasmus Mundus throughout the world, the European Union will make financial support available for international promotion campaigns and for the provision of services that make information available to third-country students, thus facilitating their access to European universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to stress the priorities that Parliament has championed, and which have been given a favourable hearing by the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">First priority: the name of the programme, initially entitled Erasmus World, has become Erasmus Mundus, making it easier for people to identify it with the European Union. Second priority: to preserve cultural and linguistic diversity, we have given students the opportunity to learn at least two of the languages spoken in the countries where their universities are situated. Third priority: we wanted the 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses' to be selected on the basis not only of the quality of the training proposed but also of the quality of the student hosting. Fourth priority: we also insisted that the diplomas and studies be officially recognised, as this is essential if we are finally to move towards a European Higher Education Area. We need to create real freedom of movement for diplomas within the European Union. This tour of Europe that we are offering students from third countries will thus also benefit European students in the future if they so wish. Fifth and final priority – the fifth priority that we in the European Parliament championed: we have agreed a budget that is equal to the programme's ambitions. The Education Council proposed allocating this programme EUR 180 million. The Commission was proposing EUR 200 million. In this second reading, Parliament has succeeded in obtaining a budget of EUR 230 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate here, Commissioner, how much I have appreciated the positive spirit in which we – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – have all worked together. I think that we can be pleased with the advances constituted by the Erasmus Mundus programme. I hope that Erasmus Mundus enjoys the same success and the same popularity as its little brother, Erasmus, and that it will thus enable the Europe of knowledge, to which we all aspire, to become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is also – and I think that everyone would agree – an excellent initiative, which, I must confess, is among those that are closest to my heart. It seeks to make European higher education more attractive throughout the world and also here, in Europe; it seeks to enhance its quality, thanks to the European Masters’ courses, which will link several universities from different countries on our continent and which will be open to students and academics initially from here at home and later from the whole world, on the basis of the award of scholarships.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at the second reading stage and I can tell you, Mrs de Sarnez, that the Commission can accept all seven of the amendments in the draft recommendation. In addition, I should like to congratulate Parliament and the Council on their efforts to reach a consensus – an important consensus, because it will enable us to accelerate the procedure and launch the programme as planned in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, the Commission fully endorses this consensus. It respects the substance of the proposal and it includes a budgetary allocation of EUR 230 million, which is worthy of a PHARE programme. This allocation is also in line with the budgetary programming prepared by the Commission with a view to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendment No 5 on the budget; Amendment No 1 clarifying the scope of the notion of higher education; Amendment No 2 referring to the new generation of programmes; Amendments Nos 3 and 6 about the requirement of quality to be met by 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses', and Amendments Nos 4 and 7 on linguistic diversity, which is very dear to our hearts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mrs de Sarnez and the Members of this House that wherever I go, in the Europe of Fifteen or in the new countries, and even outside Europe, everyone agrees that Erasmus Mundus is a magnificent initiative and everyone has high hopes of it. I am sure that it will contribute to greater convergence of our higher education systems and that it will have a major impact on how attractive they are to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Erasmus Mundus has the potential to become both a benchmark of European academic excellence and a vector for dialogue between peoples. I would like to thank Parliament very warmly for its cooperation from the very beginning to the very end of this process. I think that we have set up a marvellous programme. It will be up to the academics, students and teachers to really make it work.</p>

That is why I arrived so out of breath, but we did very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs de Sarnez for carrying out her work with such determination and so much drive. In doing so she achieved what we wanted to achieve; we will be able to start the Erasmus Mundus programme at the beginning of 2004. This report emphasises something that is very dear to Parliament, that is, we are creating a European learning area, an expression we were not allowed to use in relation to Socrates II. Today, I think everyone is talking in such terms and that, I believe, is a good thing. We are bringing Europe back onto the international stage. Europe will become more competitive and more attractive to young people from abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">As against the EUR 180 million that the Commission wanted, we have set a figure of EUR 230 million. Achieving this increase took a great deal of effort, but I believe that it is also a reflection of the ambitions we have for this programme. To be genuinely appealing such a programme requires financing. We put further emphasis on language learning and that is a very important point because the students who come here study in three different countries and we expect them to try to learn at least two of the languages of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I see Erasmus Mundus as a marvellous way of continuing Socrates-Erasmus, and I believe that we will make this programme a great success in 2004, the very year that the European elections are taking place. I hope that in so doing and in showing what we are capable of, we will make this a real attraction in the European Union and beyond. These students, coming from outside the EU, will be able to study in three places in Europe; they will assimilate the cultural diversity of the European Union, they will learn the languages and they will carry Europe’s message abroad. I am glad that we have come so far together on this road.</p>

As Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and having only just left a meeting of this same committee where we were voting without you, Mrs de Sarnez, I should like to say here that it was with widespread, indeed unanimous, enthusiasm that the Culture Committee worked on Mrs de Sarnez's excellent report. To be quite frank, when we saw the Commission document we thought the idea was excellent and we agreed that in some respects the Commission was almost being too cautious.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in respect of the budget. It is just as well that we were there to increase it a little. I might say straight away that this Parliament's Culture Committee does not consider the EUR 230 million to be sufficient and tends to think that it will have to be supplemented further.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, if you think of the world today and the considerable number of large countries who, for reasons of international uncertainty, give the impression of being closed off, the fact that it is precisely under such conditions that Europe should choose to open up completely is of exceptional significance in our view.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, we wanted to reinforce, consolidate and write in stone how valuable a degree such as the European Union Masters is. The Commission text tended to give the impression of any old studies leading to the award of a little certificate. We wanted to consolidate this qualification, this Master’s degree.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Mr President, we thought it was very important to tighten up the wording on the learning of two foreign languages in this context. Where the Union's language policy is concerned, we have often protested in this Chamber about those governments who were not making it compulsory to learn two foreign languages in their countries.

If it were up to me, we would offer yet many more students across the world the opportunity of studying at other universities. I am also indebted to Mrs de Sarnez for the energy she has put into the successful completion of her report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important in Europe to offer a sound alternative to the American universities, to which the majority of our European students go at present. As Europe seeks to become the world's most competitive knowledge economy, we ought to advertise ourselves as a centre of excellence, where academic standards are high, so that it makes it worth the effort for foreign students to come and study over here. For various reasons, I have always propagated that it is of major importance for students to learn foreign languages, at least two. This is a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span> for anyone from the Netherlands. It also promotes the understanding of other cultures. I see this reflected in your report, which I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The knowledge of languages does not only help the student with a university degree to secure a better competitive position within the labour market, it also contributes to his cultural baggage, and, lest we forget, to mutual understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I should nevertheless like to make an observation with regard to this report. The programme is intended for students and university lecturers from all over the world, hence the name 'Mundus'. I should, in this connection, like to press for extra attention for universities in developing countries. Education is the best weapon in the fight against poverty. By giving students from the developing countries the opportunity of acquiring learning within the EU, we can help them disseminate this knowledge in their own countries. However, I should like to add explicitly that it must, of course, be ensured that they plough their knowledge back into their own countries once they have completed their studies. The programme is not, after all, intended to crank up the brain drain. This requires sound cooperation among European universities and the universities from the developing countries, which must have the broadening of knowledge and experience of students and lecturers as a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By covering postgraduate education, this Erasmus Mundus programme will be a very useful addition to the existing Erasmus programme, which, as you know, promotes respect and intercultural understanding as well as dialogue between our different peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The greater openness to the outside world that these Erasmus Mundus programmes bring is something quite remarkable and will make it possible to further enhance understanding between peoples. Yes, peoples: I did say peoples because I note that these days, unfortunately, it is the fashion to talk about citizens and to forget about peoples, as we see in the Convention's draft constitutional treaty. I belong to a people, the Catalan people, which does not necessarily coincide with the French and Spanish states, and I am pleased to recall here that the Erasmus Mundus programmes will foster mutual understanding between peoples, not only European peoples, but peoples from all over the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Catalonia – since that is what I was talking about – hosts many students from throughout Europe. Barcelona is an attractive cultural centre and the fact that Catalan is not, regrettably, an official language astounds some students when they arrive there. They then discover that in Barcelona, Valencia, Palma or even in Perpignan, classes, or some of them, are taught in Catalan. In Barcelona, the majority of classes are taught in Catalan. You may have had the opportunity to see a very wise and very well-made film by Cédric Klapisch, <span class="italic">l'Auberge espagnole,</span> which is the story of some Erasmus students and which also mentions this language problem.</p>

I hope that today's debate will prove an exception to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who is concerned about the quality of education within the European Union, at whatever level, will be delighted that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement to start a programme whose only goal is to improve the quality of higher education in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, only a chosen few were able to gain experience at foreign colleges of higher education or universities during their studies. That Europe is working towards offering more and more students this opportunity is a development about which we are all thrilled, no matter which political party we belong to. As a representative of Flanders, one of the smallest nations in the European Union, I often notice that our language, Dutch, is repeatedly under threat within our own universities, among others because an increasing number of courses, not only in Flanders, but also in the Netherlands, are being taught exclusively in English.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore particularly pleased that the Council and Parliament, in their common position on the Erasmus Mundus programme, are asking special attention for the promotion of the knowledge of languages of students both within and outside of the European Union. By offering students in the Erasmus programme the opportunity to learn a minimum of two languages that are spoken in the countries where the colleges of higher education are based, we may be able, in time, to reverse the pernicious trend that we notice mainly in the large Member States. It is a sad fact that, over the past decades, European young people’s knowledge of languages, as well as of culture and history, has diminished.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore stressing that it is not only students from third countries who should be encouraged to have a command of at least two EU languages. Our own young people of Europe too should urgently realise that a good command of various languages is the best guarantee that they will learn to appreciate other cultures. This is also the best way to maintain in future the rich diversity within the European Union. Accordingly, our universities and colleges, the entire higher education system, in fact, will remain a showcase to the rest of the world of which we have every reason to be proud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Education Council’s agreement that the financial envelope should be set at EUR 230 million is important, since that figure seems fairly satisfactory. Just as important is that this programme should open up new prospects in higher education, both within Europe and in terms of Europe’s collaborative relationships with third countries. Those relationships, moreover, should exist not only at student level, but also at the level of the non-European scholars invited.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the care taken over linguistic matters and the principle of cultural diversity, the quality label and coordination between higher education and professional training, are also important. All of this becomes even more significant given the adoption of the measure making it possible for participants in the programme to travel round Europe attending several different universities. Furthermore, access to this same programme for European students has not been forgotten. Neither have their scholarships and inter-university Master’s courses.</p>
<p class="contents">Thinking in terms of enlargement, this agreement becomes even more meaningful, since from now on we have the opportunity to enhance the already impressive scope and size of the above-mentioned tour of Europe’s academic centres. It has now become necessary to devise a promotional campaign in order to allay the doubts and fears which, according to the media, have already arisen in certain academic circles.</p>
<p class="contents">Some fundamental questions remain, however. Is this the way for the European education system to compete on truly equal terms with its United States counterpart, in either quantitative or qualitative terms? Also, at European level, will a more even distribution of students among universities in the Member States be obtained? Only time will tell us the answers to these questions. For now, it should be noted with approval that, in terms of higher education, Europe now has at its disposal yet another extremely useful international tool, which has raised the hopes of many, and justifiably so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The point has already been made that the programme, which generally applies to higher education institutions and students from across the world that have gained a first degree, must, however, also take account of vocational training, such as technical courses for engineers and higher technicians, which are included in the category of ‘higher education institutions’, and for which appropriate proposals are to be drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">Close cooperation between various European universities will make it possible to increase quality and increase international competitiveness. The compromise on the financial framework of EUR 230 million is just that – a compromise and no more – and I believe that this programme will only succeed in achieving its ambitious goal if all parties involved – the European Union, Member States and universities – accept these challenges and do their bit. EUR 230 million alone will certainly not suffice. Furthermore, it must be made clear that these financial resources must be raised in addition to other educational programmes and not redeployed from them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Erasmus Mundus Programme can only be passionately supported. On the one hand, the programme’s added value consists in the possibility of mobility, in the learning of foreign languages as well as in intercultural exchanges. On the other hand, Erasmus Mundus accepts, in a pro-active and constructive way, the educational challenges of globalisation. It is precisely because the programme is open to students from third countries that Europe can distinguish itself further in the field of higher education.</p>
<p class="contents">In an age of globalisation, there is competition for the best products, the best ideas and last but not least, for the best brains. It is for this reason that Europe must make itself more attractive and competitive as a place of study and education. As draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the first reading of the report in April 2003, I too am particularly pleased today to see that Parliament has notched up one significant success. With EUR 230 million instead of the proposed EUR 180 million, Erasmus Mundus will have a sound financial basis. After all, what can sensible programmes achieve if they are not adequately funded? What we have achieved is creditable, but the current commitments and the new initiatives are altogether inadequate when set against the Lisbon objectives. When money is tight and budgetary resources limited, we cannot expect to reach dizzy heights, but nor should money being tight and limited budgetary resources be excuses for preventing us from making farsighted political commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, education is the number one investment in the future. Do we want to have the most dynamic and most competitive economic area in the world by 2010? If so, then we have to get our priorities right by investing in research and training, and Erasmus Mundus is a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved a result that is acceptable not only to Parliament but the Council too. For once we will have concluded a multi-annual programme’s legislative process before the programme is supposed to begin. Hopefully this exception will now become the rule for other programmes deliberated upon by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union at present is very obviously less attractive an option than the United States for higher education students from third countries. Each year the EU gets around 100 000 fewer new students than the United States. I believe that, in five years’ time, when Erasmus Mundus is well and truly under way, that figure will have decreased.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the programme is to improve the quality of European higher education by attracting more students and skills and know-how to Europe. We have to remember, however, that skills and know-how should not be lured here at the expense of third countries. Cooperation with universities in third countries is just as important, so that we can, for our part, strengthen the status of higher education in the countries participating in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Seven months from now, the 10 new Member States acceding to the European Union must be closely involved in the implementation of Erasmus Mundus right from the start. When the Union’s external borders change, it will be important for us to put to use the skills and know-how the future Member States already have from relations of cooperation with, for example, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. I believe the close involvement of the new Member States in this programme will also contribute to their participation in the implementation of other objectives with respect to the EU’s education policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with the result we achieved with regard to the programme’s linguistic issues. Fostering linguistic diversity is one of the fundamental values of the EU, but the aim of the Erasmus Mundus programme is obviously not the teaching of languages. Its purpose is to make European higher education look more attractive, and I therefore welcome the formulation we arrived at. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The financial perspectives do not seem quite so impressive; in the first reading we made it clear that EUR 200 million was not enough, we called for EUR 300 million. I agree with other Members that the Council’s proposal of EUR 180 million is completely unacceptable. Increasing the funding does not, by any means, put a burden on existing programmes. Mrs de Sarnez’s proposed compromise of EUR 230 million is sensible and it is in accordance with the new Interinstitutional Agreement. I think the excellent Commissioner Reding is certain to vote in favour of these perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the point of a highly ambitious Lisbon objective if we do not have plenty of specific measures? In Germany, we have learned from experience – and the Pisa study has made it very clear – that these do not come free of charge. What is the point of it when we are not investing enough in education in our <span class="italic">Länder</span>? We will then be clearly lagging behind. It is the European Union that must award the ‘Erasmus-Mundus Masters Courses’ quality mark, so that we can then clearly identify a particular higher education, with good proficiency in the languages of at least two Member States. We have left a clear political mark both in terms of courses and in hosting students.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one more thing that I feel is important. Vocational training – such as for engineers or higher technicians – must be integrated in such a way that we achieve uniformity in higher education too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Opening the Europe of education at international level, which is a daring move, promotes the European learning area and we are now starting to look at it not in a fragmentary manner, but with the bridges which it has, with the cooperation which it has, as a real area.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Erasmus Mundus programme is of a different quality in comparison with all the previous programmes, precisely because it is not based simply on exchanges, on mobility; on the contrary, it gives us a new stamp, a new reference point, to which the thousands of students and the hundreds of education institutions using it will be able to give real meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that Europe has the courage today to open up to competition, to languages and to cross-cultural understanding. We reward both the institutions and cooperation between them under this programme, as well as promoting the excellence of the students from whichever country, continent or cultural background they come. That means we are promoting European values. I think that we owe it to them. More importantly, we have to give something back to the countries from which the millions of economic migrants come and I think that what we are giving, these grants we are giving, are recompense and I trust that the majority of students will come to us from these developing countries.</p>
