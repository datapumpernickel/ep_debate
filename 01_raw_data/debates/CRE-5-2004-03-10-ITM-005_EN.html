<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please remember that back in October 2001, on the basis of the White Paper, the Commission presented to the Council and Parliament an initial proposed amendment of the Decision on the guidelines and updating of the 14 priority projects approved in 1994 by the Essen European Council. At first reading, Parliament approved the main points of this proposed revision of the guidelines for the trans-European networks, in accordance with the compromise which had been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal of 1 October – which is now on the table in Parliament – for this type of ‘first second reading’, completes that.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Council has reached a political agreement on the text which combines both proposals, which, let us remember, represent the design of the trans-European networks in an enlarged Europe, a Europe of 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that the Commission's proposal today includes the updating of the priority projects, but also – and I would like to stress this point – of the organisational resources aimed at improving their planning, monitoring, coordination, funding and, therefore, their realisation, at European level. Our intention in this case is that the maps showing routes should become reality within our European geography.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the principal objectives of this proposal? Firstly, I would like to point out that, on the basis of some 100 proposals presented by the States, the high-level group recommended reviewing the projects which conform to the following criteria: they are located on important European routes, they are subject to firm commitment on the part of the States in question, with a closed timetable for completion, they offer advantages in terms of aspects such as environmental protection, modal balance and territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that in that high-level group, chaired by former Commissioner Karel van Miert, not only were all the States of the Union + 10 + 2 represented, but also the European Investment Bank, whose opinions in relation to the economic aspects of the projects have been very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that one of these priority projects concerns the so-called ‘motorways of the sea’, which are alternatives to the saturated land corridors and which must improve accessibility of regions which are disadvantaged by their geography, that is to say, the peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The main innovation is that, within the framework of the trans-European networks, it will be possible to grant subsidies for implementation under specific conditions, which represents an interesting alternative for the European transport system, but furthermore emphasise port equipment in interconnection ports and the interconnections of ports with their surrounding areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that the aid for launching the new lines which would constitute the motorways of the sea would be restricted to what is absolutely necessary in order to guarantee the viability of economic relations between two States which jointly decide to establish one of these regular interconnections as an alternative to other modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The complete list of priority projects – three of which have been completed – represents an investment of EUR 224 000 million between now and 2020. But that is nothing more than the really essential part, the tip of the iceberg, because we must remember that the total cost of the projects for the trans-European networks for the Union of 27 States is more than 600 000 million. In other words, if we were really to carry out all the projects which we consider to be of trans-European interest in order to structure European Union transport, we would be talking about an investment of more than EUR 600 000 million, and what we are indicating is that of that 600 000, the most urgent sum represents at least EUR 225 000 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that the rapporteur’s report stresses the need to focus support and funding on priority projects within the project of European interest. This initial selection effort is essential in order to clarify what is of European interest in relation to great networks and what, for example, is included in regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to enhance the coordination between the States of the Union, the Commission proposes appointing – and now we are getting into new contributions beyond the drawing up of big routes – a European coordinator for one or several specific projects with a trans-European component. The job of this coordinator will be to advise the promoters of the project with regard to funding and assessment and also to promote synchronised development on each side of the border in the case of trans-European projects, as well as to carry out the different administrative procedures accompanying this type of project.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be pointed out that, from the point of view of evaluation, we know that this will require consultations, work, not only with the States – firstly – but also, in many cases, with the regions affected and the neighbouring populations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also proposes a procedure for declaration of European interest which will mean encouraging the States to respect the timetable for the works listed in the proposal, and to integrate the assessment procedures divided between different States. In other words, the ultimate objective is to establish single and coordinated evaluation procedures between two States, which will enable border areas to make simultaneous progress and, where necessary, the border regions to be better coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission's proposal, this declaration could be withdrawn if the requirements are not fulfilled, in particular with regard to the timetable for work and the progress of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">All the objectives I have just described are clear and achievable and we believe essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that it is still possible to adopt this proposal during this legislature – although it is true that we have very little time – and it is therefore necessary that the approach of the three institutions is based on cooperation and the will to make progress and to demonstrate a degree of flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am aware, the current differences are not really so great and I believe it is possible to reach an agreement – I would insist – before the end of this legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">The approval of this proposal before 1 May would be extremely important, essentially for the new States, which could thereby benefit from that date and be genuinely included in this great project we are establishing amongst all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The trans-European networks are a potent symbol of that single market, creating transport links that spread evenly the length and breadth of the EU and providing calculable benefits for business and people alike. As Parliament's rapporteur, this is the core consideration I have used in developing this proposal. The Community is set for enlargement in May, bringing under its umbrella another 75 million citizens, while at the same time huge growth is predicted in our major transport networks over the next decade. This more than ever is the right time to concentrate our efforts and bring this programme to a timely conclusion. We have a great opportunity to tie up this decision quickly, a mere three months after Parliament first debated this revised document.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I firmly believe that Parliament can achieve most of what it wants within the body of this proposal, there clearly remain a number of issues on which we must all exercise good judgment and flexibility. I would urge all Members to come together to successfully conclude this legislation by moving forward as quickly as possible. Europe needs improved transport links now. We have to remember that this piece of legislation is Member State driven, and the fact that the Member States have met and managed to agree a comprehensive list of projects has to be recognised positively, whilst not denying Parliament its rights under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain areas that still need to be addressed. In our opinion the Council's position does not go far enough in placing restrictions on state aid for some key elements. Following the Commission's decision on Charleroi, we feel this principle should be upheld in respect of the TENs and in particular the motorways of the sea element of the programme. You cannot pick and choose when to enforce state aid rules and cannot add state aid <span class="italic">à la carte</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also discussed the time limit for funding and I am pleased that the Commissioner referred to that in her address. I hope that both the Council and Commission will agree with Parliament on this, because in order to secure the long-term viability of the trans-European networks, it is imperative that we first ensure a commitment to act, as well as the sound management and financial probity of suitable projects.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the TENs programme deserves implementation. It has at its core the achievement of a single market. I sincerely hope we can move forward to a sensible and above all balanced approach to Europe's infrastructure needs, which after all will help determine the future shape of transport across our continent for decades to come. I commend this report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start, Madam Vice-President, by reiterating that you have taken a very great deal of trouble in submitting a very well thought-out proposal. Setting up the van Miert Group was a very good idea, and the Commission proposal is influenced by what it produced and you revised. For that, many thanks; especial thanks, too, to my colleague Mr Bradbourn, whose report is the result of very careful work. As it stands, the report is not entirely what he would have liked to see, as a fortuitous majority in the Committee pushed through very substantial amendments to Annex III, but perhaps we can sort that out tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There are just three major points that I want to discuss. My group is in agreement with the list of priority projects being extended to 30. I now hear that the Council has suddenly decided that it no longer wants the 30th. It has to decide, then, what it actually wants. Although we are prepared to extend the list by adding, for example, the project for a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt, we want a more precise definition of the projects in some areas covered by Annex III. This is the subject of a number of amendments, and I hope that the Council will accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is, at present, prepared to keep the list to 30 projects, as we know that, according to Article 156(2), decisions on trans-European networks cannot be taken in opposition to the Member States, so it makes no sense to make major additions to the list in the short time available. This means that we are taking the same line as Commissioner de Palacio, and I hope that the other groups will do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, we very much welcome the idea of motorways of the sea; I see the advancement of short-distance transport by sea, especially ferries, as very important. As a mode of transport, it saves a great deal of energy, is highly environmentally friendly, and will tend to take the load off road and rail corridors. However, Madam Vice-President, we are behind the rapporteur. Motorways of the sea must not be used as an excuse to inject state funds in the form of subsidies, with the state even buying ships in order to compete with private enterprise. That goes against the whole idea of trans-European networks, the object of which was always to improve infrastructure so that business can use it. Using them to extend it is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we will sort things out with the Council in a sensible way, but there is very little time in which to reach an agreement. If, by Monday evening, the Council has not precisely defined what its interests are, and thereby enabled us to agree on the details, nothing will happen by 1 May; the fact is that Parliament will not simply abandon the good positions incorporated into the Bradbourn report simply because the Council is obstinately sticking to its own. Codecision is at issue here. Both sides have to give way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first comment concerns the motorways of the sea, on which I take the opposite position to Mr Bradbourn and Mr Jarzembowski. I think that they are spatial planning tools. They are transport policy tools. If they were only market tools, the motorways of the sea would not become a reality, because they would not be able to compete with roads and would be reduced, at best, to motorways of the sea between Antwerp, Rotterdam and Hamburg, which would be woefully insufficient for relieving the majority of European traffic. I think that they need public support, because they are public policy tools and not just market tools.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the need for the European Parliament to have as much involvement as possible with the latest revisions and to be kept informed, if possible, of their implementation. We know that Quick Start exists, not legally, but actually. I think it would be reasonable for Parliament to be kept regularly informed, as the projects that it undertakes are implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of funding, you said yourself, Commissioner, that you needed EUR 4.8 billion per year in order to set this particularly ambitious programme in motion. Unfortunately, I now have the impression that we are being given the luxury of choosing a spending programme without the restriction of finding income. I would like to say that Parliament will support you, in the Council, to help you ensure that this programme does not exist solely on paper and that it does not end up with the Essen syndrome, in other words that it is not just something that is talked about but has no future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are seen as tools both for constructing the internal market and for strengthening the cohesion of the Union. They are tools that will cause a profound shake-up and readjustment of priorities in the territory of the Union and that will go on to force everyone to find their own role in building the new European area.</p>
<p class="contents">TENs were first defined in 1996, whereupon we found ourselves, little by little, having to look again at this project several times, changing the content too, because motorways of the sea are fundamentally a novelty that must above all be seen as a tool for allowing some traffic to be taken away from our Union’s congested roads. We are now faced with a dual necessity: that of strategically defining the works that will have a long-term effect and that will significantly reduce the construction time, and that of continually adapting to those economic and social changes that, in turn, alter the demand for transport. Flexibility on two levels is therefore to be commended: flexibility over time, which should be partially – and I must say adequately – guaranteed by the concept of biennial reports that can lead to the agreed forms being revised; and flexibility in the actual definition of the group of projects corresponding to each of these proposals. I say this because we are essentially talking about major waterways, but major waterways can only be classed as such if they have working tributaries and if proper links to these are put in place. Well then, I will take the liberty of insisting that thought be given to the possibility of ensuring that major tributaries and the links essential for major waterways to work are placed on an equal footing, as indicated in the tabled amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Not only the hauliers, but also the people living in mountains, valleys and coastal resorts complain about a huge traffic burden. Nobody took it upon themselves to build tunnels and bridges in order to remove those bottlenecks. Furthermore, for years, rail traffic did not keep up with demand for fast connections between the big cities in different countries. That is why we desperately need to work on maintaining, improving and extending the transport network in Europe, and in this the primary option should be for transport by rail and at sea, which are the least environmentally threatening forms of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be narrow-minded to measure our prosperity, well-being and progress according to the rise in transport, or the surface area of asphalt and concrete for motorways and airports. On the contrary, preventing unnecessary transport contributes to a better environment and to the well-being of people and animals.</p>
<p class="contents">According to my group, a sufficient level of government spending is indispensable in the provision of public services, social security and the environment. Wasting government funds and megalomania, however, do not solve anything. We are opposed to the idea of endless investments of Community funds in asphalt being the best way of creating and maintaining jobs or of helping new Member States along. Neither are we taken with the intention of giving businesses overcapacity, thus enabling them to decide on every occasion which infrastructure, funded with Community support, can be used by them at the time in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
<p class="contents">When it was presented at the end of June last year, the Van Miert plan was immediately hailed by the Italian Transport Minister as transport's answer to the euro. Does he see transport as an unmanageable natural phenomenon which makes people reliant on it? We see transport as taking second place to people and the environment. That is why we consider the Van Miert plan too unwieldy, too threatening to the environment and far too expensive. A more selective plan, focusing on more direct and quicker rail transport is preferable. That will be our guiding principle when we amend this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not appear to be underpinned by any real and sustainable concept of mobility for the whole of Europe; on the contrary, it is no more than yet another mixed bag of national interests. The proposals that have been tabled are the ones that it was thought would gain acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">These projects do not appear to have been analysed in terms of their benefits and optimum costs, and, in many respects, they contravene European environmental law. One of the things that make this clear is that projects given priority status are in breach of the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive. Among them, let me mention only the Kresna Gorge and the bridge over the Straits of Messina. The concept of trans-European networks must be able to stand up to a strategic environmental assessment if the projects are to receive European funding. Only projects that pass this test can be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">European funds must be invested in a sustainable way; they must also be capable of opening up ways ahead, enabling our children to enjoy mobility in the future. The projects we are planning are long-term ones. We firmly reject these misconceived plans, especially those to which I have referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe that this is an issue of great importance if it is true that the European Union and this Parliament intend to attach importance to the integration of the Balkan area into the trans-European networks too. It cannot be said that this is not a project of European interest because it brings major added value – facilitating the mobility of goods and people – and because it will contribute to territorial cohesion of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">An objection is being made to the impossibility of using the structural funds because these countries are not currently within the European Union. This is, however, an objection that, in my opinion, can be easily overcome only if there is a will to suggest access to the EIB funds or a more prudent reworking of the funds already earmarked by the European Union for the whole Balkan area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Balkan area is very important, not just in terms of transport, but also in terms of security, and transport can help the issue of security, especially in an area where illegal immigration represents a constant danger for the border countries such as Italy and, in general, for the whole of the Mediterranean area. This is why we hope that the three institutions, as the Commissioner mentioned, want to agree in the most rational way on a number of guidelines provided through the modernisation programmes listed in Annex III. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the importance of this matter and the amount of time that has already lapsed, time is of the essence. In a few months' time, the number of interested parties will grow to 25, which can further delay decision-making, certainly if the project list in the annex is extended. I am pleased that various MEPs appear to be settling for an optimisation of the projects already included. This being the case, the only addition will be Seine-Nord, for which there is already considerable support. What we are apprehensive about is additional obligations being imposed in respect of the environmental impact reports. This obligation is already in place in most Member States, and duplicating it would delay the implementation of projects even further than they already have been. It is already bad enough that the financing holds up the projects for some time.

The fact that the President and the Presidency have left the Chamber does not bode well for this project. Mr Roche was present earlier while we had a very successful and positive discussion of the issue of enlargement, but now we are dealing with the technicalities of making enlargement possible, of giving it substance and life, the Presidency is not there. For such neglect we must reproach the Irish presidency, which has otherwise been so painstaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the matter in hand, let me point out – as a number of speakers have already done – that we need a functioning infrastructure if the European Union, and the internal market in particular, are to function. Nothing will work without adequate rail, road and water links. The enlargement of the EU makes it a matter of urgent necessity that the network should be extended; to put it more precisely, what this means is establishing links or rather restoring those that Europe had, in some instances, 70 years ago, but most of which were shut down during the 70 years in which parts of Eastern Europe were under Communist rule. We now have to expend a great deal of effort on closing these gaps.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer in particular to a number of links running from Austria, my home country, in relation to which I have proposed a number of minor additions, and will take this opportunity to contradict my colleague Mr Jarzembowski. The majority was not fortuitous; it was deliberate and very determined, for the sake of the matter in hand, to close loopholes; we were concerned with, among other things, particularly the rail link between Graz and Spielfeld, which provides a functioning rail link with the new Member State of Slovenia, with the line from Linz to Prague and with what is known as Summerau line. It also mattered to us that the Czech Republic should be connected via a proper and functioning rail link. I would rejoice if, despite the resistance with which this meets, not least from my own country, we could also succeed in incorporating what is called the Southern Railway and the Semmering link into this network.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Vice-President stated earlier strikes me as being extremely important in the context of our present discussion and the further progress that we hope we can expect. It is not lines on a map that we need; they have to become reality. It is for that reason that we have to make it our concern that a start really is made on these projects, that they are brought to completion, and that funding should be provided for them. If we succeed in this, it can be expected to have a positive effect on employment. We would thereby be implementing some of what we constantly demand in connection with Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we should start by stressing what a fascinating European transport project the trans-European networks are. Jobs are at stake, as is the transport of goods, and this is also of course about how this can be done without damaging the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is very consistent, in that it makes clear Europe’s desire to change over to environmentally-friendly modes of transport and to water-based ones. With the motorways of the sea, we are breaking new ground, and European transport policy can hold its head up there. It has to be said, though, that railway projects and waterways have effects in terms of environmental policy, and so, as part of the trans-European networks, there is a need for strategic environmental assessment. If codecision means anything at all, it means that there have to be changes in the way specific projects are developed. If there are plans for motorways of the sea between the North Sea and the Baltic – and I think they would be a good thing – whilst the canal between the North Sea and the Baltic, which would cut the journey significantly, is forgotten, then that is not on; it would be absurd. For that reason, there is a need for improvements here.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to tell the Council that we, in this Parliament, have had experience of the development of the trans-European networks; let me just mention the Christophersen Group or the Essen projects. That is why it cannot be surprising that this House should attach importance to the realisation – and hence also the funding – of the trans-European networks and the priority projects being subject to strict controls and rigorous monitoring. That I see as one of our tasks as a parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council wants solutions – and I think it capable of getting them – then fair compromises are needed, and they have to be agreed by us together; the Council cannot simply announce a done deal. If it makes good use of the opportunity, we can achieve the right results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The projects affected, classified as priorities, which will be declared to be of Community interest, will enjoy the very significant advantage of easier access to the available Community resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In our case, we are glad that the modification of project No 16 in Annex III has been included, the Sines-Badajoz railway line, changing its dimension and adding certain links by road and rail which will also provide greater permeability for the Pyrenees and which are going to resolve the bottlenecks which usually arise in this area. But it must be made clear that this permeability of the Pyrenees – and this is our opinion and our demand – must extend all the way to Algeciras itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pleased with the support for the so-called ‘motorways of the sea’, since attaching the same importance to these transnational maritime routes as to motorways or railway is going to facilitate connections with countries isolated by natural barriers. The benefit will undoubtedly extend also to countries with island or peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with this thinking, nevertheless, we cannot understand why, in certain passages, specific reference to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) is being removed in connections with the North Sea and the Irish Sea. We will vote in accordance with these considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recall how, in this Chamber, Mr Jarzembowski, we crossed swords on the subject of the Transit Regulation and how some of you – including you, my dear Mr Jarzembowski – said: ‘so let us invest more in railways!’ Well, we now have the chance to support not only Austria but also the countries bordering on it if, tomorrow, we vote in favour of these rail projects linking East with West, North with South, becoming reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring here, on the one hand, to the project that has already been mentioned – from Prague to Graz via Linz and then further southwards – and also, on the other, to the southbound line through Vienna. These will help not only our neighbours, the Czech Republic and Slovenia in particular; if we think ahead a bit, we will be including the whole of the Balkans, and if we want to free up the roads for those who have to use them or for whom it makes more sense to use them, whether with private vehicles or HGVs, then I believe this extension of the railways is what we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Vice-President, I am very glad that a representative of the Commission, addressing the Committee during its deliberations, took a very positive view of what is known as the Summerau project, that is to say, the line running from Prague to the south via Linz. I hope that the Commission will support these projects, for what matters is that we provide this Europe of ours with an infrastructure that is environmentally friendly, that is efficient and that really does link the countries in Central Europe with one another.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not wish to deny that profits may well accrue from this to Austria, which suffers a great deal from heavy goods vehicle traffic, but I do hope that we will receive support from all sides of this House; this is not about self-centred interests, but about those of Europe as a whole, and when it comes to pursuing and maintaining those, we should as far as possible be in agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are faced with the problem that one of the two countries does not support the implementation of that project. We cannot find a solution.

First, we must ensure a good environment to live in and, second, we must ensure that there is employment, particularly for our young people in the future. In order to achieve a good environment, employment and growth, we must make use of transport links and communications. We must make use of the trans-European networks in a European context. We can thus promote both growth and a good environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This must also take place in the peripheral northern areas where we have close trade relations with Russia, for example. This would benefit the whole of the EU from an industrial point of view and create opportunities for employment. We therefore propose in Amendment No 47 that the Haparandabanan line should be a priority project within the trans-European networks. The railway is connected to those main lines that together make up an important goods route within northern Sweden and that, in turn, are connected to the Nordic Triangle, the Council’s Project 12.</p>
<p class="contents">The Haparandabanan line is a missing link<span class="italic">. </span>It is a mature project that involves the upgrading and new construction of railways on the Swedish side in order to raise the standard, and a rational track gauge shifting facility at the national border in Haparanda - Torneå.</p>
<p class="contents">The project would facilitate trade with Russia and improve the environment in the EU. North-western Russia has great access to raw materials which should be of value to European industry and which are transported by this route. An improvement of the rail connection can therefore be expected to contribute to a continued beneficial development of trade. The section of the project relating to track gauge shifting facilities will provide experiences that can be drawn on also in other places in the EU that have problems with the linking of railway networks with different track gauges, for example between the Baltic countries and Central Europe and between Russia and the EU.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank you for all your speeches and in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, for the work he has done, which I know has been extraordinary, as well as the whole Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which has reworked the amendments and produced great European added value and very interesting proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the honourable Members that yesterday, on the occasion of the meeting of the Council of Ministers for Transport, I said that if the Council had modified the Commission’s initial proposed projects – even if it was a single modification, dealt with and supported by the Van Miert Group, but which had not initially been given the green light by the States – we would have to allow Parliament to act in a similar way.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, to incorporate and where necessary amend the projects, provided that they had been considered by the high-level Van Miert Group, discussed by the representatives of all the States – also by the EIB and others – and furthermore given the green light by the States in question. I also told them that it was not a question of substantially modifying Annex III nor all the projects, but of allowing Parliament its prerogatives, that is to say, the capacity to make contributions to the proposals for the trans-European networks. In this regard, I noted the degree of flexibility on the part of the Council, a constructive flexibility, which could be interpreted as indicating, ‘we have also been very respectful; it has been an exceptional case; the issue cannot now suddenly be reopened’. And it is within the context of this balance that we have to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that, as well as the specific modifications to specific projects, which I will refer to at the end of my speech, there are various amendments in your proposals which refer to general issues and many of them have been accepted. In this regard, I am happy to tell you that the majority of those intended to clarify the text of the proposed Decision can be accepted by the Commission. For example, Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11 (first part), 12 (second part), 16 and 17; others can be accepted with certain modifications of the wording such as, for example, No 10 (first and second part) and No 40, in relation to the reference to environmental analyses; it is clear that all projects funded by the Commission must respect the environmental legislation in force; that is an obligation. The Commission therefore accepts the addition of the reference in the text aimed at emphasising this aspect, as in the case of Amendments Nos: 33, 34, 37, 42, 43 and 44. With regard to the other amendments, some cannot be accepted because they have already been implicitly included in the proposal and are therefore superfluous; for example, Amendments Nos 11 (second part), 12 (first part), 18 and 21. Other amendments have been rejected because they go beyond the scope of the proposed Decision; for example, Amendments Nos 2 and 13 (second part). Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 15 do not precisely correspond to the objectives of the proposal and, therefore, it is not appropriate to accept them. With regard to Amendment No 7, we cannot accept it in its entirety, because we do not believe we should extend the concept of ‘motorways of the sea’ so far, since ultimately that would reduce the strength achieved by concentrating and selecting specific projects; nevertheless, there is one part I would like to refer to which we can accept and which relates to Amendment No 22 by Mr Jarzembowski, and that is that we could include an express reference to the fact that motorways of the sea will include canals linking two seas. I believe that this makes sense and we can include this modification.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not remove the open procedure for competition, that is the announcement of proposals. Ladies and gentlemen, we must not hand out the motorways of the sea just to people we know, because that would be entirely contrary to our approach. What we must do is open up the contracts to competition, because that is the only way to maintain balanced systems, to gain the greatest advantages offered by the various opportunities and maintain the basic principles of the Treaties. We must guarantee transparency and competition, and that means we must make open tenders, announcements and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic conditions are specified in the financial Regulation and not in this document. With regard to the European coordinator, as I indicated previously, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 9 and 10, with certain clarifications, while Amendment No 8 cannot be accepted as such by the Commission, which does not mean that this Parliament will not be informed of the appointment of coordinators, but that the Commission will inform Parliament of the appointments as and when they are agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Annex III, as I said, the Commission's view is that the debate should not be reopened but that it should maintain a degree of flexibility because, I would insist, this House co-legislates on an entirely equal footing with the Council. The Council has reopened it and, therefore, we believe that we must provide a margin for flexibility. Furthermore, the Council has heard the Commission's argument. In this regard I would like to say that four amendments which contain modifications or details of routes for projects already included in Annex III, proposed by the Commission, must be accepted, provided that the countries in question accept those modifications. Because we cannot do anything against their will. And in reply to Mr Ferrández Lezaun, you have no idea how much I understand you. Unfortunately, this is not the only case; when one is in my position one realises that this is not the only country, nor the Pyrenees the only border, where situations of, shall we say, asynchrony, or lack of coordination of times, arise, and that is bad for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot therefore make modifications which are not accepted by the countries. In this regard, yesterday we were trying to reach an agreement with the countries on the modifications of this nature they would be prepared to accept. I have received certain replies which I will mention to you. For example, the first part of Amendment No 22 could be accepted, that is to say, in relation to the linking of the two canals, either because we present it black on white, or because we present it in a general manner, but, in this case, the countries in question are prepared to include it.</p>
<p class="contents">The first part of Amendment No 20, Algeciras-Bobadilla, which is a mixed project, not as it is at the moment, when it is considered as transport; it is already included in project 19 and what we must do is include it as part of Sines-Madrid-Paris, the great cargo route and we have the green light here as well. The second part of Amendment No 22, the Baltic Motorway of the Sea, project 21, can go as far as the North Sea; its name will be changed to ‘Baltic-North Sea Motorway of the Sea’ and we also have the green light from the countries in question.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first part of Amendment No 19, relating to project 6, that is, Lyon-Turin-Trieste-Koper-Ljubljana-Budapest, it would be a question of specifying that the railway line from Trieste to Ljubljana should pass through Divaca and that the line between Venice and Trieste should pass through south Ronchi. The Commission has difficulties here, because the countries affected are not expressing their agreement. We are talking about modifications which consist of establishing a route with differences of 20 km to the north or to the south, as happens for example in the case of south Ronchi. In the rough sketch we have on our map it is not clear whether it goes a little further north or a little further south. At the end of the day this will depend on the will of the specific country and the routes which can be defined in accordance with environmental and all other types of criteria. Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult for the States to accept it as it is. And the same is the case with the proposal that the Trieste-Ljubljana route should pass through Divaca. Slovenia says that it has difficulties accepting it. Let me make it very clear that the Commission has no problem, but that the problem is with the countries affected themselves, and we are talking about modifications of 20 km, of going into the details of important routes. I would insist that the Commission has no problem but that we need the agreement of the States in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain amendments involve adding projects or sections which have already been carefully assessed by the Van Miert Group. With regard to these, if the criteria of Article 19 are met, including the firm commitment on the part of the States to carry them out, the Commission is fully prepared to facilitate this agreement. But only two projects have been analysed in accordance with this criterion: one is the Sena-Escalda river project, which does not appear to pose any problem, because the Council accepted it at the meeting on 5 December, and naturally if Parliament proposes it, the Commission has no problem. And the second project is Amendment No 26, relating to the Prague-Linz link. I know that this is very important for certain Members of Parliament. On this line we may very possibly be given the green light by the countries in question, but I am not so sure that we will be given the green light from them for the rest of the project. I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote for this project or, at least, only to consider the first part. Naturally, the Commission will accept what the countries affected say in the Council, because we cannot go against their opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments introduce significant modifications which have not been assessed by the Van Miert Group, such as the Marseilles-Turin railway line, referred to in Amendment No 19, and which has been rejected; the same is the case with the Haparanda line, referred to in Amendment No 47. These projects were not initially presented by the States in question and do not fulfil all the selection criteria in Article 19, in particular, the commitment of the States of the Union to a timetable. In accordance with the spirit of Article 156 of the Treaty, the guidelines for the projects require the approval of the State in question, and the Commission must therefore oppose these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments propose routes in third countries. In this case, the Commission cannot include routes which cross third countries in the trans-European networks, but we are aware of the problem posed by the existence following enlargement of an enclave surrounded by Union territory. In Compostela, in June, we will meet with the chiefs of the various pan-European corridors in order to review them, bearing in mind that two-thirds of those corridors, following enlargement to 27 States, will be within the Union and will be trans-European networks, which is what we are approving today. In that review of the pan-European corridors we will have to deal specifically and very dynamically with those works which represent a connection of European territory via non-European territory, as in the case of certain countries of the former Yugoslavia in the Balkans region.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, certain amendments propose withdrawing or removing parts already integrated within the proposals of the Commission's Van Miert group and approved by the Council. These amendments, which the Commission cannot accept, are Amendments Nos 1, 7, 20 and 25. The projects included in Annex III, I would insist, are based on economic studies and political approval from both the Van Miert group and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it has been requested that in relation to motorways of the sea there should be explicit mention of Spain and Portugal rather than saying ‘the south of Europe’; this is what Mr Camisón said. I am going to check this but, as far as I know, it remains in the proposals. With regard to the central crossing of Vignemal, the central crossing of the Pyrenees, I would insist that we must respect the will of the States. We must try to encourage them, but we must respect what the Treaties say: that without the agreement of a State works cannot be carried out on their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by once again thanking the honourable Members and saying to you that, as you can see, the positions of the Commission and the Council offer a degree of flexibility in order to take up some of the proposals and contributions of this Parliament which improve the initial text and which, furthermore, respect the balance between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Parliament to understand that this margin for flexibility exists, but that it is impossible to entirely reconsider the fundamental points and the whole range of proposals for these new trans-European networks, which we must approve urgently so that, from 1 May 2004, when we are 25 countries rather than 15, the ten new Member States are included in them, since they will be part of the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Bradbourn and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
