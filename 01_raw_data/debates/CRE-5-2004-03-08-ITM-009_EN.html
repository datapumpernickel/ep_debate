<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santini (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, this proposal, which was presented in July 2001, is a proposal for a directive that seeks to codify and develop in the widest possible context European citizenship and above all the Community <span class="italic">acquis </span>as regards the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. The Council common position – this should be said – was drawn up and adopted under the Italian Presidency. For bureaucratic reasons, we have only reached the debating stage today. On some points, this Council common position diverges from the Commission’s initial proposal, but it is, however, highly innovative as regards the current <span class="italic">acquis</span>. For example, concerning the right of residence, the residence permit is being replaced by a simple registration. A permanent residence permit will be automatically introduced after five years<span class="bold">,</span> and protection against expulsion will in general also be stepped up, especially in the case of long-term residents. First and foremost, however, this directive has the merit of strengthening and simplifying the very complex legislation that had tried to regulate this delicate area since 1968. The directive will replace nine directives and amend a regulation. This means that, from now on, it will be a type of single text identifying what rights European citizens have, and will have, to move and reside within the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">New value will also be given to the definition of citizen, with the term no longer being defined simply as a worker, student or pensioner, but as a citizen who, as a person, has citizenship. I would remind you that we are talking about Community citizens and their families, even if they are citizens of third countries. This directive does not deal with non-EU citizens who regularly reside in Union territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has, therefore, finally provided new legislation. We can describe it as an almost historic step, which is, at any rate, certainly important. I would need more time, too much time, to mention the many things that will change even in the daily life of citizens. Here are just the most important. Unmarried partners: from now on in countries where national legislation grants rights to unmarried partners that are equivalent to marriage, such partners should be considered married to all intents and purposes and therefore benefit from the same rights. I remind you that, currently, registered partnerships between same sex and different sex partners are only possible in the Netherlands and in Belgium, countries where civil marriage for homosexual partners exists. In countries where there is no specific legislation for registered partnerships, Article 3 of the directive will apply. This is a difficult article to interpret and apply and so it will be up to the Court of Justice to interpret and clarify it.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur believes that a genuinely historic step forward has been taken. For the first time in a Community legislative text of a binding nature, the rights of unmarried couples are recognised even if, and I remind you of this, it is being done in line with national legislation. As regards the rights of family, there are some very interesting changes in this area. As regards direct descendents, the only direct descendents deemed family members within the meaning of the directive are those who are under the age of 21 or are dependents. For direct descendents in the ascending line to be deemed as such and, therefore, as family members within the meaning of the directive, they must be dependents. I regret the fact that, on this point, there has been no significant progress in relation to the current legislation. Perhaps Parliament did not want to impose any conditions, at least as regards direct descendents.</p>
<p class="contents">Other innovations concern the right of entry, movement and residence. Suffice to say that this directive fully simplifies all the current formalities. I said before that a major change introduced concerns the right of residence that is obtained automatically after five years of regular residence. This is the real point, the central point of the directive. There would be many other points, but it is enough to remember that expulsion is being abolished but not in all cases. I will quickly move onto the conclusions: expulsion can occur – this is what the Council decided – only for serious reasons of public order or public safety. Briefly, I consider that it has been better to accept a compromise, imperfect though it certainly is, as regards the Commission proposal and the improvements made by the Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, rather than to reject the directive which will certainly be a milestone in creating European citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to give particular thanks to the rapporteur, Giacomo Santini, for his efforts to enable this legislative instrument to be adopted during this parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the common position has achieved the three objectives contained in its original proposal, which were: codification, citizenship and making conditions for residency more flexible. The first aim was that of codifying the complex body of legislation that exists today. We have replaced nine directives and two regulations and have incorporated a huge amount of case-law in the field of free movement and residency into a single legislative instrument, which has the advantage of providing clearer and more transparent rights for our citizens and for national administrations. Secondly, the text of the common position should be seen as forming part of the legal and political framework created by citizenship of the European Union, which enables us to adopt a new approach to the exercise of citizens’ rights and to create a single system of free movement. This objective has been achieved despite the fact that specific rules have been retained for workers and students, in order to preserve the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. In third place, we have the objective of adding flexibility to the conditions and formalities linked to exercising the right to freedom of movement. In the Commission’s opinion, this has also been achieved by removing the obligation, for EU citizens, to obtain a residency permit, which has been replaced by simply registering with the local residency authority; through introducing a right of permanent residency that would no longer be subject to any conditions after five years, or continuous residency in the reception Member State; and finally, through more clearly defining the status of family members and by enhancing their rights, not least as regards those family members that are not nationals of any Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that this text, which does not correspond exactly to all the objectives contained in its original proposal, in any event constitutes a crucial step towards producing a solid concept of citizenship. I feel sure that the new provisions of the directive will have a considerable positive impact on the lives of millions of Union citizens currently residing in another country of the European Union and of many other citizens who will in future use the right to freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I thank Parliament and the rapporteur for the support I feel sure they will give to adopting the common position without amendment and I hope that this support sends a positive message to the citizens, explaining to them clearly that, although the Union has made significant progress in the field of security and justice in the last four years, this directive will enable us to say the same as regards this added value that is the freedom of Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is excellent that there is now indeed one legal instrument to assess what the rights of European citizens are when they move freely within the European Union. This free movement has become a clear basic right, and I think that it is also an important point for the public, in that it allows them to identify with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also read with interest the definitions of extended family, family and partnership, descriptions that are, in my view, very formal. Governments, of course, always find it necessary for things to be written down on paper. It is not sufficient for something to be claimed or determined in a different manner. The term 'partnership' should be officially registered. I personally do regret that the word has not been given a more general meaning, because it is not really up to the government to check whether a partnership entails a marriage relationship or otherwise. In my view, this should simply be possible. That way, this term could become less charged and maybe its practical application could be broadened.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that the concept of family should also be defined effectively in this field. In fact, on this women's day, I have the feeling that the text mentions something about the breadwinner's role. It appears that way: the wording 'at the expense of' – I can see Mrs Swiebel nodding in agreement – seems to refer to the breadwinner's role to some extent, and I, as a Christian-Democrat, rather like this, but others do not, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the right <span class="italic">per se</span>, I find it somewhat unfortunate that this is brought up precisely at this time, when the acceding countries and the people who live there cannot yet avail themselves of this significant basic right. It is of extreme importance, in my view, for us to underline once again that we very much regret that the basic right of free movement for employees from Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and others, is currently being curtailed to this degree for reasons that are extremely vague, insignificant, and probably mainly of a populist nature. That is why it is all the more important for us to clearly establish this right once again by means of a debate in this plenary sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a lengthy process and he has made a tremendous amount of progress. That we have arrived at this point does great credit to him and everybody else who has worked on this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">He said it is a question of simplifying formalities. That in itself is something of a simplification, because it is a lot more than that and, as the Commissioner himself just said, it brings together a very complex network of existing measures. It is very important that what we are doing here is seen and publicised. Over the years the EU has been very good at creating free markets for goods and capital. We are now moving in the direction of creating a free market for people so that they can move around with their families and partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The remarks by Mr Oostlander give cause for some alarm, because if we go down the avenue of saying that there must be a clear concept of what a family is then we are undermining the whole process. Mr Oostlander spoke of the official registration of partnerships with the government. I think Mr Santini would agree that is a difficult and contentious area and one which, if reopened, will negate much of the valuable work that has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">This common position may not be ideal. There are areas where we on this side of the House would have liked more progress, be this the three-to-six-month timescale, the prevention of expulsions or the definition of humanitarian reasons, etc. There are aspects that are not perfect.

Freedom of movement is not only a sound liberal principle, it is also the cornerstone of the Lisbon process and a precondition for achieving the internal market. A flexible labour market is identified again and again as one of the preconditions for increasing growth in the EU. Where this point is concerned, we must also recognise that one of the problems surrounding increased mobility is not limited to the particular individual. One of the most important barriers to mobility is constituted by the limited opportunities that exist for people to take their families with them to other EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the report contains a number of improvements in relation to freedom of movement. It considerably simplifies matters. If the proposal for a directive is adopted, the directive will replace nine existing directives and two regulations. It will facilitate mobility by doing away with the requirement for people to have residence permits before going to live in other EU countries. It will also entitle people to reside permanently in such countries after five years and reduce the opportunities for devising derogations in relation to people from other EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the big matters discussed in the report, that of the definition of ‘family’, ended with a compromise according to which the Member States’ current legislation is to be followed. I will not conceal the fact that I should like to have seen a more extensive definition of ‘family’, but I do not think that the present result should lead to the proposal being rejected. Besides, it contains too many improvements upon the status quo.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have been able to do perhaps a little more than might have been thought possible. We have most certainly achieved more than we could expect to achieve in a new Parliament representing an EU of 25 Member States, many of which have a far more restrictive definition of ‘family’. On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I shall therefore recommend that we vote in favour of the proposal in its present form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we had more time we might have been willing to have a bigger fight with the Council over some of the amendments. While it is true that this is a step forward in terms of codification and gives greater clarity to citizens, the approach seems somewhat begrudging: the common position seems to grant a right with one hand, only to add an enormous set of qualifications to that right with the other. In a sense, many of those rights become nationalised rather than considered from a Community perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous speakers have been right about the climate in which this debate has taken place. Some see it as a way of shutting down the possibilities of free movement unless people are seen not to be a 'burden on the state', in the language of the 1930s. Part of the issue is that people are seen primarily as economic individuals rather than as citizens who have the right to free movement. There are still problems for people who are in marriages or partnerships with non-EU nationals. I am well aware that even people working within the institutions will continue to face certain problems because of such relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">People have spoken about the issue of partnerships. It was interesting to listen to the earlier debate this evening, in the context of International Women's Day, during which time after time speakers talked about the fact that there is no single definition of a family, that things are changing and moving on. The social security systems of Member States certainly recognise different sorts of stable relationships – stable units. But we still face problems. I can foresee certain equality of treatment issues coming before the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Evans raised the issue of expulsions. For us this too is problematic. It calls into question what is meant by 'permanent residence', when it can be taken away from someone. Others have mentioned that this might be a step forward, but it still does not take us to where we want to be.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group can accept the common position. We welcome certain amendments put forward by other Groups. But this is certainly is not the end of the fight in terms of free movement for European citizens and their partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This right is also enshrined in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means, however, is that the Union’s citizens must be free to move between the various Member States, just as the nationals of one Member State move or change residence within their own territory. We all acknowledge, however, that there are still many barriers to exercising this fundamental right – a situation confirmed by numerous rulings of the Court of Justice on this matter. This is why it is crucial that this directive should be adopted as swiftly as possible, so as to simplify the exercise of the right to move freely.</p>
<p class="contents">I thus support the recommendation of the rapporteur, Giacomo Santini, whom I wish to congratulate on his excellent work, to adopt this position in its current form. It encompasses many of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament at first reading and is generally well balanced. Furthermore, any new amendment would mean reopening negotiations and would undermine the crucial need for this directive to be adopted, especially given the closeness of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise the major proposals, which I believe to be most important. The first of these is to reduce administrative formalities to the bare necessities; secondly, the right to move freely without the need for any formalities for a period of three months; thirdly, to introduce the permanent right of residence after four years of continuous residency in the reception Member State; fourthly, to impose limits on a State’s power to refuse or revoke the right of residence for a Union citizen on the grounds of security or public order; my fifth and last point concerns the definition of the concept of family, I would like to emphasise that harmonising residency requirements for Union citizens must never lead to changes being imposed on Member State legislation and on their own definitions of the family status. The Treaty excludes the right to live as a family from the sphere of Union competence, because this is a matter for national competence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As one of the initiators of that proposal, I am naturally hurt by this. Nevertheless, the Council has left the door wide open for the free movement of all EU citizens, irrespective of their chosen form of partnership. In countries where registered partnerships are recognised by the national legal system, citizens of other countries who are in the same form of partnership must be recognised. Member States are expected to facilitate entry and residence for partners in a durable relationship and, if Member States refuse to admit a family member, they must give a justification for this.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the major step forward that has been taken is that registered partnership is now recognised in EU legislation as a form of partnership for the first time. In addition, it has become clear that <span class="italic">de facto</span> relationships constitute a problem as regards free movement within the EU, and that countries can no longer ignore this fact. It will be interesting to see the case law based on this new Directive. This is certainly not the end of the fight, to echo Mrs Lambert’s words.</p>
<p class="contents">A familiar question when considering the politics of this is always whether the glass is half full or half empty. In this case, in view of the discussions in the Council and the current political context, I think that we have extracted the best we could have achieved for EU citizens. I do not see it as giving in to blackmail by the Council, as do our friends Mr Turco and Mr Cappato in their minority opinion, but rather as counting my blessings. So be it, and my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It strikes me as especially significant that we can take into the Parliamentary elections actual proof that the fourth freedom of the treaties, freedom of movement, has been revitalised as a result of Parliament and the Council adopting this directive. As you all know, the Commission was of course aiming higher than the content of the text before us today. Yet it must be acknowledged that this is a perfectly acceptable compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the concept of the family, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Directive acknowledges freedom of movement of registered partnerships and that Article 3 provides a clause facilitating the freedom of movement of durable relationships. While it is true that there is margin for interpretation, we could not be accused of ignoring social reality. In view of the fact that the EU does not have the competences to legislate in matters concerning family rights, we are faced with a highly variable European legal framework as regards the actual concept of the family.</p>
<p class="contents">As for expulsions, it is true that we would like to ensure greater protection against them. Whilst it is true that we have not received the solid framework that the Commission had called for in its proposal, it must at least be acknowledged that the provisions that appear in the common position afford wider protection, because protection against expulsions becomes more wide-ranging the longer the person stays in the host country. I therefore feel that, in this area too, we have managed to improve the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards enlargement, I do not wish to join in the debate on the restrictive measures that are being adopted. We must ensure that these measures comply with the Treaty of Accession and the totality of the Community acquis. Having said that, these measures were taken, if I have understood correctly, on the basis of the treaties of accession, which provide for an initial period of two years, during which derogations from the general rules on access to the job market are permitted. This Directive is, therefore, most importantly, one that is aimed at ensuring freedom of movement for all citizens of the twenty-five Member-States beyond this transitional period. Consequently, I feel that the message that we are sending out by adopting this Directive, from which everyone – and that includes the new arrivals – will be in a position to benefit in the not too distant future, is a positive one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish, in actual fact, to complain about the way in which we deal with the legislative procedure in the European Parliament.

That is perfectly acceptable, and I also have a reservation; but the deadline for amendments for this sitting expired this evening at 7 p.m. Quite a few of my fellow MEPs who might have contemplated endorsing these amendments have not arrived here in time because of the problems we always have when we are to make our way to Strasbourg.
