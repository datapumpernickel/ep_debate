<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roche,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, this is an interesting debate, because we are discussing a report of the World Bank. The Extractive Industries Review launched by the World Bank Group in 2001 will guide the Bank’s involvement in the oil, gas and mining sectors. The consultative process is a significant element of the Group’s overall review of its activities in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to note that the result of this initiative – in the form of the comprehensive consultation report produced by the review team, led by Dr Salim – is being examined by the World Bank, and its response to that review is awaited. So in a sense, we are discussing something that is a work in progress. The process must be allowed to take its course in view of the significant recommendations in the review.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of protecting and managing the resource base of economic and social development was reaffirmed by Heads of State and Government at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002. Raw materials, such as minerals and petroleum, provide the foundations for economic growth and well-being, both in industry and in our everyday lives. They are essential in manufacturing, transport, heating and other activities and, most important of all, they are essential in the countries in which the extractive activity takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">While mineral extraction makes a substantial contribution to economic development, the benefits must be balanced by measures to foster the environmental and social pillars of sustainable development through good governance. This is the area most Members will probably be concerned about, because good governance has not always been present. In recognition of the need to balance these demands, actions were agreed in relation to managing the natural resource base in a sustainable and integrated manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Bank is not alone in recognising the need to address all elements of sustainable development. In many ways this review parallels work carried out by the European Union in recent years, such as strengthening the governance of mining through, for example, amendment of the Seveso Directive and a proposed new directive on the management of extractive industry waste – an issue that is of concern right across the Union. The European Union is also taking forward policy on sustainable development through initiatives such as the planned Thematic Strategy on Sustainable Use of Natural Resources. At its meeting on 2 March, the Council of Environment Ministers gave broad policy orientations in relation to the future development of the Thematic Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Extractive Industry Review recognises the potential contribution of mining and petroleum to the World Bank’s primary mandate – i.e. the alleviation of poverty – and proposes a considerable number of measures in this regard. They merit some detailed consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I note also that the World Bank has endorsed the Transparency Initiative launched at the Johannesburg Summit. This is a particularly important initiative. This, again, is a complex issue and there is a need for greater clarity on how taxes and royalties for such operations are distributed. I should also say that there is probably a need to consider whether they are properly or appropriately distributed – but that is for another time.</p>
<p class="contents">Detailed environmental protection measures in the Extractive Industries Review include proposals such as closure planning and guidelines on tailings management in extractive industries. In many ways these reflect concerns that we are also addressing. The European Union guidance note on best available techniques for mining wastes is very advanced and will set out best practice in this area. Many local factors, such as climatic conditions, determine the most appropriate ways to mitigate potential adverse impacts. Nevertheless, our work in Europe will make a useful contribution to better environmental practice and standards in managing mining waste, as well as the Cyanide Code of Practice developed by the UNEP through multi-stakeholder consultation and participation.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit and the Plan of Implementation, including the specific commitments in relation to the mining, minerals, metals and energy sectors. We also support the promotion of corporate responsibility and accountability, and the exchange of best practices in the context of sustainable development. Our position on these issues is clear and, I expect, well known to all interests, including the World Bank. Nonetheless, our interests and concerns in those areas are worth underlining and restating.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change remains one of the most significant environmental concerns for the Union. The Union remains fully committed, for example, to delivering on the Kyoto Protocol target. As parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and ratifiers of the Kyoto Protocol, the European Community and its Member States are eager to ensure that the activities of the World Bank are in harmony with the European Union’s objective of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere at safe levels.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global emissions of greenhouse gases will need to be drastically cut over the rest of this century if this goal is to be achieved. The recommendations of the Extractive Industries Review in this regard are consistent with a recognised need to move to less carbon-intensive sources of energy. The promotion of cleaner and less greenhouse-gas-emitting energy sources in developing countries, with a particular focus on the promotion of renewable sources of energy, are in keeping with meeting the objectives of the EU’s long-term climate change objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we look forward to the response of the World Bank to this review. As I said, the response is still forthcoming. We welcome the wide-ranging and transparent nature of the consultation involved in this process and appreciate that the work now under way by the Bank is well informed by Dr Salim's report. The European Union’s progressive approach to sustainable development is well known, and we also anticipate a response from the World Bank that will be consistent with its overall mission, in particular in poverty reduction and the promotion of sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission is a grant donor focusing on poverty alleviation. Extractive industry support within the European Community development programme has virtually ceased. The specific instrument in the mining sector, Sysmin, was discontinued under the Cotonou Agreement. Under the Ninth European Development Fund, any programmes in the mining sector have been defined by partner countries themselves, in line with the ownership concept. Less than six percent of funds have been allocated to mining activities in national indicative programmes. In addition, increasing environmental concerns within the European Union have led to the generalisation of the use of environmental impact assessments since the 1990s. This also applies to cooperation with financial institutions such as the European Investment Bank or the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The OECD discusses guidelines for officially supported export credits. It recently announced an agreement to strengthen common approaches for evaluating the environmental impact of infrastructure projects supported by the export credit agencies of OECD governments to ensure that they meet established international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament is aware, the European Union launched an 'EU Energy Initiative for poverty eradication and sustainable development' at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002. The initiative’s secretariat is housed within the Commission. It aims to respond to the very issues raised by Parliament, by contributing to providing the access to energy necessary for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. This objective will be achieved within the context of activities driven by participating developing countries, through the provision of adequate, affordable, sustainable energy services.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the initiative does not have a technology focus, it strives to promote the provision of affordable and sustainable energy services. In doing so, it seeks to promote the choice of the most economic solutions on the basis of economic, social and environmental impacts. This involves the promotion of cleaner and more efficient fossil fuel technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also houses the secretariat of the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition. This Coalition aims to enhance renewable energy deployment within developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by assuring you that the Commission supports the call for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Extractive Industries Review, which relate to the sustainability of investments, the promotion of good governance, popular consent, social and environmental impact assessment and the respect of human rights and core labour standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wijkman (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, this is the second time today that we have discussed mining and quarrying. This morning it was Mr Sjöstedt’s report, and now it is this resolution that indirectly concerns the mining and quarrying industry. I agree with both Mr Roche and Commissioner Vitorino that the energy, mining and quarrying industries are of great importance to the economies of many poor countries. At the same time, however, we know that this type of industrial activity often takes a form that has not been of direct benefit to the poor majority, has often given rise to serious environmental damage and has also, unfortunately, resulted in the income from the concessions granted chiefly ending up in the pockets of various ministers rather than in the treasury, where it could have contributed to development in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The study to which we are referring here is interesting and important. It points out the opportunities for these industries, and also the risk of the activity not taking place within a framework of social, environmental and human rights criteria. The consequences often turn out to be an increase in poverty and the destruction of the environment. We met Dr Salim a week or so ago when he was passing through. He gave a large number of examples of difficulties for the local population in various project areas: forced displacements, environmental damage, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the World Bank bear in mind the criticism levelled by the study, and I note that both the Council President and the Commission agree with many of its recommendations. It is very important that the EU Member States, the governments of which make up a large proportion of the Bank’s Board, coordinate their activities in this field and ensure that the Bank bears the recommendations in mind. I think that the Presidency could play a very important role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is now important that the World Bank<span class="bold"> </span>reconsider matters, it is of course equally important that a number of other financial institutions also do so. Commissioner Vitorino indicated that a certain amount of agreement has been reached on the activities of export credit agencies. This may be so, but it is extremely flimsy at present. We need much stricter criteria for their activities, above all with reference to the social, environmental and climate situations.</p>
<p class="contents">To give an example: between 1994 and 2000, the export credit agencies in our OECD countries guaranteed investments in new energy production equivalent to approximately USD 100 billion. All of that activity was fossil-fuel based; not a single cent was spent on energy efficiency or renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of measures are needed in this regard. Without elevating this report and this study to absolute truths, they are nevertheless a good basis for pushing on and tightening up policy in connection with both poverty issues and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Berg (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> ‘I do not for a moment doubt that sooner or later the economic war that Shell is waging in the Niger Delta will be exposed and that the crimes that have been committed in this war will be punished.’ Those, Mr President, were the words of Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa ten years ago. In the West Saro-Wiwa is now, ten years on, still the best known critic of the extractive industries. Shell has since changed parts of its policy for the better and the Extractive Industries Review is mainly concerned with projects of the national industries.</p>
<p class="contents">The present analysis of the extractive industries shows that much remains to be done before the World Bank can operate effectively in this sector. The struggle of the Ogoni people in Nigeria is symbolic of one of the main conditions for World Bank participation, that is the guaranteeing of the right of the indigenous peoples, without coercion and properly informed, to assent in advance to projects that are funded by the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">For many developing countries raw materials are their primary source of income, but even if they have liquid or solid gold in their soil, the indigenous peoples of these countries see very little of the proceeds from it. Poverty, a high mortality rate, civil war, corruption and totalitarianism frequently stand in the way of development in these countries. Apart from the indigenous peoples, the environment also comes off second best to the rapid profits that raw materials bring. It was the same Ken Saro-Wiwa who remarked that the fish in the Niger Delta taste of oil. This is why it is of the utmost importance for the PSE Group that the European Council and the Commission discuss this report and set tough conditions for World Bank participations and extraction projects, so that they can only take place if the standard requirements in relation to the social, economic and ecological consequences of raw material extraction have been met.</p>

What has happened is that the World Bank set up a study on the extraction industries, which, after two years of consultation with public bodies, governments and business, has produced a report which is damning with regard to its development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights the deficiencies and counter-productive effects of the World Bank’s policy in countries rich in natural resources. In the words of the study itself, the World Bank has attracted too many investors, without taking any real interest in helping the countries to develop their abilities to convert their natural riches into means of combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission has emphasised the lack of action on the part of the World Bank in terms of environmental and social supervision. In this respect, the study states that, if the full force of the market is unleashed without any robust frameworks, the resultant damage may be extremely serious. There are numerous examples of loathsome financing. The Yanacocha gold mine in Peru is the prototype toxic tragedy. Managed by an American company, the mine has flattened five mountains, displaced thousands of people and polluted with cyanide the water throughout the entire region.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Bank has also given its support to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, which we were alone in combating, and which has had disastrous social and environmental consequences: massive migration, an increase in the unreliability of food supplies and an increase in prostitution, with a consequent increased prevalence of AIDS. Can we really speak of a development policy? The exploitation of oil, gas or mines is not necessarily the same thing as poverty reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">In countries still subject to a high degree of corruption, where the legal frameworks are still unreliable and democracy is uncertain, the World Bank unfortunately is doing nothing to encourage sustainable development. On the contrary, in numerous countries, the extraction industries have been associated with violations of human rights and civil conflicts, as has been seen in Burma. Even worse, more than 80% of the World Bank’s oil financing is actually going to the North and not to poor countries. The consequence of this blind and generous investment: countries with disappointing results outnumber the countries making substantial progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens, in line with the study’s recommendations, are advocating a moratorium on the financing of oil projects until 2008, the cessation of financing for coalmines in order to combat greenhouse gases, the encouragement of clean and renewable energy along with energy efficiency. The European Union has a major role to play here in demanding, through the Member States, that the World Bank should take account of the study’s recommendations. The World Bank has been on the wrong track for too long and it is time for it to change course so that development policy can at last benefit those most in need. </p>

We also need to know the position of the Council, in which 15 Member States – all playing a very important role in World Bank decision-making – are represented. We want to ask the Council what position it is going to take on this extractive industry report and whether or not it intends to coordinate the position of the Member States in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Mr Roche's interesting remarks I did not hear the answer to this question; the very reason we asked for this debate. We are convinced that we must have parliamentary scrutiny of what the World Bank does, and also that we, as a European Union institution, need to know what our Member States do when they are in the World Bank. So the World Bank is not something outside this institution or outside your institution, Mr Roche.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vitorino said very clearly that he thought, and that the Commission thought, that the most important recommendation had to be supported. I repeat: I would like to know what the position of the Council is, if any, and if there is any intention of having any kind of discussion on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that discussion of this issue in the Council is absolutely crucial for two reasons. Firstly, because the conclusions of the report say very clearly that investing in the oil, mining and gas sectors does not in itself reduce poverty. Sometimes, as you heard in the report, it is detrimental, and this is also of importance to the European Union. Secondly, we are convinced that if the World Bank's objective is to reduce poverty and alleviate the exclusion of indigenous populations and poor people, we cannot continue to support a method of financing a project that is detrimental from this point of view. So please, Mr Roche, tell us what you are going to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also aware that we have an expert in our midst, as Mrs Frassoni is a member of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank. It is quite right, therefore, that we should discuss this issue and endeavour to coordinate the approaches of the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking of the World Bank in general terms, it unfortunately appears that, in some respects, it has the worst record when it comes to the management of development projects. When I was in Niger around a month ago, all the parties in Niger had put their work on the Education For All plan in order; except the World Bank. Its management is so concentrated that it does not work. I hope that Mrs Frassoni will be able to address this matter, too, as part of her work with the other members of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the World Bank has experience in this area, as it said long ago that it is access to resources of this kind that leads to increased conflicts. We must take its recommendations seriously, therefore. They must serve as a guide in our grants for projects and our decisions on various nations and the degree to which we choose to help them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say at the outset that I did not mean to disappoint Mrs Frassoni, but I did make in my own contribution a number of points relating to measures that have been taken. However, I accept the point she made regarding the World Bank not being something from which we are disconnected as absolutely valid.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, Mr Wijkman commented on the protection of vulnerable countries and communities and in particular protection where the temptations of corruption are huge. Of course this is true, and as regards good governance, the World Bank has a responsibility to ensure that. We know from the cases cited here what is happening. We know of the environmental degradation suffered particularly by powerless indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van den Berg also spoke very dramatically about what he described as the silent and hidden ecological war, and another Member made a point about gold mining and the degradation it has caused. In fact it is quite correct. These matters should be of concern to the World Bank and to the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van den Berg rightly spoke of the need to balance development on the one hand with the rights of indigenous peoples and, equally important, the need to ensure that monies from exploitive and extractive industries are dedicated to the service of the peoples of the region, a point touched on also by Mr Rod.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make the point that this is a relatively new area of concern to the Council, but the Council is ensuring that the European Union continues to play a role in global fora as a leading partner in favour of sustainable development. That is the most important point, and sustainable development is the term that covers all of these issues ranging from the impact on, for example, indigenous peoples to the impact of environmental degradation and it also includes the disappearance of the yields of this development through corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting of 2 March, the Council reiterated that the implementation of the commitments to the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development must continue to have the highest priority and to be integrated into all relevant internal and external policies of the European Union. I take that point as relating specifically to Mrs Frassoni's point. The Council expects that all Member States will defend these common views in all international fora, including the World Bank. If I disappointed you in my earlier contribution, I hope I have made up for it now! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
