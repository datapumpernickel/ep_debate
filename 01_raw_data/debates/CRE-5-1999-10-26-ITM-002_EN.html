I have had a seat in this Parliament for ten years now, and I have never had the opportunity to speak for fifteen minutes before, which, considering my temperament, has been a long-lasting source of frustration, and is finally coming to an end today!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you, Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that preparing the budget of the European Union is a strange process indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">What sort of budget is it, then, which is based on the principle that the budgetary authority and Parliament vote on the expenditure but not on the revenue? What sort of budget is it which necessitates making a distinction between two well-defined categories of expenditure, one being the compulsory expenditure determined by an authority – the Council – the other being the non-compulsory expenditure determined by Parliament? This distinction is patently absurd. What sort of budget is it which subordinates the budgetary authority to legislative texts to the extent that some figures and some amounts expressly stipulated in the legislation and in the programmes are so restrictive that they tend to reduce the budgetary procedure to a set of legislative adjustments which have already been carried out?</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is thus strange, to say the least. But it is even stranger still to draw up a budget within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement and the budget perspectives which we have. Effectively, we are working within the framework of the Financial Perspective decided in Berlin. Well, the least that one can say is that the programming exercise which took place there was quite strange, firstly in terms of its duration (setting a seven year programme in two days of Council meetings was perhaps risky) and vague in terms of the amounts. Today, we can see that however one approaches these needs there is only a very approximate matching of budget estimates and actual requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In Category 1 on agriculture and market expenditure, we are already up to the limit of the margin. In Category 4 on external action – I shall return to this point – the Category is literally at bursting point. In Category 5, we do not know what the administrative reform of the Commission will cost, but it is with great concern that we see the problem of pensions taking shape before suitable expenditure has been envisaged; and in Category 7, intended for pre-accession preparations, the movement developing in favour of faster and wider enlargement, if I may say, is not supported by suitable appropriations. Countries such as Cyprus and Malta are in an uncertain situation already. The budget programming exercise was, therefore, vague, but also very restrictive for the European Parliament because, for the first time, we are working within a framework where we have obtained less flexibility in exchange for – not more money, as previously, but less money. The situation is inherently paradoxical.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter becomes thoroughly surreal when we tackle the subject of the financial year 2000, as the European Union is experiencing an absolute contradiction here. On the one hand, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the implementation of the single currency are creating new burdens, whilst on the other hand, the planned enlargement effectively entails an additional financial load. Finally, the increased weight of the Union’s responsibilities, especially as regards Kosovo, are also creating far greater tensions, far greater pressure on the budget. Well, confronted with this situation, some institutions, particularly the Council – I am wondering what the Commission will decide in the end – tell us that we are going to finance more policies, with more partners, take on more responsibility, with less money. I must say, Mr President, there is a paradox here, a contradiction which Parliament does not wish to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation we find ourselves in. Budget 2000 is characterised by the paradox that I have just mentioned, of how to finance more with less money, but will also, I hope, be characterised by Parliament’s rejection of this paradox. How do the institutions seek to address this paradox? Well, by two methods, both very simple and equally reprehensible. The first involves cutting expenditure, and the second sacrificing traditional priorities in favour of new priorities. I find the draft budget, which the Council has submitted for our approval and whose inspiration we are objecting to, quite worrying from that point of view. When I speak of cutting expenditure, I am thinking, for example, of expenditure under Category I for which a cut has been proposed. The Commission already started off on the wrong track. Perhaps today it is starting to experience some regrets? In fact, across-the-board reductions have been proposed to us, which are not in line with the real situation. The same applies to payments. As regards structural funds, we have considerable payment requirements, due both to the implementation of the new instrument of Agenda 2000 but also to the vast weight of past commitments. This death rattle, which is the last gasp of the dying man – forgive me, interpreters, this is impossible to translate, it means the final hour has come – is the last gasp when the programmes of previous years finally expire.</p>
<p class="contents">All that entails considerable burdens as regards payment and, in this respect, the Council follows neither the Commission, nor us, and proposes a perfectly unacceptable reduction in relation to the preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Having demonstrated some vagueness on this question in recent months, the Commission seems recently to have returned to more laudable sentiments, which we are pleased to see. Thus, on the one hand, we have a cut in expenditure and the appropriations allocated to existing and future requirements. The same is true for expenditure under Category 5.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the priorities of yesterday and today are being sacrificed, and this is unacceptable, in favour of the priorities of tomorrow. I think this is a serious point. In Category 4, the Council makes the completely unacceptable proposal to implement across-the-board cuts without any justification whatsoever. We have clearly understood that there must be reductions on condition that they are at least justified, but in this case they are not, I must insist. We have been told that it is necessary to finance Kosovo, Morocco, Timor and Turkey. Admittedly, Timor and Turkey are not in the draft budget yet, but we shall surely find them there in time. We have been told that all this must be financed and, in return, there will be cuts in all the traditional expenditure for the development appropriations for Africa, Asia, Latin America. Parliament says no. We shall not accept making Africa, Latin America and Asia, everyone bar Europe, pay for Kosovo. It is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">More generally, we consider the fact that the Commission is undertaking this type of approach for the future to be very serious, since we shall have to bear the cost of these new responsibilities from structural funds. And we cannot expect to pay for the Balkans, for example, in a structural and lasting way by means of enlargement, etc. No, we cannot get out of it that way. You cannot get the foot of Charlemagne’s mother, <span class="italic">Berthe au grand pied</span> (Berthe Big-Foot), into Cinderella’s slipper. It is just not possible. You have to make the shoe bigger, to take into account the needs we must fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation as we see it. We are waiting for the Commission to make a statement on this point. The PDB obviously did not take some items of expenditure into account, but it was very clear. All we want to know now is whether the Commission is going to defend it. I should warn you, Commissioner, of a proposal which may be made to substantially reduce your own PDB, for it would be a serious matter if the Commission were not even to defend its own policy. We would be in a situation even more paradoxical than I am willing to accept, setting up Parliament as defender of the Commission’s preliminary draft budget, replacing the Commission as guardian of the major policies decided by the European Union. I should warn you on this point. It would be a serious matter.</p>
<p class="contents">What is Parliament’s response? It is quite simple. It rejects this attitude. It considers, on the one hand, that it is necessary to face up to the new priorities. There are essentially two of these. Firstly, administratively, it is necessary to deal with the consequences of the institutional crisis which we experienced last winter. This entails active support, and even an active demand for administrative reform addressed to the Commission. All the measures relating to TAOs have that objective, in the same way as all the appropriations for OLAF. The call for the creation of a new administrative instrument, a sort of executive agency or decentralised executive unit, fulfils a real need. We have initiated contacts with the Commission which seem to be productive. We have heard the words, we are now waiting for the deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Internationally, our second priority is effectively to finance, by some means, the main priorities: Kosovo with up to EUR 500 million, the agreement on Morocco with up to EUR 125 million, the programmes for Turkey and Timor with up to EUR 50 and EUR 30 million. In this regard, we have voted on an amendment which corresponds to a serious political commitment from this Parliament, even if we vote it before Category 4, which means that it does not to date have the status of an amendment, but it does constitute a commitment on the part of this House to vote in these appropriations at second reading, especially regarding the Morocco agreement which is one of Parliament’s political priorities. </p>
<p class="contents">The second approach adopted by the European Parliament is not to sacrifice our traditional priorities. This is why we have rejected en masse all the across-the-board cuts proposed by the Council and we consider that we must face up to requirements in the areas of redevelopment, development, international development, social actions and environmental policy. We must face up to all these expenses with great energy and we must not accept their being sacrificed.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now, I left out one essential point, research, within the framework of administrative reform. We are waiting to formalise in writing and give concrete expression to the agreement which is in the pipeline between Commission and Parliament in order to guarantee better budgetary use of the appropriations under this sub-section.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore facing up to the new priorities but we are not sacrificing our traditional priorities. Thirdly, this requires us, and this is the essence of the problem, to respect fully the terms of the interinstitutional agreement, but in a dynamic fashion. We are respecting this agreement. We are respecting all the ceilings in all the categories and we are even leaving substantial margins in some of them, such as Category 1B on rural development. But we want a dynamic interpretation, in accordance with what has been said and, in particular, we want an ongoing structural review of Category 4, rather than an annual review. There are new expenses which must be funded. These expenses are not just for one year, they are ongoing expenses. This must be translated into a net increase in the appropriations allocated to Category 4 for the entire period and not just for the budget for the year 2000. This is a demand which Parliament is making and I would like to see it taken fully into account by the Commission and by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the way out of this situation? The Council still has time to think and a choice of means. There is the time to think as we are to meet on 25 November, Saint Catherine’s Day. There is a French saying “<span class="italic">A la Sainte-Catherine, tout arbre prend racine</span>” (on Saint Catherine’s Day, every tree takes root), so I hope that the budget tree will take root. As for the choice of means, Madam President, you and your colleagues have to choose, for I know that you cannot do everything, and I am sorry for this, between two avenues. One alternative is to review the Financial Perspective of Category 4 which will make it possible for us to vote in this budget by facing up to the new priorities in accordance with the commitments undertaken at the time of negotiating this agreement. If you do not want to go down this road, Parliament shall then be forced to resort to the strict application of Article 272 of the Treaty, and to assume the powers, which it is entitled to do, regarding both commitments and payments, and to vote for appropriations which match up to the level of the commitments which are the political commitments of the European Union and in strict observance of the Treaty. Madam President, the ball is in your court.</p>

The increase is EUR 44 million, or 3.5%. The margin for manoeuvre calculated from Category 5, as referred to in the Financial Perspective, is EUR 135 million. </p>
<p class="contents">This draft budget focuses mainly on rental arrangements and renovation solutions for the places of work of the institutions. The intention is for the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions to move into Belliard buildings I and II once they have been vacated by Parliament and renovated. The joint organisational structure for these committees will be accommodated in the Bertha von Suttner Building, the former Montoyer building. The rented premises that have been in use until now will be given up. For these solutions to be successful, seamless cooperation is required on all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget provides for new posts to be created at both Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee to render the administration of the buildings more efficient. One condition of adequate administration, however, is that the division of labour and of responsibility of both Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee be clarified both interinstitutionally and with regard to the individuals involved. This division of responsibility must be considered a pre-condition of the project’s success. There are two reserves attached to the buildings, which are still in the budget. A reserve of EUR 7.4 million has been entered in Parliament’s expenditure for the rental of the Belliard buildings, as the rental agreement between the owner and the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions is still under discussion. If the rental agreement is finalised before the end of the year, the amount mentioned will be deducted from Parliament’s budget, as the European Parliament budget is, at present, 20.11% of Category 5, whereas Parliament has itself declared a ceiling of 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two reasons why this ceiling has been exceeded. The first is the double budgeting relating to rents, as explained above. The other reason is the reserve related to the Statute for Members. In the spring a reserve of EUR 60 million was included in the parliamentary budget for remuneration related to the Statute for Members. Parliament has demanded that Members’ remuneration be paid from parliamentary funds, and the Council has supported this initiative. Because at present it is the Member States that pay the salaries of MEPs, this will mean that the payments are transferred from the Member States to the European Union. It is quite natural to suppose that a new expenditure item of this kind, which at the same time would diminish Member States’ costs, cannot be included under the ceiling for formerly approved expenditure. If we take these two expenditure items into account, Parliament’s share of Category 5 would be 18.97%, which is in line with the principles of budgetary discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">Another priority of this draft budget is increasing the resources of the Court of Justice of the European Union, especially their translation resources. According to the Council’s proposal, the Committee on Budgets has recommended that altogether thirty new translator’s posts be established, and that a substantial appropriation be earmarked for paying freelance translators. As appropriations have been proposed for improvements to the electronic office, the Court of Justice can expect a clear increase in resources. After this, we expect that the Court of Justice will be able to cope better with its workload, reduce the number of documents left untranslated, and serve Member States, citizens and businesses better in the interpretation and application of European law. Parliament has both the right and the obligation to demand clear results.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussion of this year’s budget made it clearer than ever that there is a need to move towards activity based budgeting. The institutions have an abundance of staff, and it is to the benefit of all that they be used efficiently. The present administrative model, however, gives cause for criticism. The institutions seem extremely interested in inventing new requirements and job descriptions, so as to be able to justify their ever-growing need for staff. It is very difficult for Parliament, as a decision-making authority, to scrutinise the chart of its own four thousand strong organisation and draw conclusions as to what new posts are needed for what jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Every Member State, however, has had to radically reorganise personnel structures. Jobs have been reallocated, as have posts and staff. That is why in many cases the establishment of new posts is no longer the responsibility of the budgetary authorities. The budgetary authorities only allocate appropriations to the institutions. There are two advantages to this. Firstly, the overall work of an institution is seen clearly, which means that there is less danger of getting swamped in details. The work of the institutions can be assessed more clearly, on the basis of results, and can be better managed. On the other hand, comprehensive budgeting also makes it possible to clarify and increase personal responsibility. This encourages better and more efficient work, as everyone can find a way to work more effectively and use resources sparingly where the need is greatest. It is high time the European Union switched to activity based budgeting, result-oriented management, delegated power and responsibility downwards, and clarified personal responsibilities. We must require managers and heads of department to bear the responsibility for their own areas of revenue, and for their development and improvement. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank all those who helped me to prepare this report. I would especially like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terence Wynn, who has given me his support in so many ways, both in practical negotiations and at meetings of the Committee on Budgets, and in personal discussions. At the same time I wish to thank the main rapporteur, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, with whom I have enjoyed seamless and smooth cooperation. I would also like to thank all the coordinators, especially Reimer Böge of the European People’s Party and Ralf Walter of the Party of European Socialists for their constructive and pertinent cooperation. Finally, I wish to thank my own group for their unreserved support in every respect, as well as the secretaries and employees who were involved in the project.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The structure of Europe was gradually built up around it, and in recent years it has provided substantial assistance, in terms of both social aid and research to coal and steel firms. The approach of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002 presents Parliament with some significant decisions to make. In terms of budgetary decisions, how should the concluding stages of the Treaty be managed? Even after 2002, will adequate attention be given to the firms and workers in the sector? What bridging measures between the ECSC budget and the Union’s general budget can be devised to facilitate the transition to new procedures for access to financing for potential beneficiaries? The Committee on Budgets invites Parliament to give a clear answer to these three questions, mindful of its prerogatives and eager to make the most of the experience gained so far under the Treaty, through dialogue with the Council and the Commission, which we hope will be positive. </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets – and I thank all my colleagues, from the chairman to all the group representatives for their participation – unanimously proposes the following recommendations:</p>
<p class="contents">1. to reinstate the amounts laid down in the 1999 budget. 2. to redistribute the allocations to the coal and steel sectors according to needs, and in particular, to increase social aid in the coal sector, and research funding in the steel sector; </p>
<p class="contents">3. to ask for additional appropriations to be allocated to finance measures to promote health and safety in coal mines, and to ensure the development of clean technologies and of products with a high added value, in the steel sector; </p>
<p class="contents">4. with enlargement in mind, to ask for part of the PHARE programme appropriations to be earmarked for activities connected with the steel and coal sectors of the applicant countries; </p>
<p class="contents">5. to reiterate clearly the request for a reduction in administrative expenditure, as the sum calculated 19 years ago is clearly excessive for current requirements, and to carry out an assessment of real staffing requirements in light of the Union’s current and future political priorities in this sector; </p>
<p class="contents">6. to insist that the research fund for coal and steel, which will receive the interest from the reserves and provisions determined by the balance sheet is managed by a specific structure – be it a foundation or an agency, according to the wishes already expressed by Parliament – in order to guarantee a degree of visibility of the activities in the coal and steel sectors and to ensure that the representatives of both sides of industry will be fully involved in the use and planning of this fund;</p>
<p class="contents"> 7. to reaffirm that the transfer of the ECSC assets to the general budget will entail a budget entry against both revenue lines and expenditure lines and will therefore necessitate a technical adjustment of the current Financial Perspective; </p>
<p class="contents">8. to provide for ‘bridging’ pilot projects between the ECSC budget and the general budget in order to facilitate the transition between the activities financed by the ECSC and the Union’s programmes, in particular as far as structural funds and research are concerned. The Commission will have to give the greatest importance to the actions for which adequate instruments at Community level have not yet been provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the basis of this comprehensive outline, may I ask Parliament for a vote which is as extensive and united as possible. This would certainly give more weight to our decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, I have heard detailed perspectives and justifications regarding the content of Budget 2000, with particular reference to the European Parliament. The Union appears to need diverse resources, and the most essential questions are gradually beginning to be resolved. With the new trialogue practice, we have been able to discuss many major problems in a positive spirit. The speeches that have been made here indicate clearly the main priority of Budget 2000. It stresses particularly the many current challenges presented by Category 4 on external action, which call for joint solutions by the budgetary authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I will speak generally about the budget, on the basis of contributions from various quarters, and I shall return, at the end of my speech, to the Kosovo or Category 4 issue. First, I would like to comment on the compulsory agricultural expenditure, that is to say, Subsection B-1. The view of the Council is that the Commission’s proposal overestimates requirements for the year 2000. Therefore the Council in its own deliberations reduced this item by EUR 375 million. Overestimation by the Commission has been the regular practice throughout the 1990s. That was also shown in this year’s figures. The same can be said with regard to subsection B-1 on rural development action. In matters of appropriations relating to structural operations, the difference between the Council and Parliament concentrate on two areas: firstly, the size of the advance payment in respect of new structural operation payments, and, secondly, the timetable for attending to old, unpaid, committed funds. I believe that both matters are purely technical. Setting the advance payment at 3.5%, instead of the 4% proposed by the Commission does not require amendments to the legal effect measures. Neither does it in any way affect the total amount of new Structural Funds that Member States will be receiving over the period 2000-2001. As regards old, unpaid commitments, it is necessary to take account of the new spending criteria the Commission has just announced. In addition, we should note that the level of expenditure proposed by the Commission – 48% –clearly exceeds the 45% held to be the basis of the European Council’s own decisions at Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">In internal policies, there are many problems that are presently being discussed in the codecision procedure. It is important that the budgetary authorities respect the ceilings for expenditure adopted in the interinstitutional agreement. This will require even more effective coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">There is significant pressure to develop administration in the Union. The new Commission has promised to issue a report on administrative development in February 2000. We can all agree that only on the basis of the Commission’s views can we comprehensively evaluate the need for human resources. As the OLAF commences its work, we should set great store by the qualitative aspects of this work. Regarding the importance of pension funds stressed by Parliament, we must also expect a comprehensive report from the Commission on, inter alia, reform of the acts on human resources, and other concrete proposals. Regarding the so-called BAT issue, or the issue of technical assistance offices, perhaps the time is not yet ripe to conduct such a laborious reform as Parliament is proposing in the budget for the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding for action in Kosovo and in connection with other external relations will be a challenge for the Union in terms of budgetary procedure and financing. It is noteworthy that the direct financing needs of the Kosovo area are considered to be mainly covered. This was established at the first donor conference in July. The budgetary authorities should now wait for the final, reliable, assessment of needs, which, in my opinion, cannot be expected until next year. The Council, for its part, is committed to attending to the financing needs occasioned by the earthquake in Turkey with the help of a loan from the EIB, macro-financing aid, and the funds targeted at the MEDA programme. This being the case, perhaps there will be no need for a separate financing programme for Turkey. As for East Timor, aid has been channelled there via ECHO. The donor conference on East Timor is to be held in November, so more detailed assessments will be available only later.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned earlier, Kosovo has become the main priority of the budgetary procedure for 2000. For this reason, the Council has demonstrated flexibility in its own procedures, resulting in a reallocation of appropriations in the draft budget for the reconstruction of Kosovo. It would seem appropriate to reallocate appropriations of humanitarian aid for Kosovo, especially as a large number of refugees have now returned to Kosovo, and to a certain extent humanitarian aid in Kosovo would seem to be the first step on the road to reconstruction, offering people at least shelter for the winter. For other budget headings that concern external action under Category 4 of the Financial Perspective, fixed-rate reductions for appropriations granted are a means of preventing hurried decisions to amend the excessiveness threshold of this Category. The reason, as I said, is that there do not yet exist any assessments of the genuine reconstruction requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the concern expressed by Parliament regarding the possible consequences that might result from the reallocation of appropriations under Category 4 regarding Union aid for the least developed countries, we should not forget that, by virtue of the Lomé Convention, the European Development Fund channels EU aid to many of the countries in question. The European Development Fund is not included in the general budget for the European Union: the Member States contribute directly to it and it has its own internal financing rules. Thus, the reallocation of funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo did not affect the European Development Fund. Subsection B7 of the budget is only partly aimed at the poorest countries, and the fixed-rate reduction thus harms countries other than just the poorest. In the sitting of the Budget Committee on 16 July, the reallocation of appropriations for Kosovo was discussed, and it was stated that the Commission should not burden the least developed countries and poorest groups. Furthermore, we were reminded of the Commission’s commitment to an international development strategy, whose purpose it is to halve world poverty by the year 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted that the European Parliament also intends to propose appropriations that exceed the excessiveness threshold under Category 4 of the Financial Perspective, so that funds would be allocated to finance operations in East Timor and Turkey and to adopt the new fisheries agreement with Morocco. On this matter, I would like to make the following observations. The Council is also very worried about the situation in East Timor, but until now no precise assessments of the amount of aid needed there have been presented. The consequences of the Turkish earthquake have required our assistance already this year. This assistance was provided for in the supplementary and amending budget no. 4/1999. It is, however, too early to determine the total amount of aid appropriations required for the year 2000. Appropriations to fund action in Turkey and East Timor should also be found within the framework of the excessiveness threshold under Category 4 of the Financial Perspective determined at Berlin. The Council, furthermore, has accepted that the Commission be empowered to negotiate a fisheries agreement with Morocco. The outcome of these talks is not yet known. I might, however, remind everyone that, in adopting the draft budget, the Council has also reallocated some Category 4 appropriations in order to create a reserve for the funds required under the new agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will briefly comment on the overall increase in the budget and the frameworks for drafting it. On the basis of votes taken by Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, the payment appropriations would increase by over 6%. The corresponding figure in the Council’s draft budget is 2.8%. We have a responsibility to European taxpayers. It should be clear that Union expenditure should comply with the call for budgetary discipline and cost-effectiveness. The Union budget should observe the same degree of rigour as those of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start, I emphasised the need for a swift response from the budgetary authorities in ever-changing circumstances. I believe that the new interinstitutional agreement also contains sufficient means to deal with unforeseen needs. The spirit of the new agreement is clear: we cannot right away rely on the new funds for aid that exceed the total sum in the financial framework. Let this also serve as a basis for adopting the budget for the year 2000. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, through sound cooperation among the institutions, we will successfully steer home the decision-making process with regard to the draft budget for 2000. I would like to thank the President and the Members of Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the budget is the political programme cast in figures; this is the short-and-sweet summary normally used to explain the budget plan. Although many decisions are taken at European level which are not directly reflected in the European Union budget, nevertheless Budget 2000 is a crucial and defining basis for many areas of European policy in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the drawing up of the preliminary draft budget in the spring there have been important events which could not have been anticipated at the time but which will and must be reflected in Budget 2000. Most importantly, this year we have had to experience a war on European soil necessitated by the most atrocious violations of human rights and by a policy of expulsion and ethnic cleansing on the part of the Milosevic regime; a policy which could not be tolerated by a democratic Europe and by a democratic international community committed to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe at the close of the 20th century must not accommodate any policy of expulsion, or indeed murder of minorities. The European Union has assumed the responsibility for financing reconstruction in Kosovo, where it is not just a matter of reconstructing bridges, schools and the technical infrastructure, but rather the total reconstruction of a democratic and peaceful civilian society in the region. I am glad, therefore, that there is absolute consensus, absolute agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on making available in the EU budget the necessary funds for Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is worth stressing the point that everyone is aware of the responsibility and stands by the commitment to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo. The preliminary draft budget of the Commission from April of this year provides for a total of EUR 92.8 billion for all expenditure commitments which may be entered into during the coming year and EUR 89.6 billion for payments. However, as I have already said, this preliminary draft budget of the Commission does not take into account Kosovo, East Timor, Turkey and the fisheries agreement with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council draft reckons with EUR 92.4 billion for commitments and EUR 87.9 billion for payments and the amendments adopted by the European Parliament Committee on Budgets give overall commitments of EUR 93.4 billion and payments of EUR 90.8 billion. Then in addition there are the funds needed for Kosovo, East Timor, Turkey and the fisheries agreement. I would like to add that there are a further EUR 15 million to be financed in the budget 2000 (directly, i.e. not from the development fund) as a contribution by the European Union to debt redemption initiatives for the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given these aggregate figures for four reasons. Firstly: for all three sets of figures in question, i.e. those of the Commission in its preliminary draft, of the Council and of Parliament, the expenditure to be appropriated for the year 2000 in fact exceeds the totals for this year. The reason for this, which must be stressed, is as follows: the necessary payments, e.g. for structural operations in particular, are increasing next year due to the commitments from previous years and the Commission fully agrees with Parliament that it is not right in these instances to appropriate lower amounts than the standing commitments require. That would be a dubious policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: in all three sets of figures some of the appropriations for commitments which may be newly entered into are, conversely, far below the corresponding amounts for this year even though, for example, the appropriations for pre-accession aid, i.e. in the case of the funds which are being allocated to the applicant countries, show a large increase. In short (and I would like to say this in reply to the speech of the Council also) this means that budgetary discipline is not just required of the Member States, but is clearly also being exercised at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: the aggregate figures also show, however, that ideas on budgetary appropriations, in particular those of the Council and Parliament, are still far removed from one another and, consequently, intensive debates lie before us in the coming weeks. Fourthly: the aggregate figures are, of course, also an indication of the work which has been carried out by the committees, in particular by the rapporteurs, and, on behalf of the Commission, I would therefore like to thank Mr Virrankoski for his report on the individual plans of Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Mr Pittella for his report on the operating budget of the European Coal and Steel Community and particularly Mr Bourlanges for his report, which again shows him to be an excellent rapporteur and a master of highly sophisticated<span class="italic"> </span>proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides budgetary appropriation levels, the report deals with important issues of budgetary economy and administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention the issue of the TAO, i.e. the issue of when external offices should be brought in to help. Mr Bourlanges, you quite rightly point out that this is not just a matter of better supervision and better contracts, although these are important issues, but also of the basic questions: “what should be handled by the public administration and what can be done and under what conditions by private enterprise? Therefore, these questions obviously concern the entire Commission staff. The new Commission has been able to meet the initial staffing requirements for the newly established Directorates-General through restructuring. However, the total staffing requirement now obviously depends on the institutional reforms for which the Commission will submit a blueprint, a proposal, in February.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the coming weeks we will be able to bring the proposals in the report into line with the Commission’s schedule for reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the OLAF staff, the Commission will incorporate into its letter of amendment the proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets to provide 75 new jobs next year.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief word on agriculture. The Commission fully agrees with Parliament that the second pillar, the measures for rural development, presents a great opportunity, in particular for agro-ecological development. It will therefore propose in its letter of amendment, an appropriation increase which, although lower than that of Parliament, is nevertheless considerable. The Commission will also take account of the request to provide funds in the budget for the fisheries agreement with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">We are agreed that Budget 2000 should ensure EUR 500 million in commitment appropriations to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo. The Council decided at the first reading to finance an across-the-board cut in the appropriations for external action. You have made it known as a parliament that you consider this course to be untenable. The Commission has authorised me to inform you that the Commission will propose another course which will take account of both the ideas on policy prioritisation and the ideas on budgetary discipline. The Commission proposes financing the necessary funds firstly by making adjustments within the external action Category, secondly by using the smaller part of the flexibility reserve and thirdly by making adjustments between policy areas, which will entail a change in the Financial Perspective. This is a course which was established in the joint<span class="bold"> </span>agreement, the interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, in May of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">European taxpayers would, I believe, not understand it if we simply requested additional funds to finance work in Kosovo without taking the difficult course of prioritisation, which means in practice reallocating funds.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the increasing tasks of the Union in external action will also need to be reflected in the structure of the budget. The budget should be an expression of political tasks and priorities, which ultimately means an increase in the external action Category.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, on the basis of preliminary work carried out by all institutions and, in particular, the reports of Parliament before us, we will reach agreement on Budget 2000 through a positive, open debating process which befits the major political responsibility we have for European policy.</p>

<p class="contents">Regretfully I cannot offer congratulations to the Council for their part in this process. The message the Foreign Affairs Committee has taken from the Council is that they believe we can only pay for Kosovo by taking money out of the hands of those who are even worse off than those in Kosovo. We want to rob the very poor in order to pay the slightly less poor. We want Africa to pay for the Balkans. I do not believe that is the message the EU should be sending out to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">To find the EUR 500 million for Kosovo the Council has proposed an across-the-board cut of 10% in Category 4. Some cuts are even worse. For humanitarian aid, line B7-21, they are proposing a 20% cut. They are cutting EUR 70 million from NOVA: in other words, a 40% cut in assistance to Bosnia, so Bosnia has to pay for Kosovo. We are cutting support for the Middle East peace process just at the time where there is hope for a long-term solution to that process. What sort of political message is the European Union sending out about its commitment to that process?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course there has to be financial responsibility and we have to set priorities, but a 10% cut across the board is not a proper setting of priorities. It is an exercise in indifference and irresponsibility. No wonder the EU’s reputation at the moment is not very high with the public.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other areas that the Foreign Affairs Committee would like to draw your attention to. First, we would like to see proper funding for the Royaumont Process, particularly ensuring that it is a Pillar I activity, not a Pillar II activity. Hence we propose that we should set up a line on the Stability Pact and take some money away from the Meda line in order to pay for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would also like your support for the conflict prevention network, set up as a result of Parliament’s work, particularly the work of Mr Rocard. Now that we have a similar organisation in the Council its work is even more important. I would urge your support for increased funding.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge that financial prudence is not made an excuse to drive more people down into poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful to the commitment that they have shown in the fight against fraud in the European Union and, in particular, with the extra commitment they have made – an extra EUR 9 million has been voted by the Budget Committee for OLAF. This will allow for the creation of an extra 50 to 75 new posts in the year 2000 on top of the 30 new posts voted for in the supplementary and amending budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I should remind you that OLAF needs 300 posts to carry out its duties. This was endorsed by the report of the Committee of Independent Experts. Let us not forget that there are raised expectations in terms of the public’s attitude towards reform of the European institutions. It is essential that OLAF is given the appropriate resources. I should like to remind the Commission that we will not allow OLAF’s independence to be compromised by budgetary gains – a little note there for the future. I am disappointed that the Council Presidency has not referred to this. Are you committed to the extra 75 posts or not? I would be grateful for some kind of feedback on that. You need to show the same commitment to fighting fraud as we are within the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue for the Budgetary Control Committee is the use of technical assistance agencies. In its budget guidelines for the year 2000, Parliament called for the phasing out of the agencies. And for the Commission to provide it with an assessment of its staffing needs. That has not been done. The Budget Committee has entered expenditure on logistical support and technical assistance in a separate section, with 90% of those appropriations in reserve. The Budgetary Control Committee would support this approach. It is absolutely right that those appropriations should not be released until the Commission has defined those categories of tasks that need to be outsourced. We look forward to receiving that information from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On another matter, in 1999 there have been large under-spends in the Community initiatives, the cohesion fund and many other areas. In some cases this is the second or third consecutive year when there has been a large transfer away from particular lines. This demonstrates the need for Parliament to monitor budget implementation more closely throughout the year. The subject committees must take more responsibility for monitoring the budget lines within those areas. If we do that then we can feed that into the budgetary process and make sure that we are more on track during the course of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards Budget 2000, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was working towards four objectives. The first of these objectives was to align the budgetary nomenclature with the priorities defined by the Treaty of Amsterdam and, in particular, the fact that henceforth the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the fundamental objectives of the Union. This is the reason why we proposed, with the support of the Committee on Budgets in this matter, to gather all the policies and budget lines relating to the creation of this area of freedom, security and justice under a single title comprising five chapters corresponding to the main policies dedicated to the establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">As our second objective, we wished to rationalise and restructure the budgetary instruments in the sector of asylum and immigration policy. When drawing up the budget for 1999, we managed to create the European Fund for Refugees. Unfortunately, following events in Kosovo, the Council was forced to mobilise virtually all these resources in order to deal with the emergency situation in Kosovo and in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has proposed that, henceforth, in the area of asylum and immigration policy, there should be two budgetary instruments: firstly, a European Refugee Fund intended to finance by structural means the necessary measures relating to the reception, integration and voluntary repatriation of refugees in the event of a normal flow of refugees, and secondly, a second budget line with the objective of making it possible to take emergency measures in the event of a mass influx of refugees. Indeed, with this, we anticipated the request of the European Council at Tampere, as the Council considered it appropriate to envisage creating a financial reserve, in some form or another, intended to offer temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of refugees. Mr President, this instrument is something we have already proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third objective was to strengthen resources in the area of the fight against crime, and our fourth objective was a budget line making it possible to undertake measures within the framework of the Commission Action Plan 2000-2004 for combating drugs trafficking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The budget contains internal policy lines concerning the Prince programme. This programme covers the public information campaign with regard to the euro which was, is and should be a priority for the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) believes that this endeavour should continue to be a vital policy priority and that a great deal of work is still required before the banknotes and coins can go into circulation throughout the European Union. That is why we support and welcome wholeheartedly the proposals tabled by the Committee on Budgets for an increase in the Prince budget. ECON also believes that funding measures in the field of taxation should be an absolute priority as it is still an area which displays some irregularities in the internal market, and as a consequence, budget line B5-3001 for the completion and development of the internal market should be kept at the level proposed by the Commission in its draft budget. ECON also endorses the amounts recommended in the draft budget as regards the Fiscalis programme in line B5-305. This ensures stricter coordination of the current taxation system. The committee also believes that the provision of quality statistical information should be a priority for the Union, particularly now that Economic and Monetary Union has been introduced in the euro area and we have prospects for a further enlargement of the Union. Therefore, line B5-600 on statistical information should continue to be funded. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, speaking as a member of the Greek delegation, I would like to express my regret at the European institutions for not yet coming up with an appropriate legal basis to enable us to provide assistance to a particular Member State recently struck by natural disasters. There is no such legal basis in the budget and I believe this to be a serious oversight. As in the case of Greece, and in other cases, this shows a lack of sensitivity towards our fellow human beings who are victims of such accidents and to whom we should show at least some generosity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Budgets has let down the European Court of Justice, as has the Council! I know that in the political process law is frequently considered irritating. However, to disregard in such a way the work of the European Court of Justice on European integration and legal protection of the individual is verging on scandalous!</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises as to what role a specialised committee should continue to play when the Committee on Budgets, in a generous gesture, simply sweeps all the carefully considered, moderate proposals from the table? So what role should specialised committees continue to play? I fear that legal protection in this European Union will continue to be limited. It is all too clear who is responsible for this. We should not expose ourselves to the danger of limiting legal protection in the European Union, not least when we constantly talk of wanting to create an area of freedom, security and justice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope he will soon be back with us.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks and congratulations to Mr Bourlanges for his painstaking work on behalf of the Members of Parliament. The Committee on Industry covers 120 budget lines – so you can see our task is fairly complex! We cover the energy programmes, those relating to industry, including small and medium firms, the research programmes under the framework programmes which of course amount to more or less 60% of the internal policy expenditure of the European Union, and the trade and technical assistance lines.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the energy lines are concerned, we were sorry that the Committee on Budgets did not follow our line in increasing the expenditure for Altener and Save. Those are renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes currently in conciliation. If we get, as expected, an increase as a result of conciliation more money will, of course, be asked for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as research is concerned, and after very many long discussions with Mr Bourlanges, I am interested to know what he intends to do. We, in the Industry Committee, do not want the research programmes broken down into dozens and dozens of lines, one for each key action. But we do want to monitor each key action. I think we have reached an agreement with the Commission that information will be provided to us at intervals and in a form that allows us to monitor that spending in the way we want to.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also sorry that the Committee on Budgets did not approve moving the training of the nuclear inspectorate in the former Soviet Union from the external policy to the energy line where that training could be done far more efficiently. We have made this argument very clearly and we will make it again.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as monitoring is concerned, we intend in our committee to take one member responsible for monitoring each of the 120 lines. They will be expected to follow the spending, to look at the way the projects are organised, to visit the projects and to be in a position to let us know how things are going. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is code for saying that the employment committee got pretty much what it was looking for in this first reading and I am grateful for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Others have referred to the Structural Funds. We are broadly happy with the fact that the Budget Committee agreed with our recommendations, so I would like to look instead at a number of subcategories of lines. One that is important to the Employment Committee is that of Social Dialogue. There we have ended up with EUR 4.5 million more than the European Commission were looking for initially. That I think is more in line with the tasks that we are facing in that important area and it includes appropriations to involve representatives from accession countries in Central and Eastern Europe which we think is very important. We have less than we wanted on B3-4003. That is a cause of disappointment because it is an important area with the expected implementation of the European company statute and, we hope, progress on the general framework for information and consultation of expenditure. We are happy that what we were looking for in relation to NGOs has been agreed in the first reading. This, we think, is a very important area – the idea of developing civil dialogue. I am particularly pleased that funding will continue for the NGO platform which I think is an important part of developing civil dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment, of course, is one of the most important issues from the point of view of the Employment Committee. And here, with budget lines B5-502 and B5-503, we have combined some EUR 24 million more than the Commission’s original proposals. We think that is an excellent outcome. We are looking to implementing the employment chapter from Amsterdam and making progress in relation to the macroeconomic dialogue agreed at Cologne. We are therefore grateful that we have the funding to move those important issues forward. Two slight problems in conclusion, President. One is that we still have no enduring legal base for NGOs. I hope the Commission and the Council will make progress on that, otherwise the civil dialogue will end at the end of next year. That would be catastrophic.</p>
<p class="contents">The other difficulty relates to technical assistance and the funds that have been transferred into the reserve. I hope that the Commissioner for Social Affairs will act quickly to provide the information necessary to release 50% at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank Mr Wynn for the cheerful way in which he conducts the Budget Committee, a new experience for me. The rapporteur has done very well given the constraints he has been under this year. Whilst the budget lines under the responsibility of the Committee of the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are not great in monetary terms, they play a vital role in facilitating the development of the Union’s policies, and particularly in bringing closer to the Union and realising the needs and desires of the ordinary citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Budgets Committee rapporteur has acknowledged a number of points we have made and has enabled us to maintain spending in most areas and develop it modestly in one or two. I cannot thank the Council in the same way when I examine their PDB. They have to give greater priority to the interests and needs of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Utilising the amounts determined last year through the conciliation on the Whitehead report, the consumer affairs budget lines will continue to build confidence amongst the public, reassuring them that we are not just a Europe open for business but are also campaigning for citizens’ rights as consumers. The additional monies granted for the additional posts in the Veterinary Health Office in Dublin will reassure our citizens that we are taking steps to protect the quality and safety of the food on their plates. The new health responsibilities put into the Amsterdam Treaty can be developed using the additional monies granted on the health budget line. I particularly welcome the possibility of developing new strategies for dealing with mental health problems and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and CJD. Equally, as we come to the end of the fifth action plan on the environment, the monies available to begin development of the sixth action plan are most welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have a disappointment, it concerns the rapporteur’s approach to the various agencies of the Union, set up by the Commission. I was the only draftsman, along with Mr Bourlanges, to meet the representatives of the agencies and I heard good arguments for increasing monies available to those agencies for the work they are doing with the applicant states of Eastern and Central Europe and for bringing on to the market orphan drugs that are so vital for a relatively small number of people with diseases difficult to treat. I feel that perhaps more consideration could have been given to the arguments they made. I am very disappointed the rapporteur of the Budgets Committee did not accept the validity of the arguments as I have done. I can only hope that in the following years we can address the problems they have identified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is clear and, given that the greater part of the budget falls within the agricultural sector, it was only to be expected. Which is why it is particularly pleasing that, on this occasion, we can state that cooperation has been a whole lot better than in the past. This is in no small measure owing to the committee chairpersons and, above all, the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, but also, it should be added, to senior members of all groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, not all the wishes of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would manage a majority today; we know that. All the same, we place particular importance on not accepting the Council proposals for across-the-board cuts and, above all, on providing for a moderate increase in veterinary and plant health expenditure and in sales promotion. Veterinary and plant health expenditure is not just agricultural expenditure, but also expenditure in terms of sensible, forward-looking consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The new second pillar in the matter of rural development is, of course, a special concern of the Committee. Here we simply cannot understand the reservation of the Council. We are pleased that, in its letter of amendment, the Commission opposes Parliament’s position. The multifunctional tasks of agriculture relating to food, maintaining the countryside, nature conservation and tourism as a job sector of the future which will expand rather than diminish are a major concern for the whole Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council really must accept that, in future, changes will be made to agricultural sector expenditure across the individual blocks of which it is made up. But that must not lead to us pursuing the cheap option and imagining that we can simply free up money for other policy areas by making across-the-board cuts in the agricultural sector, which not only covers expenditure on farmers but also that on all rural matters.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that recent years have seen a convergence of Parliament and the Commission in this sector. The previous lack of vision on the part of the Council must give way to a more realistic approach, not least with a view to what the future holds for us in terms of the powers of Parliament, also where the budget is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate was tense and lively. There were many differences of opinion, firstly on FIFG, secondly on support for the common European fisheries policy by the Council and the Member States, above all in relation to international fisheries agreements such as the most recent one with Morocco, and thirdly on relations between the EU and other international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We appeal for the European Parliament at least to try to maintain the level of appropriations allocated to the common fisheries policy in recent financial years. On my initiative, we in the Committee have drafted three amendments which have all recently been adopted either directly or indirectly by the Committee on Budgets. In particular, the Committee on Fisheries is concerned about line B2-901 concerning supervision and monitoring measures by the Member States, line B2-903 concerning support for the common European fisheries policy and line B7-8000 concerning international fisheries agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary policy variously affects the three following core issues. Firstly: structural operations. At the Berlin Summit, EUR 161 million were earmarked for regions outside Objective 1 areas. That is a truly considerable amount, yet the commitment and payment appropriations increased in 1998 and 1999 and might, in all probability, increase further.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the draft budget does not allocate sufficient money for the implementation of an effective supervision and monitoring policy. In 1999 alone, the Member States applied for more money than was available in the EU budgets. This explains why the Committee on Fisheries applied for an additional sum of EUR 2 million. At the same time, we are understandably reassured by the fact that there is sustainable management of resources, systematic recording of basic data and an intensification of dialogue with the industry. Accordingly, the Committee on Fisheries then made this application a high budgetary priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The third matter is obviously Morocco. We welcome the negotiating mandate which the Council has finally awarded. Finally, I would like to point out that the common fisheries policy – but I do not really need to tell you that – requires major support by the Community. I do not just mean financial support. We are facing major challenges. We must all make it perfectly clear that that the EU, which constitutes a superpower in the fisheries sector, is prepared to stand up for an industry which concerns numerous regions, States and citizens of the Union. The number and quality of jobs is of significant added value to the EU and, as we all know, also plays a crucial role in enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular I would like to thank him for the attention he has paid to liaising with my committee over recent months and our predecessors in the past year.</p>
<p class="contents">My committee has advanced five budget priorities: Objective 1, 2, Interreg, transport safety and sustainable mobility. I will deal with the regional policy priorities first. I agree with the general rapporteur’s comment that the cuts to Structural Fund appropriations are completely unacceptable. So what are the cuts proposed by the Council? The Council is proposing that the payment appropriations are cut by EUR 433 million for Objective 1, EUR 95 million for Objective 2 and EUR 33 million for Interreg. This Parliament enthusiastically endorsed the Agenda 2000 Structural Fund programme. We expect the new Structural Fund programmes to be launched in the coming year with a flying start. This simply will not be possible if these cuts proceed. The Council is advocating a reduction in advance payments to new programmes to just 3.5%. In contrast, this Parliament has previously considered that advance payments at the time of first commitment should be in excess of 10% of total funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, if these cuts proceed regional regeneration will be put at risk. Existing programmes will stall before they are transformed into new programmes. Momentum will be lost. Inevitably the poorest communities in the poorest regions will suffer the most. The bottom line is that new jobs will not be created and existing jobs will be put at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">My committee has proposed 100% restoration of these three budget lines to the level of the provisional draft budget. This EUR 561 million increase in Structural Fund appropriations will allow us to honour properly historic commitments and ensure the new Agenda 2000 programmes hit the ground running. We also endorse, incidentally, the proposed 20% entry into reserve pending the successful outcome of our discussions over the guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn briefly if I may to transport and just say to members that I hope they are able to support the Committee on Budgets’ moves to restore the cuts to the transport safety line and the cuts to the line on sustainable mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by thanking all my colleagues on the committee for the support they have given me through this budget process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not an easy job, there is never enough money, but it is one I would rather do than be the general budget rapporteur. I would like to add my thanks to those already expressed to Mr Bourlanges for the support he has shown to the Culture Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture has not come out of the budget process as well as it wished, but we are doing rather better than the Council of Ministers’ proposal and have figures close to the 1999 level.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main education programme, Socrates, and the programmes of Youth and Culture have been mauled by the Council of Ministers. I would say that the EUR 238 million proposed for Socrates is simply not enough to do a sensible job. Last week I met the Committee of British University Vice-Chancellors. They told me that no-one – student or university – gets involved in Socrates because of the money. They do it because they believe in Europe and they want to make the single market work. But we have to ask ourselves, are the figures now so low as to make the objectives unrealistic? Let us hope that the conciliation procedure taking place tomorrow will recognise the need to give a higher priority to Europe’s students and increase the funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The total for our share of the budget is approximately EUR 600 million, a lot of money until you divide it by 370 million people – less than 1% of our budget, not a bottomless pit. In the year 2000, the EU will spend less than EUR 2 per citizen on education, encouraging young people to participate in exchange programmes or to acquire knowledge of different languages and cultures, on informing its citizens about the future developments of the Union while supporting our audio-visual industry. Of this scant EUR 2 support for Europe’s cultural heritage will be less than 20 cents. The call for the millennium must be EUR 1 per head on Europe’s culture.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are currently engaged in is tokenism and symbolic expenditure only. Even there we manage to get it wrong. I do not criticise individual staff, but I receive too many complaints from prestigious organisations like the European Youth Orchestra, the European Youth Parliament, the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation – renowned organisations doing a wonderful job for Europe and our young people. Not one of those organisations covered by budget lines 3021 or B3-2005 has received a single euro yet in 1999 for their budgets. Can we make the millennium the year when our systems work. Mr Prodi, Mrs Reding and Mrs Schreyer, we are relying on you to do it better this coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish by telling you a story. I live in a small village in Hampshire with a population of 2 500 people. My wife is the chairman of the parish council. I asked her what she spends on cultural, sports and social activities for the village. They spend EUR 50 000, or EUR 20 per head. So if anybody comes to me for European support, I tell them they are much more likely to get realistic support from their village council than they are from the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the European Union, it represents the opportunity to reassert its firm moral duty to extend a helping hand to the developing world; the opportunity to show how much we wish to combat poverty, injustice, discrimination of all kinds, the lack of democracy, violation of human rights and attacks on freedom. In short, it is the opportunity to show our determination to pursue our development policy, even if we must review it here and there in order to make it more efficient and more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the draft budget for the year 2000 gives rise to serious concern. In saying that, I am of course referring to Category 4, which Mr Bourlanges has just discussed at length. In addition to the fact that first the Commission and then the Council have proposed very significant reductions in all the budget lines concerned, we now have to respond to a great number of tragic situations throughout the world. We have to respond to the tragic situation of the Kosovar people and commit considerable resources to the reconstruction of the country. But we must do this by freeing up new appropriations and not by amputating all the Category 4 lines by approximately 10%. We cannot make the very poorest people pay for the operations of the European Union. We cannot set the poor of one country against the poor of another country or distinguish between good victims and bad victims, and I am very sorry that the Council to some extent presented the problem in these terms, by setting different cases of poverty against each other. We need sufficient appropriations to finance reconstruction in Kosovo, of course, but also for East Timor. And, believe me, ECHO appropriations will not be enough to fund everything, no more than transferring appropriations from one line to the next according to current priorities. We also have to finance the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which is a priority for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore invite the Council to review the Financial Perspective for our external policies in Category 4. I believe that Parliament is fairly unanimous on this point. I must also thank, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, both the general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Bourlanges, and the Committee on Budgets, as well as its chairman, Mr Wynn, for the stance they have taken on this matter. Nonetheless, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, we have decided to submit three amendments. The first involves the question of gender. Throughout Africa, women are taking action; they are the driving force, the hope of Africa for the next millennium, and we must support this movement. The second amendment concerns the lines of health, reproduction, and the fight against AIDS, which we propose to merge. This merging must not, however, be grounds for a reduction in appropriations. Twenty-five million people in Africa are going to die of AIDS, twenty-five million potential patients, nine tenths of whom, due to lack of scanning and lack of sex education, are unaware of the danger lurking in their body. AIDS will be the next tragedy in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The third amendment which we wish to submit concerns line B7-6000 on the Community contribution to the operations of NGOs. The draft budget envisages a drastic reduction in the appropriations allocated to this line. Mr Bourlanges proposed instead to increase them, and I thank him for this. What we propose is to amend the wording. This is an amendment which does not have financial implications but which is going to enable the Liaison Committee …</p>

Perhaps that is why the Committee on Women‘s Rights and Equal Opportunities is the last in the series of Committees to be heard this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Women‘s Rights and Equal Opportunities have few priorities: firstly, actions specific to women and, secondly, gender mainstreaming in all Community policies. The Fourth Action Programme for Equal Opportunities expires at the end of the year 2000 and I would like to remind Commissioner Diamantopoulou of the promise which she made to the Committee to submit as soon as possible a proposal for continuing this programme so that the Fifth Action Programme can follow on seamlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">DAPHNE, the programme for combating violence against children, youths and women, must pass through the second reading as quickly as possible in order to retain here also continuity with the promotion period which is expiring. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is asking here for a broad interpretation of the term “health” which covers not just physical but also mental and social well-being. The Community initiative NOW is expiring and therefore funds must be made available in the new Community initiative EQUAL specifically for promoting women. The labour market, education and training are key areas for the active promotion of women and accompanying measures, e.g. support for dependants, play a major role for women in particular and help to make access to the labour market easier.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately it is still the case that in the European Union, we need special promotional opportunities for women also. The same also applies to public relations work and the information society where we should direct our attention to women in the applicant countries in particular. The funds for the European Women’s Lobby, which also represents the interests of women in Europe, must also be made available in Budget 2000. Europe is facing up to its responsibility in development policy and therefore the funds here must not be cut under any circumstances. It makes sense to group together the budget lines B7-631 and B7-6211 into a single line. But this must then be allocated the corresponding monies.</p>
<p class="contents">Family planning and health care for mothers and children are among the most important principles of population policy. Here, women are a key factor which we must use to lead developing countries out of poverty. The involvement of women in social, economic and political life must be expanded. By purposefully promoting women within population and development policy, we can help to produce a stable social background, to modify existing structures and to develop new structures. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is proposing only a few amendments and I would invite you to support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Böge (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, firstly, on behalf of my group I would like in particular to warmly thank the two general rapporteurs for the correct points of focus and the correct strategy which they have developed.</p>
<p class="contents">If in a public debate concerning budgetary reorganisation and savings measures we advocate a limited revision of the Financial Perspective, we are doing this as a Parliament with a clear conscience because in the past, we have always maintained that Parliament was able to responsibly set the necessary European political priorities whilst striving for greater efficiency and transparency in the budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is not a matter of financing new political needs simply by increasing funds. But, on the other hand, current development makes it clear that parts of the Berlin Agreement were not quite so prudent and forward-looking and that there is a need here for further improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address the following comments to the Council and the Council Presidency: you do not need to remind us that we have a responsibility to the European taxpayer and that we too have a responsibility to exercise budgetary discipline. I would much prefer it if in the future the Council did its share of the homework rather better. It really was scandalous that the Council recommended to Parliament granting discharge of the budgets for 1996 and 1997 to the Commission. Since a major part of the Community budget is handled by the Member States, I would recommend that, in the interests of good housekeeping, the Council pay attention in this matter to efficiency, transparency and tidy implementation so that the Commission is not forced in future to repeatedly resort to the funds of the charging procedure. If this part of the job is done, then the Council can feel free to make new proposals to Parliament on how we should conduct ourselves in matters of budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Commissioner Schreyer that she opposed the figures. What was the preliminary draft? What proposals did the Council lay on the table? How is this to be assessed in connection with the ceilings on financial expenditure on which we jointly agreed? We certainly do not want to use up the margins which, in terms of the 1.27% of the gross national product of the Member States, now comprise EUR 9-10 billion. But I would also like to say very clearly that there are international commitments which we have undertaken towards developing countries, towards third countries, which cannot simply be cut across-the-board by 10%! That is visionless and politically indefensible. That is nothing but bookkeeping! The Council really should distance itself from this!</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would also like to make clear that it is not just a matter of setting in motion the necessary priorities for external action, such as the reconstruction of Kosovo, but, so that it is reasonably organised and initiated, the Council must also meet Parliament halfway in the matter of how we should organise this aid and how the future reconstruction agency for Kosovo should really operate? I believe that here also the Council must compromise with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur correctly pinpointed the problems of the Technical Assistance Offices. We are prepared to give the Commission the necessary funds for administrative expenditure and the management of all these projects if in return Parliament is involved in the deliberations on reform. I believe that we can have good dialogue here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take up what my Mr Perry said: multiannual programmes such as SOCRATES and LIFE are indeed programmes which the citizens outside expect from us and here also we should provide the quality and the necessary funds as a contribution to European development, the European integration process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken a first step towards Parliament in the form of the comments of Mrs Schreyer that we<span class="bold"> </span>should<span class="bold"> </span>strive for reallocation, the use of a smaller portion of the flexibility reserve and possibly an amendment to the Financial Perspective. This is a first step but, where cuts are concerned, there is an onus on the Commission and the Council to provide evidence line-by-line, whether it is genuinely the case that funds are not being drained away, or whether the intention is to block the politically desired priorities of Parliament. The onus is on you. Then we can have various debates. I believe that we still have a lot to do before December, before the second reading. Parliament is agreed: we need a limited revision of the Financial Perspective so that, unlike this year, we do not need to again crib our way through x number of different supplementary and amending budgets! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, firstly, Mr Böge, a minor correction: I would like to thank the three rapporteurs, not two. Mr Pittella also submitted an extremely important report to us; I would therefore like to thank the three rapporteurs for the genuinely constructive cooperation which has accompanied the budgetary procedure this year. I must also thank all those who have approached us from the individual committees with their requests and who, in the majority of cases, in the vast majority of cases, have shown a great deal of understanding for the fact that in a limited framework much is desirable but not everything is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing here with monies which are of course limited, and indeed limited with our approval, but which must reflect the tasks which we have carried out at European level. The European Union budget for the year 2000 is a special budget, not just because it was initiated by the old Parliament, but because there was also a binding interinstitutional agreement which we adopted at the same time and which has had to be continued after the re-election. It is this interinstitutional agreement which restricts us, but which has also opened up additional opportunities for us; I shall come back to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Budget 2000 is noteworthy because this year we are entering the period of the next Financial Perspective, which runs to 2006, and today we must put down important markers for the coming years. Fourthly, following the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union is in a situation of facing many new challenges, for example in matters of internal policies, the area of freedom, security and justice, the employment chapter or increased opportunities in health protection and even consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">However, additional tasks also require that we make available the necessary funds, since otherwise it is nothing more than lip service and budgets should not be mere lip service. We must, therefore, clearly define our priorities and make it very clear what they are. We have done this in the past and will do it in the future. Turning to the President-in-Office of the Council, I must say: obviously for us this is about people, people in the form of the taxpayer who must raise what we spend here, but also the people to whom the money must be made available, for whom we are deciding policies. We are not making policies as a game between the Commission, the Council and Parliament for our own benefit, but in order to create the best possible conditions for the development of the European Union and for the people with whom we are dealing.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past we have placed great importance on the citizens being able to verify that we ensure careful handling of our taxes. In terms of appropriations which concern commitment appropriations, Budget 2000 is lower than the budget 1999. Just go to the finance ministers in your Member States and tell them that they must submit a budget plan which is lower than the plan for the previous year. I would like to see that. That is the first thing we must get on top of. Here we are acting accordingly and anyone should be aware of this if they come to us and say that we only want increases. That is not the case. We handle the money very, very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">However, because we are working with and on behalf of people, one of our particular tasks is Category 4, external action. Here the Council has actually come up and said: we want to finance an important future task and an important current task which must be spread over the coming years, i.e. aid for the people of Kosovo. To finance that we are carrying out a 10% cut in all lines.</p>
<p class="contents"> Mr Böge said that this is visionless and this is a neat term. Are you aware, for example, that in these lines we must then cut by 10% financial aid for Israel and the Palestinian people, i.e. the aid for establishing peace in the region? Are you aware that we must cut by 10% population programmes and funds for combating the scourge of AIDS in developing countries? Are you aware that tackling anti-personnel mines, which is also in our budget lines, will have to be cut by 10%, or that we must cut by 10% measures by non-governmental organisations in developing countries, e.g. for street children in Guatemala or in other regions of the world because we do not want to have any vision, because we do not want to take a close look at where these funds ought to come from? This cannot be the policy which we want to pursue. An across-the-board cut with the lawnmower is indefensible and, therefore, we must and will fight it and we will cite Category 4 as part of the interinstitutional agreement. Although it is difficult, we will observe the other parts of the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have problems with other categories, e.g. Category 3, which contains the traditional focal points of our policy: environmental policy, youth training programmes, research and trans-European networks with their possibilities for creating jobs and improving our competitiveness in global dealings. Here also things are very tight because we are outlining ever more tasks but are not getting the necessary funds. We are shifting tasks from national to European level, <span class="italic">expressis verbis,</span> but then we are not getting the appropriate financial resources. This cannot be a sound policy. We need to discuss this. All the same, within this Category we will not endeavour to increase the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the interinstitutional agreement, we have established that, in future, agricultural policy too can be definitively co-decided by us. In future, we cannot just promote the production of individual products, but the development of rural areas. This is an extremely important matter for us, and finally, allow me to say something on staffing policy. In this too we have acted extremely responsibly, as in previous years. Except in two central areas, we have not provided for additional jobs. OLAF must be strengthened, whilst the second area concerns veterinary protection and food controls, where we have made a very modest increase of five staff. This much we owe to the people, who demand that we ensure that they have safe food to eat. These, in brief, are the focal points.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mulder (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I too would like to begin by thanking the three rapporteurs for leaving no stone unturned in their work. I would particularly like to thank Mr Bourlanges. I have often noticed that it takes him less than 15 minutes for him to win various people over with his eloquence. We adopted the Financial Perspective in May this year and it is a shame that we did not manage an absolute majority. We managed an ordinary majority. But at least we managed some kind of majority and so I think we should respect the Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">My group believes that we should in fact do this as often as we possibly can. There is one category in which this it is difficult to do so and I intend to take this up again at a later stage. It is Category 4. In broad terms, I would like to lend firm support to the position adopted by the rapporteur where his policy on TAOs, the<span class="italic"> </span>Technical Assistance Offices<span class="italic">,</span> is concerned. If we look at the events of the past year we have no choice but to make this issue as transparent as possible. We must know what concerns the public sector and what concerns the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us just go through the various categories. Firstly, Category 1: agriculture. For around three years now we have had a new procedure for this: the ad hoc procedure. We are due to receive a report from the Commission at the end of this week containing the most recent estimates of how much agriculture will cost in the year 2000. I have no idea how the Council is able to determine where cutbacks can be made as early as July. A percentage cut in agricultural expenditure in all the lines is out of the question. It simply cannot be done. We must wait to see what the estimates are and after next week we will be in a position to talk about what exactly it is that agriculture needs. I feel that the course of action taken by the Council is very much against the spirit of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the innovations in agricultural expenditure are concerned, Category 1B, we firmly endorse those amendments that say that we must do something about the nitrate problem in Europe. We also feel that something must be done in terms of a quality-control policy for European agricultural products. Exactly one year ago a report on this was unanimously adopted in this Parliament and it happens to be the case that I was the author of it.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Category 2 is concerned, we believe that the payment appropriations must reflect actual needs and I think that we need to have another exchange of ideas on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Category 4 is something my group has discussed intensively and indeed it continues to do so. I believe that I can put the rapporteur’s mind at rest. A majority of people supports his position. The majority of people believe that it will not do to make cuts in funds for other countries that need help. We must pay this money. The same group of people feels that Kosovo is part of Europe and ought to be given priority. Turkey must be helped and East Timor must be helped. There is also another group of people, probably a minority – and the rapporteur will not be surprised to hear that I am one of them – that believes that the figures need to be scrutinised once again. Can Kosovo really absorb the 500 million when its gross national product is between EUR 800 million and EUR 1 billion? I would be pleased to have another look at exactly how this has been calculated some time. I also feel that as much attention as possible must be given in the coming months to seeing if we can still solve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say something about expenditure on administration. We consider it to be essential that the rapporteur and the rapporteur for the year 2001 get down some time to answering the question as to what exactly comes under part A of the budget and what comes under part B. Turning now to Category A-30 in particular: when can an aid organisation call upon EEC funding? The criteria for this are far too opaque to our mind. What does have a bearing on expenditure on administration? We hear this day in day out and many of us are uncomfortable with it. The proportion of elderly people within society continues to increase. The pension problem in Europe must be given serious consideration at some stage. I too believe that this will be a fine task for the Commission to attend to. </p>
<p class="contents">The phase we are about to enter between first and second reading will be particularly interesting this time round. I feel we must carefully examine all the headings once again for whichever way you look at it, a rigorous budget is what we need at this moment in time and that is what we are all going to have to strive for.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Buitenweg (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Three rapporteurs and many draftsmen of opinions. Mr President, on behalf of the Green Group I would like to say how obliged I am to them for their endeavours, which have resulted in the piles of reports that I have here before me. Unfortunately I am only in a position to single out a few points and I intend to start with expenditure in the field of external action, since it is this area that is at the heart of this discussion on the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur’s disapproval of the European Commission’s proposal to organise development cooperation under geographical headings from now on and to reduce thematic budget headings. It is by using the horizontal approach that we are in fact able to boost precisely those activities relating to subjects which we make our political priority: human rights, the environment and emancipation for example. Four years after reproductive rights were fought for at the United Nations conference in Beijing, the European budget heading on this is being torpedoed. I am very pleased that the rapporteur still put this right in his report. What is a pity is that this subject is going to be added to the budget heading on AIDS. Condoms seem to me to be a common denominator but there are also other aspects to the right of women to self-determination over their bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support what the rapporteur has to say on financing the reconstruction of Kosovo. Minister Siimes reminded us of our obligations to the taxpayer and that the money must be spent wisely. I think that is precisely our point. The Kosovo pot is being filled at present by means of an across-the-board cut of 10% in expenditure on external action. This drip-feed method is, in every respect, a short-sighted approach of the kind used in accountancy and does not testify to a serious weighing up of priorities. The question that needs to be asked most is whether or not this amendment to an EU external policy area will also have its advantages in the long term. Mr Walter has already mentioned a number of examples. There will be less money for the peace process in the Middle East; less money for projects aimed at reintegrating demobilised soldiers into society. The lesson Kosovo has to teach us is not being taken to heart. There is less money being invested in conflict prevention. My group therefore believes that the reconstruction of Kosovo should be financed by raising the ceiling on Category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial assistance for East Timor and Turkey will, however, be more limited in scope. I agree with Mr Mulder that there is a case here for looking at the possibility as to whether the money can be found in the existing budget. This will certainly mean setting priorities, and that being the case, using the European budget to subsidise large enterprises’ exports will not be one of my first priorities. It may also be possible to create some room for manoeuvre – and that is perhaps something for discussion with the Council – by taking the EUR 89 million destined for humanitarian activities in Kosovo out of the humanitarian aid pot and carry it over to the total financial package for the region. These differences must not, however, be allowed to conceal – and I said earlier that I share the rapporteur’s opinion – the fact that more money must be made available for external policy because it is unacceptable to allow Kosovo to suffer on account of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major point of discussion in the Committee on Budgets was the subsidising of non-governmental organisations. Budget heading 3021 – Mr Perry has already made reference to this too – contains a list of organisations awarded a precise amount. I do not intend to call the work of these organisations into question here, but I do feel that it is appalling that Parliament is going to have to be drafted in where the granting of individual subsidies is concerned. It is understandable though, from the point of view of the organisations concerned, for the Commission is failing badly in its tasks if organisations have to wait a year and a half for subsidies to be awarded or if criteria are changed in the meantime. The amount of red tape involved has to be seen to be believed. That is precisely what puts a brake on initiatives from EU citizens. The reform of the Commission is therefore also going to have to play its part in improving service provision by ensuring that money is spent efficiently, in a transparent manner, and also in accordance with the political choices of the budgetary authorities. That is not to say that the choices made by the budgetary authority itself are always rational. The cultivation and export of tobacco is being subsidised to the value of almost EUR 1 billion for example. In addition, we spend several millions a year on informing people about the negative consequences of smoking tobacco. How can we still justify this? Accordingly, my group proposes that we should reduce this tobacco subsidy by 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, Mr President, relates to the Members’ voluntary pension scheme. This became the talk of the town because the affiliated Members were receiving extra pensions from European resources through this arrangement. This will all be gone into at length during the negotiations on the Statute and I will not attempt to prejudge any decision on this at this early stage. What I do want us to achieve in the course of these negotiations is to see the pension fund become independent of Parliament, both in terms of its administrative and political structure.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this point of view, I think there is a singular contradiction between piling on the tasks assigned to the European Union, while subtracting the resources necessary to fulfil these tasks. The iron logic of the budgetary Stability Pact does not go at all well with the ambition for a Europe of greater social justice and greater solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me sum up as follows for the benefit of the uninitiated, by which I mean our fellow citizens, in order to make explicit the main themes of the draft budget submitted to us by the Council of Ministers. Agricultural expenditure: a systematic 10% cut of all the credit lines in relation to the Commission’s preliminary draft budget, without even examining the specific requirements, case by case. Structural Funds: appreciable reduction in the regional aid appropriations. Internal policies, that is, excluding research and networks, all policies supporting employment, youth, training, the environment, culture: a reduction of nearly 18% in relation to our current budget. External policies, especially in the area of cooperation with the countries of the South: the chop. Examples have been given already, but let me add: food aid down by 9% in relation to the present, cooperation with Africa down by 12% and aid to NGOs down by 35%.</p>
<p class="contents">This choice is completely unacceptable in the opinion of my group. The reason put forward to attempt to justify these swinging cuts is the unexpected appearance of new priorities, which are incidentally perfectly legitimate, such as aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, our contribution to the construction of East Timor now that it has been liberated, our solidarity with the earthquake victims in Turkey and financing of a fisheries agreement with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">This argument is inadmissible, in my opinion. It is not acceptable to rob Peter to pay Paul. While my group is by no means arguing in favour of recklessly increasing Union expenditures, we still think it necessary, if the need arises, as is clearly the case, to utilise the margin for the increase in expenditure which is authorised under the agreements signed between the Member States themselves. Yet, as a percentage of the gross domestic product of the Union, the volume of the Council’s draft budget is less than that of the Commission’s preliminary draft budget, which was already less than that of the Berlin Agreement which in turn was less than the ceiling set by the Edinburgh Agreements. Where is it all going to end? We have to know what we really want to achieve and allocate appropriate resources, within reason.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why my group is requesting, within the limits envisaged under the agreements signed by the Member States themselves, a review of the Financial Perspective for all the items I have just mentioned. And, Monsieur Bourlanges, since he who can do more can do less, we are at all events supporting the rapporteur’s proposal for the review of the Financial Perspective for external policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to some amendments proposed by my group in favour of a study on the application of the Tobin tax in support of the world cultural heritage classified by UNESCO within the countries of the Union, in favour of a freeze on aid to Turkey, excluding, of course, aid to the earthquake victims, until the Turkish authorities change their attitude to the Kurdish people, on the question of Cyprus and on the subject of human rights in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we urgently demand that the appropriations allocated in the 1999 budget to the European Women's Lobby, which unites 1400 women’s organisations and which performs work of a high quality, are renewed in their entirety in the 2000 budget. As you can see, these are common sense proposals on which all progressive Members of Parliament, and even others, can and should agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the same stringency in budgetary matters prevails as much at the level of the States as in the Union, here it is chiefly a response to the demands of some Member States, and we know that the first victim of this stringency will be the common agricultural policy. A gradual decrease of expenditure is being organised deliberately, to the detriment of farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Structural Funds, European regional policy has become a real handicap for France, contrary to the myth complacently propounded by some, including, alas, the current Commissioner responsible for regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of foreign policy, we are of course in favour of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, an essential agreement in European-Mediterranean relations, which are too often neglected by the Union. We are also in favour of financial support for East Timor and of aid for Turkey in the aftermath of the earthquakes. As for aid for Kosovo, let us one last time deplore the bombing of a European State by the countries of the Union. Yesterday we bombed the Balkans and today we must help to reconstruct the region and re-establish peace, but this means re-establishing peace for everyone, including the Kosovo Serbs. We can indeed clearly see what this increase in the total appropriation for foreign policy actions foreshadows. The austerity that the Financial Perspective herald will in fact be a sort of selective austerity: foreign policy rather than agricultural policy. The significant weakening of agricultural policy and the dubious regional policy are elements that our group could not possibly accept. And if there were further need, paragraph 20 of Mr Bourlanges’ resolution, which considers the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure to be seriously anachronistic, would be sufficient to justify our rejection of the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That implied a readiness to observe the necessary budgetary discipline. We must assess Budget 2000 against this background.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur proposes that we should go way beyond the ceiling on expenditure on external action. He is playing for high stakes in so doing; seeing as this will only unsettle matters where the interinstitutional agreement is concerned. Financing important priorities such as Kosovo and East Timor is now becoming dependent on a political game that Parliament and the Council are playing over the Financial Perspective. Moreover, what credibility can a Parliament have when it wants to renegotiate the financial ceiling that it itself agreed with such a short time ago?</p>
<p class="contents">It is far too early to call upon Article 19 of the interinstitutional agreement. We must first look seriously at the various possibilities for financing these new priorities within the present framework. I am thinking, for example, of those areas where there was underspending in 1999 and of the possibility of making cutbacks in programmes with low expenditure figures such as MEDA.</p>
<p class="contents">Next a few words about the Structural Funds. The current problems with the payment appropriations are evidence of the fact that the budget for the Structural Funds has been pegged at too high a level in the past. The rapporteur proposes to incorporate 50% of outstanding payments into Budget 2000. I am very apprehensive about this enforced increase in the appropriations. Can such an amount be absorbed and is the Commission capable of managing this extra money effectively?</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot support those who are in favour of incorporating the resources of the European Central Bank into the European Union’s budget. After all, this would mean the budgetary authority gaining control over the European Central Bank’s capital, which would jeopardise the independence that the ECB needs to have. Furthermore, the European Union is not a shareholder of the European Central Bank. Any distribution of profits would then go not to the EU but to the national central banks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are amazed to see an amendment to the effect that the Commission is attempting to draw up a statute for European political parties. Only parties matching up to this blueprint would be considered for financial assistance. There is no way that we can go along with this attempt at centralism. Drawing up a statute of this kind is a matter for the political parties themselves in the first instance. Moreover, the party organisations reflect national cultures and diversity. Any attempts to squeeze the political parties into a European straitjacket will only serve to widen the gulf between Brussels and the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, the Virrankoski report contains the umpteenth declaration of intent to revise the regulations governing travel cost reimbursement on the basis of costs actually incurred. But are we not getting to the point when it is time to convert words into deeds? Our group put forward an amendment aimed at achieving this but the Committee on Budgets rejected it. That was a lost opportunity and it sends out the wrong signal to the citizens of Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur is to be praised for having achieved it by means of a budgetary procedure which has run its course with the utmost smoothness, even if Parliament is in the process of issuing a major challenge to the Council – a challenge which, in my opinion, is worth accepting. I am referring, obviously, to the Financial Perspective and the need for Europe to prove itself worthy of the role it wishes to play in the world, without making an over-complicated issue of the budget of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999 we had a budget – I say this to the ladies and gentlemen of the Council in particular, I am reminding you of this because it is a matter which affects us all – in 1999, Commissioner, we had a budget of EUR 96 billion. This year, a milestone year, what with the war in Kosovo, the events in East Timor, the earthquakes in Turkey and the commitments of a Union that wishes to take on more responsibility in the international arena, the Council is proposing a budget of EUR 92 billion, that is, EUR 4 billion less than the budget for the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Edinburgh perspectives set us an ever higher ceiling and the Council gives us an ever more limited budget, meaning that it will be necessary to cut back on actions in the field of development, for example, or human rights and many other actions, in order to finance the priorities which have been set, and it is not our fault if Europe is the great paymaster of foreign policy. We shall be responsible for the payments, while other people are responsible for the policy, and I hope that this is going to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will therefore do well, on Thursday, to ask you to go beyond these Financial Perspective. Do we wish to finance reconstruction in Kosovo? Fine. Do we wish to assist the integration of Turkey, including by subsidising its immediate dramatic needs? Do we have a new nation emerging into the international arena after all these massacres which have taken place? Then, let us finance these policies, for heaven’s sake. We have an interinstitutional agreement that allows us, if exceptional events require, to go beyond the Financial Perspective, so why not do it? That would be EUR 1.5 billion more. It will still be less than the 1999 budget, but I think that the citizens of Europe will clearly see that this endeavour is not only logical, but also perfectly feasible at the level of the budgets of our Member States. We would therefore do well to proceed in this way and I think that Parliament should follow through and, if necessary, demand that we have recourse to the former Article 203 of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief word on TAOs. There too I think we are demonstrating great pragmatism. I thank the rapporteur very much. We have an interim solution which, I think, will enable us, by means of dialogue with the Commission, to find an agreement on a definitive solution. I am pointing out this pragmatic aspect of our report for the year 2000 and I would compare it to policies which were rather more extremist in which a clean sweep was made of mini-budgets and then one found oneself with one or two thousand TAOs which could not be managed because the project had been axed in the meantime without any thought as to the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I congratulate the rapporteur. As regards political parties, may I say that, frankly, asking the Commission to lay down the status of political parties – I am referring to the contribution of the last speaker – is neither fair nor worthy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In his opening remarks, he clarified for us the perspective for the 2000 budget in putting forward the idea that we have to have more programmes, we have to have more countries and we have to have less money. There seems to be a contradiction here which, in the longer term when we come to enlargement, when we come to a new intergovernmental conference, we are quite clearly going to have to resolve in the context of our budget procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I would like to focus my remarks on three aspects which concern the running of European policies and the attitudes which we have taken in Parliament in previous years to these aspects. This is in the particular context of the Commission. We, as a parliament, want to make sure that accountability is seen to work for those who elected us and to make sure that we have value for money in the running of the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The first item in internal policy refers to information policy. In the last Parliament we wanted to make sure that we had proper functioning interinstitutional cooperation. We made progress in that respect by making sure that in terms of the general information lines, in terms of the specific campaigns, we had good cooperation on both sides. But we did not arrive at a common framework for this interinstitutional cooperation as we in Parliament had wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some degree of concern at some of the initial moves the Commission is now making in its information structures which we in Parliament will keep a close eye on. In particular, we had asked in the last Parliament, and indeed in previous Parliaments, for the Commission and Parliament offices to work closely together in the Member States. I have put down an amendment, our group has put down an amendment, to make sure that we can have a report from the Commission on how far this has gone. There are still one or two countries where the Commission and Parliament are separate in terms of structure and we need to be particularly vigilant in instances where more than 75 or 80% of the appropriations go into paying for salaries and buildings rather than adequate information policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in terms of external policy, particularly in terms of Kosovo, the hearing we organised a few days ago with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, was very revealing to me, in particular the fact that this is not a short-term commitment. We had evidence from Mr Bildt, Mr Kouchner, Mr Hombach and then from all the other agencies, that this is a long-term problem we have in front of us. We must, therefore, make sure not only that we get proper coherence between the agencies working on the ground but also Madam President-of-the Council, that we do not take decisions which mean that we are spending money futilely because of a Council decision that we must have some people removed some 100 miles away in another place. We must make sure that when we come to Mrs Pack’s report later this week we take the right decisions and that the Council understands Parliament’s feelings on that.</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, we must ensure that we have vision and – as you said Commissioner – we need to have the idea of building civil society in the longer term, not just as some kind of short-term project. Kosovo and stability in the Balkans must be a long-term project. It is us, as Europeans, who have to take that responsibility. We cannot expect others to take on that particular responsibility for us. I therefore welcome the idea of a working committee between the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets. We must make sure not only that funds are properly spent but that the ideas which are coming through are properly coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in terms of administration policy, there are the Technical Assistance Offices. I would underline what Mr Böge said to the Council. The Council has been absent from this debate on discharge. With nonchalant ease, they have gone through approving the 1996, the 1997 discharge, and it has been up to us in Parliament to press for change at every turn. Therefore in terms of EU reform we are right, as a parliament, to say that we do not wish to see new posts until we know where the posts are going. What are the real needs of the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are right to say that we should not have Technical Assistance Offices performing tasks through temporary officials in what are meant to be permanent posts for the Commission. We must find some way of having a dialogue between the institutions over the next 12 months to make sure that these reforms take place and that we have the right kind of criteria for making sure that we are getting value for money from the staff. Otherwise – and I will end on this proposal: we must start cutting programmes if we do not have the proper staff resources available to run them, because ultimately we must make sure that these processes are accountable and we must make sure that we get value for money in the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin, David (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group in relation to the Virrankoski report. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good approach to this issue and to say that the Socialist Group broadly agrees with the matters he has raised.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of staffing, which affects all the institutions, we take the view that we have to find a balance between financial prudence and the ability of the institutions to do their job properly. As we have just heard, there is a danger of the institutions taking on new tasks which they are unable to resource properly. Mr Virrankoski has just about got the balance right. We would have liked to be a bit more generous to Parliament in terms of staffing resources.</p>
<p class="contents">On the European Parliament section of the budget, we firstly welcome the fact there has been a marked change in attitude between the Bureau and the Budgets Committee. As someone who sits on both, perhaps I can comment on this. The way in which the Bureau and the Budgets Committee have worked together to come to a compromise on Parliament’s budget has been very constructive. I want to highlight just three issues within Parliament budget.</p>
<p class="contents">One is the issue of the Members’ Statute. There was a suggestion that we should put money on the line for a Members’ Statute. The Socialists rejected this idea, not in any way to weaken our approach to the Members’ Statute; through our comments we indicate we strongly support the notion of a Members’ Statute but believe it is now up to the Council to respond to Parliament’s proposals in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly with political parties, the Socialist Group strongly supports the notion of European political parties. But you simply cannot put money on the line without having an idea of who is going to qualify for this money, what purposes the money is going to be used for, and so on. Parliament has produced an excellent report – the Tsatsos report – in this area. It is now up to the Commission to bring forward a proposal on how we might implement the proposal for a European political party. Once that happens, again the Socialists would be happy to negotiate the idea of putting money on the line.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and perhaps something that you and I, Mr President, take a personal interest in, the notion of regional offices. The Bureau of Parliament last night decided that Edinburgh, Marseilles, Milan, Munich and Barcelona should all have regional offices. We have put money in the reserve in the budget. When we come to second reading, I hope we can release that money from the reserve and get on with implementing the policy of regional offices. They are vital in terms of Parliament’s strategy of bringing Parliament closer to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The only other institution’s budget I want to talk about specifically and briefly is the Court of Justice’s budget. My view, and I am sure the view of many in this House, is that justice delayed is often justice denied. It is quite clear that the Court of Justice has not had the resources to carry out its tasks properly. The Council has made a limited gesture in terms of improving staffing of the Court. Parliament wants to go further. I hope we will support the rapporteur’s proposal here. In particular, delays in interpretation and translation are causing major problems for the Court. We should do all in our power to resolve this. The Virrankoski report does that.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn briefly to the Bourlanges report which is outwith my own remit. I put on record my support for Mr Bourlanges’ approach to the 2000 budget. He is absolutely right to reject the 10% across the board crude reduction in development lines. It is true, as the Council says, that some development lines have not been used well. It is true that some suffer from underspend. But simply to say that we cut them all by 10% is a very crude mechanism. The Council needs to make a more refined proposal before we come to second reading. At the moment, the rapporteur is absolutely right. Money for East Timor, Kosovo and other emergencies like Turkey, has to come from new money unless the Council makes a more refined proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To pick up Mr Elles’ last point on the Technical Assistance Offices, again, the Council has been silent on this. It was the root of the problem with the Santer Commission. What the rapporteur has said in his report is absolutely right on this issue. Again, the Socialist Group gives him 100% backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jensen (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I should also like first of all to express my appreciation of the sterling work which Mr Bourlanges, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Pittella have done as rapporteurs for the budget. </p>
<p class="contents">As a Liberal, I personally have the basic attitude that we should be thrifty when it comes to public expenditure. In fact, I also think we have tried to live up to that basic principle when discussing the budget. I therefore want to emphasise that, when a majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party gives its backing to the strategy which the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, has devised and which aims at rejecting the 10% general reduction in external expenditure, this does not reflect an unwillingness on our part to make savings. It is, on the other hand, a rejection of the way in which the Commission and the Council have proposed financing the reconstruction of Kosovo. As has been mentioned many times today, it is unreasonable that poor countries in Africa should in this way finance the reconstruction of Kosovo. All the more so when, with the signing of the interinstitutional agreement in the spring, it was anticipated that there would be a need to find funds specifically for Kosovo and that the reconstruction would be expensive. </p>
<p class="contents">It is important that a solution to this problem is found, and it is my hope that, in the negotiations, the Council will show the required flexibility so that we might find a solution within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement. We have started with the assumption that EUR 500 million should be found for the reconstruction of Kosovo. That is the Commission’s figure. But, in the Committee on Budgets, we have also, through a conference among other things, received information to make us question whether that figure has not been set rather too high for the year 2000 and whether we might not be concerned here with a more long-term commitment. This also indicates that a great deal of effort will have to be made to find a solution involving all the various institutions. </p>
<p class="contents">As a new member, I have been very pleased, during the Committee on Budgets’ negotiations, to experience the discipline which characterises its work. We have tried to live up to an unwritten rule about avoiding dotting the “i”s and crossing the “t”s too much when it comes to noting specific budget appropriations. These tie down the administration and can lead to far too little flexibility and a lack of accountability if we go too far in that direction. Noting specifically which funds are to be earmarked for which purposes is obviously an important tool for Parliament when preparing a budget. But any tool can become blunt and lose its power if it is not used with care. Despite our attempts at restraint, there are many examples of dotting the “i”s and crossing the “t”s in the budget, including many good examples. I think that in principle, however, it is goals and frameworks we ought to be aiming for to as great an extent as possible. It is our task as politicians to establish goals and set the general frameworks. We need to beware of specifying too much detail. </p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I want vigorously to back up Mr Virrankoski’s proposal that budgets should be prepared and controlled on the basis of activities and in relation to goals, as he has recommended they should be in his report. Clearly, the circumstances of the past year – what with the Commission’s departure and the reports by the Committee of Independent Experts – provide a reminder that we need to secure for ourselves a foundation which can give us confidence that resources are being administered in a reasonable way. There have been good signals from the new Commissioners, and I think we are all looking forward to fruitful cooperation with both Mrs Schreyer and Neil Kinnock, but they must live with the burden of what we have experienced. </p>
<p class="contents">This is also the background to why so much money has been placed in reserve. The Technical Assistance Offices, or TAOs, have been established by the Commission as a roundabout way of getting administration into those areas which could not be administered with the given resources. And the Experts’ report shows that the necessary follow-up and supervision was not in place. We need the Commission to provide realistic assessments of the need for administrative resources. This is the background to the situation in which payments into the technical accounts have been placed in a reserve, and there is a need for open dialogue concerning future administration. </p>
<p class="contents">As I say, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party attach a lot of importance to a solution being found which all three institutions can live with. The next few years will demand a lot from us. There will continue to be major external tasks to consider. Enlargement of the European Union will necessitate a constant re-ordering of our priorities, and we need to continue tidying things up internally. The prior condition for tackling these things is constructive cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rühle (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think we are heading for some difficult debates given that Parliament is pretty much agreed – even my group – that we oppose the across-the-board 10% cuts in funding. We would like to thank Mr Bourlanges for his preliminary work, even though we certainly envisage the need to amend some points of the negotiations. It has already been mentioned by Mr Mulder that there must still be a critical review of expenditure on Kosovo, of the assessment of expenditure on Kosovo. As a group, we also consider that there must also be a critical review of the fisheries agreement. In these areas also we must ensure more efficiency, more ecological principles. There are some points where a critical review may be necessary, e.g. the export agreement with Japan. Nevertheless, we believe that additional tasks – and in this case many additional tasks would pass to the European budget – must also mean additional funds being allocated. We therefore need a critical review of the Financial Perspective. We would like to thank the Commissioner for intimating this. In any case, we are prepared to cooperate constructively in this matter. We think that Kosovo can certainly be financed with fresh funds, but we consider that the other points – Turkey, the fisheries agreement, etc. –must be financed by the budget for the current appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Parliament has also clearly shown in today’s debate that it is increasingly aware of its responsibility, not just insofar as concerns the effective use of funds, but also the discharging of funds. It is not just a matter of introducing new budget lines and critically reviewing whether all the budget lines can be used correctly and effectively; it is also about ensuring during the course of the year that the programmes are run properly. We are also responsible for this. I hope that these were not just isolated declarations today, but that in the coming year Parliament will also assume the responsibility of critically reviewing in all the Committees whether the appropriated funds are also being discharged properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly address another subject that has also been mentioned here and which will be important. We must, in order to increase trust in the European institutions, also increase the efficiency of parliamentary work itself. In this regard, we have already heard several key points today. Firstly, it is a matter of swiftly developing a Members’ Statute, an Assistants’ Statute. Also, and here I am opposing some of the previous speakers – it is a matter of developing a European Parties’ Statute since I think that, in the area of party financing at European level also, we need more transparency, more efficiency. The voters must know what funds are available in these areas. This, of course, requires that we clearly define what a European Party is and what sort of work is done at European level. It also, of course, requires that we critically and precisely determine what in this case the term “European area” means. How far does the European Union’s coordinating task go? It cannot just be about the EU. It must also cover enlargement in the east. Funds must also be made available for this. But in all these areas we need more transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one more area in which I think that Parliament must also do its homework properly is the whole question of estate management. Here, in my opinion, mistakes have been made in the past. We must therefore ensure that in future the monies in this area are used much more efficiently and purposefully! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, the most striking point about this budget is its obvious lack of appropriations with which to confront specific objectives, given that it is in Category 4 on external action and cooperation that this shortfall is most evident. </p>
<p class="contents">On this matter, I would like to express not only my strong disagreement with the indiscriminate horizontal cuts that the Council is proposing in this Category, but also to state my general agreement with the strategy that the rapporteur is proposing to us. I also agree with the fact that in essence, it is aiming for a revision of the Financial Perspective so that they will respond to new priorities without previous objectives being affected as a result. </p>
<p class="contents">Within the scope of this strategy, we are pleased to note that Timor is one of this budget’s priorities, and we particularly welcome the fact that the rapporteur has accepted the insertion of a new heading in order to deal with the reconstruction of that region, which is moreover what we on the Committee on Development and Cooperation had proposed and approved. </p>
<p class="contents">This is, moreover, the only way in which we can respond to the new situation in Timor, whilst at the same time respecting the legal basis for intervening in the right way. The proposal of EUR 30 million in payment appropriations, however, seems insufficient to us. This is why we want to see this merely as the starting point for a final sum which will be established in the near future and in the context of the Conference of Donors, which is in progress and in which the European Union is participating. By the same token, we would only accept the insertion of this new heading for Timor in a multiannual perspective to be considered within an international framework. </p>
<p class="contents">One final, very specific point, which is nevertheless of great importance: it is essential to ensure – if this has not already been done – that under heading B7-6000, concerning non-governmental organisations, there is a reference to the Liaison Committee in the respective commentary. Indeed it would be absurd if this did not happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I must emphasise the fact that this year’s budget cannot fulfil the objectives set at the beginning, that is, a revival of the Union’s economy and, above all, growth in employment. Indeed, if we start by cutting back the budgets by 10% and we hit sectors like industry, trade, transport and in some cases, even agriculture, we will not be able to revive our economy and become more competitive with regard to competitors such as the United States and NAFTA. </p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that these are our real competitors and that therefore, only budgetary policies aimed at protecting investments and economic growth will allow us to lay the foundations for a Union which will certainly be stronger from a structural and economic point of view. In view of this, I therefore propose that during the next period, we no longer analyse the programmes and their related credit lines for periods of four, five or six years but for shorter periods – one or two years at most – as the rationales of the market and investment in a now global economy no longer correspond to the criterion which the budget itself was built on. In fact, everything is moving much more quickly and much more competitively on the market. This will allow us to intervene immediately in specific sectors and, at the same time, to verify whether our budgetary policy is on course, moving in the direction we set out. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, this is a budget which must be revised by including new credit lines with regard to international interventions. I therefore agree with the line set out in Mr Bourlanges’ report, although nothing must be taken away from the other credit lines that have already been allocated. At the same time, however, we must endeavour to alter the content and rationale of the budget to take into account the challenges that the Union will have to face over the coming years, in particular the fact that the real enemy to be overcome within the individual States is unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, every minute, 380 women become pregnant. Of these pregnancies, 190 are unwanted or unplanned. One hundred and eleven women experience pregnancy-related complications and 40 have unsafe abortions. Every single minute, there is a death following a pregnancy-related complication. Approximately 300 million women suffer from short- or long-term illnesses because of complications in pregnancy. That is more than a quarter of all women living in developing countries. The risk of dying in pregnancy or while giving birth is 1 in 8 in Angola, while it is 1 in 8,700 in a country like Switzerland. </p>
<p class="contents">Only 53% of women in developing countries give birth with a doctor, nurse or midwife present. Seventeen per cent give birth completely alone. At least 60% of all pregnant women in developing countries are anaemic. We know what it means for a family if the mother is sick or dies. The mother’s income goes on food, clothes, schooling and health care. If there is no access to reproductive health facilities, there are consequences for the whole family, not least the children who, in the worst case, also die when the mother dies or else stop going to school and become malnourished. </p>
<p class="contents">Reproductive health is cheap, costing EUR 2 or 3 per woman per year. It is also cost-effective when one considers the consequences for the whole family. This year, almost 600,000 women will die in pregnancy or while giving birth. By far the majority of these fatalities could be avoided. It is therefore incredibly important to maintain this particular budget line for reproductive health. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martinez (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the draft budget for the year 2000, EUR 92 billion, a margin of flexibility for our Parliament of EUR 1.5 billion taking into consideration the Financial Perspective, the across-the-board reductions in all appropriations, or at least in appropriations for agriculture, the lack of ambition, and the usual thin spreading of resources and budgetary gimmickry; in other words, it is a draft budget with no great innovations. It is to Mr Bourlanges’ great credit that he attempted to make the discussion more lively by introducing technical objections. He presented a fine study with a sort of pot pourri of everything he has written since March and all that with the attitude of an official of the French Supreme Audit Office. Well, that is all very well.</p>
<p class="contents">The only innovations are not deliberate. It is the first budget of the 21st century, one which will indeed see the dissolution of the European Union following the Seattle Conference where the Community preference will be abandoned. It is the first budget to implement the Financial Perspective for 2000-2006, which Mr Bourlanges is also asking that we review. It is the first budget which is going to verge on the EUR 100 billion mark if we adopt the amendments which Mr Bourlanges is proposing and, speaking of Mr Bourlanges, who I might call the financier from “Uncle Jean Monnet’s Cabin”, this is a first for him, his first report following the general report, after that of Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, Mr Tillich, Mr Lamassoure or others.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the change in presentation in the form of Mr Bourlanges, 2000 is much like 1999 as far as the budget is concerned. Firstly one finds once again the European Parliament’s ongoing aspiration to make its presence felt. This has been a constant ever since 1979. This is a natural tendency on the part of all parliaments throughout the world. The judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Communities have multiplied. The 1995 budget was even cancelled, and President Hänsch refused to sign, and, every single time, there is this conflict about NCE and CE. Well, Mr Bourlanges is bringing us back to this bellicose atmosphere, even quoting Marshal Foch, which is appropriate, I suppose. In the backwater of the European budget there is not enough room for two crocodiles, the crocodile of the European Council and the crocodile of the European Parliament which, after eating up the Commission by toppling Santer, now wants to eat the Council too.</p>
<p class="contents">So Mr Bourlanges proposes to be voluntarist, he wishes to increase Community expenditure by 7%, he is an ultraliberal who has forgotten the budget rationing pact which he wanted to inflict on others, and he is doling out money because Christmas is coming, 135 million for Turkey, 500 million for Kosovo. First we bomb, then we rebuild. And then there is even East Timor. It is said that it is old monarchs who concern themselves with foreign policy. Of course, the farmers are not entitled to the same largesse, unless they move to Turkey. The only problem, obviously, is that if you keep increasing expenditure, one day you will also have to increase revenue and contemplate a Community tax. But in the meantime, well, Italy will pay, and France will pay another EUR 600 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, as Mr Bourlanges quoted Saint Matthew, by quoting Jesus, asking Simon Peter. “What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? Of their own children, or of strangers? Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.” But with Mr Bourlanges’ tendencies, how long will this freedom last? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Garriga Polledo (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, this budget is fundamental to the development of Europe in the next few years. It is the first budget in accordance with the new Financial Perspective and institutional harmony will depend very much on its efficient execution, and without that harmony – and I would like to underline this – it will be very difficult to implement a genuine European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that the previous Parliament approved, in May, the Financial Perspective for 2000-2006 and the interinstitutional agreement. Parliament approved them by a simple but, nevertheless, clear majority.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that the Berlin Council approved the Financial Perspective by means of an extraordinarily complicated consensus, which began with some extremely divergent standpoints between the Governments and, furthermore, with a European Commission which had resigned and a European Parliament which was at the end of its mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">What I mean by this is that it is now of fundamental importance to defend the Financial Perspective. Only in this way for example can we guarantee the financing of the Union’s structural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear however that the interinstitutional agreement itself provides for a review of the Financial Perspective if necessary. If the Council has not found any other way of financing the reconstruction of Kosovo other than an across-the-board cut in the external activities of the Union, it is logical that the European Parliament will want to defend those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we believe that the notion of defending the validity of the approved Financial Perspective and the notion of needing to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo by means of a limited review of that perspective, are compatible notions. If this is the proposal which Commissioner Schreyer is making, I hope that this Parliament will welcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, we should point out that the commitment presented by the rapporteur on the first reading calms the fears of a significant section of the Community fishing industry. We must remember that the fisheries agreement with Morocco affects almost 30,000 citizens of the Union and that regions such as Galicia, the Canary Islands and Andalusia have a large proportion of their fleet fishing in Moroccan waters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is normal – and this is the view of the rapporteur and my own group – that, at the beginning of the budgetary process, we should be concerned to see that in the first reading no commitment had been specified for these EUR 125 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, and bearing in mind that fishing policy is a Community policy whose funding is separate from the Treaties, a formula has been found between all of us that allows the Council’s amendments not to be rejected in the first reading, including those referring to fishing, but rather defers their approval until such a time as financial agreement is reached with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have preferred to separate the fishing agreement from the rest of the Community’s external activities. In our opinion, this is a confusion of two categories of expenditure and two different kinds of problem. However, it is also clear that the outgoing Commission did not include any indication concerning the renewal of the agreement in its preliminary draft and, for this reason, did not include any appropriation in the reserve. If the outgoing Commission had been willing to take that political step, we would not now have to wait for the second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">We repeat however that we will have a political commitment on the part of the European Parliament to prioritise the funding of the said fisheries agreement. This will serve to calm the fears of all those families and economic sectors which urgently need this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what we do ask the rapporteur and the representatives of the Council is that an enormous effort be made in terms of negotiation. We do not want to reach the second reading with a proposal to break the interinstitutional agreement and thereby end up with no Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat: we need a Financial Perspective and we need the interinstitutional agreement. But we also need credible, and therefore well financed, external European activities. We need both things. And we want the Member States to confront these exceptional circumstances, and the reconstruction of Kosovo is an exceptional circumstance, with exceptional solutions which must not be sought by means of a simple across-the-board cut imposed on Parliament in their lines and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The general rapporteur has said this: we are in a paradoxical position which requires a real solution. The priorities are clear. Now, representatives of the Council, the negotiation must begin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, Mr Virrankoski who has done a thorough job. He came to this position halfway through the year; his attitude has been exemplary and he really deserves the congratulations of Parliament, not just the committee. Secondly, Mr Pittella who, as a new member, came to the committee and has made quite a significant point about the phasing-in of the ECSC funds. It is quite an innovative approach and he should be congratulated. And while we are giving out congratulations I shall also congratulate the Commissioner on her speech which was politically realistic. Well done Commissioner!</p>
<p class="contents">But the main congratulations go to Mr Bourlanges. When Mr Bourlanges began he said it was the first time he had had 15 minutes to speak in Parliament, and my immediate thought was “yes and that will not be long enough”. Sure enough it was not long enough – he exceeded it by almost a minute and still had not said half the things he wanted to say. Mr Bourlanges, I congratulate you on your approach to the budget. It is fair to say there has never been a dull moment. You are pragmatic, innovative and, most importantly, serious. That is shown in your attitude towards the BATs. You may well be known as “BATman Bourlanges” although I cannot quite see you with a cape and mask, wearing underpants outside your pants, but you have done an extremely good job on the BATs!</p>
<p class="contents">This first reading is predominantly about the asterisk amendment concerning Kosovo, the Morocco fisheries agreement, East Timor and Turkey, which was mentioned by the rapporteur. I have to stress this point quite clearly to the Council and – to a lesser extent – to the Commission because I think they understand. We take the interinstitutional agreement extremely seriously. There are forces within this Parliament which would quite happily see it scrapped tomorrow but as far as I am concerned my job – and the job of Parliament <span class="italic">per se</span> – is to defend the agreement which we made earlier this year. We have shown that we are prepared to do that. If we were against it the Category 3 ceiling would have been exceeded, and on that point, incidentally, all three institutions have a problem with the amount deemed necessary for codecision lines such as Socrates. This is not just a problem for the year 2000, it is an ongoing problem. Can I say to both the presidency and the Commission that this is something we need to find a solution to together and quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment for Category 4 should not be seen as Parliament just flexing its muscles. I hasten to add this is not a threat – though that may sound like a contradiction of something I have to say a little later on. But I do not want the Council to see it as a threat. We do not want the Council thinking that we think we have them “by the Balkans” so to speak; we are not trying to squeeze them too hard, though that may be the wrong phrase to use. It should be seen as an invitation for our two institutions to sit down and agree a solution. That is what we should be aiming to do, President-in-Office.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to the proposal from the Commission which will come forward next week. In the light of what Mrs Schreyer has said, I look forward with anticipation. I hope the Council can do the same. But I do need to stress to the Council that this is not the Grand Old Duke of York marching his troops up the hill, just to march them down again. This is not just some act by Parliament to mount a show of force, but at the end of the day Member States will put pressure on individual Members whose parties are in government to get us to change our mind. Things do not work like that because of the majorities that now exist within this Parliament. If we do not get an agreement on the revision of the Financial Perspective especially, I am fairly certain that Article 272 will be invoked. There is no doubt about that and Council should be in no doubt about that whatsoever. That it is not a threat, it is a statement of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate the philosophy of two of my predecessors: Mr von der Vring and Mr Samland. I want the Council to take back this message. What we are fighting for is Parliament’s rights, we are not fighting for money. It is about the rights of this Parliament and that is the message they have to understand through and through. Once they understand that message I am quite sure that the discussions we should and will have will be fruitful. I know the political constraints that Member States are working within, we are all serious about – as you put it – the principles of cost efficiency and rigour. We abide by those same principles but in this instance, after what Parliament has fought for over the years, this revision of the interinstitutional agreement, a revision of the Financial Perspective as outlined in the interinstitutional agreement, is extremely important to Parliament. I hope that is understood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Bourlanges stands before a double paradox – a debate on the budget which deals with expenditure but not income, and then a budget subject to the double conflicting pressure of an increase in the tasks of the European Union and an actual trend towards reduction of the European GDP rate which is reflected in the Union’s budget. The way out of the paradox has been suggested to us and means not accepting tomorrow’s priorities being financed by the sacrifices and priorities of today and yesterday, and consequently, financing new, indispensable priorities of external actions by increasing the Financial Perspective for Category 4. </p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Parliament will follow the rapporteur’s statement and that the Executive Commission and the Council will accept the consequences of this. However, I do not think that everything can come down to difficult negotiations that seek a possible compromise between new resources and the sacrifice of former priorities. It would be a short-sighted attitude which is largely hypocritical and out of keeping with the irreversible prospect of an extension of the Union’s competences and geographical enlargement of the Union’s strategy. This prospect is dictated by the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but even more so by the change in global political balances following the war in Kosovo. One of the few and sure guarantees of stability and prosperity in Europe which cannot be ignored is Europe’s active presence on the world stage and its unequivocal, open attitude towards progressive enlargement policies, even towards south-east Europe and the Balkans in the perspective of that parallel virtual enlargement of peace and security which Mr Prodi has given us a glimpse of. </p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, we need to make a bold choice. We need the hypothesis which is contained in Mr Bourlanges’ proposal to be set out for all to see. We have to say that the emperor is naked! Today the European Parliament, the Executive Commission and the Council have to take on the responsibility for opening a broad, thorough debate in full view of the European taxpayers. In short, we need to ask ourselves whether or not the moment has arrived to entrust the European institutions with greater shares of financial resources. This must not lead to any increase in public spending in Europe, but requires individual countries, all the European countries, to be willing to transfer the resources corresponding to the de facto transfer of competences to the Union. The increase in the Community budget will and can correspond to a reduction in national budgets. The task we have before us is a formidable one which can no longer be avoided, for otherwise the all the European institutions will lose credibility. I hope that Parliament will take this path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The money that we want to spend in Kosovo, Mr Martinez, will largely be spent on rebuilding the 80,000 homes that were destroyed there. Those homes, Mr Martinez, were destroyed not by NATO but by your friends there, that is to say, by certain Serbian paramilitary organisations. That is the truth of the matter and there is no other.</p>
<p class="contents">I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets for their support for Amendment No 69, which I submitted with the support of Mrs Van Lancker and Mr Beysen, as well as most of the Flemish and French-speaking Belgian Members. It provides for an appropriation of EUR 50 million to be taken up in the financial reserves for financing the activities to be undertaken by those producers or Member States wishing to set up an integrated quality control system for the whole food chain. That will make it possible for us to restore the consumer’s faith in his or her food. And so I will take the opportunity at this plenary sitting to say that it is my express wish that the Council should lend its support to this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to affirm my support for paragraphs 13, 17 and 57 of the Bourlanges report. Paragraph 57 relates to the allocation of additional posts to OLAF and the Veterinary Office in Dublin. I endorse what Mrs Morgan, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder had to say about this. Paragraphs 13 and 17 concern the future of the TAOs, the Technical Assistance Offices.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Bourlanges rightly says, the measures produced by the European Commission do not satisfy our demands. I regret that Mrs Siimes’ reaction to the proposals made by rapporteur Bourlanges was one of slight disenchantment. The Council maintains that the European Parliament is proposing very far-reaching reforms and that it will not be possible to accommodate these in Budget 2000. Mrs Siimes, the citizens of Europe expect us to exercise robust and financially-transparent administration and it is therefore absolutely essential that we see to it that the Technical Assistance Offices are gradually disbanded. I would refer you to what Mr Elles has just had to say on the matter. And so it is my hope that the overtures we have made to you do not fall on deaf ears. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in favour of aid for Kosovo. But financing for the reconstruction of Kosovo, and indeed Serbia, where the fate of the population seems not to be of interest to the European institutions, should be taken out of the military budget of the powers responsible for the destruction. The humanitarian arguments which we have heard serve mainly to hide the fact that EUR 500 million of public money, supposedly earmarked for Kosovo, only serve to make profits for big business in the private sector, especially building firms and public works contractors. The Members of <span class="italic">Lutte ouvrière</span> and the <span class="italic">Ligue communiste révolutionnaire</span> have no intention of sanctioning the European budget either directly or indirectly. This budget reflects the fundamental orientation of the European institutions, responsible for facilitating the activities of the large capitalist groups, including in the areas which are most damaging to society, such as the redundancy plans which are responsible for the gravity of the unemployment situation and the spread of poverty. On the subject of internal policies, since the Bourlanges report establishes priorities, the first priority should be to prevent all the redundancy plans announced by Renault-Nissan, Alsthom, Rhône-Poulenc, Hoechst-Marion-Roussel and many others. This is the only way to oppose the rise in unemployment effectively without it taking a single penny from the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This relates to the continuation of the European Peace and Reconciliation Fund for the period 2000 to 2006. As a Member of Parliament for the constituency of Connaught/Ulster I certainly welcome the decision of EU leaders taken in Cologne this year to ensure the continuation of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace and Reconciliation has been successful. I believe it was a wise and sensible decision to continue this programme. For the border county region which I represent it will be worth something in the region of IEP 80 million. But my primary concern relates to the transitional period between the ending of the existing programme and the commencement of the next programme. It is important that transitional financial arrangements are put in place so as to guarantee that those organisations who oversee the fund can smoothly make the changeover from the existing programme to the new programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe a roll-over will ensure the retention of the excellent staff on both sides of the border who have played no small part in ensuring the success of the programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And it is the first budget to be treated in accordance with the Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000 from March of this year. I think that both these points are worth mentioning. Firstly, because I had expected more involvement by the Commissioner in the budgetary procedure; there was actually little to be seen and heard. Secondly, because in the first year of implementation of the decisions on Agenda 2000 there is already a need to discuss revision of the Financial Perspective. This also I consider to be fully worthy of note because the wish list of the foreign ministers, which has grown in recent years, means that today we can no longer cope financially. The buck has been passed to us to bring about a solution in this and to find a way to handle matters from a budgetary point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">To be perfectly honest, I find this unacceptable. First of all, the foreign ministers should be at one with their own finance ministers and then we can also sensibly implement this in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would also like to say a few words on the so-called “small budgets”. Firstly: I do not consider it credible that, as the European Parliament, we should, on the one hand, require the most stringent tests from all other institutions, in particular the Commission, that we should expect the staffing structure to be adapted to new challenges and that we should want to accomplish this through the European budget, when, on the other hand, we are not prepared, here in our own domain, in the parliamentary budget and in the parliamentary administration, to take the necessary action. For this reason, as the Group of the European Peoples’ Party, we have commissioned a study which, for our own administration, will bring about opportunities for staff development and task allocation within our departments. We have – and I would like to state this quite clearly – started an initiative to find a neat solution to the budget funds which we must manage ourselves as a Parliament – I am referring here, in particular, to travel costs. In this regard, in the very near future I am expecting specific proposals from our parliamentary administration which can then be treated accordingly by our Bureau. It must not be the case that the initiative which we as the Group of the European Peoples’ Party have started leads in the end to savings being made where it makes least sense, i.e. in the very place where real work is done, Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Court of Justice, there has been an urgent need to increase the number of interpreters. It must not be the case that Court processes are delayed for two or three years due solely to problems with interpreters. Here we as a Parliament have seen the need and assume our responsibility. The Committee on Regional Policy has now found a solution for solving its staffing problems internally. It is not a matter for the budgetary authority, but something they can do, and indeed are doing, by their own efforts. I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their loyal cooperation and hope that in the second reading also we can adopt a sound budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, as rapporteur for the interinstitutional agreement and the Financial Perspective, I feel compelled to emphasise it.</p>
<p class="contents">Few people interpreted Berlin as a success: the European Council confused austerity with miserliness. I will not repeat my criticisms: I refer you to the Minutes of the plenary sittings.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 25 March and 6 May, we held the last round of negotiations between Parliament and the Council. During that long and intense month of bargaining, Parliament made an effort to persuade the Council that there was more to the Union than the EAGGF and the Structural Funds, that the remaining 20% of the budget was also used to serve the Union’s objectives and that, often, it affects issues which were politically very sensitive. The Ministers implicitly recognised the obstinacy of their leaders, but did not want to find fault with them barely five weeks later. For this reason they only accepted the slightest and most miserly alterations to Category 3 (Internal Policies) and Category 5 (Administrative Expenditure).</p>
<p class="contents">The insuperable stumbling block was Category 4 (External Action) and not even the war in the Balkans persuaded them to accept the higher figure. One of the Ministers who negotiated and who is now a Commissioner came to recognise that it was possible that the Financial Perspective would have to be revised before it entered into force, but that we would have to wait until the Commission provided an estimate of costs. Once again, the Council confused the multiannual budgetary framework, that is to say the Financial Perspective, with the budget itself: a self-interested short-sightedness which hindered suitable and appropriate political decision-making and which led to a bungled handling of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the situation? We are beginning to see the cost of the needs of Kosovo, there has been an earthquake in Turkey and a political disaster in East Timor, not to mention the need to pay for the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which the government of the principal country involved must have forgotten in the negotiations in Berlin. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council intends to resolve the matter by cutting a good proportion of the aid to Russia and the Mediterranean area with the rest coming from proportionate reductions in the other external programmes. Very cunning. The Financial Perspective has also failed to take into account the question of the accession of Cyprus and Malta. I believe that we should bear in mind that the interinstitutional agreement includes a mechanism for revision of the Financial Perspective for these cases, and that it is there to be used when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who keep an empty bottle in the fridge in case their visitors do not wish to drink anything. If the Commission now presents a proposal for revision of the Financial Perspective, think of that bottle, Madam Minister. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent nuclear accidents in Japan and South Korea again show how overdue a new energy policy is. Regarding the EURATOM credits, we in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy are asking that Parliament be consulted immediately. It is incomprehensible to us that our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets cannot support this as parliamentarians.</p>
<p class="contents">The sole purpose of the budget lines in the area of trade is, professedly, to promote exports and create free market access. Yet this so-called “free market” only exists for multinational concerns because, for example, the SME cannot access either the information on money allocation nor the programmes themselves. In the last two decades exports from Latin America have increased by 300% whilst the gross domestic product in those countries has only increased by 3.3%. Since the beginning of the worldwide policy of a liberalised world economic area, there has been a massive redistribution from the rich to the poor, both within societies and between States. I advocate the opposite political trend. The result is that the financial assistance from the EU is indirect subsidisation. It is precisely this which contradicts the declared concept of free trade. Ultimately, what we are seeing here is another of the many inherent contradictions in WTO policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the decision to accept or reject the budget can, of course, only be bound up with how the focal points of the policy match up to one’s own ideas and whether the available financial funds are sufficient. What then, in my opinion, are the main criteria for this budget?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a drastic minimisation of the unemployment which dominates in the Member States of the European Union. Secondly, a reduction in the economic and social divergences in the Member States. Thirdly, the enlargement of the European Union and, fourthly, a peaceful, democratic and social development of all regions in the world. If, and this I am assuming, you share these starting points, albeit there will certainly be differences of opinions as to the ways in which we reach these goals, it must be clear that the budget, as it stands, cannot be affirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schreyer, I am, of course, in favour of reorganising and redistributing. I would immediately switch the focus from large enterprise to small and medium-sized economic policy which safeguards jobs. I would immediately move from an offer-oriented economic policy to a demand-oriented economic policy in order to boost consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is absurd to find ever more responsibilities for the European Union without providing it with the necessary financial funds. It cannot be the duty of Parliament to accept that the Council wants to finance important new political needs by renouncing traditional needs. Similarly, it cannot be the duty of this Parliament to accept that the Member States want to reorganise their budgets to the detriment of the European Union budget. Consequently, I consider that the most urgent task, given that we have a new Parliament and a new Commission, is to give consideration to the fact that the Financial Perspective really must be amended and that the interinstitutional agreement must also be modified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over-budgeting is an unsound budgeting practice, and it is important that it should disappear completely from the EU’s budget. I have noted the Council’s savings in regard to both structural arrangements and the agricultural sphere. These I support, even though they only constitute a small beginning when it comes to the required changes to the EU’s financial arrangements. In a changing world, we must be in a position to make adjustments to the budget far more quickly so that, without increasing the overall budget, we might meet any new needs including, first and foremost, the development needs of the new Member States in Eastern Europe but also the need for emergency aid and reconstruction in the Balkans, which ought not to be financed through cutbacks in support to the Third World. </p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the EU has no need for more money but, rather, a need to use the existing money more sensibly. I want to emphasise that a more professional and accountable administration of the EU’s financial resources will provide rich opportunities to get more out of the same amount of money. Everywhere, there is a need for activity-based budgeting. More cost-conscious administration must be implemented and the wastefulness of which we have again and again seen examples and which the Court of Auditors’ reports have revealed for a number of years must be eliminated if the EU’s citizens are at all going to be able to regard the EU’s institutions as serious partners in the development of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a result, all the efforts made in favour of quality beef, fruit, vegetables and dairy products would be in danger of being wiped out, even though this action is part of the Community action which could be entered in the green box at the WTO. The pretext of setting up an evaluation study does not justify the suspension of appropriations whose continuation is the guarantee of success. The professionals in the Member States who participate widely in this action are in agreement in favour of a study. Such a study could in particular result in the harmonisation of the Community contribution which currently varies between 40 and 100%, according to the products. For the same period, there are plans to finance a communication action for third countries, but in the absence of an implementing regulation, it will probably not be possible to use the provision in the year 2000. Finally, provision is also made for the promotion of the labelling. The Commission, however, is actually proposing to defer the implementation of labelling for one year, making the promotion of this non-existent product completely useless.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore possible to continue to promote quality products without requiring additional expenditure, and I therefore ask the Commission not to stop promoting quality products, for these products are the external face of difficult regions, local products and the earnings of family farms in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What it represents above all is the confirmation that the Europe that we are building is ruled by universal values which are equally resonant across the world. It also means that military invasion is not an acceptable method of extending borders, whoever perpetrates such an act and whatever geopolitical factors and interests may be involved. It means above all, that liberty, democracy and respect for human rights are the fundamental principles according to which we would like to see our world develop. </p>
<p class="contents">By deciding that the budget for the year 2000 is to make Europe’s financial contribution to Timor one of the four great European priorities, the European Parliament will be giving an unmistakable political signal to Europeans and to the world. I am pleased to note here the determined way in which the Commission and most particularly the Commissioner directly responsible for this matter, Chris Patten, is committed to supporting East Timor. In spite of the huge budgetary constrictions within which we work, the Commission managed to find the means to respond to the most pressing needs even in 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">The assessment reports on the reconstruction costs for East Timor, as well as for the attendant international financial aid plan, have still not been completed which means that it is not yet possible to have an accurate estimate of the European contribution to the costs of reconstruction. The political message that we shall be giving when we vote next Thursday in favour of Mr Bourlanges’ draft legislative resolution is nevertheless unmistakable. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s support for East Timor is an absolute priority for Parliament in terms of the budget for the year 2000. It gives an accurate reflection of the feelings of many Socialist MEPs and of those from other benches who came here to give their evidence in the debate that we held on the situation in East Timor in the September part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, we have the impression that this budget is restricting all those things which are dearest to us. At a time when the requirement is for women to take greater part in the decision-making process, the corresponding budget lines are being restricted. At a time when the wish is for the environment, particularly the protection of tropical forests, to be integrated into the development process, the appropriations allocated to this are being reduced. At a time when developing countries are being asked to respect the principle of good government, with respect for human rights, our own budget on this crucial issue is being drastically reduced. Finally, at the very time when Lusaka is reminding us of the human and economic ravages due to AIDS in Africa, we are reducing the funds dedicated to it, contrary to the Commissioner Nielson’s assertions, while mixing them in with the policy on health and reproduction.</p>

As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development I fully support the scheme, both now and in the future. However, I am disappointed that reductions are being made in the overall budgetary allocation but I hope that the European Council, when it comes to reviewing the second reading of the EU budget for the year 2000, will take on board the recommendation of this Parliament that it should increase the funding for the programme to EUR 67 million or IEP 53 million in next year’s allocation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking of the importance of increased democratic support for the EU’s activities and of the importance of concentrating on crucial issues, for example the fight against unemployment and the enlargement of the European Union to include the new applicant countries. These tasks go hand in hand. The European Union must win the fight against unemployment so as to break down ordinary workers’ and employees’ mistrust of the European Union. In order to succeed, the enlargement of the European Union must quickly give rise to social and economic improvements for the citizens of the applicant countries. That is why we now want to increase the resources for developing dialogue between the two sides of industry. It is a question, among other things, of giving employees a say in the development of the Employment Pact and coordinated economic policy. It is equally important that the applicant countries should now be able to participate in the dialogue with a view to constructive cooperation on the labour market in these countries too. </p>
<p class="contents">The procedure leading towards membership for Eastern and Central European countries, among others, is a difficult one. It is not enough to design well-balanced accession agreements. For EU membership to be a palpable and advantageous change in the eyes of ordinary citizens, the current state of affairs needs to change, and companies and employees need to be able to create a labour market which is not only dynamic but also grants rights to employees. Enlargement of the European Union must not mean that companies exploit a situation where there are low wages and poorer social security or that taxes and environmental demands are evaded. Employees in the new Member States have the same legitimate claims upon social entitlements and influence as we do. In this budget, we want, both for their and for our own sakes, to support dialogue between employers and employees and the establishment of union rights in the applicant countries too. In the same way, we would point out how important it is for the EU’s Committee of the Regions to have resources to develop contacts with regions and municipalities in the applicant countries. We also support the proposal for a special initiative to promote local and regional cooperation around the Baltic and the Barents Sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has developed a strategy that everyone can support. My colleague Mr Wynn may have feared that we would end up with a “Duke of York”-type scenario, but I feel that the whole affair is more akin to a scene from Asterix and Obelix, where Asterix has a special part to play in this case and we then have to vie with the Council, which plays the part of Julius Caesar. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that we can be satisfied with regard to Category 3, which is of particular interest to me. The rapporteur has struck the right balance here. But I would like to temper this comment with a caution to the Commissioner. I would ask that she does not start making changes to the categories when she puts her package together. We have decided most emphatically to restrict ourselves to Category 4 and if she starts on Category 3 then I think we might run into difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very curious as to the contents of this package. I believe that the Council and in fact the Commission itself are responsible to a certain extent for the problems now facing us. The Commission because it misjudged the fisheries agreement, thereby actually reducing our margin, and of course the Council because it allowed Africa to foot the bill for the remainder.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one more small point to make about Kosovo. It relates to a particular concern of mine besides that of the total amount to be spent on Kosovo. Of course we can consider the situation in terms of existing needs. I am completely in agreement with taking this approach. But we must also look at how much Kosovo’s economy can bear. If we were to provide assistance amounting to approximately 50% of Kosovo’s GNP – and there is a possibility of this happening if very high estimates are made – then I fear that the inflationary and other consequences for the economy would outweigh the benefits afforded by the assistance. I would ask the Commissioner to look not just at existing needs but also at the macroeconomic consequences. It is very clear that this is what happened at the time of the Marshall Plan. That is when it all started. We should also look very closely at this matter in the case of Kosovo, and we must learn from our experiences in Bosnia as far as that is concerned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank all those involved in the budgetary procedure for their work, which had to be executed with very little room for manoeuvre and was intended to send out a message to all the citizens of Europe. We are able to do this as far as Category 3 is concerned, which relates to internal policies. The youth programme, the SOCRATES programme, the cultural programme and issues relating to women and equality all provide us with the opportunity to make clear to the citizens what we want to achieve. A mistake was made in the case of Category 3, that is to say, when the vote took place in the Committee on Budgets an amendment was adopted by a very slim majority which could cause considerable damage if it is not corrected. The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities submitted a remark and a budget for the European Women’s Lobby in line A-3037, as it did the previous year, but the remark now states that this line is to be opened to all non-governmental organisations. May I remind you that we as a parliament have supported this umbrella organisation for European women’s organisations and have entrusted it with the task of implementing the plan of action agreed in Peking at non-governmental organisation level, and I think it would be disastrous if just any women’s organisation could have a share in this budget. That is why I would ask you all to correct the amendment again and to vote against Amendment No 443 and in favour of the amendment tabled by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. We weighed the situation up very carefully and exercised great restraint as regards the amendments relating to gender mainstreaming and the question of firmly establishing equal opportunities in all European policies. I would particularly ask the rapporteur to take this into account and to support the position of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are grounds for asking the question now and again, “What should the EU’s tasks really be?” It is in fact the answer to this question which ought to guide work on the budget, too. </p>
<p class="contents">Within a short period, we shall be facing what will probably be the biggest round of enlargement of the EU ever. It is a prerequisite of enlargement that there should be extensive changes to the budget and that we should begin to make these changes right now. This ought to involve making cuts right now in Category 1. We can begin this work by reducing the tobacco subsidy, among other things, and in such a way that it can be abolished completely within a ten-year period. </p>
<p class="contents">A number of so-called unforeseen expenses have arisen in the course of the year’s work on the budget, and this means large demands for increased expenditure in Category 4. Humanitarian efforts to help refugees or victims of war in Kosovo, people injured in the earthquake in Turkey or innocent people hit by events in East Timor have obviously led to demands being made upon the European Union. As I see it, it must be an obvious objective successfully to deal with these matters too within the frameworks which we ourselves have been involved in setting up. That is where the important issue of prioritising comes into the picture. </p>
<p class="contents">We have budget frameworks in the form of an interinstitutional agreement, signed less than six months ago. In my view, it would be extraordinarily unfortunate if this should need to be cancelled. I am in fact proceeding on the assumption that it will be possible for this issue to be solved jointly by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers before the second round of discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this is my first budget. I should like to begin by thanking Mr Wynn and Mr Bourlanges and the other two rapporteurs for simplifying a very complex process for me.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union is changing. The institutions are having to become more representative. In that spirit, we should be trying to bring the European budget closer to the electorate. It is crucial for the citizens of the EU to know what their stake in the EU’s policies and operations really is, what they are paying and what they are paying for. Increased transparency will be the key to the future success of all EU institutions. That means assessing every budget line to see how it benefits the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the commitment in the Treaty of Amsterdam to incorporating the interests of consumers into all other policy areas of the EU and the derisory level of the consumer budget, which stands at a quarter of one percent of total EU spending, there is a need to begin by making sure that valuable programmes such as the school milk scheme are safeguarded. This is not the case in the draft budget as my colleague, Mr Hyland, said earlier. The draft budget for the school milk programme throughout Europe has been reduced by 50%. This cut is a drastic measure for a programme that has benefits for both consumer and producer alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason I feel strongly about this budget line is that it has an impact on the long- and short-term health of people, it addresses social deprivation issues and it impacts on the economy and jobs in my region. I do not have any difficulty with the reform of the CAP if it means cheaper and safer products for the consumer. I know that people are concerned about paying for subsidies that increase prices for them as consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The response I had from the Commission in the Budgets Committee was initially quite disappointing. They said that social issues are not within the original remit of the programme. But it now emerges from the Trialogue meeting last week that the Commission will be proposing an increase of EUR 31 million. I welcome this. I must say that I am disappointed that the Council is not here because I would like to know if they will support this. People out there are not concerned about the finer points or headings of the subsidy. What matters to them is the impact and the positive benefit of policies, such as this one.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept totally the need to streamline and introduce efficiencies in the management of this scheme and others and to improve value for money, but a more effective way in terms of amending the budget would be to outline improvements and provide an implementation plan for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, in estimating spending, should look at funding in its totality. I call on Members to support this endorsement and amendment in Thursday’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, I must emphasise the fact that the Council’s draft budget represents less than 1.10% of the Community’s GDP, an amount which is already quite low in itself and what is more, is considerably lower than the ceiling of 1.27% set in Edinburgh and confirmed in Berlin. This should be cause for serious reflection for those who want Europe to do more and to do it better. </p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I agree completely with the rapporteur Jean-Louis Bourlanges, whom I congratulate for the quality of his work, concerning the obligation to meet, in the budget for the year 2000, major needs which have recently arisen in the area of Category 4 on external action without calling into question other needs which have been previously defined, as the Council is trying to do. Taking away from some in order to meet others is not acceptable! Across-the-board cuts are an aberration! I am also against any reduction in the level of Category 1 on agriculture and Category 2 on structural operations. </p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the new priorities, I would single out that of the reconstruction of East Timor, a region which has been a permanent target of the attention of the European Parliament which in September, once more adopted a firm resolution. In terms of the political commitment it represents, I think that the proposal to dedicate a specific budgetary heading to East Timor is of great significance. It is a shame that the Commission’s estimates – EUR 30 million – are not in line with reality. Once we have consistent forecasts, we will have to make the necessary adjustments. </p>
<p class="contents">Two final observations: the first is the difficulty in understanding and then in explaining why there is a legal basis, and rightly so, for assisting victims of natural disasters anywhere in the world, as we are very rightly going to do for Turkey, but there is no such basis for doing the same at home. Today let me remind you, it is Greece. Tomorrow, God knows. Secondly, there is the expectation, that I insist be noted, of the specific measures and the resulting funds which the Commission is obliged to propose for the outermost regions of the Community which have been recognised, identified and defined since Amsterdam in the Treaty on European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Socrates II programme is presently the object of conciliation, and the recommendations for a second reading on the Youth for Europe action programme and the Culture 2000 programme will be discussed in the plenary sitting on Wednesday, which is tomorrow. Thus the final effort to have these multiannual programmes approved still remains to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest differences of opinion between Parliament and the Council relate to the financing of the programmes, which is still open. At the same time, the Committee on Budgets has had to present the allocations for the implementation of the programmes next year. It has to be clearly pointed out that the figures presented by the Committee on Budgets do not constitute a stand on the result of conciliations. A schematic mathematical method is not suited to multiannual programmes. The financing of the programmes has caused worry to the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and it might not be just a one-off problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to alter parliamentary procedures with regard to the budgetary procedure for multiannual programmes that are the object of the codecision procedure. The opinion of the Committee on Budgets relates to the report on the first reading, but there is no official collaboration between the special committee and the Committee on Budgets in connection with the second reading and conciliation. That can easily lead to breaks in the flow of information and misunderstandings between the special committee and the Committee on Budgets. The worst that can happen, however, is that Parliament’s position on financing for the programmes remains unclear; that can be used against Parliament. As multiannual programmes must in any case adapt to the general Financial Perspective of the relevant budget heading as well as the budget as a whole, it is necessary, in my opinion, for Parliament to enhance the effectiveness of its internal coordination when discussing multiannual programmes and the budget. Communication between the special committee and the Committee on Budgets should not be broken at Parliament’s first reading, after which some time might pass until the matter is finally resolved. The Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises Parliament’s position as a responsible and effective decision-maker. That is why we need Parliament to have a common and sustainable view of the matter under discussion in budgetary negotiations and conciliations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The major items have undergone some changes, but they are not yet at the level of a structure free of conditioning, which may vary in nature: there is national conditioning which, however, is acceptable in part, conditioning by sector, not to mention by corporation, which is less acceptable, and by lobbies, categories, individuals and structures. Budgetary language is not dry because it is made up of numbers but because it pays little heed to changes in society and its needs, expectations and hopes. The Union performs its major function not only through political and legislative acts, but also through investments, management and expenditure, which are becoming a means not so much to satisfy as to stifle high expectations. The wait for funding is becoming the strongest bond for many communities, not just local ones – funding which binds people together more than any other types of ideals or principles. </p>
<p class="contents">While we do not agree at all with some of the programming choices, we will, however, accept them on one condition – that expenditure is subjectively and overall, individually and collectively useful. But because of inveterate habit, it does not always appear to be like this. Just because there is unjustified management does not necessarily mean there is unlawful management. Taxpayers’ money can be badly spent in a perfectly orthodox manner. The Community’s expenditure is huge and there could be many benefits and beneficiaries. If this is not the case, it is often because Brussels seems distant from Europe and does not always know what is happening there, while those in charge of controls sometimes seem distant and uncoordinated or disorganised. Let us give them more means, as is repeatedly requested, and the results will certainly be significant. There is a great deal of confidence, but the choice of what is to happen is just as important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to recommend a reduction in the Community’s bureaucratic impetus, reducing the number of officials who are inspectors in name only, committees, commissions, temporary transfers, obligations and regulations. We need more passion and transparency. As a new Member – and this is just one example – I approached the European Investment Bank, and I felt as if I were approaching a sanctuary for privileged, all-powerful fat cats who had been released from the rules of democracy and therefore from their obligation to citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And if it is clear that rigour is required in the implementation of the budget, I would also claim that we require rigour in the drawing up of the budget. And it is difficult to be rigorous in the drawing up of the budget if one does not have rigorous information.</p>
<p class="contents">And here today, how many of us have had to insist on the question of the fishing agreement, a clear case of a lack of rigorous information. The previous Commission should have foreseen that the said agreement was going to be discussed again, that it was going to be renewed and that therefore it would have to be reflected in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other institutions, when we speak, for example, of interinstitutional cooperation, how much rigour was there in the information on the day when our colleagues previously agreed that a Common Organisational Structure had to be set up and what is the reality today when we decide that we have to dissolve that common structure? I believe that we lack rigorous information.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of building policy, who has the genuine information about the continuous changes between the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions who say “now I am going to that building”, “now I am not interested”, “now I am going to the other”? When we speak of the rigour necessary for interinstitutional cooperation with regard to the buildings in Luxembourg, has Parliament decided what the effective minimums and maximums are which Parliament requires in Luxembourg?</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about expecting enlargements as from 2002, are we taking account, in our building policy, of the enlargements to come, in 2002, 2003 and 2004?</p>
<p class="contents">Rigour also has to be demanded of the members of other committees: the Committee on Budgets must not always be seen as the baddy, the one who always makes all the cuts. The other committees must take responsibility in the knowledge that new policies mean new expenditure, that for every increase there must be a cut.</p>
<p class="contents">And with regard to MEPs allowances, I believe that the current regulation is less unjust than any situation which the absence of a regulation would cause. In any event, it can only be reformed by means of the Members’ Statute.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, we have just had a very interesting discussion. The Members have endeavoured to get to the heart of the issues. At the same time, we should not forget the goals of the European Union, the most important of which is to make our budget lines as effective as possible in terms of creating employment. Which budget lines can we use to create fresh employment opportunities in Europe? Another interesting question of course is which budget lines we can use to secure fresh taxation revenue. Revenue is a very important area and we should examine these issues in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must take a look at which of the products currently on offer in the EU superstore we could take off the shelves. Which products could be returned to the national level? It would be interesting to set up a research programme into which activities are currently being performed at European level that could in fact be dealt with much more easily, more efficiently and better at national level. This would free up our time and give us the opportunity to concern ourselves with the new projects, new goals and all the aspirations that we have expressed here today.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two budget lines that are particularly dear to my heart. One is B5-512, financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises, support for family businesses. The SMEs account for 66% of jobs. In excess of 55% of turnover in the European Community is generated by these enterprises. We must concentrate our energies on specific programmes, start-up support, transfer of business know-how, and on the Euro-infocentres, for it is these that will give rise to fresh employment opportunities and fresh sources of taxation revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">The second budget line B5-234 concerns financial support for the European digital capacity for global networks. Commissioner Liikanen advised this House that there will be approximately 1.2 million additional jobs by the year 2002, but we will not be in a position to guarantee the necessary quality of staff. We must train people and ensure that this labour market of 1.2 million jobs can be exploited in future, and that we develop programmes that will enable us to get people into work. This will put us on the right footing in terms of the Internet, e-commerce and the many sectors which will bring brand new opportunities to Europe, and there is no question but that we should work on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, programmes such as BEST are of crucial importance to us. When it comes to enterprises of this kind – there are 18 million SMEs in Europe, 50% of which have no employees – we must make the legal requirements pertaining to them a great deal simpler so that they can concentrate on their main tasks of satisfying customer requirements and offering the right products and services. That is what creates jobs and new opportunities. That is why we should also look to encourage innovation in schools and to reinforce initiative and innovation in schools – from primary school to university level – so as to give this sector completely new impetus and also enable new opportunities to develop there. We must reach agreement with the supply sector. How can we foster links between small and large companies so that the former can learn from the latter, so that we can help them with the introduction of the euro, so that we can promote transfer of business know-how, and so that we can tackle any year 2000-related problems?</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would like to mention the enormous challenge we have before us, that of enlargement. I believe that enlargement also represents a huge opportunity for small companies. But we should not shrink from providing them with the support they need. There are only a few more years to go. Many are already involved over there, many are interested, and I believe that the work being done at grass roots level is interesting and affords new opportunities. We in the European Parliament recognise the challenge to give our commitment and invest our energies here, and I would like to take the opportunity today to thank you for your support in this, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Many thanks for your interesting and highly varied contributions to the debate, and above all, thank you very much for making the atmosphere in which this debate has taken place an extremely constructive one. I would like to limit myself to a few points in my speech, points which I would like to come back to since, in my view, Parliament and Commission proposals must be reconciled. I wish to refer, firstly, to market measures in the agricultural sector. The Commission agrees that it is of course, necessary for the budget appropriations for the year 2000 to correspond to actual requirements as far as possible, and that no artificial reductions should be made here. That was our position in the preliminary draft budget and it will be maintained in the letter of amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the measures in the rural development sector, I had pointed out that I also considered this second pillar of agricultural policy to be an absolutely essential addition. Accordingly, the Commission will propose a limited increase for agricultural development measures so that the Member States are also given the incentive to step up their efforts as far as environmental protection in the agricultural sector is concerned and as regards establishing structures to ensure safety in the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention the issue of research. It is being proposed here to divide up those budget lines in the budget plan which relate to the research sector. I believe that there is a pre-condition to consensual solutions. The Commission will always inform the European Parliament before there is a need to amend the appropriations for key actions and before these amendments are actually carried out, and it will of course substantiate these in full. I hope that on this basis we will be able to reach a consensual solution as to how matters are to be represented in the budget plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the question of the TAOs, which Mr Bourlanges, Mr Wynn and Mr Elles went into very deeply again. The new Commission will undertake and examine the award of contracts to the technical assistance offices according to the various criteria, which, again, you have discussed, in order to reach a clear decision here as to what has to be undertaken by public administration and what can be undertaken by the assistance offices. This issue will also be a main theme of the blueprint paper on administrative reform and institutional reforms. It will then also be possible, against the background of this blueprint – as is desired by the European Parliament – to estimate the overall staffing requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to address the question of financing the important measures associated with reconstruction in Kosovo. Mr Bourlanges rightly pointed out that it is not a task which lasts only one year. On the other hand though, we are in a situation where we do not yet have a definite basis to be able to estimate the overall requirement. That is why the Commission is proposing that we should first review the Financial Perspective for the year 2000 and only then, once definite figures are available, should we talk about how the necessary funds for the ensuing years are to be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">There have also been a few critical comments made on the question of what our approach will need to be in the year 2000. The question of how the sum of EUR 500 million stands in relation to Kosovo’s estimated GDP is indeed worthy of mention. On the other hand, though, I think that we should continue to stand by the figure that the EU has in fact quoted in the political sphere – it has said that it will make EUR 500 million available for the year 2000 – so as to avoid giving the impression that the EU is backing out of its political responsibilities. I have gained the impression from this debate that the Commission’s proposal, which I myself put forward, could form a sound basis for compromise. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to come back again to Mr Böge’s and Mrs Buitenweg’s contributions to the debate. The Commission proposes a limited revision, as you yourselves mentioned, and it also very important that we should make a point of providing for and taking account of ECHO measures for Kosovo. The Commission will therefore propose that all three instruments should be used i.e. reallocation of funds, use of the flexibility instrument and review of the Financial Perspective. In the Institutional Agreement we all have an excellent legacy on which to base our handling of Budget 2000 and fruitful cooperation, and as far as that goes, I am very confident, having had this debate, that it will be possible to reach a consensual solution and make the budget for the year 2000 one in which we can have faith.</p>

We will appreciate her proposal, once she has drawn it up, which will help us to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">For the moment, I shall limit myself to one small comment, which Mrs Schreyer will understand perfectly, on the subject of research appropriations. I appreciated the terms of the commitments which were publicly undertaken by the Commissioner regarding the management of the lines for research. Like everyone, I believe, on the Committee on Budgets, I attach particular importance to seeing these commitments being made in writing further to the highly interesting letter which Mrs Schreyer sent us and to which our chairman, Mr Wynn, responded requesting, I believe, further details.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore ask you, Commissioner, together with your colleagues, please, to formalise the commitments that you have just undertaken in the terms you deem appropriate, so that we can be familiar with the facts and we can proceed to the vote on Thursday on the basis of clear commitments which do not allow for any misunderstanding between us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
