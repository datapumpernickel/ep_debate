<p class="contents">Mr President, I have said this in private, but please allow me to repeat it publicly. It is going to be a great pleasure for me to work with you, with the Presidency, and with Parliament, and rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that whenever our complicated agendas allow it, I will be very happy to attend Parliament to explain the important actions the European Union is taking in the field of security and foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have been asked to attend today to speak essentially about the Middle East and that is what I will focus on, but I would also like to take this opportunity to exchange a few words with you on the situation in Afghanistan and the Balkans, where – we must not forget – we have very serious commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the first term I am going to use when talking about the situation in the Middle East is frustration. For those of us, like myself, who have spent years trying to find a formula for resolving the problems of the Middle East, the situation we are in can only be described, both from a personal point of view and from that of the parties involved, as highly frustrating. I first became involved in the problems in the Middle East at the Madrid Conference, which was the driving force that demonstrated that we needed a formula essentially based on the idea of ‘peace for territory, territory for peace’ and which subsequently gave rise to the Oslo process, which brought results, but not all the results we wanted, and which suffered from the enormously tragic assassination of Prime Minister Rabin.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot talk of a peace process, since there is neither a process nor any peace. My first comment, ladies and gentlemen, is therefore to say how much I, as a person involved, regret the consequences of this lack of a peace process, as do the people who are suffering on both sides. Should we be pessimistic then? I would say not, and despite all the frustration, despite everything that is happening, we must retain a certain degree of optimism and a sense of future possibilities. I believe that the European Union is performing its task correctly by not throwing in the towel. We must stick vehemently to our principles and our commitment to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must not just defend and help the Middle East peace process because of the principles and values which inspire the European Union, but also because, in this globalised world, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, is our home territory. We cannot conceive of a stable Europe, a progressive Europe, without a Mediterranean and a Middle East which are also progressing. It will be very difficult to achieve a stable and peaceful Europe, which is worthy of the status of a great world actor, if we are not also capable of having a Mediterranean which is peaceful, tranquil and prosperous.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to say that, since I had the opportunity and the privilege to work on the drawing up of the Mitchell report, almost a year ago now, there have been many, too many, missed opportunities. Too many moments when something could have been done and it was not. Too many occasions when progress could have been made and it was not.</p>
<p class="contents">The European citizens and we in Parliament, their legitimate representatives, must collectively commit ourselves to never again allowing an opportunity to be missed. At this point there are certain opportunities which I would like to mention to you. But please allow me to go a little, not into the broader story, since we have had the opportunity to discuss that on several occasions in this House, but into more recent history. Please allow me to return to December of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">On 10 December, I was in the Middle East. I was able to be there and talk to all the political leaders. I also met with General Zinni, the representative of the United States there. There was a tough stage, as you will remember, but later there was also a moment of hope. And we must recognise that, thanks to the effort of Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the representative of the European Union <span class="italic">in situ</span>, we achieved, from around 10 December, the most significant moment of peace for many, many months, which lasted until the middle of January. There was opportunity during that period, the most significant demonstration of which was the speech by President Arafat on 16 December.</p>
<p class="contents">You will remember perfectly that on 16 December President Arafat made a speech in his own language, broadcast by television stations, as requested by the Members of the European Union, in which he called for a cease-fire, for peace and for the terrorist groups to stop their violent acts on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. As I have said, there were a few days of peace, of hope, which were related to the Christmas celebrations. Even when President Arafat himself was not authorised to go to Bethlehem to celebrate Christmas.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, since 10 January we have a situation similar to the previous one. First of all violence broke out amongst Palestinians in one of the settlements, later Israeli forces murdered an important member of one of the Al Fatah groups and later there was the incident involving the vessel, the Karim A. I would like to talk about both things very briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a terrible tragedy that violence should have broken out again in January. Because we had passed that crucial period of seven days of total calm and the opportunity was not taken to make a qualitative jump forward. I remember, and I will never forget, how, in Tel Aviv airport, on 6 December, late at night, together with the United States’ representative, General Zinni, we were thinking about the plan to implement the Tenet plan and the implementation of the Mitchell plan. We had agreed on a trilateral meeting between the Palestinian, Israeli and United States security services and subsequently a bilateral meeting between the Palestinians and the Israeli forces. Terrorism and violence from both sides destroyed the opportunity we had over those days. And it was complicated – as I said previously – by the famous episode of the Karim A. Please allow me to stop a moment and explain to you what the famous Karim A has meant.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the ship, which contained arms of a higher calibre than those normally used by the Palestinians, also had a strategic value for the Israeli leaders and for the United States, since it was the beginning of the relationship, not yet finally proved, but very possible, between ‘somebody’ in the Palestinian Authority and Iran. Ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between the Palestinian Authority and Iran has been practically non-existent for many years. If that relationship comes to be proven, it would significantly change what we might call the Middle Eastern landscape. There is no firm proof which I have been able to see physically, but there is no doubt that something of that nature has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can imagine, ladies and gentlemen, all of this has led to an increase in the already significant distrust between the two parties. If Camp David represented a break in the trust between the two parties, the situation of the early days of January this year have lead to huge further increase in that distrust.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do from now on? How can we try to resolve the situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Remember the famous European Union declaration in Laeken, in the final days of December. It assigned clear responsibilities to the two parties and I believe it is one of the best declarations made by the European Union. We must continue in this direction, which was the one taken by the last General Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">That Council, as well as making that declaration, sent me to the United States to try to find a common position between the European Union and the United States, above all in relation to the situation of the Palestinian Authority. As you will remember, President Arafat is practically a prisoner in Ramallah and the Israeli authorities are still claiming that the Palestinian Authority has become unnecessary and irrelevant.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that that is not the European Union’s position and that we believe we should maintain the Palestinian Authority and its President, for various reasons: firstly, because it has been elected by the Palestinian people and, secondly, because we firmly believe that there will be no military solution to this conflict and that therefore the only possible solution is dialogue, and that dialogue requires negotiators, and the negotiator elected by the Palestinians are the members of the Palestinian Authority, headed by President Arafat.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we are maintaining that position. And I have had the opportunity over recent days – I have spent the whole week in New York talking to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and in Washington with Vice-President Cheney, Secretary of State Powell and the President’s adviser, Condoleezza Rice – to try to discover whether we are able to give further joint impetus in the face of this terrible situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these visits have some consequences. I do not want to talk about the influence of any one party, or the influence the European Union, but I will restrict myself to describing the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Wednesday night when I was in the United States, Prime Minister Sharon, for the first time since saying that he would never again hold contacts with the Palestinian Authority, received three very important Palestinian leaders in his private residence: the President of the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority, Abu Ala; the person who is considered to be the number two in the Palestinian Authority, Mr Abu Mazen; and Mohamed Rachid, who is considered to be one of the most important people in the financial world within the Palestinian Authority. For the first time, Prime Minister Sharon received these people in his house. I can also tell you that yesterday and today Secretary of State Powell has received Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Parliament, in Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we are at a point where we can once again say that there is a tiny glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. The aim of all this effort is to try to recover a political perspective. We can and must continue to fight against violence. We must continue to condemn terrorist attacks, but we must also be capable of giving the conflict a political perspective. That was the spirit of the Mitchell report. That was the spirit in which I participated as a representative of the European Union, and that is the spirit which must inspire all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where we stand, ladies and gentlemen. I cannot tell you at this point that I have great hope. I have a little bit of hope. I began by saying that I was very frustrated, but I can also see that there is some possibility that we may inch forward a little. Any movement in the right direction is worth trying, however small it may be. Because, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know how many of you have been there recently, but the situation, from the citizens’ point of view, is truly horrendous. It usually took me twenty minutes to get from Jericho to Ramallah. At the moment it may take me three hours to make the same trip, owing to military and police controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union is doing all it can to try to bring a little hope to this process. I believe that the European Union must continue to work in conjunction with our friends in the United States, as well as the King of Jordan and President Mubarak.</p>
<p class="contents">A few hours ago I was with the King of Jordan, I also spoke a few hours ago with President Mubarak on the telephone and I have spoken to President Arafat this morning, and there is, as I have said, a little hope. I cannot say that there is a lot. We still have the rest of the week to carry on working. At the weekend, as you know, the Foreign Affairs Ministers will meet at Gymnich to deal almost exclusively with the issue of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">What political initiatives can we bring to the table? Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to participate in what I believe should now be our course of action: to help, to contribute to the successful outcome of the process of dialogue which has begun between the President of the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority and the Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Peres. As you know, the negotiation mechanism which has now begun is as follows: to try, as soon as possible, to have the Palestinian State recognised, before the definitive borders are recognised. The idea is that the bases of the negotiation should be the 1967 borders, with exchange of territories if necessary, in order to compensate for some of the possible difficulties. To try not to enter at this point into a discussion of the more difficult issues: Jerusalem and the return of the refugees; and to begin to work with the mutual trust of two States which already recognise each other, although the second is not complete.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the idea we are working on. I cannot guarantee success. I must also tell you, very frankly, that Prime Minister Sharon told me that for him that was not the perfect solution but that he was going to let the Foreign Affairs Minister continue with the negotiation. That is to say that we cannot be sure that in the end the government of Prime Minister Sharon is going to accept it. But I believe we must continue working in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is no change, even the slightest change, in the current situation, the violence will continue to dominate the centre of the debate. And we must be able to prevent violence being at the centre of the debate, since politics must be there. I insist once again: this problem can only be resolved politically, by means of dialogue, and, therefore, sooner or later – let us hope that it is as soon as possible – arms and violence must disappear so that politics can prevail. There is no other solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, just a few days ago, Simon Peres spoke in a restricted sitting of the General Affairs Council to the fifteen ministers and told them something which meant a lot to me, due to the way he expressed himself and the emotion with which he said it. He said more or less as follows: “I will never be in a government which does not have the objective of two States: Palestine and Israel. For a dreamer such as I, Simon Peres, who is very old and has always worked to achieve peace, it is impossible to imagine a situation in which there are not two States. If there are not two States, two negative things will happen, which I could not accept: one, Israel would not be a democratic State because we would be imposing ourselves on the Palestinians, or, on the other hand, Palestinian demography would win out and the State would not be a Jewish State ".</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these fundamental and profound reasons, which he expressed with great emotion, we must carry on fighting for two States, quickly, on the basis of the agreements of the United Nations Security Council, the two resolutions, and on the basis of those approaches which I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Will we have success immediately? There is no guarantee of that. Is there the will to make every effort to do so? Yes. I can assure you that there is. However, ladies and gentlemen, neither the European Union nor anybody has a miraculous solution. To carry on working with the United Nations, with the United States, with Egypt, with Jordan, is – I believe – the best way to try to make progress in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this is what we are doing. You can rest assured that both Miguel Ángel Moratinos and I will be working 24 hours a day, whenever necessary, to try to resolve this conflict, which is of profound concern to the Europeans. We are not talking about a distant problem, but a problem which is physically, geographically, close and which we feel in our hearts and in our heads. It is therefore our obligation to continue doing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, please allow me very briefly to mention two issues which I had been asked to mention. The first is Afghanistan. Commissioner Patten will have more information to offer you, because it is he who has represented the European Union at the Tokyo meeting in a most dignified manner. I just wanted to say that we have a personal representative of mine in Kabul, and I am also rather proud to say something that we are not always able to acknowledge: the military forces defending Kabul at the moment, supporting the government which was approved at the Bonn Conference – also a European city – are mostly European forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirteen European Union countries have forces deployed there. I believe we have to say this very clearly: we must be proud that the people who are carrying out the peace and stabilisation process in Kabul are basically citizens of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will tell you that we have to work, and that we will do so in very difficult political circumstances during the remaining time between now and June, when, as you know, the Assembly will once again have to name the Grand Assembly which will have to meet to elect another government, which will not be easy. The present government has a certain degree of balance. To change those balances will not be easy, but it will certainly have to be done. Therefore, between now and June we will have to work very intensively with the representatives of Afghanistan and also the other three fundamental countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Pakistan. Yesterday, both Chris Patten and I were with the Pakistani Foreign Affairs Minister. I believe that they are doing a fantastic job and we should congratulate them on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Iran, the other key country for the stability of the region. We must recognise that, regardless of what is said or what can be said about Iran, its representatives behaved constructively in both the meeting in Bonn and the meeting in Tokyo. I believe that we must work with them.</p>
<p class="contents">And thirdly, Russia. These three countries are crucial to the external stability of Afghanistan. We are doing so and we are going to continue to do so, in order to try to ensure that this process, which will begin in June, and which was launched at the Bonn meeting, yields results.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue I wanted to mention, very briefly, Mr President, is that of the Balkans. I would like to focus on three points, which in my judgment are the hottest, or potentially the hottest issues. The first relates to the FYROM, Macedonia and Skopje. I believe that, after the agreements signed in Ohrid, we are in an ideal situation, from a political point of view. The whole Constitution was changed and a few days ago the Law on Local Governments was approved, which was a fundamental element in terms of being able to implement the return and entry of police into areas they had been expelled from some months ago. We are therefore moving in the right direction. The situation is still not perfect, but I believe we will be able to spend the Spring in peace and calm.</p>
<p class="contents">At this moment, NATO military forces, led by Germany, are still there. The government has accepted an extension for another three months, which may become six. The European Union is considering the possibility of treating them as an actual European Union responsibility in the future. No decision has been taken, but it is being considered and therefore, in relation to Skopje, although this is not a time for great celebrations, I believe that things are moving in the right direction. The Conference of Donors, which Chris Patten will refer to, may work and may be a considerable help from an economic point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in Kosovo, as you know, there were elections which we should all be satisfied with. The elections took place very calmly, with no violence, and the Serbian minority also participated in them. They are now the second largest force in the Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening now, at the beginning of February, is that they have not yet been able to reach agreement, and remember that the elections took place in November. They have not yet agreed either on electing the President, which really should be President Rugova, or on forming the government.</p>
<p class="contents">It also happens that the representative of a European MIC, which will continue to be European, had to leave for personal reasons and we have had a few weeks of vacuum. I was there trying to give a little impetus to the negotiations, which are absolutely essential, so that Rugova, who does not have the majority to govern, can do so with the others. Let us hope that over the next few days we will have an Assembly with a government in place, with the Presidency elected which has the ability to confront the real problems that that government will have to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to make relates to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As you know, the talks between Podgorica (Montenegro) and Belgrade broke down on 24 October. I was called by Kostunica and by Yukanovic, to see whether we were able to keep those talks alive. We have managed it and we are continuing to work, to negotiate and to facilitate those talks as the European Union. I am going there as often as I can to talk to each of them. We will meet again on Sunday, when we will have another meeting to see whether it is possible, by means of constitutional reform, to prevent the referendum and the separation of Montenegro from Belgrade. We are working very intensely on that: there is total consensus between the Member States of the European Union that we should make every effort to achieve that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">There were certain doubts over whether the United States would take the same approach or not. After spending this week dealing with their leaders, I can tell you that they are taking the same approach and they are prepared to help us to achieve this reform of the Federation’s Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end – and I believe, Mr President, that I have almost exceeded my speaking time, since I was told 30 minutes and this is my twenty-seventh minute – by referring once again to my first point: the Middle East. There is no doubt that it is, and must continue to be, our main concern. The European Union has great responsibilities and we must continue to work in that direction. It will not be easy, but we must not throw in the towel and we must continue to be resolute and determined. We will win this battle.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, this is the first time I have spoken in a debate with you presiding. It is not just the half of me that is Irish which welcomes your presence in the Chair – all of me welcomes your presence in the Chair. I wish you well for a very successful presidency. I am sure we can count on it being not only successful but also remarkably eloquent.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one potential confession: If I have to slip away for a couple of minutes during the course of the debate, it will be just to do my democratic duty in another place, where one of the Union's great institutions is meeting and discussing important matters relating to competition policy and other things. I will only do that if I have to and will return straight away to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole Parliament knows how tirelessly my friend and colleague, Mr Solana, has worked to restore some semblance of hope in the bloody shambles of the Middle East peace process, and to sustain the progress that the Union has undoubtedly made in bringing stability and hope to south-east Europe, and to the western Balkans in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I have an admirable speech, which goes over all the issues which the High Representative covered so extraordinarily well. In order not to offend the intelligence of Parliament and to ensure that as many Members can take part in the debate as possible, I will not simply cover the issues which Mr Solana has covered with such knowledge and passion. I will just underline the strength of my agreement with everything the High Representative has said. He has pointed out the missed opportunities – one after another – which have brought so much savagery and violence to the region, beginning with the failure to implement the Mitchell report, and going on to the failure to respond with adequate generosity of spirit to the speech made by Mr Arafat on 16 September. He has touched on some of the appalling errors which have disfigured the history of the region, including the <span class="italic">Karine</span> shipment. What we have seen is a descent into violence: killings provoking more killings, violence, repression, senseless destruction. As the High Representative said, we do not have a Middle East peace process any more but – to use a phrase from a New York magazine a few weeks ago – a bloody feud. We have to remain engaged in order to try to restore some hope, and the High Representative set out some of the things the European Union is doing to press the case for peace and for a political settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing on which I should like to focus – which the European Union has been doing and which is sometimes decried. We have been supporting the Palestinian Authority, and our support for the Palestinian Authority has first of all made certain that there is still a viable negotiating partner for the Israeli government. Secondly, it has made sure that there has not been a descent into anarchy in the Palestinian territories – because let us be clear that the alternative to a Palestinian authority is Palestinian anarchy.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the alternative to the substantial commitment we have made? In the last two years, we have spent about EUR 400m from the Community budget in the Palestinian territories, and that money has been carefully vetted month by month, in particular the contributions we make to the Palestinian Authority, to ensure that it is not spent on purposes of which this Parliament would not approve. It must be said that if the accountants of Enron had been one-hundredth as diligent as the IMF is, month by month, in looking at how our money is spent in the Palestinian territories, a lot more people would still have jobs and pensions to look forward to.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When one looks at that commitment and sees the extent to which projects we have started and others in which we have invested money have been destroyed, wilfully and purposefully, it is enough to make one literally weep. We have seen the destruction of projects worth about EUR 17m in which the European Union has invested – that is, just over a tenth of the total destruction of infrastructure which has been identified by the World Bank. And the World Bank argues, though this must be a very rule-of-thumb figure, that the Palestinian national income has been reduced by about USD 2.4bn as a result of what has happened over the last months.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask myself, and I ask Parliament: where is the evidence that any of that increases security?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Where is the evidence that going back twice to destroy the forensic laboratory that we had been asked to provide for the Palestinian security services increases security in the Territories? Where is the evidence that destruction of a sewage pump increases the security of Israel and Israeli citizens – something which I wholly understand they are passionately concerned about? Where is the evidence that taking bulldozers to the runway in Gaza airport is a contribution to the security of Israel?</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that sort of destruction of infrastructure, health and education services, people's livelihood and jobs destroys hope and any prospect of political stability and security.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative referred to what we are doing in Afghanistan and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Why is Europe spending EUR 600m this year in Afghanistan – EUR 200m from the Community budget? We are doing that not just out of humanitarian motives, but also to try to ensure a more stable and secure future for the people of Afghanistan. We know that economic development and social progress help contribute to political stability and to greater security. That is why we are making that investment in Afghanistan and why, so far, the European Union, the Member States and the Commission have pledged about 45% of what the World Bank and the UNDP say is going to be needed in Afghanistan over the next five years. I hope some others – the United States, Japan, Saudi Arabia – will be as generous as we have been in the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we spending what we spent in the Balkans, in FYROM, for example? In the last few months, with the reconstruction agency starting to do as good a job in FYROM as elsewhere in the region, we have already repaired 400 houses, there will be 300 more repaired by April; electricity has been restored in Aracinovo; water and electricity are restored in Kumanovo. We have made a considerable contribution to restoring normality to Macedonia and will keep on doing that. Again, why? Not only because of a humanitarian impulse but also because we know from our experience in Europe that there is a relationship between economic stability and political stability and security. I do not labour this point as a sort of demented chartered accountant. I make these arguments because they are so obviously true. We know they are true from our experience. If you make people unemployed, if you destroy any infrastructure for people's social well being, then what you are doing is not only making their lives miserable but also, almost certainly, making sure that everyone's lives become more violent.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that even now in the Palestinian Territories and in Israel more people will be prepared to listen to the moderates, to those who made their views about the future so bravely known at Kalandria checkpoint before Christmas. I hope that the Voice of Peace movement will be listened to because the people who argue in that brave way for peace are the only ones who really chart a way forward for the Middle East, for the Palestinian State in the future, and for Israel. Anybody who does not believe that should ask Members of this Parliament; should ask somebody like Mr Hume what helped to produce peace in Northern Ireland. It was moderates being prepared to stand up for their beliefs, it was moderates having the courage and decency to go out there and argue for what we all know is the only way in which you turn off the violence and turn on the peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">Look at what has happened in South Africa, which the Voice of Peace Movement from the Middle East has recently been visiting – exactly the same process occurred there.</p>
<p class="contents">So in endorsing everything which the High Representative has said, I just wanted to ask this question: how many more people have to die before the voices of the moderates who are left in the Palestinian Territories and Israel are actually listened to by the citizens of those communities?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the events of 11 September and subsequent action taken in Afghanistan and the current situation in the Middle East, have pushed into the background a matter that both Mr Solana and Mr Patten have mentioned, namely a peaceful settlement in Macedonia. I wish to say a word of thanks to Mr Solana, the High Representative and also to Commissioner Patten, but also to all the others who have played their part there in making Macedonia peaceful today. This is a gigantic success for the European Union, for which our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats thanks you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In these days and weeks, we are looking eastwards. We expect there to be new countries in the European Union in the next few years. I will, though, say quite emphatically and underline what the High Representative said, that it is important to our security in Europe that we achieve peace in the Middle East and that we, as Europeans, cooperate peacefully and well with all the countries of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also state that, when these problems are under discussion, we must first just put people on centre stage. We state quite clearly that the life and human dignity of a Christian and a non-Christian in Europe, the life of a Jew, an Israeli in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and the life of a Palestinian, of a Muslim in Ramallah or the Gaza Strip are of the same value, and no distinction must be made between human rights in Europe, in the Islamic world or anywhere else on this earth.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We wholeheartedly agree with both Mr Solana and also Mr Patten in declaring our need of dialogue and of partnership. These involve us telling the truth and not going along with irresponsible language. When, for example, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says, in Thursday's issue of ‘Maariv’ – and I am quoting him verbatim: ‘In Lebanon’ – that is, in 1982 – ‘it was agreed that Arafat was not to be eliminated. To tell the truth, I regret that we did not eliminate him.’ – that is irresponsible language. That is the sort of language that leads to war; it is not the sort of language that brings about reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I find it difficult, even in view of my nationality – and I was born after the war – to say this here. I find it cynical of the Israeli Prime Minister to respond to our criticism of his attitude by speaking of a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe. No, we are not anti-Semitic. We want Israel to live in peace within secure borders. In that, we stand alongside all Israelis. This has absolutely nothing to do with anti-Semitism. We reject that appellation with all the decisiveness we have.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have, of course, demands to make of Yasser Arafat. He wrote a remarkable article in the ‘New York Times’ a few days ago. In it he says that he intends to redouble his efforts against terrorism from the Palestinian side, thus expressing the possibility that he might not have previously done all that was necessary. So we also call on Yasser Arafat to do more in this respect in the places where he has influence, knowing as we do that he does not have all the Palestinian groupings under his control.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana also mentioned the weapons shipments on the <span class="italic">Karine-A</span>. We too want to have information on who they were intended for. We urge Arafat to provide information on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we Europeans have, along with the Americans, a great task ahead of us. The Americans, though, must also understand that they have to give Israel and Palestine equal treatment, and that both sides have the same dignity. Secretary of State Powell, in an interview a few days ago, spoke of Palestine's right to exist, its right to be a state. All this we welcome. I think that we, Europeans and Americans together, now have a common task, to contribute to peace in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Yasser Arafat is, of course, the elected President of Palestine. If we do not accept him as a partner in dialogue, then there can be no peace and no dialogue. We therefore call on Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat to make a start on peace by talking to each other so that people in the region, in the Middle East, can have a future worthy of human beings. All those who promote that, such as Javier Solana, Chris Patten and others, have the full support of our group.</p>

I wish to start by joining with Mr Poettering in what he said on behalf of his group, and also, on behalf of our group, express our thanks for the success of the policy on the Macedonian issue which the High Representative and the Commissioner conducted last summer. The press is, unfortunately, always full of the things that are not going well in Europe, but when a policy is successful, it is virtually ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to focus my remarks on the Middle East. I am dismayed by the figures the Commission has published on the destruction recently meted out to projects funded by the European Union. The point here is not the fact that something is being destroyed, but rather the reason why it is being destroyed. The Israeli government is attempting to wreck whatever might become the infrastructure of a future Palestinian state, and that is something we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">You were saying today, Mr Solana, that what is going on there is not a peace process. I agree with you wholeheartedly. I have been saying in this House for a year and a half that we should no longer use the word ‘peace process’. It is a low-intensity war, but a war all the same, and our task is to put a stop to it and attempt to restart what will become a peace process. We are, though, still a long way from doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, I fully support your statement that the EU must carry on, for we have no alternative. As has repeatedly been said, though, Israel does not want us as mediators. Perhaps you will again be accepted and welcomed there, with an opportunity we are rarely given to present our policies and our proposals. Are we then to finance projects only to see the Israeli government's tanks destroy them? I also consider the recognition of a Palestinian state to be very important, indeed, as Mr Poettering has said, the only possibility. A President has been elected for this Palestinian state, and that is something Mr Sharon cannot ignore any more than we can. He is the only person we can negotiate with. I do not believe there are many other potential partners in dialogue on the Palestinian side.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret, Mr Solana, my inability to share even in your modest optimism. For one and a half years, we have been looking on while two utterly unequal opponents wage war on each other. We look on while Israeli tanks destroy Palestinian homes and kill Palestinian civilians and we also watch as Palestinians kill themselves and take equally innocent Israeli citizens with them. It goes without saying that we condemn all violence and every terrorist act without ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’. Where, though, does it get us? We achieve no progress by it, and so, Mr Solana, we and the Commission as well, have to think in terms of using the powers we have by reason of the association agreement with Israel, even to the extent of suspending it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – High Representative, Commissioner, you have the dubious fortune to live in interesting times, as the Chinese might say. You may be the architects of the Union's awakening in foreign policy. I welcome the meetings that Mr Sharon had last week with Palestinian leaders. I regret that it is the first time since he came to power that he has directly engaged with the Palestinians and I hope it is not mere coincidence that the talks come just before his trip to Washington DC. But it will not be enough to talk about a cease-fire. We need to be talking about an Israeli pullback and an end to the destruction of EUR 17 million worth of EU-funded Palestinian infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend, High Representative, that if we want peace we do not define any starting date. Nonetheless, the news that some Israeli reservists are reportedly refusing to serve outside the 1967 frontiers is a welcome development.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">After all it was similar pressure from reservists that led to Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and, taken together with Arafat's expression of willingness of the Palestinians to end the conflict and the need to find creative solutions, these green shoots of optimism need to be nurtured and encouraged to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative, you spoke of the Mitchell report and light at the end of the tunnel. I hope this is not the headlamp of an oncoming train. Sometimes America's friends – or so-called friends – in the Middle East have been about as helpful to the peace process as the so-called loyalists in Northern Ireland have proven loyal to the UK Government. The Union has a serious dilemma if it believes that US policy on the Middle East is damaging the entirety of Western interests. I wish you wisdom and courage in your discussions with our friends on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative, you spoke also about Afghanistan. My group is concerned about reports of interfactional fighting in Northern and Eastern Afghanistan, leading to thousands of Pashtuns fleeing villages, reports of 50 or more people being killed in Gardez. Such reports are an ominous sign and strengthen the case for an international stabilisation force to prevent any possibility of a slide to civil war. Our priority would be to complete the elimination of terrorist networks but in this regard we believe that whatever questions there are over the status of combatants held by the US in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo Bay, they should be treated consistently with the 1949 Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That Convention was the fourth such to establish principles for the treatment of enemy soldiers and civilians in wartime. I hope that you will support my call for a United Nations committee to review it, to determine whether further changes are needed concerning armed insurgents and terrorists who do not fall within the traditional definitions and, if not, at least call on the Americans to sign the 1977 amendments to extend protection to guerrillas and combatants, amendments which the US has refused thus far to sign.</p>
<p class="contents">In his state of the union address, President Bush displayed a shocking belligerence. Just as his environmental policies lead to global warming, so his diplomatic and military policies are pushing the world towards a new cold war. In this century every shot the US fires will indeed, in the words of the poet Emerson, "ring round the world" and unless you can appeal to, and nurture, a wider concept of American self-interest, then we risk the menace of a new military millennium.</p>

You said that politicians feel a sense of frustration, not to mention cynicism. This translates as melancholy, sadness, distress, fear, anxiety and despair for the people.</p>
<p class="contents">We could continue by saying that the Israelis certainly have not done what was necessary. Mr Sharon’s strategy consists of destroying Palestinian infrastructures, because he does not believe in the Palestinian State, he does not want a Palestinian State. He has spent his whole life fighting a Palestinian State. We must therefore make him understand that he will only achieve peace and security in his country if there is a Palestinian State. And, to do this, we must enter into a dialogue of political interference in Israel. It is the Israeli people that must be made to understand that they can only have security if there is the Palestinian State. The only possibility of security for Israel is if there is a Palestinian State.</p>
<p class="contents">As far back as 1972, I defended this thesis and I was almost beaten up during an important meeting at the University of Jerusalem. I know what fighting for this issue means in Israel, but there is no other solution. Similarly, there is no other solution than saying that, in the Palestinian territories, there will be no return of all Palestinians to the State of Israel. The numbers of those returning will be limited, we must have the courage to say this, but a State of Israel is a State of Israel, a Palestinian State is a Palestinian State and the two must remain separate.</p>
<p class="contents">The price of this is that there will be a European intervention force between the Palestinians, maintaining security in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Jaffa, but which also maintains security in Ramallah, Gaza and in other Palestinian towns. You will say to me ‘But who are we to do this?’ Mr Sakellariou will say ‘Europe means nothing. No one listens to us.’ First of all, we must want to be heard, we must want to speak out, we must want to say ‘No, it is not up to the Americans to run global politics!’</p>
<p class="contents">We, the European Union, know that the Middle East conflict is a result of a fundamental European crisis. It is our responsibility, the responsibility of Germany, the responsibility of others who created the situation that we now have in the Middle East. This is why we must not give up. This means that today, we must break down the barriers that are isolating President Arafat. This does not mean that I believe President Arafat is absolved of all responsibility. He is as hypocritical as Mr Sharon. They are two old gentlemen who have been fighting for decades in this region and we know that hypocrisy is one of their common weapons. They know one another very well, they do the same thing. That is not the problem. It is not a question of moral standards. As one speaker said today, there is an elected president – Mr Arafat. There is a second – Mr Sharon. I can do nothing, even though, in any case, I would not have voted for Mr Arafat or for Mr Sharon. Democracy is not what I decide, it is what the majority decides. Nothing can be done. We have to put up with the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore come back to the point that we must break down the barriers that are isolating Mr Arafat. This is why our group is asking the European Parliament to invite Mr Arafat and Mr Perez to have a discussion with us. They both hold the Nobel Peace Prize, therefore they know what is meant by peace. Well, let us invite two holders of the Nobel Peace Prize to discuss the subject of peace with us here in Strasbourg. And let us put pressure on Mr Perez to allow Mr Arafat to leave. It is scandalous that it is Mr Sharon who decides whether Mr Arafat has the right to take part in a meeting in Brussels or in Strasbourg or wherever. It is up to us to intervene politically to break down the barriers isolating Mr Arafat.</p>
<p class="contents">We must fund, organise and support all the NGOs that are fighting at civil society level for new relations to be forged and so that everything between the Israelis and Palestinians will not collapse, as there are some wonderful things being done in this region. Those who have often visited Palestine and Israel know this. This is why we have a fundamental responsibility to contradict the key phrase that you hear in Israel, which is ‘there is no other solution’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not true; there is always another solution. I know that today, as Mr Patten said, those who speak of peace are not listened to, but if we manage to show that the other side can hear the initiatives we are proposing, then there will be many more initiatives, like those by the soldiers who are saying that they want to defend the security of Israel, but do not want to occupy Palestinian territories and the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I hope that Parliament will have the courage to make a determined effort in its attempt to influence the Israeli and Palestinian civil societies and make a strong gesture by inviting Mr Arafat and Mr Peres to Strasbourg, in order to break down the barriers isolating Yasser Arafat.</p>

I also know that you are working in a creative and worthwhile manner with your many counterparts in order to encourage the prospect of a breakthrough in the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank Mr Patten for his fair and forceful words on the subject of the destruction of infrastructures which symbolise the heart of the Palestinian State. I think, however, that the general attitude of the Fifteen is still greatly out of touch with the extreme seriousness of the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there is a great danger of seeing the majority of Palestinians lose their last hope for peace out of dignity. A nation that is submitted to this sort of daily humiliation by the occupying forces must never feel that the whole world does not care. We must therefore make ourselves heard.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Poettering rightly pointed out, it is not normal for the head of a government to express regret that a man, recognised by the whole international community as the leader of a people and a nation, was not killed 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we think of this? And how has Europe reacted to the dangerous green light given by President Bush to Mr Sharon’s policy under which he makes things worse in order to further his own ends? The rapport between them is as threatening as a violent storm cloud.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, how are we interpreting the signs, a growing number of which is evident amongst the Israeli population, of a deep-rooted opposition to Mr Sharon’s policy on the basis of the fundamental requirement that the military occupation of the Palestinian territories must be brought to an end?</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking of the courageous statements made by Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, who believes that a nation of occupants will end up being disfigured by the crimes of occupation. I am thinking of the 300 men and women who travelled from Israel to Ramallah this weekend to deliver a message of peace to Mr Arafat. I am thinking of the appeal launched by 52 Israeli officers and soldiers to no longer agree to fight in order to occupy, deport, destroy, blockade, kill, starve and humiliate a whole nation of people.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest opinion polls reveal a profound distrust of Mr Sharon’s security policy and almost an absolute majority in favour of peace with the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">Do such facts not give us more room to manoeuvre than those that we use to significantly heighten the tone when faced with the irresponsible attitude of the current head of the Israeli government? What are you intending to do, Mr Solana, in this area, to support the forces of peace in Israel?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, practical measures are as important as fair words in diplomacy and these measures are now expected from Europe. One of the very significant initiatives, such as the one I proposed to you in an open letter that I sent last week, and the essence of which Mr Cohn-Bendit has just partly taken up, could be to invite President Arafat, and possibly Shimon Peres, to the European Council and to the European Parliament and, if Mr Sharon dared to defy the European Union by using force to prevent our guest from travelling, to organise a joint visit by the 15 Foreign Affairs Ministers to Ramallah and to clearly express an opinion on the conditions that, in Europe’s view, would secure a return to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is of utmost urgency to give, in one way or another, those who support dialogue and peace on both sides the prospect of a breakthrough, which they vitally need. Simply by doing this, you will present – and I know that this is your desire – Europe with a task that rivals its greatest ambitions.</p>
