<p>(EN) The Council is not a member of the World Energy Council nor has it discussed the outcome of the conference mentioned by the MEP.</p>
<p>There is however no doubt as to the Council's long-standing commitment regarding the promotion of renewable and energy efficiency as attested by the adoption of Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal market in electricity <a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings <a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> as well as the provisions supporting renewable electricity and energy efficiency retained in the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity <a href="#defann_1_3" name="refann_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This support for renewable energy and energy efficiency is without prejudice to Member States' individual decisions regarding their energy mix.</p>
<p>Regarding the EU relations with third countries in the field of Energy, the Council is well aware that addressing security of supply issues requires the diversification of energy sources both in terms of fuel and origin, and firmly believes that dialogues with third countries respond to this objective and should be further promoted. The support given by the Council to the establishment of the International Energy Forum, involving OPEC countries, is a good example in this respect.</p>
<p>There are at present four dialogues/relations in the field of energy:</p>
<p>- EU - Russia</p>
<p>- EU - Euromed countries</p>
<p>- Northern Dimension</p>
<p>- EU - South East Europe</p>
<p>On 14 May, the Council will adopt a set of detailed conclusions covering these four dialogues/relations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) On 18 February 2003 the Council decided to extend the period of application of the restrictive measures adopted last year for a further period of 12 months. The measures applied remained unaltered. The measures were adopted last year because of serious violations of human rights and of the freedom of opinion, of association and of peaceful assembly in Zimbabwe. A more immediate reason was the attempts by the government of Zimbabwe to prevent free and fair elections, notably by refusing access for international election observers and for the media. The Council decided to extend the sanctions because it found that no improvement had taken place in the situation in the country over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>The Council has stated that it will be willing to revoke the measures once conditions prevail to ensure respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, but also that the EU reserves the right to take additional restrictive measures. In the meantime, the EU is following developments closely in Zimbabwe, it continues its contribution to operations of a humanitarian nature and projects in direct support to the population and it has stated its desire to pursue dialogue with Zimbabwe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0251"></a>

<p>Following a meeting between the Greek Presidency of the EU, the High Representative of the CFSP and the Russian Foreign Minister on 15 April 2003, the Union Presidency welcomed the positive signs in Chechnya, particularly the substantial turnout in the constitutional referendum of 23 March.

Furthermore, is the Council familiar with the report by the pro-Russian Chechen administration of Mr Kadyrov, especially as regards the number of Chechen civilians who have been the victims of summary executions, the number of mass graves and bodies already discovered, and the number of killings perpetrated daily by military and paramilitary Russian forces?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

It will also continue to encourage Russia to adequately investigate all allegations of human rights abuses in a prompt, independent and impartial manner.</p>
<p>The Council believes that a permanent international presence is essential in this context. It therefore supports the Dutch OSCE chairman in office’s on going efforts in achieving a renewed, constructive and long term engagement of the OSCE in Chechnya, mainly designed to strengthen democratic institutions and to promote the rule of law. It is certainly in the interest of Russia to maintain a continued OSCE field presence in Chechnya with a broad mandate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0261"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU is committed to promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities and will continue to play an active role in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee that is scheduled to meet in New York from 16-27 June 2003. The Council has submitted an EU position paper to the UN Secretariat late March 2003 for inclusion in the UNSG’s report on proposals for a comprehensive and integral international convention to promote and protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>This EU position paper (doc. 8997/03), that was agreed by all Member States, sets out the EU’s view on a new legally binding instrument. It discusses inter alia the objectives, principles, scope, definitions, elements to be included, monitoring and evaluation, as well as the relationship of a new instrument to existing international human rights instruments. The paper states that a fundamental principle in elaborating a new legally binding instrument on the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities is that it should have a rights-based approach. Furthermore, it should not duplicate but rather reaffirm and tailor existing human rights rules and standards to the specific situations faced by persons with disabilities. The main purpose of a new instrument should be to seek to ensure the equal and effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The Council is in the process of preparing in more details the upcoming meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee and is still discussing whether should it or not come forward with more detailed proposals for a Convention or should it rather at this stage work on the basis of other proposals. It has not yet discussed the recommendation from the Commission to the Council in order to authorise the Commission to participate in the negotiations of an international legally binding instrument to promote and protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, but will do so in due course.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0269"></a>

<p>Bulgaria has the highest rate of children in institutional care in Europe. Altogether, in 2002, there were 22 000 children (aged 0-18) living in institutional care in Bulgaria. The vast majority of these children do have parents and should not be in these residential homes at all. The continued use of institutions, and the conditions within them, indicate serious breaches of Bulgaria's commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). There is an urgent need for a full reform of the child care system.</p>
<p>Why has Bulgaria not been required to address this situation, as was the case with Romania? Has the Council taken any measures to promote the devising of long-term solutions in the form of community-based alternatives with a simultaneous downsizing of the institutional system?

<p>(EL) The Council attaches the utmost importance to the respect, by candidate countries, of the political criteria for accession established at the Copenhagen European Council, namely democracy, the rule of law, human rights and protection of minorities. The protection of children is therefore a requirement for all candidate countries.</p>
<p>The Commission’s 2002 Regular Report on Bulgaria’s progress towards accession concluded that Bulgaria “needs to strengthen its efforts to reform the child care system, to make sure that the best interests of the child are reflected and reduce the number of children in institutions”. This is also one of the priorities highlighted within the revised Accession Partnership with Bulgaria, which was given political agreement by the Council on 14 April 2003. In fact Bulgaria is now party to the relevant international conventions and has established a legislative framework for ensuring the rights of children. The Bulgarian government is making significant albeit slow efforts to tackle the question of childcare in the country’s harmonization with the Acquis. On the contrary, in Romania’s case, within the Political Criteria, the Section regarding children has still to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the context of the accession negotiations Bulgaria has signed and introduced a number of bilateral agreements with Member States providing for measures aiming at fighting against child abuse. However, sustained efforts are still required to ensure that this legislative framework is properly implemented and that the necessary structures are put into place.</p>
<p>The Union will continue to closely monitor the situation in this regard, in particular within the framework of the bodies established by the European Agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0280"></a>

<p>(EL) The Spring European Council (Brussels, 21 March 2003) reaffirmed its strong commitment to the timely and effective delivery of reforms across the three pillars of the Lisbon strategy – economic, social, and environmental.</p>
<p>The promotion of sustainable growth and the creation of more and better jobs must remain firmly at the top of the Union's agenda, despite the economic slowdown. This involves taking decisive action to increase employment and modernise the European Social model.</p>
<p>In this context, the European Council endorsed the initiatives by Heads of State and Government of certain Member States for the establishment of a European Employment Task Force.</p>
<p><br />Pursuant to the conclusions of the Spring Summit, the European Commission, and not the Council, has set up a European Task Force for Employment.</p>
<p><br />This Task Force will carry out an independent in-depth examination of key employment-related policy challenges and will identify practical reform measures that can have the most direct and immediate impact on the ability of Member States to implement the revised European Employment Strategy and to achieve its objectives and its targets.<br /><br />It is intended, therefore, that the Task Force will be an additional instrument in achieving the Lisbon targets.</p>
<p>On 6 March 2003, the Council (EPSCO) adopted the "Key messages on the future of the European Employment Strategy", which are part of the Joint Employment Report 2002. The Council supported the three overarching objectives of the Strategy: full employment by increasing employment rates, quality and productivity at work and cohesion and an inclusive labour market.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Council has no intention of abandoning its drive for quality in employment and production and is fully committed to supporting the Lisbon strategy, in order to build the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0282"></a>

<p>As far back as October 2001, the Commission proposed certain measures to satisfy the demands of the European tourist sector in its communication entitled ‘The repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the air transport industry’. In order to deal with this state of crisis which has hit certain industries and certain destinations on the market, the Commission has issued a further communication entitled ‘Working together for the future of European tourism’. This communication proposes a strategy for dealing with the medium-term and long-term economic challenges and for monitoring the repercussions of specific incidents on tourism, in close cooperation with the Member States, the tourist sector and the other agencies involved.</p>

<p>The Commission therefore welcomes “Out of the Shadows”, the global campaign against epilepsy, and notes that it is a partnership between the World Health Organisation (WHO) and two international NGOs, the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE). These organisations are active in advocacy about epilepsy, and assisting Ministries of Health to implement activities such as education, training, and research.</p>
<p>The Commission itself has no specific comparative advantage in the field of epilepsy, and the main focus of its development and health policies remains accelerating progress to meet the Millennium Development Goals for health.</p>
<p>The Commission increasingly provides sectoral or global budgetary support to countries rather than project-type assistance. One of the main aims of doing so is to make increased resources available for health systems to tackle major health problems according to nationally agreed priorities. Decisions about what these priorities are vary from country to country, but in some, there may be a good case to include epilepsy and other mental health problems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0279"></a>

<p>(EN) Council Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism, and certain weaknesses in its implementation by Member States, make it impossible to analyse the impact of the war in Iraq on tourism trends in a way that allows a rapid reaction. However, in the wider Mediterranean region of the Community, more or less stable latest trends can be seen for Spain and Italy. Portugal is reported as currently undergoing a slightly negative trend. While data for France are only available until the end of 2001, increased domestic demand there seems to offset a drop in foreign visitors, if any. Greece has transmitted full data only until 1999 inclusive.</p>
<p>On a medium term basis (1997-2001), all Member States in the wider Mediterranean region recorded significant tourism growth, expressed in nights spent. In first place Spain is found with a yearly increase of more than 7%, followed by France, Italy and Portugal, where the rate amounts to 4% and 3%, respectively. In Greece the past annual growth of tourism activity can be estimated at about 1%.</p>
<p>Regarding Community financial support in favour of Europe's tourism industry, despite the current situation, the Commission does not intend to provide specific assistance. A wide range of existing Community financial instruments in the various policy fields provides possibilities of enhancing the competitiveness of the sector, its enterprises and tourist destinations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0218"></a>

<p>The Basque Country and the whole of north-eastern Spain have been taken by surprise at newspaper reports on the route followed by B-52 bombers between their base at Fairford (England) and Iraq.

Rather than refuelling over the Atlantic, they are cutting corners and flying close to towns and cities with hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, whose safety they are jeopardising. The Spanish airforce is banned from carrying out such operations over population centres.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not consider the overflying by these aircraft of densely populated towns and cities to be an infringement of public safety?

<p>(EN) The European Union Solidarity Fund can only be mobilised if a country eligible for support from the Fund affected by a disaster makes a formal application to the Commission.

<p>The Commission has received an application from the Spanish authorities for support under the European Union Solidarity Fund relating to the Prestige accident which it is currently examining. The figures presented in that application are considerably lower than the € 3 billion or 0.6% of GNI (gross national income) threshold. In order to carry out a full assessment of the application and to determine the affected regions and the actual level of damage caused, the Commission has sought from the Spanish authorities clarification and supplementary information on a number of important elements. The examination of the application will proceed on the basis of the information received, thus permitting the Commission to assess if the conditions for mobilising the fund are met, and in turn where appropriate, make proposals to the budgetary authority.</p>
<p>The Commission takes this opportunity to clarify to the Honourable Member that the criterion allowing the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund is not confined only to the € 3 billion damage threshold. A “major disaster” is also considered to be present if damages exceed 0.6% of the applicant country’s gross national income. It should be noted that this latter criterion takes into account the situation of smaller countries with a lower levels of total GNI. The regulation also permits regions to benefit under certain circumstances even if the above criteria have not been met.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission confirms, as mentioned in the question of the Honourable Member that the newly constituted Forum Group on Mortgage Credit met for the first time on 27 March 2003. This Group, which is chaired by the Commission, is composed of 24 members representing a broad diversity of stakeholders: credit industry, insurance sector, consumers, notaries, chartered surveyors etc. It is expected to hold between six and ten meetings between March 2003 and April 2004.</p>
<p>The first meeting was mainly a constitutive one. The principal objective of this meeting was to identify the main issues to be examined by the Group in order to pave the way for an integrated market for mortgage credit. Among the main issues identified were the following: constitution, registration and transfer of mortgages, valuation of properties on a cross-border basis, enforcement, funding, consumer protection, taxation etc. The Group also decided to create sub-groups in order to examine simultaneously all issues identified and report back to the Forum.</p>
<p>In the light of the obstacles that it has identified, the Group is expected to formulate policy recommendations to the Commission in early 2004. The Commission will attach utmost consideration to these recommendations and – subject to its own conclusions – present an appropriate proposal for a genuine European market for home loans. This initiative is seen by the Commission as being part of its broader strategy to develop retail financial services markets, strategy for the elaboration of which the Commission is particularly keen to associate, from the earliest stage, all relevant stakeholders.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0235"></a>

<p>(EN) Under the current CAP reform payment entitlements are linked to farmers who are “active farmers” (as defined in Article 2 of the Proposal for a Council Regulation establishing common rules for direct payments) on the date the single payment system commences. No provisions are established to ensure payment entitlements for landowners that have retired before or during the reference period and consequently whose land has been leased. The payment entitlements will be given to the tenants who exercised an agricultural activity in the reference period on the land in question.</p>
<p>Indeed it can happen that once the lease ends and the leased land revert to the retired farmer he has no entitlements to be claimed for this land. This is one of the problem cases in implementing the CAP reform proposal already brought to the Commission attention.</p>
<p>The Commission is well aware that farmers will be facing certain difficulties when the proposed system for direct payments will be in place. As the Member of the Commission in charge of Agriculture and Fisheries has already said at the Agricultural Council held the 8 April 2003 and in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of 29 April 2003, addressing certain points on “common rules for direct payments”, the Commission is open for considerations to mitigate the sometimes hard economic consequences of such a change in the current system.</p>
<p>Finally, according to the provisions in the Council Regulations (EEC) N° 2079/92 and (EC) N° 1257/1999 farmers who opt into the Early Retirement Scheme must undertake to cease any commercial farming definitively. Moreover provisions in the Irish Rural Development Plan foresee that if the retired farmer wishes to revert to active farming payments already made under the Scheme have to be refunded by the farmer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0237"></a>

<p>(EN) Researchers starting-up their own businesses closely combine skills including scientific excellence and innovation capabilities to produce, manage and exploit new knowledge, therefore reinforcing economic growth and employment potential in Europe. The Commission has for long recognised that Europe needs more entrepreneurs. Increasing entrepreneurship and removing obstacles that prevent researchers and other entrepreneurs to fulfil their dreams has been an issue that the Commission has addressed in the Risk Capital Action Plan of 1998, The Growth and Employment Scheme of 1998, the Multiannual Programme for Enterprises and Entrepreneurship (2001-2005), the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship of 2003, and the Commission Communication “Investing in research: an action plan for Europe” of 30 April 2003.</p>
<p>Securing early-stage finance is often difficult for researchers and others who try to set up an enterprise. The European Technology Facility (ETF) Start-up Facility of the Multiannual Programme for Enterprises and Entrepreneurship (2001-2005) aims to facilitate the provision of risk capital to innovative start-up businesses with growth potential.</p>
<p>The Lisbon summit requested that the European Investment Bank (EIB) should participate in financing start-up firms, and the EIB has given this task to the European Investment Fund (EIF), its risk capital arm. The EIF is already one of the largest suppliers of early-stage finance in Europe using funds from the EIB mandate, its own funds, and funds it manages for the Commission under the Multiannual Programme for Enterprises and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Further research funds are available to small enterprises under the Sixth Framework Programme of Research, Technological Development and Innovation. Technology-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and researchers running their own businesses benefit from increased support to SMEs under this programme. With 15% of the budget of the priority thematic areas allocated to SMEs, the sixth framework programme contributes to promoting the co-operation of SMEs with many participants in large research projects and networks throughout Europe.</p>
<p>To encourage the spread of best practices throughout the EU, the Commission has published a report on the management of incubators and has set up the Gate2Growth network helping innovative start-up businesses to find financing. In particular the peripheral areas of the Union benefit from the reorientation of the regional funds towards more risk financing. To this end the Commission has published a Guide to Risk Capital Financing in Regional Policy that lists good practices from many Member States.</p>
<p>The dramatic decline of risk capital activity since 2000 makes it particularly difficult for young research-intensive SMEs and business-start-ups to grow or even survive in current conditions. Considering the market failure to raise adequate funding for seed and early stage capital, there is a strong case for public initiatives in this area at regional, national and European levels. To this end, the Communication from the Commission “Investing in research: an action plan for Europe” proposes specific measures regarding risk capital, for example to strengthen and broaden EIF risk capital activities to better address current equity gaps and to extend to public research organisations its advisory services on the setting up of new funds. Overall, this action plan aims at building a momentum, ensuring that the necessary initiatives at European and national levels are sustained, mutually consistent and commensurate with the challenge of bringing radical improvements to the European system of research and technological innovation. It marks the start of a process which has the potential to boost Europe’s attractiveness for entrepreneurs and investment in Research and Development.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0246"></a>

<p>(EN) The Community is the largest carpet producer in the world, and currently produces approximately 1.1 billion m<span class="sup">2</span> of carpet, 50% more than its nearest competitor the United States of America. The sector is highly capital intensive and the cost of labour is less important in the sector’s competitiveness compared to more labour-intensive activities.</p>
<p>The abolition of the remaining quantitative restrictions on textile and clothing products on 1<span class="sup">st</span> January 2005 will not affect the carpet sector, as quotas for carpets have already been fully liberalised and the sector has adjusted to a free trade regime.</p>
<p>Enlargement is not expected to have a substantial effect on the European carpet sector, as there is hardly any carpet production in the new Member States and Candidate Countries (apart from rug production in Turkey). However, general economic development in the new Member States is expected to open up new and interesting markets for European carpet manufacturers.</p>
<p>In general, the future of the Community carpet sector, which currently exports 45% of production, will depend upon the global economic climate, transport costs and access to markets. Barriers to trade, including non-tariff barriers, represent the main hindrance to further growth of the sector. The carpet sector has, however, recently been affected by the general economic downturn and by fierce competition from hard floorings.</p>
<p>The European furniture industry currently employs 870.000 workers and generated a turnover in 2001 of over €82 billion. Like many other labour intensive industries, is confronted by fierce price competition from third-country imports, in particular from countries with low labour costs. Hitherto, Community furniture companies have reduced their average costs and improved their competitiveness in world markets through industrial co-operation with companies in neighbouring countries with lower labour costs, including the future Member States and the Candidate Countries.</p>
<p>After enlargement, the Community furniture industry will continue to benefit from sub-contracting activities with the new Member States, and is therefore expected to maintain its competitiveness with respect to third country imports and on the world markets.</p>
<p>To prepare industry in the future Member States and Candidate Countries for enlargement, both the European Furniture Association (UEA) and the European Apparel and Textile Organisation (Euratex) have benefited from Commission funding of projects, first under the “Business Support Programme (BSP) I” and now under “BSP II”. These projects aim at strengthening sectoral associations’ capacity to support and represent effectively the interests of different enterprises (BSP I) and to assist local business operators to cope with the requirements of the Community acquis (BSP II).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0247"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has stressed on many occasions that it deplores all forms of cruelty towards and inhumane treatment and neglect of animals. It does regrettably appear from the reports of the incident referred to by the Honourable Member that some of the animals involved may have suffered as a result of not initially being killed outright by the hunters employed for that purpose.</p>
<p>To date, Community legislation in relation to the welfare of animals covers only animals bred or kept for farming purposes, protection of laying hens, calves and pigs, transport of animals, slaughter and killing of animals bred and kept for the production of meat, skin fur and other products and methods of killing animals for the purposes of disease control and protection of laboratory animals. In the present state of Community law, the responsibility for all other animal welfare issues remains with the Member States.</p>
<p>According to the facts disclosed by various complainants, the bovine animals involved in the incident referred to by the Honourable Member had been running freely in a mountainous area of Spain for about five years and were not under the control of any owner or being reared for any commercial purpose. It therefore appeared very doubtful that they could be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing, which contains no express provisions for the killing of animals in these unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>The Commission fully understands the concerns of those Community citizens who found this incident disturbing.</p>

<p>The funding requested by the Greek authorities before the deadline of 31 March 2003, totals EUR 1 058.2 million, divided among the Structural Funds as follows: ERDF, EUR 618 million; FSE, EUR 315 million; EAGGF, EUR 118 million, and FIFG, EUR 7.2 million.</p>
<p>This has resulted in a shortfall of EUR 468.2 million, EUR 363 million of which relate to the ERDF, EUR 50 million to the ESF, EUR 45 million to EAGGF and EUR 10.9 million to FIFG.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the arbitral proceedings which have been brought by Ireland against the United Kingdom both under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic ("OSPAR"), and under the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea ("UNCLOS").</p>
<p>Neither the Commission nor any other institution of the Community is a party to the disputes. The Commission has not sought to intervene in these disputes. It should be noted that the rules of procedure of the arbitral tribunals both under OSPAR and UNCLOS do not foresee a possibility of intervention by third parties.</p>
<p>In the view of the Commission, several instruments of Community law are pertinent to the disputes. First of all, the Community is a party to the OSPAR and UNCLOS Conventions. To the extent that the provisions of those Conventions invoked by Ireland fall under Community competence, they must therefore be regarded as provisions of Community law. Secondly, in its statement of claim under UNCLOS, Ireland has invoked a number of other provisions of Community law as being pertinent to the dispute, including Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment and Council Directive 96/29/Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.</p>
<p>The Commission has not taken a position on the merits of the disputes between Ireland and the United Kingdom concerning the interpretation of OSPAR and UNCLOS. In this context, the Commission would like to stress that Ireland did not submit a complaint to or otherwise consult with the Commission on the subject-matter of the disputes prior to the institution of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission would like to recall that according to Article 292 of the EC Treaty, questions relating to the interpretation or application of Community law must not be submitted to means of dispute settlement other than those foreseen in the Treaty. The Commission is currently also examining this aspect of the disputes, including the question of whether to institute proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0257"></a>

The industry has been as ruthless as the tobacco industry in trying to coerce the WHO into withdrawing its report. Some sugar caucus congressmen have disgracefully threatened that they would cut off the £260m annual contribution which the US pays to the WHO. To its credit, the WHO has resisted such blackmail. Over half of adults in many developed states are obese, leading to 30 000 premature deaths in the UK - and 300 000 in the US - from heart or chronic diseases. The US Surgeon General, David Warner, has warned that obesity is quickly eclipsing tobacco as the number one threat to public health in developed states.

<p>(EN) The Commission has strong concerns regarding the increasing occurrence of obesity.</p>
<p>During this last year, the Commission services collaborated actively in the definition of the joint report of World Health Organisation (WHO)/Food Agriculture Organisation (FAO) “Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases”.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the framework of the Public Health Programme, a network of national institutes in the field of Nutrition and Physical Activities will be created. One of the main objectives of this network will be the fight against obesity.</p>
<p>The increasing occurrence of obesity could be linked with the progressive dismantling of traditional cultural behaviours in respect of food intakes and new lifestyle trends, which do not yet match appropriate nutritional balances.</p>
<p>This suggests that the distribution of healthy diets and the education of the consumer to make the appropriate dietary choice remain the main challenges requiring Community action.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the network will be held on the 30 June and 1 July 2003 and representatives of WHO have been invited to participate.</p>
<p>In order to improve the comprehension of the rates of occurrence of obesity growth, the Commission will also continue the collection of related data and their analysis.</p>
<p>With regard to food law, the Commission’s priority is to reflect how Community nutrition/labelling legislation can encourage European consumers to adopt healthy diets and lifestyles. To this end, the Commission is currently reviewing its labelling rules and considering new legislation on claims.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0259"></a>

The putting into operation of Galileo, a joint undertaking set up by Council Regulation 876/2002 <a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, has, however, been delayed as a result of the problems that have come to light within the European Space Agency as regards the sharing out of funding for the programme.

Subject to this consideration, 2008 remains the date planned for the start of the system’s operating phase.</p>

The University of Al-Mustansriya, one of the three oldest universities in the world (1284 AD), the Al-Kadhimain mosque (1515 AD), the Abbasid Palace and the museum in Mosul have all been hit, while other archaeological sites are being used as billets for soldiers.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to take an initiative, together with UNESCO and ICOMOS, to send an international delegation of archaeologists to work on the ground, to make a record of the current situation and the thefts, to ask the occupying powers to take measures to prevent the illegal export of antiquities, to ensure that immediate checks are carried out on the illicit trade in antiquities in other countries and to ask the occupying powers to produce a plan to restore Iraq's cultural heritage?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission expresses deep concern for the looting and the destruction of a large number of archaeological treasures in the National Archaeological Museum of Baghdad. The Commission sincerely hopes that all measures will be taken by the coalition forces as present responsible authority in Iraq, so that further destruction is avoided.</p>
<p>The Commission supports the views expressed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in the call issued on 17 April 2003, deploring the extended damages to the cultural heritage of Iraq, and recommending measures to stop the traffic of cultural objects exported illicitly. Within the framework of its competence, the Commission will follow up any United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution or debate addressing this question.</p>
<p>Under the current United Nations (UN) sanctions regime, the export of any cultural goods from Iraq is banned. The possible lifting of sanctions on Iraq is an issue to be decided by the UN.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0265"></a>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>From 31 August 2003, all trucks will be required to pay a mileage toll (‘LKW-Maut’) in Germany. It will be possible to have the toll charged automatically by installing an On Board Unit. In the case of trucks which do not have OBUs, the toll will have to be paid manually using one of the 3500 terminals provided for the purpose. When the system comes into operation, only 150 000 OBUs will be available. Yet in Germany alone, 800 000 are needed. OBUs have to be installed by recognised workshops. So far, no list of recognised installation workshops outside Germany exists. Most HGV drivers will therefore have to enter the data manually. This will undoubtedly cause major problems (language, errors in operating the terminals, traffic jams, changes of route, etc.). Directive 1999/62/EC<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> lays down that tolls and user charges must not be discriminatory nor entail excessive formalities or create obstacles at internal borders.</p>
<p>Does not the Commission consider that the German toll should be postponed until the conditions of Directive 1999/62/EC are met, and in particular until all trucks whose operators so wish can obtain On Board Units?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Germany has notified to the Commission the intention to introduce a new road toll system for the German motorways concerning heavy goods vehicles. The Commission has contacted the German Authorities in order to assess the compatibility of the system with the rules laid down in Directive 1999/62/EC<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> concerning non-discrimination, the easiness of payment ensuring free flow of traffic and the charging level as well as possible State aids aspects. The issue is currently under examination by the Commission.</p>
<p>Today Germany is applying a user charge for the use of its motorways, which represents a paper document connected with the length of use in time. This document is often referred to as the eurovignette. Frequent users may buy an annual or monthly eurovignette, occasional users opt for weekly or daily vignettes.</p>
<p>According to the information available at this stage, the future system of tolls in Germany would be based either on the use of an on-board unit for automatic registration of all the trips or as an alternative a manual registration of each journey via Internet, call centres or terminals. The number of operators which would opt for the on-board unit is not known today. One should take into account that the manual registration would be done quite conveniently in different ways besides the terminals, namely by using the Internet or by contacting the call centre by phone. Information about the system should be available in all the languages of the Union, even if the online registration system only will allow the use of English, French, German or Polish.</p>
<p>The Commission will ensure that Community law is duly respected in the application of all issues related to the new system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission conducted the negotiations of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the basis of negotiating directives which were approved on 16 December 1993 by the Council. The Commission adopted on 13 November 1995 the draft decision of the Council and of the Commission concerning the conclusion of this Agreement. The Parliament approved it on 29 February 1996 (265 votes in favour, 2 against, 3 abstentions) following a report by the Honourable Member Luigi Calligaris. On 17 April 2000, the Council adopted the Decision on behalf of the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission recalls that according to its wording the EC-Israel Association Agreement applies solely to the territory of the State of Israel. It does not apply to settlements or annexed territories, which do not form part of the territory of the state of Israel under international law, as evidenced in relevant United Nations resolutions for instance.</p>
<p>Therefore products obtained in the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are upon their entry into the Community not entitled to preferential tariff treatment under the terms of the EU-Israel Agreement and proofs of preferential origin issued by Israel for these products cannot be accepted by the Community's customs authorities. These principles do not apply to products which have been sufficiently processed within Israel's internationally recognised borders.</p>
<p>The Commission has communicated this interpretation to the customs authorities of the Member States and to the European importers in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a proper implementation of the Agreement and to identify the unlawfully issued proofs of origin, the customs authorities of the Member States are screening all imports that would have a doubtful origin and return the proofs of origin concerned to Israel in accordance with the verification procedure provided for in article 32 of Protocol 4 to the Agreement. Entitlement to the preferences is refused if there is no reply to the request for verification within ten months or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the proof of origin in question or the real origin of the products.</p>
<p>It falls within the competence of the national customs authorities to determine for each and every individual consignment whether the elements of fact and law entitle to the preferential tariff treatment. The Member States have informed the Commission that customs duties have been recovered in a number of cases of goods obtained in the settlements and imported with Israeli proofs of origin. According to the provisions of Article 236 of the Community Customs Code, importers objecting to the recovery can apply for the repayment or remission of the duties.</p>
<p>The Commission scrutinises the recovery of customs duties by the Member States in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 1150/2000 of 22 May 2000<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Parliament is informed on the outcome of the own resources control.</p>
<p>The recovery of customs duties as described above follows from the Community's interpretation of the Agreement and assures the protection of the Community's financial interest, but does not fully resolve the problem of issuing origin certificates to exports not originating in the territory of the state of Israel. In addition, the Commission takes every opportunity to find a definitive solution to this problem.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) There is indeed a well established jurisprudence by the European Court of Justice to the effect that Treaty provisions and the principles that can be inferred from these provisions (in particular the principles of equal treatment and transparency) also apply to contracts which - for one reason or another - are not subject to the detailed provisions of the Public Procurement Directives. The case-law mentioned by the Honourable Member, is also the continuance of well established jurisprudence dating back to the European Court of Justice's judgment of 22 September 1988 in case 45/87 ("Dundalk") and consistently continued in other judgments or orders such as Case C-324/98 ("Telaustria") and Case C-59/00 ("Mousten Vestergaard"). In the words of the Court, these rulings simply establish that "the mere fact that the Community legislature considered that the strict special procedures laid down in those directives are not appropriate in the case of public contracts of small value does not mean that those contracts are excluded from the scope of Community law". It added that "although certain contracts are excluded from the scope of the Community directives in the field of public procurement, the contracting authorities which conclude them are nevertheless bound to comply with the fundamental rules of the Treaty".</p>
<p>A part from a slight reduction deriving from the proposed simplification (which was rejected unanimously by Council), the Commission did not and does not intend to proceed with a general lowering (or elimination) of thresholds - also because to extend the detailed provisions of the Directives to all contracts irrespective of their value would be disproportionate and might raise some criticisms namely concerning the non respect of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>As to the question whether the Commission was aware of this jurisprudence during the legislative process in connection with the legislative package, the Commission wishes to recall that - in answer to an amendment by the Parliament - the Commission's modified proposal did contain a recital to remind users that Treaty provisions and principles apply irrespective of the value of a public contract. This was, however, not accepted by Council in its Common Position purely for reasons of legislative technique. The Commission wishes to add that in respect of contracts not covered because of their subject-matter or form such as service concessions or other forms of Public Private Partnerships, the Commission is currently assessing "the need for a specific legislative instrument so as to allow economic operators better access to concessions and to the various forms of public/private partnerships and so guarantee that these operators can take full advantage of their rights enshrined in the Treaty", as it stated in a declaration to Council Minutes in connection with the adoption of the Common Position on the Directive on Public Works, Supplies and Services Contracts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0276"></a>

<p>Tobacco merchants in Greece, with the complicity of the government, are using vague allegations that the intense rainfall in the country has spoiled the quality of tobacco of the oriental variety harvested in 2002 to pressure tobacco growers into selling their produce at rock-bottom prices and in contravention of applicable contracts. Thus, although the marketing period is officially over, large quantities of oriental tobacco remain unsold and producers therefore also run the risk of losing the related Community subsidies. Furthermore, the prices for the tobacco which has been sold are also rock-bottom compared with last year and the incomes of farmers who are possibly the poorest in Greece and the EU have therefore plummeted.</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission is grateful to the honourable Member for informing it of the problems faced by Greek tobacco growers as a result of poor weather conditions.</p>
<p>The common market organisation for raw tobacco does in fact provide for the grant of the Community premium for raw tobacco leaf to be subject to a certain number of conditions, in particular, the maintenance of quality standards and that the leaf tobacco be supplied to the primary processing enterprise on the basis of a cultivation contract.</p>
<p>It is an essential requirement that a minimum quality standard be maintained. When the sector was last reformed, the introduction of the variable component of the premium gave great encouragement to improvements in quality over and above the minimum standards.</p>
<p>Cultivation contracts between growers and primary processors are in fact subject to private commercial law. Such contracts specify purchase prices corresponding to the various quality requirements. If the minimum quality standard is met, even relatively low prices should not prevent growers from supplying their tobacco and receiving the Community premium.</p>
<p>The common market organisation (CMO) for the raw tobacco sector has the specific object of ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural community concerned. In each specific instance, their income is nonetheless determined by the market price. The Commission will give very specific attention to developments in the situation to which the honourable Member has referred, in order to ensure that tobacco meeting minimum quality standards benefits from the premium.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0281"></a>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member may refer to the possible implications for the European Employment Strategy of the Spring Economic Forecast for 2003 and 2004 recently published by the Commission, which predicts a slight rise in unemployment this year and modest job creation in 2004.</p>
<p>In line with the outcome of the debate on the future of the European Employment Strategy, the new proposal for Employment Guidelines adopted by the Commission on 8 April 2003<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has a medium-term perspective and aims to support the Lisbon objectives. This implies that the Guidelines will be stable and undergo only minimal changes until the mid-term review of the Strategy planned for 2006.</p>
<p>Member States are responsible for designing their employment policy mix for implementing the Employment Guidelines and helping to achieve the Community-level objectives, according to national circumstances and in line with the overall recommendations set out in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. The latter aim at economic stability and sustainable growth and take due account of the recent changes in the economic climate and their implications for each individual Member State.</p>
<p>Although the Employment Guidelines reflect a medium-term strategy, they are intended to strengthen the capacity of Member States and social partners to respond to possible short-term problems on the labour market. Indeed, as already demonstrated since the beginning of the downturn, the overall labour market reforms implemented over the years under the European Employment Strategy have strengthened the structural capacity of our economies to sustain employment in times of economic weakness. A few aspects from the Employment Guidelines could be mentioned here: Firstly, the strengthened approach on unemployment prevention should help to reduce the inflows into long-term unemployment and the better targeting of active policies should increase the chances of reintegration of the unemployed into the labour market. Secondly, by improving investment in human capital and lifelong learning, individuals will be better prepared for any changes in their labour market situation over the whole economic cycle. Thirdly, the call in the Guidelines for positive management of economic change and restructuring should stimulate the search for an alternative to layoffs to manage employment levels in periods of economic slowdown.</p>
<p>The newly created Task Force on Employment has as its main task the identification of practical reform measures that can have a direct and immediate impact on the capacity of Member States to implement the Employment Strategy. The mandate of this Group does not preclude proposals dealing with the management of short-term problems. However it is premature to anticipate its outcome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission does not consider that the European Employment Strategy needs to incorporate a specific element for dealing with short-term changes in the economic climate. The Commission thinks that the design of the Strategy itself foresees such challenges and that the recently adopted and on-going structural reforms will allow such fluctuations to have a lesser negative effect on the European labour market than was the case before the launch of the Strategy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The funds available for 2002 under budget heading A-3046 entitled "Women's Organisations" were designed to cover subsidies for women's organisations other than the European Women's Lobby. As a result, an open call for proposals (VP/2002/014 ) was launched aimed at a consortium of women's organisations, not covered by the European Women's Lobby, which assist women victims of trafficking across Europe. Such an initiative would complement the range of instruments currently available in the Union for combating trafficking, by developing an additional aspect, i.e. assistance on the ground for the female victims of trafficking.</p>
<p>The project submitted by Associazone IRENE (a non-governmental organisation (NGO) representing an Italian network of legally established NGOs) was selected to receive the relevant funding. The aim of this project is to co-ordinate the action of local women's associations from Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Norway, which are active in the field of providing support and assistance to victims of trafficking. The relevant contract took effect on 2 December 2002 and an interim report on the project's results will be available in June 2003, i.e. half-way through the performance period.</p>

Funds on this Budget line are also available to fund Interparliamentary meetings that might be organised in Cancun at the time of the 5<span class="sup">th</span> WTO Ministerial conference.</p>
<p>If the Budgetary Authority again decides to make provision for these activities in the Commission’s part of the 2004 Budget, the Commission would, of course, continue to mobilise the available funds. However, given that the Commission and Parliament share the objective of establishing a permanent structure, which would have its own budget and secretariat, it is difficult to say at this stage how far such funds will be needed in 2004.</p>
<p>While the provision of credits on budget line B7-850 for such activities has been specifically envisaged by the Budgetary Authority, it is noted that the present arrangements require the Commission to provide funds from a budget line for which the Commission will be held accountable but for which the activities are driven by the Parliament. This situation is not ideal. The Parliament is asked to consider whether there is any way for these activities to be transferred to the budget of the Parliament as this would reduce the difficulties of ensuring sound financial management. The costs of Parliament delegations attending preparatory meetings to establish the Assembly are met from the European Parliament’s section of the Budget. Establishing the 2004 Parliament-Budget is a matter for this House, in accordance with the usual procedures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
