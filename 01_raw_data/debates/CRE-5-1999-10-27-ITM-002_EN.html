<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Members of Parliament, for the Commission, the debate which we are having right now is of great interest but is also limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The limitation, which you will all understand and respect, is that at the time of this debate neither the Commission nor the European Parliament have established in a precise and detailed fashion their position and their proposals for the next institutional talks which are due to commence at the beginning of next year. Today, then, the matter in hand, a considerable one, is to assess and gauge the state of mind in which we, together with you, are going to approach these talks.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore going to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, or rather reaffirm, the state of mind shared by President Prodi and the College of Commissioners, and I shall be extremely attentive to what you have to tell me, either on behalf of your political Groups or as individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in asking three respected and experienced individuals to comment freely and express their ideas, the Commission wished, without further ado, to initiate and shed light on the debate. In so doing, I am certain that we are fulfilling our role in the precise spirit of the first clause of Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first objective has been achieved. The debate has been initiated. It must take place here, it must take place within the Member States, within the national parliaments. I shall contribute to it along with all the people interested in building Europe, and there are more of them than you might think, working as closely as possible with the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, Mr President, to express our gratitude to Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, to President von Weizsäcker and Lord Simon for the high quality of their contributions, and to thank you too, in this place, for your welcome and for your careful consideration of their report, particularly within your Committee on Constitutional Affairs, run and chaired by Mr Napolitano.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary merit of the Dehaene report lies in establishing what is at stake and giving a real political perspective to institutional reform. I shall return to this point in a moment. A number of lessons may be learnt from it as of now: firstly, regarding the timetable, secondly, regarding the scope of the reforms which must be implemented successfully and, finally, regarding the way in which these talks must be prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the timetable first of all, ladies and gentlemen, let me express this conviction of mine. This reform is the last opportunity to implement real reform before the greater enlargement of the Union, before the States and the peoples of Europe come together in a great political and economic community. The prospect of greater enlargement is no longer a mere hypothesis, it is not a remote possibility. The Commission decided, on 13 October, that we must prepare for this with the same degree of seriousness, but more quickly. This is why it is necessary for this Intergovernmental Conference to be completed effectively before the end of the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This tighter deadline makes success essential. But the question is, ladies and gentlemen, does this deadline necessarily make a mini Intergovernmental Conference essential? We do not think so. This reform, which is necessary, as we must all realise deep down, is not only and not primarily a matter of time, it is primarily a matter of political will, of clear-sightedness regarding our own way of operating at the moment and its inadequacies; it is a matter of courage, the collective courage that we may or may not have to give priority, this time, to the Union, to give priority to a long-term vision which, as we know, even if it is difficult, goes beyond short-term caution and short-term interests. </p>
<p class="contents">Considering the time limits for the talks, and the time limits for ratification by each of the Member States, now is the time to wish to achieve and to actually achieve a real reform. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not talking about a definitive reform of the European institutions, but of a reform that is far-reaching enough to prevent the institutions being deadlocked or choked, a reform far-reaching enough, as a Member of Parliament said the other day, to enable further development in future. It is a mistake to believe, let me emphasise this strongly, that it will be possible at a later stage, with eighteen, twenty or twenty-seven Members, to carry out the reform which we did not manage to achieve at Amsterdam and which we were not willing to carry through now.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the scope of this reform, we have discussed the level of ambition for this Intergovernmental Conference, and this is the frame of mind of the Commission. This, ladies and gentlemen, should surprise no one, since the great project of enlargement, as I said moments ago, will be even faster and even wider than we imagined at Amsterdam. I repeat therefore: the Commission and the European Parliament are fulfilling their role by wishing to take this conference forward and by recommending that reforms be undertaken now so that the Union may integrate a great number of States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not, ladies and gentlemen, a matter of challenging the Cologne conclusions. The primary obligation of this Intergovernmental Conference will be to deal with the matters which were still outstanding after Amsterdam, and deal with them properly; deal with them, I must emphasise, ambitiously, because it is perfectly possible, let me tell you from experience, to deal with these three subjects with a greater or lesser degree of ambition. All three of these matters, the number of Commissioners within an enlarged Union, the new weighting of votes, the scope of qualified majority voting, are extremely problematic, but necessary, subject areas. Our feeling, let me tell you, is that it will not be so hard to deal with them if they are included in a political perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the list of questions mentioned in the Dehaene report seems perfectly admissible to us. Not one of the ideas put forward may be deemed superfluous. It is not unnecessary to work on the reorganisation of the Treaty to make it more readable, more accessible to citizens and in order to imagine one day the simpler amendment of common policies, as opposed to the fundamental principles of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not unnecessary to seek to improve the system of strengthened cooperation, without however taking the slightest risk, I am absolutely sure, of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> becoming “unravelled” in some way or other. It is not unnecessary to hope that it may be possible, by the end of the year 2000, in the new Treaty, to draw the conclusions affecting the institutions of the decisions which may be taken in the meantime, in the spirit of Cologne, for the security and the defence of the continent of Europe. It is not unnecessary, ladies and gentlemen, to work on the other institutional questions which arise with enlargement. For example, the matter of the legal personality of the Union. For example, the matter of the operation of the Court of Justice, or even the matter of more concerted European action in the fight against fraud. I am saying this in the aftermath to the Tampere Council, which you have just discussed with my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino. On all these matters, and on others too perhaps, the Commission will be pleased to hear your reactions and your suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a brief word about preparations for the talks. The intentions of the Portuguese and then the French presidency, the intentions of the Finnish presidency, before the Helsinki meeting, are essential for the Intergovernmental Conference to be able to proceed on a firm foundation and to go ahead, may I say, as early as possible, by the beginning of the year 2000. As for us, we are making serious preparations, and this is the least that can be expected of the Commission. Within the College of Commissioners, as of 10 November, we shall be debating the form and the broad lines of our formal report which is to be published before the start of these talks.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, ladies and gentlemen, this formal report will be a comprehensive, forceful policy document, constructed and structured so as to be of use in the talks, to facilitate and, we hope, expedite them. Recalling the fine quality throughout the entire period of the run-up to Amsterdam, of the contributions made by the two representatives of the European Parliament, Elisabeth Guigou and Elmar Brok, I would also like to say that I think it generally useful for Parliament to be able to have a say and to be involved, ideally, in these forthcoming talks.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude with this observation. Between caution and recklessness, between realism and utopianism, there is, we are convinced, a place for and a path towards the real reform of our institutions, for the more efficient and more democratic operation of the Union, not to delay enlargement, but to make a success of it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, let me first of all say a word of thanks on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats to Jean-Luc Dehaene, Richard von Weizsäcker and Lord Simon for this report which is ambitious, courageous and yet, at the same time, realistic. That is why this report points to the future. We had a debate with Jean-Luc Dehaene in our Group last week. – Commissioner Michel Barnier was present – and I should like to tell you, Commissioner, that we have every confidence that you will make your contribution towards taking the European Union, aided by the work of the Commission, into a worthwhile future. You have the support of all of us on this road. </p>
<p class="contents">In Helsinki it will be decided that we should negotiate with six further States about accession to the European Union. We are therefore negotiating with 12 States in all, and it is very probable that, in a first round, more than five States will accede to the European Union. It is not therefore realistic to limit this Amsterdam Protocol to three subjects. We must go beyond that. As the Group of the European People’s Party, the Christian Democrats and the European Democrats, we therefore say: we want more than was promised in Amsterdam; we want Amsterdam plus; we want a fundamental reform of the European Union so that it is capable of the expansion which is a great priority for us. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The heart of the matter is certainly majority voting in the Council, and we are in favour of this becoming the basic decision-making procedure. In all questions of majority voting, moreover, the European Parliament must have equal rights under legislation to participate in decision-making, as it already has now in the case of agricultural policy (which is a further point). Where the matter must still be discussed, we appreciate that each country is also represented on the Commission and that we are getting a new weighting in the Council of Ministers. The double majority is one instrument, and there are others. However, the way in which the votes that can be cast in the Council of Ministers are recalculated must still, of course, be democratic in character. I would also say that there is a dimension beyond all legal procedures. Whenever, now, representatives of a number of large Member States show a certain presumption, a certain arrogance towards smaller Member States, we reject this and say that all Member States of the European Union make their contribution and must be integrated into the Union. On this issue, the large Member States too ought to acknowledge that the Presidencies of many a small country have proved to be more successful, more efficient and more committed than those of many large Member States. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We approve of the proposal of the Committee of Wise Men to create a basic Treaty. I am particularly glad that our friend Jacques Santer was pleased about this point because his country, Luxembourg, is an example of an efficient smaller Member State. We emphasise that it is quite right – and I think this is a brilliant idea – for the working party to have proposed creating a basic Treaty and a Treaty for the enlarged Union. Under the basic Treaty, all Member States and all Member Parliaments would always be represented when a reform was proposed. That is only right. Under the Treaty for the enlarged Union, it would be the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament which could take the relevant decision This makes for flexibility, and the possibility would exist of doing justice to the respective requirements of the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barnier spoke of the legal personality of the European Union. Legally, the European Union is at present a non-entity, a nothing; it cannot even buy a house, let alone be represented in an international organisation. This is something we must change if the European Union is to carry any weight in the world. </p>
<p class="contents">We must also take action in the field of foreign, security and defence policy. Just last week, the Institute for Strategic Studies in London said that Europeans were not in a position to act. That is not only a question for the European Union as an institution, but a question of the readiness of the Member States to provide our armed forces with the necessary logistical support and reconnaissance. We expect the new High Representative, Mr Solana, to arrange with Chris Patten for the necessary initiatives to be taken here. We also now need a large-scale debate about the geographical enlargement of the European Union, about what it is to contain, and we urge the Council of Ministers, which is to say the ladies and gentlemen who are represented there, to have the courage to lead Europe into a worthwhile future, for we are concerned here with stability, peace and democracy on our continent in the 21st century. </p>

We must address wider issues. This IGC, though, will not be so much about broadening the field of responsibility or the competences of the European Union; it will be about structural reform, institutional reform, reform that will make the Union more open, more efficient, more democratic and more transparent. Above all, the IGC will make it capable of functioning and carrying out its responsibilities when it is composed of more than 20 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The three Amsterdam leftovers will be part of the package but they will not be alone. We are winning the argument to have a wider agenda. But even those three leftovers, as Mr Barnier underlined, are not subjects which are easy to handle. For instance, extending the field of qualified majority voting will immediately provoke assorted Eurosceptics and others to say in their Member States that their country is giving up the veto and giving up sovereignty. Indeed, it is the position of one of the largest component parties of the EPP that there should not be an extension of qualified majority voting. Yet if they pause to think for one minute they would soon realise that their own country, every country, probably loses more from the vetoes cast by other countries than they gain in using their own in many areas of European Union responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">However, change must come not just for the three Amsterdam leftovers; extension of qualified majority voting, the size of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council. Change is necessary for the Court. How will it function if it is going to be composed of nearly 30 members? Change is necessary as regards the size of this Parliament if we are to respect the limit of 700 members laid down in the Treaties at our own request. Something needs to be done to take further the conclusions reached by our Member States that the WEU should now be integrated and its functions, or part of its functions, transferred to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the question of codification and simplification of the Treaties, an issue that this Parliament was first to highlight in the run-up to the Amsterdam negotiations; a task started by Amsterdam but far from complete and which, too, is a point underlined and highlighted in the Dehaene report.</p>
<p class="contents">In adding new issues like those to the IGC we are not necessarily making it more difficult. Having a wider package might make it easier to reach agreement and easier to ratify in our Member States but I can say, on behalf of my group, that we are willing to have Parliament work closely with the Commission in the spirit that Mr Barnier has just indicated, so that together we can put a balanced package of proposals on the table of the IGC that he, and our representatives to all the meetings of the IGC, can defend: a package that will make the Union fit to work when it has more than 20 Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must realise that it will be virtually impossible – and certainly it will be impracticable – to forge agreement between 25 or 30 states upon essential questions of sovereignty. So, the key reform is Article 48 for treaty change. We must entrench the constituent articles of the treaty and we need a softer, lighter system for changing the treaty in regard to policy chapters. The first reform will calm citizens’ fears of creeping sovereignty transfers and the second should encourage citizens to engage more obviously with the political choices that we face in Brussels and in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reform that is essential is to remove the national veto from the clauses of reinforced cooperation; and the third will be to grant citizens the right of direct approach to the European Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add that the main ideas have been advanced by the European Parliament for decades, so it does not seem particularly original. I would like to make the most of my short speaking time to invite you and President Prodi to reflect on the risks we are running in only talking to the governments and trying to convince them alone, especially the most reluctant ones, and always trying to combine realism and credibility in proposals which are often ambiguous and moderate. </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is worrying that even the Wise Men, who no longer have any obligations to anyone, consider trying to reach a compromise as a priority and that they want to play a part which is not theirs. I hope that in the proposal that you put to us, the Commission and yourself will have the courage to aim higher and that you will be able to justify the need to establish a constitutional section in the founding texts of the European Union with something more inspiring than the mere reorganisation of the confused texts of the Treaties. I am sorry that President Dehaene could not find this courage. I also hope that the Commission will be able to free itself of the inefficient and anachronistic pillar structure and clearly refute the extremely odd idea which the Wise Men put forward, that Parliament’s power of codecision is legitimised only under the first pillar. The courage to seek alliances and a consensus outside the palaces of power, among the people, and in this Parliament, is a challenge that the Commission must accept. If it does not, we will all lose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No, what the citizens of the European Union rightly expect is true democracy, transparency and efficient decision-making. What is necessary, above all, is the courage to critically examine the policies of the Union so far. The need for a socially just Europe remains highly topical. We need a reform of the Union which finally places the struggle against mass unemployment and poverty at the centre of policy. The reform should also entail having the courage to change Article 4 of the EC Treaty which, in classically neo-liberal manner, defines the Union as an open market economy with free competition. </p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to Article 105 of the EC Treaty so that the European Central Bank might have the contractually established political task of using its monetary policy to promote growth and employment. Our citizens must be involved in the debate about the content and objectives of the reform. They must have the opportunity, through referenda, to themselves deliver their own judgement on the results of the Intergovernmental Conference. </p>
<p class="contents">I have noted with interest the proposals of Messrs Dehaene, von Weizsäcker and Simon. A number of these I personally consider to be definitely worth discussing, for example the proposals to simplify the Treaties or the proposal that qualified majority voting in the Council and the involvement of Parliament in decision-making ought to be the rule in future. As a Member of the European Parliament representing a large Member State, I attach the greatest importance, of course, to the fact that the rights of small States should not be restricted. </p>
<p class="contents">One thing, though, I want finally to say loud and clear here. My Group decisively rejects the integration of the Western European Union into the Union. We want to see a civilian Europe characterised by solidarity. We do not want a military union appearing in future, armed to the teeth, as a Euro policeman on the stage of international politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers the Dehaene report on the institutional implications of enlargement to be unsatisfactory in terms of both its method and the greater part of its conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, its method. The Cologne Council, last June, refused to appoint a limited working party to prepare the work of revising the Treaty. It did want discussions to be more open from the outset. And what did we find? The Commission, piqued at not having been able to control the debate completely, hastened to appoint a limited working party on its own account, which was immediately described as a Committee of Wise Men even though its members are no wiser than most people here today. All this in order to attempt to force the Council to retain the conference agenda which the Commission wanted. It is not surprising, in such conditions, to see that the Dehaene report, basically, is seeking to strengthen the powers of the Commission and circumvent the rights of the States. First of all, by a strange coincidence, this text concludes that, from the very beginning of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission will have to submit a complete draft Treaty to the Council. It is simply a continuation of the same old method of forcing decisions through.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same spirit, the working party puts forward the old federalist proposal of making qualified majority voting the general rule in the Council. This proposal, combined with maintaining the Commission’s monopoly of initiative, would ultimately end, as we know, in a considerable strengthening of the Commission’s powers and a concomitant reduction in the rights of States. For that matter, it is quite interesting to note that the system of majority voting is presented in the report, in a fine example of European Newspeak, as, I quote, “leading to consensus”, whereas, obviously, the opposite is true. Majority rule obliges the minority to give way, especially the smaller States, whereas the requirement for unanimity makes it necessary to negotiate until a consensus is obtained.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, in the same spirit of circumventing State power, the Dehaene report proposes that the Treaty may, in some cases, be modified by a simple Council decision, and even on the basis of a decision taken by qualified majority alone. This is absolutely unacceptable, since it stands in absolute contradiction to our concept of a Europe which respects its nations. Apart from the usual federalist clichés, the report does, however, tentatively sketch out one new idea, the idea of the institutional flexibility required in an enlarged Europe. It acknowledges what we have always said, that the cases of strengthened cooperation outlined by the Treaty of Amsterdam go in no way towards resolving the twofold problem of increasing heterogeneity and the absolute impossibility of giving up sovereign powers in favour of procedures for decision by qualified majority and, what is more, in a Europe comprising thirty or more States. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the real subject that must be included on the agenda of the IGC, and a second subject, “how to restore national control in Europe” should be added to the first, since it too posits the free exercise of national sovereignty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, on reading the report, one notices that it makes no mention of the visions, the goals or the challenges facing Europe on the eve of the 21st century. Nevertheless, it does, at least, give some broad guidelines on a number of institutional issues which must be addressed. Despite Commissioner Barnier’s very interesting comments, we have yet to see how many and which of those proposals we shall adopt and what needs to be added for the European Union to prepare itself properly for the future. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barnier’s comments about the Commission presenting a text which will be “<span class="italic">global et fort</span>” are quite significant. We, therefore, await the contents of this text. In any case, from the European Parliament’s point of view, we must press for the text to include a systematic approach to all aspects of the European Union, so that the new Intergovernmental Conference can address in turn all the issues and problems which concern us at present using the Aristotelian logic that politics is the art of the possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would be disastrous and fatal because what the 15 States cannot settle among themselves, 20 or 25 States most certainly will not be able to. Now is the last chance to reform the Union in such a way that it functions properly, is understood by the citizens and is capable of being expanded. </p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Treaties are to be redesigned. None of our citizens understands the Treaties of Maastricht or of Amsterdam. It is unreasonable to expect any citizen of the Union to read these texts. The texts must now successfully be divided up into their genuinely constitutional and their more technical elements. This distinction needs to be made, as it is in our Member States’ own fundamental laws or constitutions. </p>
<p class="contents">A word about the reform of the institutions. The Dehaene Group has concentrated very much upon the reform of the Commission. In my view, it is the Council which should be at the centre of the reform. The Commission will function on the basis of what is done now. Parliament has carried through reforms and is functioning. The institution which is not functioning is the Council. It is the Council which forms a barrier within the Union. In Parliament, we shall therefore also be concentrating on making demands for the reform of the Council. The rules must somehow be laid down for this dual role it has as both a legislative and an executive body, and certainly in a Union of 20 or 25 Member States. I hope, Commissioner Barnier, that the Commission can come up with a concrete proposal for altering the Treaty, which we shall then discuss. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must act in accordance with this message and work for change. The Intergovernmental Conference is one very good opportunity for doing just that. </p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot to be inspired by in the Report of the Wise Men, and we ought to use the Intergovernmental Conference to carry out a proper examination of the Treaties. We need to simplify, open up, clarify and review all of the European Union’s tasks and bring about an order in which the EU concentrates on fewer things, that is to say the genuinely cross-border problems. The EU’s citizens need a democratic constitution which lists the powers that can be exercised, and in such a way that accountabilities are clear and that the principle of subsidiarity is of proper significance. </p>
<p class="contents">With these ambitions on the eve of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that we can succeed in both of the EU’s major tasks: to create a larger Union which functions democratically and to win back some of the confidence our citizens have lost in the European Union, as well as the legitimacy they lent to the enterprise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much regret, Commissioner Barnier, that the preparatory work for the Intergovernmental Conference contains no trace of that turn-of-the-century magic and of an ability to entertain new visions. I also regret that, quite unlike the panegyrics delivered in this House, the deliberations of the Committee of Wise Men revealed no such visionary courage either.</p>
<p class="contents">When it came to the whys and wherefores of reforming the European institutions, reference was made to the technocratic concepts of increased efficiency and the ability to act, but not so much as a glance was directed towards the very urgent and necessary matter of establishing a European democracy. The Committee of Wise Men wastes not a word of criticism on the second and third pillars of this democratic no-man’s land of intergovernmental cooperation. Nor does it hazard any proposal to include this area among those which are to be subject to democratic reform. Nor is any thought wasted on the Intergovernmental Conference as a method, which we now all know is in no position to bring the European idea any closer to fruition. Involving Parliament is, in truth, not one of its concerns. </p>
<p class="contents">Nor does the report of the Committee of Wise Men contain a single mention of the social dimension of the European Union, which is a prerequisite of a European democracy. On the question of foreign and security policy, the report wastes a lot of time on developing security policy, as well as policies for governments and heads of state, and forgets in the process that security policy is a function of foreign policy. </p>

<p class="contents">What must it do? It must maintain the institutional equilibrium, which has allowed the advance of European construction over the last forty years. What must it mean?

<p class="contents">In this context, I wish to say that the report carried out by Mr Dehaene is very correct in many areas, but it contains something that worries me very considerably.

And to this add making strengthened cooperation more flexible.</p>

However, the proposals fall short with respect to the requirements of a Union numbering more than thirty Member States. If the Union was to have twice as many Member States as it has now, the decision-making process would completely run aground unless drastic changes were to be put forward, and they would have to be far more drastic than those that are now on the table. Inevitably, the competences of the Commission, as guardian of common European interests would be extended at the expense of the competences of the national governments represented in the Council. This would demand far greater democratic legitimacy on the part of the Commission than is presently the case, and it would be necessary in the long term for all Commissioners to be directly elected. Of course our Parliament would also need to be accorded the authority due to it. What has a revolutionary ring to it now will soon seem very realistic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Subsidiarity here seems to be a concept which gets lip service but not real action and it certainly needs redefining in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The autonomous regions and nations internal to the Union states of the European Union, like Spain or the United Kingdom or Belgium, must obtain effective standing in our system. Reform in the Council would be one prerequisite. It could properly differentiate its executive and legislative roles and in the latter begin to approximate itself to a territorial chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee of the Regions as at present constituted is both toothless and not in any sense fairly representative. Are Members here aware that Luxembourg has six members in the Committee of the Regions and Scotland four? I am not familiar with the differences between east and west Luxembourg but I know a little about the internal differences of Scotland, and the principle of representation as it exists is absurd. A committee that was supposed to enable regions and internal nations to counterbalance the states is dominated by the state system.</p>
<p class="contents">New members will arrive here with enlargement in this Parliament, many of them representing former member nations of union states. Think of Slovenia, think of Estonia. They are small states but their representation will automatically exceed that of the Basque country, that of Flanders, that of Scotland, that of Wales. The principles of representation in Europe, as applied to its nations and regions need to be re-examined, and I am very sad that the Dehaene report has said practically nothing about this.</p>

It is running and running, but no longer knows where it is running to or how it is going to get there.</p>
<p class="contents">The European currency is not yet in circulation, and yet in Cologne in June there was mention of a European army, and in Tampere in September of a European criminal justice system, a Charter of fundamental rights is being prepared and finally, above all, the Commission is inviting the European Council to accept the prospect of a Europe expanding as far as Asia Minor, up to the western borders of Iraq and Iran. This is not just enlargement, it is explosion.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people, including us UDF members within the PPE, are in favour of the new developments in Europe. Others among us are doubtful and even hostile. But I believe that we are all unanimous in considering that it is time for the political leaders to regain control of the machine and to dare finally to discuss the objective of the geographical dimension and the way forward for political union in Europe, as we did for economic and monetary union in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">How far is Europe going to go? How far, in terms of geography? This has never been debated either here in Parliament, or in the Council or the Commission. How far is Europe going to go, in terms of jurisdiction? A Europe of thirty Member States will no longer be able to operate in the same way as the Europe of twelve Member States. On the one hand, it will need a far more efficient decision-making system, one that is of a political and no longer diplomatic order. On the other hand, there will be far fewer matters of common interest and there will be much greater demand for decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">How far do we want to go? With what partners and by what route? These are the questions which must be answered before giving instructions to the legal experts on matters like “the future weighting of the vote for the beautiful island of Malta”.</p>

It is a pity that the report contains no ‘onions’, as institutional differentiation would seem to be the only realistic solution for a Union that is expanding fast.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future Europe must comprise three institutional circles. The outer circle would be the European Council, whose intergovernmental institutions could be utilised better than they are at present by giving them new jobs to do. The second circle would be the European Union, which would develop as an association of states in the future. This would mean the decentralisation of decision making and would require intergovernmental cooperation to be strengthened. This sort of EU association could easily and rapidly expand. The inner circle would be the Federation of Europe, made up of an integrated group of EU states that had progressed the furthest: those that belong to NATO and the euro area. The EU would thus become an association of states, the core of which would be a federation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not have 101 recipes for making an Intergovernmental Conference’s work rapid and efficient. If there is a desire to avoid a new tour de force in legal high technology, an inextricable tangle, then one way or another it will always be necessary to refer back to the substance of this crystal-clear report. It does not have to be Mr Dehaene’s swansong. But if we fail to embrace the crucial importance of post-Amsterdam Treaty developments then we run the risk of rendering Europe powerless. The ball is now in the court of the Member States and the Commission. As far as we are concerned, and let this be made very clear, reforming the Union is, in any case, still a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non </span>for enlargement.

As regards today’s debate, the rules of the game were clear. This debate was of great interest to the Commission but it was also somewhat limited since neither the Commission nor yourselves had yet defined precise positions and proposals. It was therefore an exchange of views on the basis of the Dehaene report which President Prodi had intended specifically to initiate and shed light on this debate. I have listened to all the speakers, Mr President, with a great deal of attention and I thank them for their attention and for their own contributions. We are going to take these questions, these suggestions, and even these occasional criticisms or fears into account in the few days which remain before 10 November. This is the day on which the Commission is to establish its initial position on policy, and then we shall have a debate on the Commission’s first policy document. After this, we shall again have a great deal of work to do between 10 November and the start of the talks, since the Commission will then have to submit a document which I have myself described as a forceful and comprehensive policy document, designed to be of use to the negotiators and to facilitate the talks. During this period we shall have to work in close liaison with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and with the Parliament. I therefore wish, Mr President, by way of conclusion, to thank the European Parliament for this initial exchange of views on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and on the ambitions we should have in approaching this conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
