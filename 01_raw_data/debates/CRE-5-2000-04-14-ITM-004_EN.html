This is completely understandable if we consider that the majority of European citizens are exposed to uncomfortably high levels of noise. </p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, the European institutions’ delay in legislating is highly regrettable, particularly the Commission’s failure to propose practical measures to combat noise and to set limit values for noise exposure. A Green Paper was presented in 1996 and nothing else has happened since. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the noise problem is largely due to transport, particularly road transport, but air transport is a factor which is also giving increasing cause for concern. The peak levels of noise during take-off and landing are specific to air transport and, of course, this problem is exacerbated by the effect of the noise at night, for it must be admitted that night flights, or rather aircraft taking off and landing during the night, make sleep almost impossible in some areas near airports. </p>
<p class="contents">What has been done to regulate aircraft to date? Standards were last established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 1977. Therefore, there has been no progress in this area for 23 years, and it is clear that aircraft replacement policies are not in any way motivated by the introduction of more stringent standards, to the extent that our aircraft are extremely outdated.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent Commission communication on air transport and the environment defines a noise reduction strategy based both on economic factors, such as improving air traffic control and airport access, and on fostering progress in technology. This is a good strategy which will limit the increase in noise pollution, but in my opinion and, I would argue, the opinion of a good number of Members, it will not allow us, in the short term, to reach our objective which is that nobody is exposed to dangerously or uncomfortably high noise levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, a number of countries and regions have taken steps to restrict access to airports at night. Unfortunately, they have not been very organised about it, with the result that some firms, particularly courier and freight companies, have reacted badly – to my mind, dangerously. They are threatening to relocate and this is creating economic insecurity in the regions concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that harmonisation at European level is imperative. Of course, this does not mean demanding uniformity, for regional differences must be taken into account, but there must be a common core in the approaches of the different Member States of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that the organisation of night air transport activities, which are inevitably going to be noisy whatever the level of technology employed, is certainly something which must be restricted and coordinated. I therefore call upon the Commission to take action in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">I made no contribution to this morning’s debate and, with your permission, I would like to say a few words now regarding the vote. Personally, I would prefer a vote in which a large number of Members take part to a vote which takes place at noon on Friday in which only thirty or forty Members participate. Frankly, that distresses me, for a resolution voted in by only a small number of Members carries very little weight. I took part in this morning’s action and I did not appreciate criticism from Members who interpreted it as an anti-Strasbourg manoeuvre. I am not at all against Strasbourg: quite the opposite, and I have proved it many times, despite the fact that I am Belgian. I do not wish to see Strasbourg cease working normally from Monday to Friday. </p>

<p class="contents">One of the goals of the Commission communication ‘Air transport and the environment – towards sustainable development’ is precisely to launch the debate on the suitability of establishing a Community framework for decision-making procedures concerning the operational restrictions to be imposed on airports in the Union for environmental reasons. In the course of this debate, which will be held in the different institutions, the Council of Ministers and Parliament will have the chance to express their views on this communication, both in general terms and with regard to specific aspects such as night flights. </p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out in this communication, the Commission does not see how uniform and restrictive rules governing restrictions on use, which would apply to all Community airports, as would be the case, for example, for the general ban on night flights, could provide the most balanced solution to the issue of noise pollution attributable to certain airports. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion that decisions should continue to be taken at local level. However, it also considers that a common framework is necessary to coordinate the procedures adopted in order to reach these decisions so that when a region decides to ban night flights, for example, it does so in the same way as a similar region somewhere else. And this framework could make it compulsory for all the interested parties to be consulted, stipulate an appropriate timeframe for adaptation to the new restrictions and establish a common basis for assessing the efficiency in environmental terms of the envisaged measures restricting operations. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to touch on the subject of hushkits. With regard to speeding up the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft, the Commission is committed to the work currently in progress within the International Civil Aviation Organisation on drafting a new standard on noise and rules for the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft. If, as we hope, all goes according to plan, this work will result in the 33rd Assembly of the ICAO adopting new, binding international noise regulations in September 2001. Compared with the hushkits regulation, which is content to put a freeze on the current situation for aircraft whose certificate has been renewed, genuine international rules requiring the progressive withdrawal of these devices would have greater effect in terms of environmental protection. </p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in view of the United States’ refusal to back down over the hushkits regulation, the provisions of this regulation on banning the attachment of these devices will enter into force on 4 May next. Given that the provisions governing the banning of aircraft registered in third countries will only come into force on 1 April 2002, the Commission’s interpretation of the conclusions of the 33rd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation will provide all the elements necessary to decide whether it is appropriate to replace the hushkits regulation with rules for progressive withdrawal adopted at international level. All this is in the pipeline. The Commission is working on it and would like to thank Parliament for its cooperation on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talked about hushkits not so long ago. I understand from the observations made by the Commissioner that the regulation as it has been laid down will enter into force on 4 May next.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is not only hushkits which are causing us considerable concern. In broader terms too, we have to establish that, on account of the increase in air traffic, noise pollution is growing at an alarming rate, especially for citizens who live near busy airports. At night time, in particular, this level of pollution is out of all proportion. The number of night flights should therefore be significantly reduced. But what is meant by night? At Düsseldorf airport, night falls at 10 p.m., according to Mr Florenz. We in the Netherlands are far more flexible in this respect. Night does not set in until 1.00 a.m. and we do not actually term it night, we refer to it as the brink of night. Mr President, whatever time we are talking about, it means that we need a coherent approach to noise pollution caused by the transport of civilians and freight by air, as the individual Member States are applying very different rules. These lead to the direct and undesired effect that airports start to compete with each other. They reason that as long as they are flexible enough, they will get a lot of freight traffic. But, at the end of the day, it is the people living near airports who suffer. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, so what needs to happen? First of all, all noise pollution, including pollution generated by aircraft, must be tackled at source. This means thorough research into low-noise engines. This means bans and international standards. But it also means that we need European framework legislation which ensures that measurements are taken, standards set, zonal structures put in place in the same way for all European airports. What we are asking for – not for the first time, in fact, we did this two and a half years ago in connection with the report on noise pollution which was supported by the late Mrs Carmen Diez de Riviera – is this legislation. Commissioner and Mrs Reding – you are representing Mrs de Palacio at the moment – you are saying that this is extremely difficult, but I am not asking you for a ban, or even a night ban. What I do want is to keep the discussion around this issue going and to continue where Parliament left off before. It was our own amendment, tabled on behalf of the European People’s Party. Let us thus fight for a European directive which, thanks to Mrs Loyola de Palacio’s new impetus, ensures that we – at long last – can give our citizens what is theirs. That is peace and quiet at night, but this also implies a proper zonal structure, insulation and sound legislation in Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This undoubtedly brings many benefits, but there are also many drawbacks. I would like to make it clear straight away that, if Europe does not intervene, aspects such as quality of life, the economy and social factors will very much be in the balance. The key question is, do we want our citizens to enjoy a good night’s rest, and even day’s rest and, secondly, are we able to give them just that? If you will allow me, I will dwell for a moment on the problem of noise pollution suffered at my own country’s national airport, an airport which, by the way, many of you frequent very regularly. The noise pollution at Zaventem has exceeded the permitted levels for a long time. The quality of life – and sleep – of the people living in the vicinity is appalling by any standard. The solution to this problem has caused great uproar in Belgium and in my government. As you know, the Belgian Government embraces people from the blue, green and red sections of the political spectrum. Well, when the green Minister had the audacity to propose a complete night ban, all of a sudden, Belgium was not big enough for the fierce discussion which followed. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you may be red and green in your heart, and I can assure, this is what I am. I too want to continue to promote life and the quality of everyone’s existence as the supreme good. This is all well and good on paper, but this can be very difficult to implement in practice. What is worse? Having a very difficult or bad night’s sleep, day in day out, or suddenly losing your job and your income? Indeed, the parcel company at Zaventem had threatened hundreds, if not many more, redundancies. All of a sudden, the trade union and employers joined forces. Belgium has meanwhile come up with a solution: a combination of measures which involves a restriction of noise at source, strict supervisory measures and a number of infrastructural planning measures, such as offering insulation to the houses affected. </p>
<p class="contents">It is an improvement, but not a solution. Too many people continue to suffer from excessive noise in their bedrooms. Nonetheless, Belgium, in tandem with other Member States, has taken on a pioneering role in this discussion and the question is then, will that country, with its businesses and people who work and live there, suffer as a result? We can only avoid this if night flights and noise pollution are tackled at European level. This is, in fact, what we are asking for and I am delighted to see that people of all political persuasions in this Parliament are asking for the same thing. I therefore hope that the Commission will be receptive to this. Europe will need to resolve the false dilemma that exists of having to choose between the economy and social and environmental considerations. We would like a standardised method to measure noise pollution within the Union. In this connection, we would also like uniform standards and an effective costing rule. In addition, we would like criteria which determine when a night ban should be instituted within the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">In a recent communication from the Commission on air transport and the environment, an initial strategy has already been outlined. This is to be welcomed, but it is not enough. Firstly, this does not solve the current problem, as Mr Lannoye has already pointed out. Secondly, this is simply a communication, but we want hard legislation from the Commission, so that everyone knows where they stand. I regret that the Commissioner – the Commissioner who is standing in for Commissioner de Palacio that is – is of the opinion that it is very difficult to institute a night ban. I think that, with a little good will, this should be feasible. I am looking forward to her reply.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its communication on airports and the environment, the Commission mentioned a few things about noise, one being – and you also echoed this yourself – that the principle of subsidiarity applies to noise. In other words, it must be possible to implement at local level without the European Union having to regulate everything. I would, however, like the Commission’s guarantee that distortion of competition is ruled out. An interesting concept in the communication is the drafting of classification lists, not only for aircraft, but also for airports. This would mean that noise-sensitive airports would be distinguished from others and that certain activities could not take place at such airports but could possibly take place at less noise-sensitive airports. Mrs Van Brempt already pointed this out: we are faced with a dilemma. </p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that certain businesses and a certain economic sector totally rely on night flights. If we asked them what would happen if there were no night flights, they are bound to say that they would have to close down their businesses, their activities would become pointless and they would no longer be able to offer their services. Our question is, therefore: how can we marry the two together? The Commission should then legislate against distortion of competition between different airports in different Member States. Mrs Van Brempt clearly stated what the dilemma was for the Belgian Government. It is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. As it happens, the Belgian Government has taken a number of measures, but would it not be useful, for example, if the Commission were to compile some sort of list of good and bad airline companies in terms of noise, if it were to draw a distinction between those who do invest in combating noise, those who can present a good record in combating noise and those who cannot, those who do not try their best, and then combine this with measures. Because one thing is clear: noise must be penalised. Accordingly, it should be more expensive to fly certain aircraft and it should be impossible to fly certain aircraft at night for example. A total ban would be ideal, of course, but can we afford this and where could this be done? We would like to have these questions answered by the Commission. A European framework is lacking at the moment – and you say yourself that a framework should be in place, but when? When will this happen? We have a communication at the moment and shortly we will have the report by Mrs Lucas on aviation and the environment, but when are we getting legislation, when can we expect a framework which is sufficiently clear for each Member State, so that distortion of competition is ruled out? Would it not be useful, for example, to look at ‘best practices’ at this stage – to use a buzz word – so that we know what certain airports get up to? This would be some achievement. For example, at Schiphol, there is a kind of complaints desk for noise. Other airports do not have this but could possibly do with one. So why not exchange ideas between the different EU airports, where all of us are faced with the same problem? I would ask the Commission to speed up its process and not to wait for the legislative measure alone, but to set up other initiatives in order to bring people closer together.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now the company is trying to worm its way into the Nancy-Metz regional airport, which it has targeted because of its rural location where, due to the lower population density, there might appear to be less public opposition. But this is not the case at all. When it comes to noise pollution from aircraft and public health in general, it makes no difference whether an airport is situated in the town or the country: all citizens have the right to a peaceful night’s sleep. I could also mention the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Roissy, Satolas and Milan who are protesting. Milan has fallen into the clutches of Trans-European Networks which have failed to take into account the detrimental effect of their activities on local inhabitants’ standard of living. </p>
<p class="contents">With air traffic booming and the new economy expanding rapidly, I can foresee a fresh increase in freight in the future. The Union must react and the Commission must propose tangible measures in response to the legitimate concerns of our fellow citizens. The entire transport policy needs to be revised in order to curb, or even reduce, air transport and related noise pollution. No research has been carried out into noise pollution from airports. It is essential to transfer short-haul air freight transport to the railways. And personally, I am in favour of banning night flights in order to respect the local inhabitants’ need for a peaceful night’s sleep, for they already have to put up with excessive noise all day long. These three matters genuinely require urgent consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I imagine that other populations living near any airport in any large city will have the same problem. I know that in the last two months the Government of Madrid has proposed a reduction in night flights, after 11.00 p.m., but I also know that the measures that have been taken have not had any significant effect on the quality of life of the population. Let us hope that it will improve. Hence the opportunity for this debate, which we should thank Mr Lannoye for.</p>
<p class="contents">From the joint motion for a resolution, I would like to highlight some of the proposals – please excuse any repetition – which I believe the European Commission should take note of if it wants to reduce noise pollution: a global and integrated framework for reducing noise pollution which should lead to a framework directive with concrete and binding measures; the uniform application of those measures in all Member States so that there are no distortions; a Community framework for the classification of noise which will allow measures to be taken with the rigorous allocation of slots and a reduction in flights; and progress towards the establishment of a common air space, which is not in conflict with local and regional measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fifth framework programme for research it would be necessary to carry out an investigation into the design of aircraft, with a view to reducing its influence on noise pollution. We should also work towards the reduction and disappearance of night flights and the promotion of the railway.</p>
<p class="contents">In truth, Mr President, if everybody disliked aircraft as much as I do and travelled by rail as much as I do, perhaps we would have fewer problems.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this work should be done in conjunction with the populations and residents’ associations which are already pushing, throughout the whole of Europe, as in Spain, for a reduction in noise pollution, other types of pollution and a reduction in the enormous demand for air traffic. We should also cooperate in the creation of a noise map in local areas which would lead finally to a serious piece of work on the part of the European Community in favour of a reduction in noise pollution which is increasing as a result of demand.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I must say that many of the problems are the result of bad planning or no planning at all. The airports were built haphazardly and no practical assessment of the environmental impact was made as the towns, or certain parts of them, grew up around the airport structures. Regional planning is only a recent introduction, whereas airports have existed for a long time. The first flights to operate from Malpensa, for example, began as early as 1910. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are other structures which are public nuisances – landfill waste sites, for example, which are created from old quarries with no planning – but, in the case of airports, we see the consequences every day, or rather we hear them, for they fill our ears rather than offending our eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, provision of information is poor. For example, many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights. Cargo flights generate neither more nor less noise than passenger flights. The amount of noise depends exclusively on the type of aircraft, not on what is being transported: a cargo Boeing 747 produces much less noise than a passenger Boeing 727. Consequently, a thorough knowledge of the facts is necessary even for debating purposes. </p>
<p class="contents">Then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated. Here, we have an example of the application of the principle of subsidiarity in its entirety, even extending beyond the European Union, for the standards are established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is a supranational body. I welcomed the Commission’s remarks regarding a European legislative framework. For example, as has already been said, we need to establish what is intended by the word “night”. Does night start at 10 p.m. or at midnight? Does it end at 5 a.m. or at 7 a.m.? This is something to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor is the involvement of the local authorities, for every airport is different. The noise impact differs even within the same airport according to the runway used. For example, runway 25 of Fiumicino airport is next to the sea and hardly disturbs anybody at all, whereas if an aircraft were to take off from the right-hand section of runway 16 it would disturb half a million people or so from the Ostia and Fiumicino communities. Local authority involvement is therefore important, although, I must stress, it needs to be within a general European legislative framework. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it would, on the whole, be feasible to eliminate night flights and ban them, although, I must stress, this must be done by taking specific local factors and also the type of aircraft used into consideration. It should not make much difference whether an aircraft has a built-in silencer or whether its silencer is fitted subsequently: the engine noise can be measured and an assessment made of whether the aeroplane is excessively noisy or not, irrespective of the date of manufacture or the type of silencer used. In any case, I would stress that we must not just concentrate on the individual factors in isolation but view the issue as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in principle, a localised problem which should, as such, be solved by the competent authority of the relevant airport. Different airports are already working on this by issuing flight bans to the noisiest aircraft or by banning certain night flights. </p>
<p class="contents">This solution, however, is not sufficient, since aircraft are produced on a global market. Competition hinders such solutions, and creates the side-effect that more noise will be produced at other airports. In short, we are simply shifting the problem. Technically speaking, the problem is not that enormous. By using state-of-the-art technology, it is possible to produce aircraft which generate six times less noise than aircraft thirty years ago. Since the life-span of aircraft is about thirty years, the effect of these technical improvements are not felt for a long while. The question is whether this long wait is desirable. I do not think so. If we actually want to do something about aircraft noise, technical improvements will need to be implemented more quickly. The extra cost involved will obviously be passed on to the user, who will pay more for their airline tickets. The user should be fully aware of the actual costs of flying, including all environmental costs. For the sake of fair competition, this should be done on a global scale. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposal from the resolution, which, among other things, presses for making information on the level of noise pollution around different airports available in a readily understood format, is a step in the right direction. I also back the other proposals to reduce noise pollution. It should be clear that, ideally, the actual environmental costs should be brought into the equation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that this will lead, in our densely populated States, to increasing noise pollution for citizens. I support all those who have stated here that solutions can only be found jointly. I come from the region around the Cologne-Bonn airport, an extremely densely populated region. We have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens. Every major attempt was simply answered by the companies with the announcement that they would switch to another airport. The airports of Liège and Maastricht are within a radius of almost 200 km. The companies are really not bothered about where they start and land their cargo planes, in particular. For this reason, I would like to urgently request that we find joint solutions which achieve both objectives: a competitive airline industry in Europe and adequate noise protection for our citizens in the vicinity of airports.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have surmised, Commissioner, from the Commission’s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met. Firstly, it is obvious from the report that there is still no common method for calculating aircraft noise and, secondly, there is still no common method for monitoring basic data. I therefore come to my request: you have proposed specific measures to the Commission in your report. You have also set deadlines: the year 2001 for expiry of the old specification on noise emissions for old aircraft equipment. You have announced a strategy, which I welcome, for how the burden on particularly busy airports can be eased on the basis of objective data. However, you have not set any deadline for this.</p>
<p class="contents">My request to the Commission is that, together with the regions, you set deadlines, in the interests of both the companies and the citizens affected, which we can all work towards in a team effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This sensitive issue takes us back to a recurring problem faced by all decision makers and politicians, whether they are local, national or, nowadays, European, and that is the problem of how to reconcile economic development with the need to safeguard the health and the standard of living of our fellow citizens. In effect, this embraces the three fields of technological, economic and regulatory considerations. </p>
<p class="contents">Although progress has unquestionably been made on the technological side, further progress is still essential in order to renew fleets of aircraft, particularly freight aircraft. The European Union must continue with its endeavours in the areas of research and technological development, equip itself with the means it needs to produce the standards envisaged, and give financial and technological support to all studies and programmes which make shared information available and which facilitate the modernisation of equipment with a view to limiting environmental disamenities. </p>
<p class="contents">However, at the same time, we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue. Airport complexes are hives of intense economic activity and appeal; our intention to preserve jobs, reasserted in Lisbon, means that we do not have the right to avoid this issue. Any use of existing structures and the establishment of new infrastructures must conform to the legal instruments – the area-specific land use plans and national and regional development rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in terms of regulation, in the absence of standardised European rules, strict harmonisation of air traffic control and restrictions must be achieved in order to prevent dumping within the Union, a phenomenon familiar to us, which is governed by decisions taken simply at local level. We cannot allow this to continue. The citizens are waiting for decisions to be implemented within the relatively near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a researcher who has examined the social effects of industrial labour, especially shift work, for years, I appreciate – and this has also been adequately proven scientifically – the seriousness of sleeping disorders and lack of sleep. Against this background, the entire discussion is relatively serious, bearing in mind Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s comments on “the brink of the night” and the way we are discussing noise pollution, and the lack of harmonisation. In the foreseeable future, we will discuss at great length the more general aspects of aviation and the environment within the committee, including the common noise classification schedules, how to provide economic incentives in connection with noise and how to achieve aircraft noise standards. However, one thing is still lacking from the discussion, namely that we will need the political courage to talk about restrictions, bans if necessary, for night flights during a certain period and reach common agreements on this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem of night flights in a densely populated country such as Belgium is a very topical and extremely sensitive issue, especially since the Belgian Transport Minister issued a ban on night flights in Zaventem which, following a hefty row within the government, was withdrawn soon after. I believe that Mrs Van Brempt has outlined the dilemma very expertly. Tens of thousands of people live and sleep a stone’s throw away from the runway. 15% of the population are suffering as a result of the noise pollution generated by aircraft. Medical reports have shown that people living near airports are having to deal with health problems of an unacceptably serious nature, such as insomnia, high blood pressure, stress and depression. Needless to say, it makes no sense to ban night flights in one Member State alone. Businesses, such as DHL, will then simply move to airports in other Member States. As a result, we are at risk of finding ourselves in a downward spiral, where the citizens’ quality of life is pulled down with it. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx has already pointed out, with good reason, that measures to reduce the effects for those living near airports should not promote distortion of competition. The increase in the number of noisy, obsolete and unlisted Russian aircraft, in particular, is the cause of unacceptable noise pollution, not to mention the risks for the environment and safety which such aircraft pose. In my town, Ostend, where the airport is situated in the centre of town, there have already been over 50 incidents, so far only leading to material damage. I therefore concur with Mrs Oomen, who advocates uniform framework legislation, which will reconcile the economic and employment interests with the care for public health, the environment and safety and which will apply to all airports within Europe. The much publicised and promised common framework for noise classification of aircraft could not be here soon enough, Commissioner, especially given the Russian situation. I also hope that the European Commission will not budge one inch from the position it has adopted with regard to hushkits and will not succumb to American pressure. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask that special attention be paid to the specific problems which smaller, regional airports have to contend with. They are fighting to remain profitable and are even unable to make the necessary investments to reduce noise pollution. This is why I would ask Europe, where possible, to help out in order to guarantee the viability of airports, but especially the quality of life of those living near them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I have taken careful note of all the comments made by the Members and I will pass them on to the Commissioner responsible for transport. Parliament’s message was very clear, as might have been expected, for most of the Members who spoke represent the interests of citizens who live very close to airports. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it was pointed out, and very rightly so, that airports represent major economic factors and that, if we start to impose bans, there is a serious danger that this will have adverse implications for employment. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the question which arises is how to reconcile economics with preserving the standard of living. Clearly, the level of noise pollution from night flights varies from one airport to another, according to the topography of the areas and population density. This is why, for the time being, the Commission is not going to place a blanket ban on these flights. Moreover, very few airports in the Community impose a full curfew: Paris-Orly is the only one to impose a total ban on night flights. Munich and Berlin-Tegel limit night operations to mail freight. A general ban on night flights would therefore seriously disrupt air transport activities. Most large airports place restrictions on the use of the noisiest types of aircraft or employ economic instruments in order to limit their use. </p>
<p class="contents">There are, effectively, a number of alternatives to banning night flights used by various airports, all compatible with Community legislation on market access. A notable example is the use of a noise quota system such as that employed by the London airports, or a ban on using the noisiest runways during the night, which one very well-informed Member referred to. In addition, the use of flight paths which generate less noise pollution, avoiding sensitive districts during take-off and landing, and the application of differentiated airport tax, calculated according to the environmental characteristics of the aircraft, are some of the solutions currently employed. </p>
<p class="contents">The question now arises of how to proceed in the future, and, most importantly, when to act. Pages 34 and 35 of the communication on air transport and the environment contain an action plan setting forth a precise schedule. I will not bore you with the details. You have the documents in your possession. The Commission has absolutely no intention of postponing decisions on this matter indefinitely. It has committed itself to precise deadlines. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the regulatory framework, we aim to present it at the end of this year, or early next year at the very latest. This harmonised framework could include common reference points for measuring the operational noise levels to be limited or prohibited, a provision allowing operators sufficient time to come into line with the new operational restrictions and the establishment of a right for people living near airports to request consultation and negotiations on noise reduction objectives. The economic measures proposed also provide for differentiated treatment of airlines according to the characteristics of their aircraft. In addition, the Commission envisages the development of a code of conduct based on current best practice. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to reply to the question on the drafting of a new noise standard. The ICAO is currently working on drafting a new standard, and this is long overdue, for the present standards date from 1977 – ages ago. Given the long life of an aircraft – thirty years – clearly, the effects of a new standard will only be seen in the long term. This is why we are insisting on the fact that these new standards should be sufficiently ambitious to counteract the environmental effect of the fast-growing air industry. </p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, the Commission considers that rules stipulating the progressive, but rapid withdrawal of the oldest and noisiest aircraft are the best solution, especially for airports whose capacity is restricted by environmental constraints. And the best way to ensure the environmental efficiency of these rules is to act at a worldwide level within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, as the Commission is doing, in tandem with decision making at a purely European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is correct, even though I do not approve of her behaviour politically. But she has now said something which must be objected to in respect of the Rules of Procedure, namely that we will now see from the numbers how the importance of this vote is to be assessed. I do not consider this acceptable. Under our Rules of Procedure a vote is fully valid if it has materialised in a proper fashion, even if those who requested that the quorum be determined were no longer able to do this because there were no longer enough of them. Even then a vote is fully valid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for rules of procedure is that they guarantee democratic principles and obviously if, at some time, someone wishes to highlight a particular political problem, then they are perfectly within their rights to do so. If, however, a right is somehow abused, I am not sure if that abuse has anything to do with democratic ethics. I am speaking on a more general note here. In other words I am not sure if, in the final analysis, it has more to do with being obstructive than with proving that there is indeed a genuine problem. What causes me particular regret is that we all have experience of national parliaments and so on and this sort of abuse rarely takes place.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the problem could be solved very quickly if we could schedule the votes for the end of the session, like all the other days, and ask for everyone to sign the attendance register at the end of the day. It would then become clear if we would be prepared to consider this a proper meeting or not. I therefore recommend that this problem be raised in later proceedings so as solve this Friday problem once and for all.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will not help us any further this morning. All that remains for us to do this morning is to apply the Rules of Procedure in an honest and transparent way and, as such, I am at your service and at the service of the Rules of Procedure. Needless to say, I will refer this morning’s course of events to the President and the Bureau, upon which the competent parliamentary committee will deal with this matter further. This is clear enough, I think. </p>
