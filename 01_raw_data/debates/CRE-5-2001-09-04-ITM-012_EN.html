<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly no easy task to have to draft a report on ones own country because one is all too subjective. However, I shall endeavour to paint as objective a picture as I can. I should start by clarifying that, when Austria negotiated its accession to the European Union, it asked for the content and substance of the Transit Agreement to be taken over in a protocol and hence be made part of its accession and its standing under the Treaty once it acceded to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Transit Agreement is without doubt doubly important because transit traffic in Austria – and this is a unique situation in the whole of the European Union – accounts for a very high proportion of overall traffic – up to 80% on many routes – and, because of Austria's geographical position and the fact that it is a relatively small country, it contributes to a relatively heavy environmental impact, especially in sensitive zones. In addition, it is an area with practically no added value of its own. Obviously, transit traffic cannot be separated from other types of traffic in the long term. That is why the Transit Agreement has an expiry date of 2003, which is fast approaching.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Commission does not like this agreement. I can understand that it might not please everyone because, from a traffic policy point of view, it is far from perfect. The Commission has tried various ways of sinking this agreement. First it opined that the sanction mechanism was too heavy. I admit that the Commission is materially right, I too understand that. That is why I have taken account of Uli Stockmann's suggestion and my point 2 c) states that we in Parliament take the view that a better, sliding scale needs to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the Commission said that the calculation did not work correctly in Austria. I am not in a position to judge, it is a question of establishing the facts. We decided in committee to call on the Commission to ensure that the calculations are correct because I for one do not want to sanction erroneous calculations. But then the Commission decided that the sanction mechanism was all wrong, the calculations were all wrong and, if that does not work, then we are also opposed to the upper ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">But clearly the upper ceiling for transit lorries was part of the agreement from the outset. A provisional finding of the European Court of Justice states that this was a basic element in the transit agreement. Nor is it true, as the Commission maintains, that this is, to a certain extent, a negative incentive to use environmentally-friendly vehicles. Every haulier is better off using environmentally-friendly vehicles because he needs to use fewer ecopoints. That is why, if nothing else, this regulation motivates hauliers to use more favourable, i.e. more environmentally-friendly vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Which is why I completely fail to understand why such a sustained attack is being mounted on an existing agreement which, anyway, is due to expire shortly. Nor do I understand, Commissioner, why it is being mounted at a time when the Commission knows that Austria will have to reckon with a serious increase in transit traffic during the course of forthcoming enlargement. I can gladly let you have a copy of the study by an independent economic institute concluding that, by the year 2015 – and I know that is a long way off – transit traffic will have increased four- to fivefold. What I mean is that, in this situation, knowing that people are very sensitive to traffic issues, to change an existing agreement in this situation in order to create a different situation for perhaps one to one and a half years, is totally incomprehensible to me.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate that this is not, in our view, about passing a new regulation. It is not about introducing additional restrictions. It is simply about leaving an existing agreement in place and let's face it, the principle of trust always applies when agreements are signed. I must repeat, this is predominantly about not adding fuel to the fire at a sensitive time when the question of enlargement is writ large, because we know where that can lead.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally my recommendation is that we accept the report tomorrow as it was adopted in committee – albeit, I admit, by a very narrow majority, if one can talk of majorities at all here. Commissioner, I know you will be unable to agree but I should like to ask one favour of you, nonetheless: if, and this might easily be the case, Parliament decides otherwise and rejects my proposal, could you perhaps think twice about forcing it through? Could you use the precarious, sensitive situation in this country, which is also important for negotiations with candidate countries, as an opportunity for finding a long-term solution, rather than forcing through a short-term solution?</p>

Transit traffic in a sensitive Alpine region is the secondary issue. Primarily, it is about the fact that Austria has a valid agreement with the European Union. The Commission is now trying, in its proposal for a regulation, to cancel this valid agreement unilaterally and expects the European Parliament to validate this illegal move.</p>
<p class="contents">If we vote in favour of this proposal, we shall be helping to break an agreement to the detriment of a Member State of the Union. What this can and will do is to destroy any trust in agreements concluded and hence any trust in the legal security of the European Union. A large majority of people living in the Alpine regions in question came out in favour of accession to the EU in 1994, believing in the sanctity of contracts. If we vote in favour of this unwarranted abolition of the protection clauses, we shall foster reticence towards the Union and force people back on to street blockades.</p>

First, because the objective of the ecopoint system has more or less been achieved. The objective was to reduce overall NOx emissions from heavy goods vehicles in transit through Austria by 60% by the end of 2003. In 2000, we had already achieved a 56% reduction; in other words, we are well on the way to achieving the target set in the agreement by 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission proposal does not touch the ecopoint system per se. The target of a 60% reduction has been retained. The Commission expressly calls for the ecopoint system to continue. Only the so-called 108% rule is to be abolished. This rule runs counter to the very objective of the ecopoint system, i.e. to protect the environment by reducing NOx emissions. It acts as an incentive to buy and use environmentally-friendly lorries. The 108% clause sets an upper ceiling on the number of transit journeys and imposes sanctions where it is exceeded. However, this clause only applies if the lorries have produced 8% fewer emissions a year. That is a contradiction in itself. Which is why the whole thing makes no sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, reducing ecopoints does not reduce transit traffic through the Alps as a whole because it will either be switched to routes through Switzerland or trickily converted to bilateral traffic to and from Austria or traffic using east European lorries which are subject to a different licensing system and do not come under the ecopoint system. On balance, all this means is that there will be no further reductions in NOx emissions in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the sanctions attached to the 108% rule are disproportionately high. For example, exceeding 100,000 journeys in 1999 was punished by cutting 150,000 journeys in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I wish to raise is this: doubts as to whether primary law, in this case an act of accession, can be changed by secondary law, i.e. by a Commission proposal for a regulation, as is the subject of today's debate, are to my mind unwarranted. Protocol no. 9 makes explicit provision for the ecopoint system to be reviewed in 2001. On this basis, the Commission proposal is therefore legal. That is why I am in favour of abolishing the 108% rule and adopting the Commission proposal as it stands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So what we are talking about is an existing, legally valid agreement which expires in 2003. The objective, as has already been mentioned, is to use more environmentally-friendly lorries in transit through the Austrian Alps and to reduce NOx emissions by 60% in comparison with 1992, which has almost been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement also sets an upper ceiling on the number of transit journeys, the so-called 108% clause. Now the Commission wants to abolish the 108% clause by the end of 2003. The rapporteur, Hannes Swoboda, rejects the Commission proposal and I concur with this view, although there is a conflict between Austrian and German interests, for example, here. But our concern here must be to act within the context of a European transport policy and that means having a taxation mechanism for ecologically sensitive regions. In all events, I should like to highlight three problems, as I have done in my proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the number of journeys needs to be calculated correctly. A number of speakers have expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the statistics, because they also include some bilateral journeys. Care must therefore be taken to calculate the number of journeys correctly, so that sanctions are not wrongly applied.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my second point, sanctions. In 1999, as has already been mentioned, the number of transit journeys was exceeded by 100,000, resulting in a cutback of 150,000 journeys by way of "punishment". I think the current sanction mechanism is excessive and wrong because it hits individual road hauliers, even though it means state action. Something needs to be done here.</p>
<p class="contents">And my third and final point. Our ultimate transport policy objective is to have a sustainable transport system which allows sustainable mobility in the long term. However, the Commission has so far omitted to present a conclusive overall concept for the Alps for 2003 onwards and we need one now as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the line my Group has agreed upon and intends to follow tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">This is because the experiment conducted over these years will instead be used from now on to define a coherent strategy for transit journeys across the Alpine region, which will, in future, be based on as broad a shift from road to rail as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The current system has proved essentially effective, since the basic objective has been or is in the process of being achieved, while on the other hand it is proving ineffective, or rather in some cases I would say it acts against the incentive to make vehicles crossing Austria more eco-friendly, as well as being difficult if not unfair to implement, and therefore the clause has indeed proved to be effectively of little use, even though worthwhile in its intention.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that no serious difficulties should arise and that there should be substantial respect for the agreement in that the desired objective has been achieved, and that the clause should not be implemented because it does not help us at the moment. It will instead be used or applied, like others, to harmonise different schemes that we should use to work out a better way to cross the whole Alpine region in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope and we hope that this too will be taken into account in the forthcoming White Paper, both in favouring the choice of those rail links that we have been waiting for for too long, and in identifying tariff measures that will, through better attribution of infrastructure costs, help to encourage more coherent conditions with regard to the Alpine region as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, of course, no coincidence and they have both explained the situation in Austria in detail. However, I do not see this as a purely Austrian problem. This report and tomorrow's vote are about a decision with far-reaching implications. I am not trying – nor do I have any intention of trying – to play the internal market, competition and environmental and transport policy off against each other. I see two points at issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">First, to repeat the concern expressed by my fellow members, we should not emulate President Bush by ending an agreement unilaterally. Secondly, how serious are we about our European environmental and transport policy? How serious are we about implementing it and how efficiently do we want to promote it? So we are not just talking about reducing nitrogen oxide in the Brenner pass. We need a coherent transport concept for the whole of the Alps and we need to internationalise the external costs. Until we apply real costs, roads will be cheaper and neither combined transport nor the railways will be able to compete. The whole of the ecologically sensitive Alpine region needs our support within the terms of the Alpine Convention. Our citizens, and I do not just mean in these sensitive regions, are counting on the European Parliament and the sense of responsibility of all its members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a matter of how the European Union treats its promises to newcomers, the rights of its smaller Member States and interests other than simply those of the economy. For years, Switzerland and Austria have protected their Alpine valleys against noise and air pollution from goods traffic. That kind of protection gains in importance as this environmentally-unfriendly means of transport increases.</p>
<p class="contents">When Austria joined the European Union, a compromise was agreed that enabled this Member State partially to maintain this protection by reducing NOx emissions by 60% between 1992 and 2004. Others also benefit from that measure, since it encourages the restriction of transport or its transfer to rail connections that are better for people and the environment. The underlying principle was not to wait for cleaner technologies, but to empower a government to limit transport by establishing ceilings. Seven years after this compromise, the Commission is trying unilaterally to deprive Austria of that right and at this late stage to give free rein to north-south road traffic, even if the limit of 108% is exceeded. If the European Union behaves in this way with its smaller Member States, that will increasingly provoke antagonism and opposition. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports the rapporteur in his rejection of this attack by the Commission, the large Member States and the big transport conglomerates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time is no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">When Austria joined the European Union, limited access for in-transit transport of goods was agreed until the end of 2003. The Commission wants to revoke one of the components of this agreement. The rapporteur regards the unilateral (partial) termination of protocol No 9 without acceptable alternatives as a breach of agreements entered into.</p>
<p class="contents">The present system in Austria – does not seem to be flawless. The fact that no account is taken of large groups of road users when measuring emissions does not contribute to a clear picture of emissions caused by in-transit traffic. At the same time, Austria has not yet fulfilled its obligation to offer sufficient alternatives to the Alpine route.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Europe cannot do without transport, but neither can it do without a healthy natural environment in which we ultimately all live. Therefore I support initiatives to limit emissions in general and in vulnerable areas of natural beauty, in particular. The rejection of this proposal by the Commission therefore does not stand in isolation, but falls within this framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The question does arise, though, what the future of in-transit traffic through Austria will be after 2003, when the ecopoint system has disappeared. In order to tackle environmental damage to the Alps constructively, a policy for vulnerable areas is essential. For as long as this is lacking, ad hoc measures will appear which are seldom constructive in nature. Hence my question to the Commission if it is going to tackle this topic in the long-awaited White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I do not consider it sensible, while there is no wider policy for vulnerable areas, to take unilateral measures that cannot be expected to promote sustainable mobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, the Transit Agreement was part of a Union promise to Austria. The promise being that the sensitive Alpine region would not be buried under an endless avalanche of transit traffic. Austrians trusted in Europe's word. 66% of Austrians were in favour of accession to the Union. If this Commission proposal is adopted, this promise will be broken. I speak to you as a European; this is the sort of thing which will come back to haunt us if another referendum somewhere in Europe turns out badly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, transit traffic and hence the 108% clause, which it is proposed to abolish, forms part of the Act of Accession to the European Union. In other words, the Transit Agreement is primary law. I ask you in all conscience: what is an agreement worth if the European Parliament can undermine primary law in a vote? This is also a question of principle, not just Austrian, but European principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a question to all of you: what are words on paper worth? To quote the new Article 6 in the Treaty of Amsterday: "Environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Community policies and activities referred to in Article 3", such as the free movement of goods. Tomorrow's vote will be a measure of just how seriously this House takes the objective of this article in the Treaty of Amsterday. Or, ladies and gentlemen, do we just pay lip service here to environmental protection and sustainable development? The contest tomorrow is free movement of goods versus environmental protection – it is a fundamentally European question, which is why I call on you to vote in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This hypothesis, that the Community is breaking Treaty law is simply nonsense. Treaty law makes provision for adjustment and this proposal adjusts just one point of the law. So it is not a question of breaking Treaty law. The non-attached member is moaning that we are not treating the environment properly and is calling for environmental protection. Well my question to my fellow Austrian member is this: when will you stump up the money for the Brenner base tunnel? Then you would be doing something for environmental protection. We are, in fact, taking far too long about implementing the Brenner base tunnel. That is the only real solution to the problem of transit traffic in the Alps. Instead of bandying fine words, Madam, you would do well to push ahead with plans for the base tunnel and stump up the money. That would be your job in a government in which you are represented. We do not need vox pops!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stockmann made a great number of valid points, namely that the main objective, to reduce NOx emissions, has in fact almost been achieved and that the 108% clause is disproportionate and inaccurate. Mr Stockmann, vote with us tomorrow in favour of the Commission proposal and you will achieve exactly what you want to achieve. I can understand that you do not want to stab your Austrian rapporteur in the back, but consider carefully how you intend to vote tomorrow. Vote in favour of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Just two more brief comments. If we maintain this clause, there will be no change in real freight volumes; instead the transit journeys which are no longer possible will be replaced by a journey using one haulier into Austria, transhipment and a journey using another haulier out of Austria. In other words, transit would be split, we would have more exhaust emissions and more costs to consumers. That is not the solution. The solution is to build the Brenner base tunnel so that we can shift freight from the roads to the railways in the long term. That is what we should be fighting for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, we are fully convinced that the set objective of the protocol in question is a good one: the environmental protection of Austria within the Alpine region. The Commission intends to maintain this objective, and we are also convinced, as the proposed regulation to the Commission suggests, that the 108% clause should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall confine myself quickly to two puzzling facts. The first is a matter of logic: the clause operates on the number of transit journeys, regardless of the ecological performance of the vehicle, and therefore more ecologically friendly vehicles mean more ecopoints saved, more journeys accumulated and a greater risk of going over the 108% quota. The result is a paradox: operators are discouraged from choosing less polluting vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">The second puzzle is a practical one: the sampling system is unreliable, the critical threshold would seem to be exceeded by 0.6%, or 10 000 journeys, but according to a Commission study there are 92 000 vehicles that entered Austria and did not leave. We are dealing with a system that has demonstrated that it is absolutely unreliable: the 108% limit has not been proved effective; the penalties are quite excessive, with 150 rights of transit less as a result of exceeding the 108% threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these are the technical and objective reasons why the Italian delegation will vote in favour of the Commission proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as we can tell from the Commissioner's future plans as they stand now, she wants the same thing we all want and need, i.e. specially sensitive transport rules for specially sensitive areas. That was precisely the intention of the original Transit Agreement between the Community as it was then and Austria, standing as it did on the brink of accession in every sense of the word. And the solutions worked out just under ten years ago and the compromises brokered for Alpine transit at the time have, on the whole, worked. The ecopoint system has brought about a net improvement in the environmentally problematic nitrogen oxide situation, despite all its weaknesses, and the quantitative upper ceiling and 108% rule, which is what this is all about, has at least gone some way towards acting as a safety net, as hoped, despite a whole series of problems.</p>
<p class="contents">So why now and why, given the current situation, terminate a fundamental element of the arrangement prematurely for such as short period of time? This is the question people in Austria are asking and they are not getting an answer. Unless the idea is to end transit traffic restrictions, including – more to the point – in sensitive Alpine regions. I think we shall all be doing future European transport policy a disservice if we jeopardise the common, long-term objective or completely lose sight of it for the sake of a few relatively minor inconsistencies and squabbles. That is why I think the position adopted two months ago by an admittedly narrow majority in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is the right one. This committee position could be used as a springboard for renewed efforts to find jointly acceptable solutions, rather than creating huge emotional and political problems for Austria and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Austria versus the rest of the world? That cannot and should not be. We should all being pulling together to find good, forward-looking solutions to European transport problems. That should be our objective and I trust that we shall return a vote tomorrow which guarantees that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an error into which we must not fall, and I must say this with all due respect to the Members from Austria: your representation of the situation is not useful to your fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all concerned with safeguarding and protecting the environment, and the question of the Alpine passes, amongst others, affects not only Austria but also a large part of a sensitive area like the Alpine region on the Italian side. Why do I say this? Because in the Commission’s proposal, which we share and support, we see the same environmental concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that the ecopoints system will not be touched because it has produced results, and this has been confirmed. On the other hand it has been observed – and this cannot be denied – that the ceiling system actually punishes those hauliers that try to adopt ecologically friendly procedures, as has been said, while instead encouraging bad practice, as you well know, and even fraudulent practices: for instance, many lorries go in with a bill of lading, unload in Austria and then leave, and so are not subject to the points clause. All that does no more good to the environment than it does to the transport system.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is also a problem of guaranteeing mobility, there is a problem of guaranteeing competition among haulage companies, but there is most of all an environmental problem. I ask you to take in the aspect of concern for the environment that is expressed in the Commission proposal; I agree with you all that we certainly need to find stable, definitive solutions for the future, which will really protect us from these risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Article 11 of Protocol No 9 discusses NOx pollution.. Nowhere does it mention noise or any other type of pollution. The objective of Article 11 is to limit gas emissions and NOx emissions and nowhere does it mention any other types of pollution that could have been suggested but which, at the time, were not suggested and were not included.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, when Article 11 discusses a revision – and I am here attempting to answer what was said earlier – the Commission is not trying to steamroller nor to exceed the legal obligations that bind us all, but to adhere strictly to the provisions of Article 11 of Protocol No 9 to the Act of Accession, in other words, to undertake a revision, to see precisely how it has developed. And yet people are suggesting that we are proposing equivalent measures in order to reduce NOx emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Please read it. I requested the text in order to read it out to you. Unfortunately I do not have it here with me, but I can quote you part of the text, which states that, pursuant to Article 71, which covers codecision, it authorises the Council and now Parliament – following recent changes to the Treaty codecision applies – to adopt Community measures that – and I quote verbatim – “guarantee equivalent protection of the environment, in particular, a 60% reduction in pollution”.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that we are not trying to steamroller or to exceed the provisions of Protocol No 9 to Austria’s Act of Accession. I fully realise that there may be difficulties and I also know that Austria is suffering as a result of the vehicles transiting through it, as are other countries, which may, incidentally, suffer from other types of problem too. I also understand that regions such as the Alpine regions and other particularly sensitive areas of the European Union can and should be given special protection where transport is concerned, road transport above all. Not the whole of Austria, however, which is what this Protocol refers to. The Alpine regions are a part of Austria, but not only of Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the principle of ecopoints – let me make this quite clear – has been positive and has reduced NOx emissions by more than 50%. We have not reached the ceiling of 60%, but a reduction of over 50% has been achieved. I stated, although I did not give a firm commitment, that I intend to propose, as stated in the White Paper on transport policy – which I hope you will soon be able to read, that for particularly sensitive areas such as the Alps, measures must be taken to limit the potentially harmful effects for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The system of ecopoints itself could be one solution. Perhaps. I am not saying that it is the solution, but it could be one. There must be an ecopoint system – which leads me to the final point – that really works because this, Mr Swoboda, is the problem and this is another point on which I disagree with you.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that with a ceiling of 108%, hauliers still see a benefit, for the moment, in improving the environmental quality of their lorries. You are wrong, Mr Swoboda. It is not in their interest at all, because if their ceiling is 108% why should they make improvements when, with this number of trips they reach a ceiling that they cannot raise by reducing emissions, since they cannot travel more often without penalties being imposed on them?</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the two clauses contradict each other, which is why we are proposing that they be removed. If we want to continue improving emissions, the 108% clause must be withdrawn, because otherwise, some of the better lorries might stop transiting through Austria because they have too many ecopoints and lack transit rights as a result of this 108%. This could lead to the use of lorries that pollute more. This is of no importance: it is no longer in anyone’s interest to improve the quality of their emissions because the ceiling is set at 108%. This is why we are proposing that it be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, starting from the premise that there can always be divergent legal interpretations, as I freely admit, I feel that the provisions of Protocol No 9, Article 11 state that a review should be carried out, that equivalent measures should be proposed and that the objective is NOx emissions. They also state that, if we want to continue improving NOx emissions, our only option is to remove the 108% ceiling because, if we maintain this ceiling, there is no incentive to improve environmental quality with regard to emissions by European hauliers transiting through Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge Parliament to support the Commission proposal and to reject – I am sorry, Mr Swoboda, but for the first time we cannot agree – Mr Swoboda’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
