For the first time since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty and the extension of its competences in this field, the European Union is about to adopt a Europe-wide law on the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our debate tonight, on a symbolic date for victims in the world and especially for victims of terrorism, is proof for even the most sceptical that the European Union is concerned with more than just the single market or budgetary control. Today, the European Union is delivering for its citizens and their rights. The agreement, which will be put to the vote tomorrow, is the result of long and sometimes difficult negotiations with Member States and the Commission. It has always been guided by one main principle: the interest of the victim and the support they need in getting through a process which can be particularly difficult for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has rightly initiated this timely piece of legislation which will now guarantee to all victims of crime across Europe the same basic rights in criminal proceedings irrespective of where the crime took place and of the victim’s residence status. The future directive is also closing identified gaps in protection for victims, particularly those exposed to discrimination and victimisation such as children, victims of gender-based violence or victims of organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has stood firm on strengthening a needs-based approach in order to provide basic and tailored support for all victims, in particular, victims who are most at risk of repeated or further victimisation. A major change in the future is that all victims will now undergo an individual assessment in order to identify potential specific needs, notably based on their personal characteristics and the circumstances of the crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key element of the agreement are procedural rights such as the right to be heard, the right to receive information about their case, including the time and place of the trial and the nature of the charges, the right of appeal and of access to victim support services, which have been significantly improved with the setting of minimum EU standards.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I am obviously pleased to see in this legislation provisions aimed at protecting and supporting victims of gender-based violence and victims of violence in close relationships, an issue which has been neglected or ignored for too long in our national systems. I would like to add that from a more procedural point of view, the cooperation between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights has proven successful and has allowed Parliament to stand firm on its position to address the needs of all victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore conclude by thanking my colleague and co-rapporteur, Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, for her exceptional and fruitful cooperation on this dossier. I would also like to thank all shadow rapporteurs who have been actively and positively contributing to our work over the past months. The agreement reached today would not exist without the courageous initiative launched by the Commission and its active support in reaching compromises during the negotiations. I would also like to thank Commissioner Reding, her staff and acknowledge their excellence.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also recognise the leading role of the Danish Presidency of the EU in making a consensus possible among Member States. It has been very successful and has given a positive outcome. I am hopeful and look forward to your questions and positive support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot forget those who died in London and Madrid, or the many victims of terrorism in Europe, such as those of the ETA terrorist organisation in Spain, my country.</p>
<p class="contents">Society as a whole is the victim in a terrorist attack, but a few citizens pay with their lives to defend our freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, I am dedicating part of my speaking time, including the time I have been allocated at the end of the debate, to observe one minute’s silence for all of these victims.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The House observed a minute’s silence)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Commissioner Reding for the sensitivity she has shown towards victims, also the Council for its flexibility, and Ms Parvanova for her excellent work, as well as the Members of Parliament who have followed this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow will be crucial not only for victims but for all citizens, and believe me when I say that anyone can become a victim, as we can see from this compelling statistic: 75 million people a year are victims of crime in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is time to give the victims the place they deserve, that is, at the centre of our debates in Parliament, because, even though the economic situation is our main concern today, I know that in most European countries, people are extremely worried about the way the justice system functions. This directive, which sends a clear message to victims that their rights will not be ignored and that they will be treated with respect and dignity, will serve to build people’s confidence in justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The response to victims’ call for justice begins in Europe: a transparent and effective framework that restores citizens’ rights and the hope they have lost, in some cases, in their judicial system.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of their nationality or the place where the crime was committed, the victims will have the right to be informed, to understand and be understood, to legal counsel, and to be heard and protected. Victim support services will be able to provide psychological support and defend the victims at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard many victims’ accounts, all of which were very traumatic, but necessary in order to understand the needs of the different types of victims; I would like to add that I dedicate this directive to them, especially to my brother, Alberto, and his wife, who will be looking down on me from heaven.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament today, we are taking an important first step towards helping a father who has lost his son in another country, the victim of an attack, or a girl who has been raped and has no idea where to begin or what to tell the police. They are forced to go through that nightmare, and we are helping all of them here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope this compass guides not only victims when they are crossing the desert of criminal proceedings, but also all those who must support them on their path of pain, such as judges, police officers and legal experts, including in cases involving children, and I also dedicate this directive to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is a very important day for all victims: victims of gender violence, people trafficking, terrorism, organised crime, as well as child victims, victims with disabilities, and all those who have experienced the ordeal of a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we cannot bring back people’s loved ones, nor can we restore their honour, the peace of mind they have lost, or their health, but all of us here today can promise them that we shall continue working towards giving them back their rights, dignity and belief in justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am committing myself and I call on the whole of Parliament to do the same with me tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am moved because we have two wonderful rapporteurs who, in their diversity, managed to bring to this House and to our action the human feelings and the emotions which we need in our European policy making.</p>
<p class="contents">European policy making is not about institutions; it is not about this Parliament; it is not about the Commission; it is not about giving power to Brussels. European policy making is about giving help to people, making them feel that Europe is their place to be, that wherever they go they will feel secure, that somebody cares, and the question of victims which we discussed today is a very good example of this Europe we are building together.</p>
<p class="contents">When I became Commissioner for Justice, I had to look at criminal justice and I discovered that of course, in the different Member States, we have very different systems. They all have grown, some over centuries and some over decades. They are all <span class="italic">sui generis</span> and they all have their values, but they are very different.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the citizens who are travelling from one country to another – whether as tourists or students, or because they want to work in a neighbouring country? They are lost when they find themselves victims in a system they do not know, because it is their home system that they are primarily aware of. That was the first element.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element was when I analysed what is happening in criminal justice, I saw that everything revolves around the criminal, the one who has committed a crime; but in most of our justice systems, the victims of crime receive no attention. That is the person who really counts – or indeed ‘the persons’ if we look at the family of those victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I had a very important experience with a mother, a mother whose son had been severely injured during a holiday trip to a beautiful southern island. This mother’s name is Maggie Hughes, and when she wanted to help her son, she had no possibility of helping him. She went to a foreign country, she did not understand the language, she could not speak to the doctors, she could not speak to the police, she had nobody to help her.</p>
<p class="contents">What did this woman do after this terrible experience? She did not come to me and say: can you not do this or that for my son? She asked me: can you not draw up European legislation so that what I have lived through will never happen to another mother? That was the origin of what we are discussing today. That was the origin of saying: yes, we put people at the centre of our European endeavours; yes, we are making laws which will help our people, our 500 million citizens, so that wherever they go and whatever happens to them, they will feel at home in the place where they have a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, thank you Parliament, thank you Council. Thank you for having made this possible. I think that the message we give today on 11 September, when we think about victims of terrorism, is that we also think about all victims. We think about the woman who has been raped; we think about the child who finds himself without any help; we think about the people who have been burgled; we think about the wife whose husband has been murdered in a neighbouring country; and we say ‘how can we help them so that they get their rights?’</p>
<p class="contents">What we are doing today is not about the direct victims, it is also about the families of those victims who very often feel completely alone and helpless. In future, Europe is going to be there in order to help them. They are going to be part of the judicial system. The police are going to be specially trained to care for victims’ needs. Victims will get information from the point of first contact with the authorities; they will be provided with interpretation and translation to enable their participation in the court action.</p>
<p class="contents">They will get specialist support, targeted for victims of sexual violence, victims of gender-based violence, victims of domestic violence, and children who are always going to be considered vulnerable. Particular attention will be paid to some categories of victims, victims of terrorism, organised crime, human trafficking, gender-based violence, sexual violence, exploitation, hate crime, victims of disabilities. They are all human beings and our responsibility here is to care for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Our victims package of today, our directive, our European law, is going to be the first step to address the rights for victims of crime across the European Union. We are going to tackle as a next step the compensation to victims by the offender. Once an agreement has been found between Parliament and the Council, we will be able to help and assist the Member States in getting those provisions introduced into national law, and we will support practical projects on the ground that are crucial for ensuring that victims can obtain effective rights in practice. We are going to say loud and clear: ‘we Europeans care about people’ – and support to victims is about caring about people.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks to all those people who have managed to help in order to make this legislation become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore very pleased to accept this initiative and I would like to thank both the European Commission and the rapporteurs for their excellent work. The fundamental objective, which is to provide protection to victims of crime throughout the European Union, is indeed a great challenge for our Parliament and for European institutions. This does, of course, tie in with courts and public institutions in Member States also recognising civil protection measures, as this is a process that is based on mutual trust between justice systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs, we have been trying, step by step, to enable and facilitate cross-border civil law cooperation to make this increasingly convenient for individual citizens to access. I am very pleased to see progress in our work. However, I must draw your attention to one particularly important issue: if people are to benefit from something, they have to know about it. For this reason, I am again appealing to the Commissioner and to the European Commission via the Commissioner, as well as to the representatives of Member States, to instigate a well thought through information campaign so that people know which protective measures are available to them and so that they feel safer in the united Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are praiseworthy actions, yet we need to focus more attention on the victims. This is, in fact, what we are doing today, as a result of this law which I happily welcome. Now, we shall no longer distinguish between first or second class victims, determined by country or nationality. From now on, victims will be provided with the same kind of assistance. Everybody stands to gain from this law, because anyone can end up being a victim from one moment to the next. As the Vice-President of the Commission has pointed out, this law represents a significant step in the building of a Europe for the citizens; a Europe which endorses freedom, justice and security; a Europe that offers its citizens top quality rights; a Europe which, above all, does not abandon you at your most vulnerable moment, that is, falling victim to a criminal act. Therefore, I would like to thank Vice-President Reding, as well as the rapporteurs, in particular Teresa Jiménez-Becerril, who I know has this law very much at heart, including on a personal level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We agree with the Commission on the need for a comprehensive legal framework that provides care and protection to victims in the European Union, and therefore covers issues relating to their rights to information, a victim assessment and support services. These are fundamental aspects, and I think they have been properly included in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">As the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to give a special mention to the incorporation in this report of female victims of gender-based violence. For some time now, our group has been pressing the Commission on the need for a European directive to combat gender-based violence against women. We have been given a negative response, and we feel it was important that, at least in this text, a reference should be made to the social scourge of violence towards women.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal remains to be done, of course, but this is a step forward and I believe that, with the good will of everyone, we can say that we are now moving forward in the fight for equality and the struggle against the social scourge of gender-based violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After intense negotiations, which were difficult but exceedingly well organised, they managed to come to an agreement with the EU Council that will allow minimum standards on the protection of victims to be introduced throughout the European Union, marking another stage in the creation of the area of freedom and justice at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current situation, it is rare in the Union to find so many reasons to be satisfied. This evening, we can all welcome the mechanism outlined in this text to protect victims, who form a legal category that, as you said, Commissioner, is often forgotten in our national legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Justice for victims means protecting them, facilitating their access to justice, supporting them and giving them the right to legitimate compensation. It was therefore essential to have this coordinated, integrated approach that benefits victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome three points in particular. The first is the fact that the Council largely agreed to better protection for children. This text pays particular attention to children and their needs, and to their vulnerability as far as protection is concerned. That is covered by this text, and Article 22 in particular, which enshrines in full the principles and standards advocated by the Council of Europe, and the rights specific to children and their protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as you pointed out, Commissioner, we need to train practitioners and all those likely to come into contact with victims, including civil servants, lawyers, and those responsible for victim support: Article 24 emphasises the need for general and specialist training, which is a good concrete, realistic step forward at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is essential to develop the network of host structures to ensure that all victims can find someone nearby who will listen to and support them. This personalised aid is fundamental in the European Union because these victims are often alone and distraught because of these traumatic situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Commissioner, all that remains is to take the necessary measures to inform the public and raise awareness of this new mechanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have had to pay a lot of thought to, and have had to get used to, the idea that our administration of justice is going to change by strengthening the position of victims. But I have got used to this idea and I actually find it appealing. It is crucial for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that, in this new law for victims, we are not going to distinguish between people who have legal status and people who do not. For example, if you are a victim of trafficking and if you find yourself in the European Union without documents, this directive should ensure that you can report to the police and that you will receive guidance in your criminal proceedings. That, as a result of the directive, you can be taken care of, that you have access to an interpreter, that you receive medical care and psychological assistance – we find that crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this will lead – and this enhanced European cooperation in the field of law is also showing us this – to a shortage of legal aid. This really calls for European rules on legal aid, because getting your rights recognised on paper is something different to being proved right in court. Victims will experience that and suspects are already experiencing it. So this directive is insufficient without minimum standards for legal aid in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within days, British police officers were in France working alongside their French counterparts, and French investigators have travelled to the UK to work alongside the British. This is a very good example of a joint investigation and illustrates that EU Member States can cooperate and work together on the most serious of crimes.</p>

Whilst this directive covers a wide spectrum of crime from the most petty to the most serious, I believe that when people find themselves away from their home country and are the victim of a violent and serious crime, they are at their most vulnerable, especially children.</p>
<p class="contents">By asking all European national governments to adhere to a set of standards for all victims, we can ensure that they will receive the proper assistance and support. For the first time in European legislation, there will also be a legal requirement to respond to the particular needs of victims of terrorism, including their immediate family members.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier today, we remembered those who had lost their lives in the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers, and we remember also their family members left behind. Since that attack, Europe, too, has faced the threat of terrorism. When London was attacked in July 2007, 52 innocent people lost their lives and 52 families lost a loved one. The same can be said of our friends in Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am pleased to see the inclusion of a large number of amendments initiated by myself relating to child victims. As a lawyer, I dealt with a number of children who had been the victims of crimes, and I know the sensitivity which is required in order to guarantee their safety and protection. In the UK, we have become very well skilled at dealing with children who are victims or witnesses of crime, and I believe that in this specific area, we really can share best practice with other EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to say a special thank you to Parliament’s rapporteurs, Ms Parvanova and Ms Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, for really working hard and in such a splendid way to make this document mean as much as possible for the victims of crime. You fought for Parliament’s point of view with zeal and enthusiasm. Thank you once again for that.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal itself, I am particularly pleased that it now contains a strong gender perspective. Examples of this include the fact that victims of crime who suffer gender-based violence are highlighted, the need for safe accommodation is established, and the right to legal information is clarified. The directive is therefore a step in the right direction when it comes to combating men’s violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to emphasise the fact that Parliament still believes that the Commission should present a proposal for an EU strategy for preventing violence against women. Only within the framework of such a coherent strategy will it be possible to take measures at EU level, effectively and forcefully, to combat all forms of violence against women in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this debate tonight and believe that the proposals before us represent real progress in how we deal with the victims of crime in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">My constituency of Northern Ireland is today making real progress after having suffered at the hands of criminals who, through their terrorist campaign, have sadly left us with many victims who daily feel the hurt and loss of loved ones or deal with mental or physical anguish as a result of what they were put through. These victims, innocents, suffering loss through no fault or deed of their own, need our support and the support of democratic institutions. I am heartened by what I have heard tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a key point: I would urge the House to always remember to make a clear distinction between the perpetrator of crime and the victim of that crime. There are some in my constituency, perverse as it may seem to the vast majority of us, where the perpetrator can also be the victim. That cannot, and should never, be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to Eurostat data, there are around 30 million crimes, many of which are unfortunately never reported for fear of reprisals. Often, crimes do not just affect the victim, but also have an indirect impact on family members and relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether people are victims of mugging, theft, burglary, murder, sexual violence or even terrorist attacks, they all have the same need, which is to be treated with respect and dignity. Support, guaranteed protection for one’s physical safety, access to justice and payment of damages are all inalienable rights that every judicial system must guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Europe is finally proposing to adopt a directive capable of guaranteeing a shared legal framework for the protection of all victims, helping in solid terms to sweep away all the obstacles that continue to prevent effective cross-border protection. The legislative text aims to strengthen people’s trust in judicial systems, by helping to make it possible to apply an existing protection programme in another Member State. The right would also ultimately apply to the victim’s family members.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, greater attention will be paid to the professional training of all those working in the judicial system, who will have to gain new skills in psychological and social welfare support. Therefore, there should be an end to unpunished crime, victims without justice or support, and criminals walking free rather than going to prison.</p>
<p class="contents">The text we will be voting on tomorrow represents a step towards building a model of justice in which the institutions fight to defend citizens’ rights, and ensure that no criminal can walk free as a result of a breakdown in communication between different judicial systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have one small reservation, however, because we would all have liked to have gone even further by extending the list of vulnerable victims, but the Council did not agree to this, for financial reasons, which is a complicated topic in this time of economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of an individual interview for each victim remains, and this should prevent any risk of discrimination in victims’ access to the different services. This is a major step forward: it will allow us to better define the rights and needs of victims across Europe and to respond in the most appropriate fashion, taking into account the specific needs of each person and, in particular, women who are the victims of violence.</p>

<p class="contents">Gender-based violence, as well as violence in close relationships, is defined for the first time in EU legislation. This is a huge success given that Commissioner Reding’s proposal was – I am sorry to say – gender-blind in the beginning. In fact, the seriousness of gender-based violence was denied as was the request for a separate directive on gender-based violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also managed to highlight and include reference to victims of race and hate crimes or abuse. Another success were the proposals with regard to victims’ access to support and protection without discrimination of any kind, including their residence status, and regardless of the participation of victims in criminal proceedings, which were adopted by the rapporteurs and the Commission and were thus accepted by Council as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that irregular migrants who are victims of crimes will have access to the rights, support and protection afforded by the directive regardless of whether the victim makes a formal complaint of a criminal offence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that it ensures minimum rules for all crime victims who are EU citizens, regardless of their nationality or of the place where the crime took place.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome, for example, the fact that the directive gives both victims and their families the right to all the information on their case and the state of proceedings in their mother tongue, that victims should be provided with support services such as accommodation, medical care, psychological and legal advice, and that this directive is to ensure protection of the privacy of victims, thus attempting to avoid repeat victimisation. This is particularly important for victims with specific needs, and above all children – who must be given special care during proceedings – or victims of sexual or domestic violence. In all cases of this kind, it is highly necessary to limit contact between the victim and the perpetrator.</p>

I was honoured to accompany Maggie Hughes to her office.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner put Ms Hughes at the heart of her speech because it was her campaigning which formed many of the amendments which we put forward to this directive. Those amendments really informed what constructed a victim’s agenda to this report and it answered the question: how does the EU help me and my family in times of dire need, where existing cooperation between Member States has demonstrably been inadequate?</p>
<p class="contents">What Maggie Hughes asked for was access to information, translation, interpretation, legal advice, reimbursement of expenses and compensation for victims of cross-border cases – the practical things that make the European Union mean something to people in times of need. I think she will listen to this debate, Commissioner, and think that the European Parliament has done its job and I thank Members in this House for doing their job very well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The compromise reached between the institutions paves the way for real progress on uniting the European continent to help particularly vulnerable people who are the victims of crime. This directive will reinforce a series of measures implemented at European level to promote the free movement and the defence of victims of crime, such as the European protection order.</p>
<p class="contents">We can welcome the result of this trialogue, for example, the definition of gender-based violence, even though it only appears in the recitals rather than the articles. We must also welcome the fact that all victims have been included, regardless of their status, particularly their residence status. From now on, the most vulnerable people will have the right, in European territory, to protection and consideration of their needs. The text recognises the impact of crime, not only on the victim, but also on close family members, including children.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these advances, I would like to underline the need to consider violence against women as a social phenomenon as such and, like a number of my colleagues, I call on the Commission to prepare a specific directive on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the cross-border dimension of crime, it is important that the directive introduces the same rules for all victims, regardless of their status, such as the right to translation and interpretation, and that it secures access to legal aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the other beneficial aspects, I would include the greater protection in particular for at-risk groups of victims, such as children and women, and also the fact that the media will be forbidden from contributing to the further victimisation of victims by revealing their identity. I appreciate the fact that states will have to commit to providing training for judges and prosecutors, and also to financing information campaigns and submitting statistical information for evaluating the success of the directive in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not the only one who, over and above the framework of the minimum levels of this directive, also expects states to provide victims with additional help, making things easier for them in a difficult situation, and to help them avoid or minimise post-traumatic complications by providing further services, such as payment-free psychological assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also shows, however, that Europeans respect human dignity, ladies and gentlemen, and that they do so under all circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The best protection is to ensure that crime does not exist. However, given that prevention is often difficult, very difficult or almost impossible, it is our obligation to provide victims with the means to overcome their tragedies. For that, I pay tribute to the rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Emotional and psychological support is therefore important, even if the victim has not reported the crime, precisely to make it possible for them to do so. It is also important for the directive to highlight the fact that Member States should guarantee compensation for victims. In the case of gender-based violence, this reference to compensation is crucial as a deterrent and restorative measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this directive will not be worth the paper it is written on, Commissioner Reding, if the Commission does not consider supporting Member States in the EU programmes that have funded this preferential line of action. As part of the multiannual financial framework for 2013-2020, programmes in the area of justice have been restructured, supposedly with the aim of rationalising and simplifying them, but the general section on rights and citizenship is very broad and makes no mention of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, Recital 25 talks about encouraging non-governmental organisations to make a commitment to defending victims, and Article 7 mentions specialist services. We have to make these measures available in Europe and make reference to victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, I call on you to make a commitment to maintaining the Daphne Programme, in order to allay the concerns of those who have worked to lessen the scale of this issue, and so that we can really help this directive enter into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why we need to move on to what comes next. While we congratulate ourselves and recognise the progress that has been made and celebrate the fact that we have got this far, the 2001 package promised much but raised – and dashed – the hopes of those of us who wanted to see a more coherent system. It is crucial that we learn the lessons of that to make sure that they are not repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to report that the Scottish Government is a very willing partner in this process. The Scottish Government this week launched a Victims and Witness Bill to the Scottish Parliament which will exceed the terms of this directive by a significant margin. We are keen on this legislation. We will work with you.</p>
<p class="contents">Scots law already is very distinctive within our European tradition. But what about the other Member States? We have a three-year limit for transposition. Will the Commissioner tonight undertake to open immediate infraction proceedings if a Member State drags its feet, for whatever reason? We need a civil body on the side of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish with one sentence: we need to see a proper budget for it. Commissioner, we will work with you on this dossier going forward to deliver for our citizens. Passing laws is easy; enforcing them is what will change their lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Praise for this substantial work goes to Commissioner Reding, Ms Parvanova and, in particular, Ms Jiménez-Becerril for her dedication. They deserve this praise especially for managing to make it one of the strengths of the report that it pays special attention to child victims and to the particular situation of victims in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that through the adoption of the Budapest Road map with a view to ensuring the protection of victims, the Hungarian Presidency also played a significant part in this. This directive will only be successful if it is transposed as soon as possible at Member State level, if sufficient financial funds can be allocated to its implementation, if appropriate experts are available, and if we can finally develop an approach that is sympathetic to the situation of victims. This directive can help bolster citizens’ faith in national justice and its European enforcement.</p>

Therefore, this new directive completes a process of justice and law that will strengthen the value of citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same is true in the protection and guaranteeing of the rights of victims of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts of the European Commission to establish minimum standards for the rights of crime victims are therefore justified. In addition to recognising the rights of victims to information, interpreting and translation, and to have access to legal protection and victim support services, I think it is very important to assert the right of victims to avoid contact with the perpetrator.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the recognition of those rights in the legal acts of the EU does not, in itself, automatically change the status of victims in everyday life. All bodies working in law enforcement, police officers, prosecutors and the judicial authorities will have to adopt working methods according to these principles. It is therefore very important to be aware that our work will not end with the adoption of this act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not know whether you realise, honourable Members present here tonight, that you are witnessing history, because tonight we have broken down a wall: the wall of indifference to the people who need us, as politicians, the most. I am not about to make a tear-jerking speech but what I will say is that in years to come, this day will be etched in our minds as the starting point of a new policy of the European Union, a policy focused on citizens, focused on human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to thank the two rapporteurs, who have done a wonderful job and who have worked hard for the future of European citizens in their area of justice. Congratulations! A heartfelt thank you to you. </p>
<p class="contents">This directive is about minimum rights for victims, so Member States can, of course, go a step further if they wish. But those Member States who have no such provisions must guarantee the human beings of Europe – and by human beings of Europe I mean not only the citizens of Europe, but also all people, regardless of their residence status, who happen to be in Europe – a minimum basis to address the very specific needs they have as victims.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to ensure that all Member States implement these provisions. As I said in my introduction, the Commission, with its experts, will help Member States to do this. Once they have been implemented, the Commission, as always, will be responsible, as guardian of the Treaty, for the proper enforcement of the directive in real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">That also means that we need to provide training for the police and justice practitioners, as well as awareness raising, to ensure that victims know their rights. We will also require the help of the victims’ organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Such initiatives are today financed from different programmes, including the Daphne Programme. In future, they will be financed under the justice and citizens’ rights programmes. I thank the European Parliament today for all the efforts it will make to help ensure that the Council does not reduce financing in these domains.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that this is a first step, but it is a very important step because we have broken through this wall of indifference. We have opened the way so that the next steps can be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very proud to have had the opportunity to be a rapporteur on behalf of the Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) Committee. I would like to thank the Presidency for the trust it placed in the FEMM Committee in our joint work on Rule 51 with the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) Committee. We have proven that we can significantly contribute to improving the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you will have a major role in the next three years in monitoring and reporting on, and transposition and implementation of, this directive. This will continue for the five years following implementation, since an assessment report has to be drawn up and any loopholes need to be identified with a view to improving this legislation. I am absolutely sure that all the organisations that we work with will be watching us very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is a day to be proud, and tomorrow will probably be even better after the vote. The next years will be crucial; we have to prove that this legislation can work. You have a crucial role, and we trust you that you will be able to deliver on this trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to single out for special praise the contribution of our colleagues, Ms Griesbeck and Mr Kirkhope, on the children’s package. They made a significant contribution to strengthening protection of the rights of child victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chair of the FEMM Committee and all the FEMM Committee shadow rapporteurs also made a significant contribution towards the gender package. Mr Gustafsson and all the shadows from FEMM Committee, your staff members, Commissioner, and, especially, the European Women’s Lobby, all helped prepare a very good package on gender issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank all the ‘invisible’ people. These are our staff members, the secretariat of the FEMM and LIBE Committees, the policy advisers, our assistants and all the professionals from the Presidency and the Commission.

I also find it particularly important that the draft legislation urges support to the vulnerable groups of society that are especially threatened by crime. The poor, members of minorities and the homeless are frequent targets of violence. Crimes against women and children and incidents of domestic violence are also commonplace; contrary to some opinions, these are not caused by low birth rates but by the spreading of aggression. Many do not file police reports out of ignorance or fear. It is essential for the victims to know their rights. We need information and awareness-raising campaigns, for which Community funds are available. Several Member States are using EU support to implement programmes that provide legal information and even aid to the victims of crime. These should be continued and, wherever possible, expanded. It is important for law enforcement and justice staff to be aware of the tasks and responsibilities associated with the protection of victims. The directive to be adopted calls attention to this need. The draft legislation lays down the minimum requirements for the protection of victims; I hope that in practice, some Member States will afford the victims of crime broader rights and protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This framework must follow a victim-centred approach – meaning that all categories of potential victims must be identified, targeted and protected, with special attention to children and other groups at risk – and must also cover related policies of social affairs and social inclusion, as well as effective methods for the social rehabilitation of victims, including measures related to social security systems and the labour market. Specific measures are necessary in order to prevent extortion and retaliation under the full assurance of anonymity, paying special attention to the situation of victims with specific needs. Awareness-raising campaigns must be organised involving civil and non-governmental organisations, women’s organisations and the media, and it is also necessary to conduct detailed researches on the latest criminal trends, with special focus on the involvement of at-risk groups, analysing all the factors that lead to the victimisation of such groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It provides minimum protection for all victims of crime. The new act is significant, not just for EU citizens who are travelling, but also for those who are very vulnerable, for whom the law offers special protection. The act stresses the importance of protecting privacy in the case of children and, for example, the media will be prohibited from using images of victims. On the other hand, women who have suffered violence will be protected through a restriction on contact between the victim and the perpetrator. I am very pleased that concrete measures are being introduced in the European Union to safeguard fundamental rights. The European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights that entered into force two years or so ago safeguards the rights of citizens to the extent that EU law is applied, but it has not yet succeeded in safeguarding fundamental rights externally. The Equal Treatment Directive prohibiting all kinds of discrimination, which is in preparation, would provide good resources for that, but some Member States are opposed to its entry into force on account of the costs that might be incurred. The adoption of this directive would be an important next step towards an EU where everyone’s fundamental civic rights are protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no less important that they should be able to count on redress, justice and protection against the crimes being repeated, irrespective of the Member State where the crime took place, and whether or not the victim of the crime is a citizen of that country. All of this has been guaranteed in the directive on which the European Parliament will be voting tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive contains some clauses that are worthy of particular note: the introduction of a unified definition of ‘victim’, under which the status of victim is accorded not only to the people directly affected, but also to close family members; a definition of victims of ‘gender-based violence’ and ‘violence in close relationship’; the introduction of the solutions that are necessary to ensure effective coordination between authorities that provide support to victims through the creation of both formal and informal structures enabling the staff of courts, prosecution services and non-governmental organisations to work in a regulated manner and to ensure that victims have access to psychological counselling, legal assistance and translation and interpreting services free of charge. There is no doubt that this is a very important step towards harmonising law on a European level and it is, above all, an expression of real concern for citizens throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objectives of the directive are to strengthen the rights of victims in the EU and for the mutual recognition of protection measures in court proceedings. All victims of crime, irrespective of their legal status, should be accorded the widest protection throughout the whole of the European Union. For this reason, we should establish minimum protection standards in the whole of the EU that grant rights to all victims of crime irrespective of their nationality or the location of the crime. The person affected by the crime (understood here as the victim of the crime) should be guaranteed the right to information, translation and interpreting services, legal assistance and victim support services, as well as the right to be heard. The clause in the directive that provides protection to victims who do not wish to have contact with perpetrators deserves support. Victims and, this is also important, their family members, particularly children, should be offered support, including psychological counselling, free of charge from the time that they are affected by the crime.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required in order to introduce these changes is a consolidated definition of ‘victim’ that is the same in all the legal systems in EU Member States, and this should recognise that a ‘victim’ is not just the person directly affected by the perpetrator but also their family members. The European Union should introduce a transparent justice system that includes these suggestions as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
