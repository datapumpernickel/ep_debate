<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jarzembowski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the stones that have been flung at this Parliament this afternoon, let us, dispassionately and calmly, debate an issue that we have had to deal with for months, indeed years – the issue of the European regulation of sea ports. The Council at last handed down its common position on 5 November, so that we are now through to the second round.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing that I believe should be apparent even to those who were throwing stones this afternoon, and that is that seaports need to be regulated in the same way across the EU, as seaports, being nodes of intermodal transport, have a central part to play in European transport policy as a whole. There is a need for improvement in Europe's ports, and that needs to be accomplished, on the one hand, by clear rules on competition among ports and within each port, and, secondly, by means of transparent market access for harbour services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has stated its position, and now, on the basis of the first position, we again have to give our opinion. There are four things I want to say about the 34 amendments that the committee has submitted. First, the committee takes the view that we need unambiguous provisions to establish fair conditions for competition between ports. Even though the Council and the Commission have made statements in the Council Minutes to the effect that they too can see the need for fair framework conditions for competition, such declarations of intent are not satisfactory, as, even if the Commission were to extend the transparency directive to ports, it would not achieve what we want, which is, firstly, that enterprises operating out of ports and the harbour companies should actually themselves provide the Member States and the Commission with details of the financial links that exist between them and the state, the region, and the cities; secondly, that the Commission should act on this information; thirdly, that it should then actually prohibit measures that distort competition; and finally, that it should put before us a transparency report that would enable us to see where we need to do more work.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the regulation on state aid that the Commission submitted at the last minute is not adequate, either.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be legal certainty for the ports and for the port companies. We have to know which financial arrangements regarding port infrastructure do not constitute subsidies and do not require modification, and which actually are subsidies and need to be approved. It follows that we need clear and binding guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are agreed – in the committee at any rate – that pilot services are to be taken out of the scope of the directive. The Council's approach is to keep pilot services within the directive's scope, but then to state that all are free to do as they please. In contrast to that, we favour clear and open regulations. We want pilot services in the Member States to be regulated in the public interest and in accordance with the safety requirements in force in that Member State, whether these pilot services be private or provided by the state. That is something that the Member States should regulate for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The demonstration, and a number of strikes in European ports, were about self-handling, and this is where I am, quite seriously, astonished. After all, we all spent last week in discussions with trade unionists. It was Parliament that, at first reading stage, restricted self-handling to a port's own staff and equipment. The committee's report introduces a further restriction – to a ship's own crew. The unions are striking, and I have no idea why. If they are generally opposed to European regulation of ports, then let them say so. They have not said that up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the view that there is fierce competition among ports, and that there must be openness and a fair balance between the interests of the shipping companies and the port companies. An individual port belongs neither to the people who work in it nor to some state-operated harbour monopoly, nor indeed to the shipping companies. A balance must be found between fair competition and entrepreneurial freedom, and so I can only say that our proposal on self-handling is the right one. Nor can I understand why some are now saying that we have to make all port services subject to a conditional agreement. The Commission has stated that the Member States can require that they be submitted for approval. At first reading stage, Parliament took exactly the same view, as did the Council in its Common Position.</p>
<p class="contents">There is absolutely no reason – and, Madam President, I do not consider it permissible – to vote, tomorrow, on amendments imposing, in Article 6 (1), mandatory approval on all Member States at once. The Belgians can do things the way they want to, but it makes no sense to impose a course of action on the Finns, and so, tomorrow, we should have no misunderstandings in this House, and there should be no reference to election campaigns, wherever they are being fought. We of course want the compensatory payments to be arranged on a mandatory basis, with unambiguous criteria, and so we have no great problems in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, Madam Vice-President, that we two have an excellent relationship, but on this point we are, unfortunately, at odds with each other, and I would again ask you to give the question further consideration. What this Parliament demands is a regulation that holds in a balance the interests of the shipping companies, of the port entrepreneurs, and of the workers both on the ships and on land. The proposal we are putting forward is an excellent one, one that all these parties should consider very carefully, and, in the conciliation procedure, they should also support the provisions on transparency. We both – as, I hope, does the Council – want seaports to be efficient and to perform well, and to be places where workers and entrepreneurs can coexist amicably. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, firstly, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament for the work it has done to date with regard to this extremely important directive and I would like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, for the work he has done in relation to this issue, which is extremely important in terms of providing the European Union with a competitive transport system.</p>
<p class="contents">We often complain that Europe could use sea transport as an alternative to road transport and land transport in general. However, we are now sometimes being faced with a situation in which those same people who say that we must promote maritime transport create more difficulties when it comes to creating a sea transport system which is more competitive and more suited to the new circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly need to improve the efficiency of port services, and that is what this initiative intends to do. We need to improve the efficiency of these services, put an end to situations of monopoly, which sometimes mean that the same services cost three or four times more in one European Union port than in another, indicating that something is not working, and – I insist – we must guarantee, by excluding or imposing restrictions and guarantees, so that marine safety aspects are maintained at the highest possible levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission believe that the Council’s Common Position to a large extent takes account of the amendments approved by this Parliament at first reading which represent a balanced solution for achieving these objectives and I believe it would be a real mistake not to maintain this balance and to change the broad balance established within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, I will explain to you the Commission’s position on the proposed amendments. Some of them clearly improve the Council’s Common Position and the Commission therefore accepts them in their entirety, in principle or in part. In other words, the Commission is once again making an effort to ensure that the codecision system works as well as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this field, I would firstly like to refer to the amendments which highlight the provisions of the Commission’s directive on transparency with regard to the ports to which the directive we are dealing with apply. This achieves the objective we have all shared from the outset and in this regard I regret the fact that the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, believes that what is proposed here is insufficient. In any event, I will refer later, in particular, to some of the amendments which deal with these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we can accept Amendment No 11 – which relates to a lesser frequency for the review of the list of ports of a high seasonal character – and Amendments Nos 5 and 27 – which provide examples of expensive moveable assets which could be considered equivalent to immovable assets when considering repayments or residual costs. Furthermore, we can support all those amendments which, without going into detail, we believe make appropriate contributions to the common position or those which provide additional clarification, in one way or another, of the final text.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to congratulate both Mr Jarzembowski and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism in general for the work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain amendments, however, appear to attempt to slow down, and even to paralyse, the efforts made to promote this stimulation of European ports, aimed at improving, as I said earlier, the potential of long-distance maritime transport, aiding our exports to other parts of the world, but also short-distance maritime transport, providing an alternative to land transport. We therefore clearly cannot support Amendments Nos 36 and 66 which call for the Council’s Common Position to be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to make a few brief comments on other issues which Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the question of competition between ports. I know this is an issue of great concern to the rapporteur and other Members and furthermore I believe that progress must be made on it. That is why I intend to accept those amendments which propose the inclusion of ports in the Commission’s Directive on transparency. The Commission understands the current concern here. In fact, our recent document on this issue demonstrates our will to resolve the problem while respecting, however, the provisions of the Treaty, Mr Jarzembowski. That is to say, State subsidies have a framework, which is the one we have proposed, but they cannot just simply be regulated, since the Treaty itself lays down the regulatory framework. We must clarify this in order, as I said, to prevent legal doubts or uncertainties. And therefore, Mr Jarzembowski, I must say that Amendment No 15 goes further than such provisions and we cannot accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, prepared to try to seek, together with this Parliament, an approach which is acceptable to everybody. In this regard, Amendment No 10, duly modified, with certain important alterations in accordance with the solution we may find, could help us to find that compromise formula. I would ask you that we may work as hard as possible to find it as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 16, I must remind you that the Commission, within the context of the so-called ‘range of port measures’, has already carried out a study such as the one requested and unfortunately there was little cooperation on the part of the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: Mr Jarzembowski has talked about the practice of self-handling. This practice should be allowed in all modern ports where possible, with regard to both operations on board and those on land. The Common Position reflects this desire to send a message of progress and looking forward rather than rigidity. A message of progress but with every guarantee. In this regard, it is made clear that this type of action must comply with the social, environmental and safety standards required in each port and that this demand is essential in order to be able to carry out this self-handling.</p>
<p class="contents">Those amendments which seriously restrict this approach – since, in various ways, they hinder self-handling operations – restricting them exclusively to seafaring people, cannot be accepted. Amongst other things – we are talking about ships from third countries and from European Union countries – because these crews are not subject to the same requirements as the professionals who work in our ports and what we are proposing in the Council’s Common Position is that, in order to carry out these actions, they must be carried out within the framework of social and safety standards in accordance with the rules of each port. Because the additional limitation relating to ships flying the Union flag will bring the Union into confrontation with its partners in the world and that must also be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – briefly – we have always believed that pilotage is a commercial service. Therefore, access to such a service should be regulated by the Treaty and by this directive. For this reason, we support the consensus reached on the common position that authorisations should be conditional upon compliance with certain particularly strict criteria with regard to public service and maritime safety obligations – and again we return to the reality of each port. But this approach can be adapted by means of specific solutions for each port, which allow self-handling, within the field of pilotage, in the form of exemption certificates, under certain conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow’s vote will have great repercussions on the legislative process. The Commission has always shown itself prepared to seek constructive solutions with the European Parliament. I would like to remind you once again that our general objective is to guarantee that the port services industry, which is expanding greatly, is ready to confront the challenges facing us. Furthermore, the future European transport system will only succeed with efficient and forward-looking ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like once again to ask you to support this Commission proposal and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, and the whole team which has worked on this text, and all the Members of Parliament for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said which, I realise that as soon as I sit down, a number of my honourable friends will no doubt stand up to oppose liberalisation or at least make comments intended to severely restrict the liberalisation of port services. What I have to say to all these honourable Members, whose opinion I do of course respect, is that I fail to understand how we can be in favour of liberalising the railways, in favour of liberalising air transport, in favour of liberalising telecommunications, and against liberalising port services. We cannot have one sauce for the goose and one for the gander. I, for one, find it incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to say to everyone – and to the port workers protesting today – that, in my personal opinion, they stand to benefit from the liberalisation of port services in the medium to long term, because it will create new jobs. We have nothing against these people. On the contrary, we recognise that their work helps foster economic growth; but they should not hamper further liberalisation and, by extension, further growth in the European economy. The European Parliament, at least the majority in committee, has so far stood by a number of firm principles, one of these firm principles being our espousal of the liberalisation of services, not as an end in itself, but as a means to economic growth. And because we stand by this principle, Commissioner, we adopted an amendment, which the rapporteur referred to and which is designed to prevent discriminatory treatment by port authorities, so that the ports of the European Union can compete with each other. In doing so, we did of course listen very carefully to what the industry and interested parties had to say. That is why we stand by our position on pilotage, where idiosyncrasies, different approaches and safety factors have to be taken into account. It is why we take a different view from the Council, a more amicable view if you like, of workers’ demands and the question of self-handlers. Our focus is on proper staff training, which is why I think that port workers’ current demands on the question of self-handling are somewhat exaggerated. This being our position, and in the light of the position taken by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism when it voted for the report, I think this is the right approach if we and the Council are to push through legislation which is acceptable to all sides as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We passed them with a great deal of unanimity, and I think we will get an absolute majority of 314 votes on the decisive points when we vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussing the part package today and voting on it tomorrow, we know that many European port cities – and I emphasise cities – have seen their workers, out of fear for their jobs, out of fear of social dumping, taking to the streets and demonstrating, and I say, for myself and on behalf of my group, that we sympathise with port workers as they draw attention to their concerns and needs. They have every right to do so, but not, as I see it, to throw stones and get into scuffles with the police. I take the demonstrations in the port cities to be in support of the work we are doing, as the Common Position does indeed include a number of odious points that we cannot accept; it is those things in the Common Position that we want to change today and tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The most odious point is the formulation on self-handling, which is also to include what is done on land. Let me say quite clearly that this is, in our view, unacceptable. We take the view that self-handling can mean only those things that can be done by a ship and its company on their own. Anything more than that is not on, as is clear from the term ‘self-handling’ itself; anything else would be handling by others.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, for the benefit of the Commission and the Council, that we Social Democrats do not believe this definition of self-handling to be capable of being negotiated in a conciliation procedure. There is no moving beyond that, either here or in the conciliation procedure. I want to point out that the directive contains an array of provisions that touch – to the workers' benefit – on social protection, social security matters, and their qualifications for the jobs they do. I think the committee has done very good work on these things, and the Social Democrats have tabled amendments to make overall improvements. You can vote in favour of all these amendments tomorrow, and then everything will be that little bit better for the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the issue of pilot services, an area in which the Commission was very keen – and the Council rather less keen – to see competition introduced. We believe this to be wrong. As carriers, ships are subject to so many constraints, and face so much competition, that safety often gets left behind. As we have seen from what happened to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, pilots have to answer for the safety of ships. They therefore have nothing to do with this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In general – as Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned – we have now devoted a great deal of attention to competition in ports. My main problem continues to be with competition between one port and another, and that is where the Commission has not done enough. We hope the Commission will now present us with something good in this area, so that we can really get to grips with the problem of inter-port competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, access to port services must be as open as possible, and a port must be able to operate as well as possible. This directive is one contribution, but we also need guidelines for government aid and a directive on transparent financial relationships between the port sector and the government. We are also rightly making rules that create a framework for the free circulation of services and we are rightly including specific aspects of ports. The trade unions are also right to point out to us the risks of ports of convenience, ports where all the social rules go overboard, just as there are flags of convenience, cheap flags, for ships.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must impose requirements – social requirements too – on anyone wanting to offer services in a port. That is also why we propose introducing compulsory licensing for the provision of services in ports. That will enable aspects such as safety and the environment to be taken into account, as well as social rules and employment. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident, an accident that once more focused our attention on the training and quality of ships’ crews, which we are also talking about here, had fortunately not yet happened at the time of the first reading. Since then we have also had a proposal from the International Maritime Organisation about safety on ships and in ports – in fact you are currently working on legislation on that. We must therefore know who is working in our ports and under what conditions. With a good licensing policy the competent authorities should be able to ensure that a port is not a place where you take risks with safety or with the environment, that a port is certainly not a place where you allow social dumping, but that a port is in fact a vital link in an efficient and sustainable European transport policy. That is something we urgently need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone has commented on it. The Council subsequently made its position known. We are faced with a liberal directive which, as usual, seeks solely to reduce costs, to the detriment of all other factors. Even though the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, has met with a large number of people and has included a number of proposed improvements, the situation, the fundamental problem remains. There has been no genuine consultation with unions or others involved, despite the fact that these people are familiar with the safety and environmental requirements and have invaluable know-how. Furthermore, the fact that we are continuing to legislate against those employed in this sector was demonstrated this afternoon through the formidable dock workers’ demonstration. In this respect, I support the protest made by Mr Wurtz, the chairman of my group, to the effect that the attitude of the police towards the demonstrators was unacceptable. As he said, their protest is legitimate. Considering that their trade and their jobs are being destroyed, we cannot expect them to come to the European institutions bearing flowers.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, no prior assessment has been made of the effects of this liberalisation, especially as regards important issues such as employment, safety and the environment. According to my fellow Member, Mr Hatzidakis, liberalisation is not an aim in itself, but a means of economic development. Well, I am waiting for an evaluation! I want to know the impact of this on other sectors. We have been waiting for a while now. Regardless of the amendments incorporated, the text remains liberal. Whether we like it or not, self-handling at ports will be tantamount to permitting social dumping, despite the various safeguard clauses included. These refer to safety, to the qualifications required of staff and even to the nature of the seagoing personnel. This directive makes it possible to employ workers from outside the port to do the work of the qualified workers currently employed. The concept of self-handling will result in insecurity, worse working and employment conditions and worse environmental safety standards. This is a particularly retrograde step in light of the current practices of commercial fleets, which have shown that the consequences may be very serious for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Employees like dock workers fulfil a very important economic role in difficult conditions while maintaining safety standards. Services such as pilotage and mooring services are not covered by this directive, even though they are universally recognised as being services of general interest. I think all these sectors should be considered as partners in the pursuit of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, following the damage caused by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, I met with professionals from the maritime sector in France to discuss safety issues. They all insisted that maritime safety begins at ports. I therefore feel that the measures taken here after the sinking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the decision taken today to impose self-handling are totally contradictory. These, then, are the reasons why my group will continue to advocate rejection of the common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both cases the position of workers may be affected. I would therefore like to say to the Commissioner that from my point of view I am in favour of more maritime transport, to replace other forms of transport, for example, but I am not in favour of affecting social rights. I would therefore like to express my concern about what is going on here, not only as shadow rapporteur for this subject in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, but also as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">When we see what the employers’ associations – and others, incidentally – are currently putting forward, which is something I would also like to find out more about from the Commissioner, namely that there is a conflict between ILO – the international labour organisation – conventions 137, which concerns port activities, and 152, which concerns the working conditions for such port activities – and the EU directive in its present form, then I wonder whether we have not jumped the gun. There seems to be a major problem, and I would like to know if there really is, as we have not yet come to the end of the road. After the vote tomorrow we will go to arbitration, then we will have another vote and then the European Court awaits, I can assure you of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, one of the reasons why the people who are protesting at the moment are angry is the fact that a number of amendments we are trying to introduce, relating amongst other things to authorisation, licences and Article 13 on self-handling, have been declared inadmissible.</p>
<p class="contents">Things are changing in the world, people are coming up with new arguments, and I hope that the President will also allow us to do something about this tomorrow. For the rest, I agree with Mr Jarzembowski and others that this port directive on competition in ports is completely inadmissible if we do not have a simultaneous arrangement, a regulation, about competition between ports. We are still waiting for this. Please can we link these two matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the list covering the funding and the system of tariffs for ports, clear rules on state aid to ports and, finally, the adoption of measures guaranteeing access to the port services market through legislative instruments established at the Commission’s initiative and within its powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, however, decided, contrary to what was requested of it, to propose a directive on port services and to omit what Parliament had charged it to provide, which were clear rules on state aid. This is perhaps one of the reasons why the directive, despite the changes it has already undergone, has been contested so intensely at various levels, including here in Parliament, where a considerable number of amendments have been tabled at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the directive has not produced any measures that will benefit the operability and effectiveness of national ports where Portugal is concerned, and instead generates unnecessary bureaucracy and constitutes a potentially destabilising threat to the social harmony that has marked relations between the social partners in all Portuguese ports.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget the fact that, especially in Portugal, some companies have recently taken on obligations arising from legislative requirements, such as having to absorb all workers employed in any capacity in ports and whose interests must now be safeguarded. We cannot, therefore, accept the fact that this directive will allow any port user, who may or may not be accredited, to engage in cargo-handling activity, in contravention of national legislation on labour or on the operation of ports, which is binding on all port operators, under conditions other than those laid down, specifically for the use of operators’ own equipment and workers, and possibly on docks for which a public service concession has been granted.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stated, the obligation on current port operators to absorb the labour force contracted to ports on salaries around three times higher than the average in sectors with identical operational requirements means that the directive will not be able to allow a port user to engage in cargo-handling activity without having to be accredited, thereby using workers in more favourable conditions than those binding current port operators under the law and under collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we clearly maintain that self-handling must be confined to the work of a ship’s own crew, as the term ‘self-handling’ itself suggests, and used as a complement to and in conjunction with the port operator. Self-handling is the most controversial aspect of the directive and the aspect that will have the most implications for economic agents, especially in my country, especially for Portuguese economic agents, in the event that the wording that has just been approved does not safeguard the principles identified previously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I see it, the reasons for excluding pilotage services from the scope of the directive apply to all technical nautical services. Quality of service and the safety of operations are part and parcel of all these services.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive has a single aim. It seeks to establish fair competition, which seems to amount to opening up markets judged to be sufficiently profitable to competition. Although the efficiency and reliability of public services is recognised, this is outweighed by the interest, or rather the interests generated from the process. Self-handling provides an example of this liberal vision. Although it now has a better-defined framework, for the most part it ignores the high safety standards currently in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it actually realistic to imagine that the two roles currently fulfilled by qualified professionals might, in future, be undertaken by non-specialist workers in a completely fragmented way? The dock workers made their discontent clear through their demonstrations in Brussels on Friday and this afternoon in Strasbourg. The demonstrations show how they despair of the European institutions that are out of touch with reality and the concerns of the people of Europe. They can see that the authorities are sticking obstinately to their dogmatic positions. This is all the more unacceptable when safety is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to reiterate the points made by some of my fellow Members during the discussions on the previous document. They pointed out the negative repercussions of previous cases of liberalisation, which proved unpopular as they were ill-prepared and imposed. Further to the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accidents, it is not possible to claim ignorance or maintain that such incidents were highly unlikely. If accidents happen, the European Union and its institutions must act in accordance with their accountability to the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to emphatically express my complete solidarity with the workers who have come to Strasbourg to demonstrate today. After all, from practical experience in my own country, Flanders, we know that the pool system with recognised dock workers ensures that we have qualified and motivated people working in our ports who can be regarded as some of the most highly skilled workers in the world. It is their dedication and their professional knowledge that make our ports fast, competitive and in particular safe handling organisations. I would like to know why something that is in fact perfect has to be changed or dismantled.</p>
<p class="contents">Dismantling this pool system and the dock workers’ monopoly will not only result in the umpteenth social graveyard, but it will also undermine the safety of our ports, unsettle the social peace that we have, cripple the strength of our ports and even reinforce anti-European sentiment. After all, the man in the street should realise that strong European files or files with a strong European dimension that have to be deblocked in order to secure our prosperity will in fact get us nowhere. Take the IJzeren Rijn rail link, for example; there has been no progress there, but Europe appears to regard measures that we know will only result in social breakdown and more unemployment as a priority. Europe is giving the impression that it gives greater priority to the interests of certain shipping lines – shipping lines that in many cases are practising a form of modern-day slavery – than to the survival of their own best port workers. Only a clear ‘no’ or ‘never’ will do in the face of so much blind European arrogance. Today we must make it all the more clear to the Flemish port workers: working for your own people first is a guarantee of safety and quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, free access to port services is very important for guaranteeing honest competition in ports. Competition between ports is also important, so the Commission must ensure greater transparency in government investments that benefit the ports. The present directive got off to a messy start, but we now finally have a good document on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about two matters. Firstly, self-handling. Today and last week, there were dock workers demonstrating outside the Parliament buildings. They have every right to do so, but if ever there was a directive that took account of all the rights and interests of the dock workers, then it is this directive. Their position and social standing is extremely well protected by various articles in the directive, right up to their training and professional qualifications. Even if the port employers wanted to, it will not be possible to work with poorly trained, unqualified workers who could be a threat to the safety of the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do want to set straight, however – and everyone is always talking about workers’ rights, Mr Bouwman – is that employers have rights too, even if nobody ever stands up for them. The employer’s right to know whom he will be working with is, I think, the employer’s right. I therefore do not support Amendment No 13 in which self-handling is again toned down – in a definition, would you believe. In order to guarantee that every Member State has regulations in which everything is guaranteed, I have tabled Amendment No 28, as we had promised in consultation with the FNV.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of interest is pilotage services. I wholeheartedly endorse the Council’s viewpoint on this matter. In the formulation of the Council, Member States may liberalise their pilotage services if they want to, but they must do so under the directive. In other words, with all the protection and professional qualifications that this entails. I am not in favour of removing pilots from the directive. Anyway, what else is this directive about?</p>
<p class="contents">The common position forms a balanced text which we should not tinker with too much. Important points such as the provisions on transparency, the duration of licences, new ports and arrangements concerning the compensation that service providers have to pay when buying themselves out of a contract period, are in my opinion plain and clear. The compensation arrangement can, in my opinion, best be arranged between the market parties concerned without outside interference. The text of the common position does far more justice to the great diversity of situations and regulations on this point than the amendments tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consideration of this report began in confusion during the first reading. We are opposed to it for three main reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we believe that, if we want to purse the aim of sustainable mobility as part of our policy on ports as proposed in the White Paper, the problem of competition in ports is certainly not the most appropriate or timely way of approaching the issue. At stake are problems concerning the development of different areas, the North-South balance and congestion problems in the Pas-de-Calais area, in particular. It seems to us that the Commission has failed to respond to this issue and is displaying a haste to liberalise port services which we feel will have no real impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although we are in favour of competition, it must have an equitable basis. The Commissioner said a few moments ago that there is a one to three ratio between the prices charged by different European ports. While this is probably true, the main explanation lies in the radically different social conditions in different countries. Without directives on social issues, collective agreements and harmonised statutes, what has happened to road transport for example, will also happen to ports. In other words, competition will not be fair but will entail a levelling-down of social conditions. The dock workers understand well that we are not implementing competition but a terrible mechanism to reduce prices and salaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are completely opposed to the way the concept of self-handling has been introduced. Why are we opposed to this? Mr Hatzidakis wondered why we should not liberalise everything now that we have liberalised one sector. He is fully aware that the greatest amount of social malpractice probably takes place in the maritime sector. We fear that self-handling would simply be an excuse for significant social dumping. We would like to pose the following questions. How can we guarantee that national social standards will be complied with when they are all different? Who will ensure compliance with social standards? How can we ensure that multinational crews, comprising Philippinos and Malaysians, for example, respect social standards? How can we ensure fair competition with the port’s dock workers? This is why we propose the common position be rejected. This is doubtless also why the dock workers are demonstrating their discontent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not finished yet if we are really voting out pilotage services tomorrow. Mediation with the Council is therefore on the horizon. As a Liberal I am far from happy with the scope. I had wanted more leeway, especially on the point of self-handling. I have a couple of amendments that make it possible for self-handlers to unload cargo both on the ship and on the quay. I think that the unions’ fear about social dumping is nonsense. Sufficient guarantees can be built in. In particular, I find it regrettable that the people at the top are communicating so badly with the rank and file. There is no threat, there are just opportunities. Opportunities to show that they have the most experience, that they can work smoothly and efficiently and that they can therefore offer a keen price. Ultimately, what we are talking about is better quality and more services, but a monopoly must not be allowed to develop. Closing ranks and holding back modernisation will ultimately be at the expense of the working conditions of the dock workers themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this case, the people are the workers in the ports. Once upon a time there were a lot of them; their work was dirty and dangerous and poorly paid then. By organising themselves they have been able to improve these things and protect themselves against poorly paid, unskilled labour being hired in from outside by illegal contractors. Years ago the European Parliament called for rules governing competition between ports, particularly between ports serving the same hinterland, such as the North Sea. A lot of government money has been squandered on excessively low tariffs and excessively generous facilities to please the shipping companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has now picked up on this, but not with a view to restricting competition between ports but rather to promote it within the ports. This competition is trampling all over the dock workers. That means a return to the old situation. The main aim is to cut labour costs even further. A lot of the work has already been mechanised, and the cost of port labour forms only a negligible part of the cost of goods these days, but they even want to cut back on this. It is true that the amendment limits opportunities for extremely low paid crew from developing countries to take over loading and unloading on quays from registered local dock workers, but this is difficult to monitor. We can expect a large number of disputes about rules being flouted and competition being distorted in years to come. That was not sufficiently clear to the trade unions at the first reading in November 2001. They have since agreed on their complete rejection on a European level, but many of the elements relevant to them have now been declared out of order for the second reading, and demonstrators have been kept far away from this building. Strikes against this unreasonableness are the only weapon the people have left. In order to avoid this, the entire proposal must be dropped, as was advocated by more than 40% of the Members at the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many countries have signed these conventions, and you will naturally say: ‘We are not opposed to it either, and we also allow these countries to organise themselves further.’ My country also wants to be able to retain its ‘Major Law’, but that is naturally not what it is about. What the dock workers are afraid of, and this is an area in which I share their anxiety, is the fact that safety in the ports will go out of the window in favour of cheap prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident has already been mentioned by many people. Are we going to see serious accidents like this in the future when goods are loaded and unloaded? The other great risk is that of social dumping on account of self-handling.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, is that really what you are aiming for, competition through social dumping? I do not think that we should go down that route. We must ensure that compulsory licensing is introduced. I therefore really do not agree with what you are advocating, as I am sure that anyone subject to strict licensing laws will also experience distortion of competition. They will be priced out of the market, and cowboy ports will develop, just as we already see ships sailing under a flag of convenience that are the terror of the seas.</p>

If this Parliament truly represented the wishes of the people, it would throw this directive out, but it will not.

I endorse the proposal for a directive and the balance reached, thanks, not least, to Parliament’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that opening up to the market could be positive, not least as regards access to port services, but only under the conditions specified and introduced by Parliament’s amendments: only provided that safety, professional qualifications, contractual and social rules and environmental protection are rigorously safeguarded where all the companies and all the kinds of services connected with aspects of the different port services are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The same must apply to self-handling. I am not against self-handling in principle, but it must not become an excuse for promoting forms of social dumping and ways of economising on professional qualification or safety. This is transparent competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies to new ports too, in order to ensure the availability of private investments. Direct control over services and providers must be possible – and is highly desirable – but with due regard for those conditions: professional qualification, contractual and social rules, environmental protection and safety. Unless these conditions are observed, we will be lumping together things which are so very different that they neither properly serve the interests we represent nor further progress towards the objectives we want to achieve with this directive.

Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this afternoon we have seen that our directives do have some effect on the people of Europe. We have, in particular, seen that the dock workers are angry, very angry, and also desperate. Why? Most likely because they are heard too infrequently in this Parliament. More likely, however, because they are coming up against a cold, liberal Europe that subordinates safety, safety at work and health, social matters and jobs to blind liberalisation dogma. They are also angry about the proposal you launched in February 2001, Commissioner, in which you pulled their social charter out from under their feet with one stroke of the pen. It will come as no surprise to you that you are not very popular in Belgium, and I still regret that you did not have the courage to have a direct debate with the dock workers in Antwerp, for example. That could have been enlightening. In Parliament we should have discarded the proposal immediately after the first reading, we should not have amended it. Various colleagues have already told me that it is not what we wanted. So why did we not vote it out? I will continue to fight against this directive, I will vote against it tomorrow and I will continue to do so. Because I still do not understand what its added value is, not even in its amended form, although I do admit that it is much improved.</p>
<p class="contents">I will tell you why the dock workers are striking, Mr Jarzembowski. They are, of course, striking because if you permit self-handling in another country, you must also permit self-handling in your own country straight away because of the sacred competition rules, and that is the reason why I continue to oppose it. I hope that we will be able to vote the proposal out, but I fear that we will not be able to do so. I am therefore hoping for strong amendments: self-handling out and compulsory licensing in. I found out today that we are better at defending this Parliament with a police force than we are at maintaining the social system in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has led to ecological disasters involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and finds expression in the employment of seamen at salaries ten times lower than European salaries. When you talk of reducing the costs of port services, you are clearly talking in terms of lowering salaries, cutting jobs, increasing work rates and doing away with the forms of social and wage protection contained in the collective agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore opposed to this European directive, and we call for ports and port facilities, which are useful to society as a whole, to be made a public service. We reject the idea of having dock workers compete with one another on the basis of their status or origins, for that would be to the detriment of everyone. All those who work at ports must benefit from the same conditions of salary and social protection, modelled upon the most advantageous available.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the dock workers who demonstrated before what became a besieged Parliament and were greeted by water cannon and tear gas, I should like you to assure us, Mr President and Commissioner, that the demonstrator who was arrested this afternoon, having chained himself up in the courtyard of the European Parliament, has definitely been released. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So much has been said already, but this afternoon I had another meeting with some of the people from the dock workers’ unions, and I was impressed by their message. This directive brings ports of convenience closer. This directive organises social competition between the European ports which will result in social dumping and also, in time, the destruction of the dock workers’ charter as we know it in Belgium. Nobody is asking for this. Europe is apparently the crowbar used to tackle problems in some countries. Allowing self-handling without a prior compulsory licence has other negative consequences, as has already been mentioned here: a lack of safety and problems with environmental disasters at sea. That is all we need. My group and I are therefore voting against self-handling and in favour of the social protection of dock workers, and I hope that some socially aware fellow members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will follow suit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to deal with just one point, namely that of compulsory licensing. As the directive now says, it is being left up to the Member States to decide whether or not to issue a licence. So they can choose for themselves. In other words, the Member States and the port authorities are free to decide whether to operate an obligatory system of this kind or not. At the same time, however, we are creating – and I do not understand this, Commissioner – an additional competition-distorting element in this directive itself. What will happen is that one port will comply with the compulsory licensing rules and may impose strict conditions in terms of workers’ qualifications, social conditions, safety, the economic development of the port and so on, and another port will not do so, which will ultimately distort mutual competition between the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore being left up to the Member States to decide whether or not to do this. My amendment, and an amendment that was also tabled by other people, concerning the introduction of compulsory licensing was declared inadmissible in the parliamentary committee on the basis of Rule 80 of the Rules of Procedure. I have now been told that the President of this Parliament may now declare these amendments admissible after all on account of a number of new elements, which Mr Bouwman has referred to. If this is the case then I will vote in favour. I support compulsory licensing because I am in favour of the same competitive conditions existing in all ports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We began with the rapporteur’s positions, which gradually changed and which at the moment are being transformed by Parliament’s vote. I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur on doing his job, which is to defend the position of Parliament and not his initial position.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, these negotiations have helped us to understand that Parliament must respect the Commission’s exclusive powers of legislative initiative. Some Members have tried to introduce proposals, but this has not been possible, which I believe is positive, because we must all respect everybody else’s role.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive attempts to open up a European area of transport, which is absolutely essential, because at the moment the State areas are of no use to us. This directive, with its proposal to open up the market, attempts to stimulate a mode of transport which is very positive in terms of its relationship with the environment. Until now, maritime transport, apart from the transport of oil and dangerous goods, has been secondary, but it provides the possibility of improving European transport from the point of view of the environment, congestion and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already had experience of access to the market in relation to other means of transport and there have been no dramas or traumas; therefore, what there has been is an increase in their management capacity. It is true that, at the moment, with the proposals in the directive, we are not talking about reducing the number of jobs in ports. We are talking about increasing the number of workers in ports while making them more efficient. We must also forget the idea that liberalisation and lack of safety go hand in hand. Aviation is a mode of transport in which safety is vital and nobody can claim that its liberalisation reduces safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget, Mr President, that Parliament has made a great effort to bring its position closer to yours. In conciliation you must now reciprocate in relation to self-loading and pilotage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be done by people who sail on ‘flag of convenience’ vessels and who lack the special professional skills that are needed in the difficult snowy and icy conditions that exist in the north to guarantee the occupational safety of other dockworkers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had bitter experiences of flag of convenience vessels flouting terms and conditions of employment and health and safety and environmental protection standards. Under the guise of competition, ship owners are now trying to extend the exploitation of seamen from the seagoing context to the ports. That cannot be accepted, given that it is being done on the pretence that it increases competition. Both port employers’ and workers’ organisations unanimously agree that competition will not increase with this directive.

That is something which the proposal for a directive on market access to port services, in the form in which it appears in the Council common position, is well placed to promote. If adopted, quite a few of the changes now proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism at second reading, will, unfortunately, crucially undermine the directive’s ability to contribute to just such more efficient maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">That particularly applies to the amendment to Article 4.9 whereby the provision that would give industry the option of self-handling using land-based personnel would disappear from the directive. If this amendment were adopted, owners of consignments would, in the future too, be prevented from loading vessels using their own skilled and authorised personnel and their own resources. If this and other unnecessary, and unnecessarily detailed, amendments were to be adopted, antiquated port structures would unfortunately persist, to the detriment of maritime transport’s competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">We Swedish Moderates believe, moreover, that all port services, including pilotage services, should fall within the directive, for this could be a positive development for European trade, for an efficient, safe and competitive shipping industry and for better options in terms of transferring cargoes from road to water. Many people want to achieve this, but extremely few are working towards doing so. One step in the right direction would be to reject all the amendments that limit competition and to support those which really are aimed at promoting it. That is something I hope Parliament will do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initiative may be thought constructive in principle but, given the maritime disasters experienced by Europe in recent years, you will agree that there is the a need to ensure that the regulations voted for meet the demands of maritime security.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important for the text adopted to consider each particular port service in its own right. At first reading, I tabled two amendments designed to exclude pilotage and mooring services from the scope of the directive. The House voted in favour of these, and that is something I am delighted about. At second reading, our rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, once again proposed that pilotage services be excluded from the scope of the directive, a proposal not taken on board by the Council. In the interests of consistency with our vote at first reading and in order to allow pilots to continue contributing to environmental protection and to safety in Community ports, I therefore request a vote in favour of excluding pilotage services from the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of excluding mooring services, I think it would be preferable not to liberalise this service, which is also one of the key features of port safety. An opening up to competition would be slightly more acceptable to the relevant services if certain points in the directive, such as self-handling, were to be reworded. Having opted for self-handling, the ship owner must ensure that this is maintained throughout the operation. We must avoid enacting regulations authorising an <span class="italic">à la carte </span>system. That is why I would encourage you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of Amendment No 13, seeking to limit self-handling to seagoing personnel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is important that we can hold a debate and that you can present your arguments. But there are certain issues I would like to clarify because, having heard some things which have been said here, it appears that we are talking about different texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the general issue of whether or not we want a competitive maritime transport system which can be incorporated into an intermodal network and which can provide an alternative to road transport. Yes or no?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have an entirely ideological question. Some of you believe that monopoly is the ideal situation. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe in principle that the option of healthy competition is much better than a situation of monopoly. This is essentially an ideological question. Having said all this, the facts appear to point more to one side than the other. It is true that there are elements, areas, market segments, which, due to a lack of size, do not allow for several operators. But when there is competition things work better. There is a higher quality of service, better prices and better costs, and more competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, our air sector, as was said a moment ago, does not appear to have suffered as a result of introducing competition. This Parliament wishes to introduce competition into the rail sector and has voted for that by a majority. Here we are talking about also introducing competition into port services in large ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you say that this puts an end to safety and you link it to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. What does this have to do with the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>? Absolutely nothing, ladies and gentlemen. It bears no relation. I am sorry, but they are different issues. Furthermore, nobody is asking for a reduction in the safety elements. This is why in the fields of pilotage and mooring services, in all these fields, specific and special precautions are being put in place, including in loading. It is said that the port authorities, which have the best knowledge, can regulate conditions in their own cases – which may consist of a certificate or of proven knowledge. We are allowing the port authorities to develop this aspect in accordance with their better knowledge of the situation in each European port.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that this is a proposal in favour of transport in general and also in favour of creating more work in our ports and having more competitive ports, which have more activity and which can cooperate in the economic development of the European Union. That is what I am in fact doing in transport, in the ports, in the other sectors of transport and in energy. That is quite simply what lies behind the Lisbon spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, what we are talking about here is a fundamental proposal and what we are proposing is the European model.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now discuss the second point that has been discussed, which is social dumping. Nobody wants social dumping, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody. We want more work for more activity in ports and furthermore with adequate social guarantees and conditions. Because, according to the European model, competition is introduced while maintaining social standards and guarantees. That is the European model, which is regulated liberalisation and which is not genuine liberalisation. Because liberalisation and regulation in principle appear to be contradictory, but, nevertheless, in Europe we are capable of combining the two elements: the advantages of the market with the guarantees of a system of solidarity. And that is what we are doing, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would read two things to the honourable Members. One, what does self-handling mean? Article 9 states that self-handling is the situation in which port services can be provided for an undertaking or by an undertaking for itself using regular personnel, not temporary personnel or personnel employed for a specific task, but ‘regular land-based personnel and/or seafaring crew’.</p>
<p class="contents">The key is that we are talking about regular personnel. But, as well as regular personnel, I would point out that Article 13(2) states that the national employment and social rules will be obligatory and that social dumping cannot take place. Ladies and gentlemen, please read the way this text has ended up because I believe it is crystal-clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have to consider what we are doing. We do not intend to reduce safety levels, to carry out social dumping, or anything of the kind. If we were to abide by your fears in relation to liberalisations, <span class="italic">Ryanair</span> or <span class="italic">Virgin</span> would not be operating, for example, and we would all be living with State monopolies, and I believe that more than one of you makes use of <span class="italic">Ryanair</span> and <span class="italic">Virgin</span>. So do I. Let us see if we can come to an agreement. And we have not as a result reduced safety in European air transport. Let us tell the truth, please. I understand that there has been a protest outside this Parliament. You are politicians, ladies and gentlemen. So am I. We must listen to everybody, but let us tell the truth. Nobody is proposing social dumping. On the contrary, we are talking about guaranteeing social standards and requirements relating to employment, and of regular personnel, not temporary personnel. If we restrict it to just seafaring personnel, we would then, on the contrary, be taking the wrong approach. I believe we also have to consider land-based regular personnel equally.</p>
<p class="contents">The third element which you have insisted on once again is that of competition between ports. Of course we are dealing here with competition between ports. What we have to ensure is that that competition is not unfair. And in this regard I agree with the honourable Members and the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, in particular. With regard to Amendment No 10, let us find a solution which can clarify it further, within the limits and margins laid down in the Treaty, which we clearly cannot change by means of this text.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of timeliness, mentioned by Mr Savary. He said that we should do everything apart from this. Mr Savary, the problems of the maritime sector, maritime safety ... this House has done a lot of work, as have the Commission and the Council, to improve maritime safety and we know, and the honourable Members are perfectly aware, that if the rule we proposed had been in force, we could quite possibly have prevented the last accident. Still more can be done and we are going to do it. But let us not say that we have begun with the ports because that is not true. On the contrary: we are practically ending with the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a very serious transport problem in Europe and we must seek solutions which are alternatives to road and rail transport, in other words, land-based transport. In an enlarged Europe, in which distances are increased, the maritime sector has many more possibilities and it makes much more sense to create European cabotage. But in order to create European cabotage and for it to genuinely compete with other transport systems, that is land transport, we need efficient port services. And that is what we intend, once again: to introduce competition into the large ports – I would insist – in a regulated manner, providing social and safety guarantees. That is simply the European model.</p>
