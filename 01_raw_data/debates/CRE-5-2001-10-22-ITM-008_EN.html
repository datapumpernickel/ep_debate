<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, according to the International Monetary Fund, the world experienced 120 monetary crises between 1975 and 2000. A monetary crisis is defined as the depreciation of a currency by more than 25% in one year. It was always the real economy that paid the price for this financial instability. Less growth, less employment and more misery accompany financial crises. We should therefore view the need for financial stability as being in the public good. Public authorities are called upon to prevent, or otherwise to manage as best they can, any crisis. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has commissioned me to produce this own-initiative report. I have experienced some difficulties with the rules laid down by the Bureau of our Parliament. My report was too long, as if it was possible to deal with the complexity of international monetary relations in five pages. The Meltzer report, in the American Congress, was some one hundred pages long. The Meltzer committee, made up of congressmen, scientists, bankers and trade unionists inspired a lively international debate. My humble report, and the motion for a resolution, will certainly not inspire a similar debate. In order to carry more weight, our Parliament should have followed a procedure similar to that of the American Congress, that is, by means of a collective report, with detailed proposals. The motion for a resolution is restricted to certain essential issues. My report hinges on the notions of transparency and accountability, regulation and solidarity. In 2000, the private sector transferred about twenty times more resources to the developing countries than the World Bank and the other multilateral banks. Open financial markets will lead to significant increases in efficiency for world exchanges so long as they are provided with a better framework. The international financial institutions must become truly universal. The monetary fund must become more democratic. The super majority of 95% must be abolished for all important decisions. It gives a right of veto to the United States and to the Union, if it is also able to unite within the International Monetary Fund. A regular rise in quotas and the issuing of special drawing rights is needed, in accordance with the growth of the world economy. Common rules and standards should be applied on an international level. We need a legal and judicial framework allowing for the rapid resolution of insolvency crises. The private sector should be involved in the management of crises, in particular by means of the general application of collective action clauses. This involvement should extend to the freezing of debt service payments. This will allow a reduction in moral uncertainties and in the cost of restructuring programmes. Better prevention of crises requires increased supervision of off-balance sheet operations. In particular, we must toughen the prudential requirements imposed on banks when they serve to offset hedge funds. Europe must become more active in international bodies. In this respect, the ECB must be more involved. The European system of central banks must be designed as a body for coordinating the Union’s supervision and control authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the conclusions of my report is that the Tobin tax will not work. In fact it would have terrible economic consequences. Why penalise transactions between strong currencies, which make up more than 95% of international currency transactions, on the basis of a desire to prevent speculation against the currencies of developing countries. The Chilean <span class="italic">encaja</span> would achieve better results. Nevertheless, I welcome the decision of the ECOFIN Council to invite the Commission to prepare a report on this issue which I hope will make the decision much more objective.</p>
<p class="contents">My report puts great stress on the need to settle the problem of third-world debt as soon as possible. This debt should be partly cancelled and partly rescheduled, so as to allow the developing countries to repay the amounts up to a limit of 5% of their annual exports. The London Agreement of 1953 laid down such provisions in favour of Germany. This was the basis of the German post-war economic miracle. This could also be the basis for a new economic partnership between all nations, the beginning of a true globalisation. Settling the problem of third-world debt would allow the internal development of these countries and would cement the victory against poverty and ignorance and therefore against intolerance and terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an own-initiative report dating back as far as 1999, when it was prompted by the crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil. In the meantime, there has been a succession of further small crises, and we have got on with our work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our group wholeheartedly agreed with the basic line taken by the rapporteur, not least because you, Mr Goebbels, took up a clear position on the Tobin tax. The international monetary system is undergoing transformation, as is clear from your report. We want to bring proposals into this process of transformation, but we can also see that the euro has firmly established itself since 1999 and has fully proved itself as an anchor giving stability to the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">That in itself is an important contribution by Europe to stabilising the international monetary system. Mr Goebbels has done a sound job of work, something I want to emphasise here today. For that reason, we are in substantial agreement with his proposals: the improved supervision of banking, surveillance of international financial activities, greater powers for international bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank to really get to grips with crisis situations. As you have just said, the IMF must become more democratic. Above all else, it must fit into the overall scheme of things so that it does not become the bogeyman of crisis management. Of course, the states must work together in this, for financial means alone will not overcome crises.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with closer collaboration at international level between national supervisory and regulatory authorities, a stronger coordinating role for the European Central Bank, something that has still not been resolved, and which we would remind you is overdue – the establishment of an observatory for systemic risks at the Bank for International Cooperation, and continued efforts at reform of the international monetary system. We share Mr Goebbels' view – contested in their proposals by our Green colleagues – that the Tobin tax does not belong in this report. Looking through the proposals, I noted that the Group of the Party of European Socialists also, according to Amendment No 10, wants this to be checked up on, even though it does refer to an ECOFIN Council resolution. On that point we take a completely different view. We agree with your basic approach and we will be asking for a separate vote on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Introducing such a tax, whose technical problems cannot in any case be resolved, would imperil the transfer of capital and thus also put at risk the advantages of global division of labour, investment and employment. That is why we are opposed to it, but will vote for your report without a Tobin tax, and against it with one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. We support this report because it gives the right solutions to the issues of the new financial architecture which must be created, of reform as a whole and of crisis management – solutions which also deal practically with the needs of regions hit by crises, the requirements of international financial markets and the very important need of all societies for stability in financial markets. I would like to emphasise again that I believe stability in financial markets to be a public good to which all citizens are entitled.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking a look at the situation we are in, I cannot resist making an observation. International financial activity on the currency markets has, in fact, decreased to around USD 1 200 billion a day, and that is due to the creation of the monetary union, which is of course one of the levers of the flows of capital that are quantitatively scarcely manageable. At the same time, though, we must note that during the course of the nineties we were dealing with a twenty-five-fold turnover increase in derivative trading such as swaps, options and so on. We know that, now, not even 3% of the transactions have to do with the real market in goods and services. I believe it to be important that we should look at the flow of capital under the influence of globalisation in terms both, on the one hand, of the yield accruing to institutional investors and of the economic and social situation, and on the other, from the point of view of the capital-importing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, we have to bear in mind that 75% of the capital invested flows into only twelve states, and that only 1% of the capital invested flows to black Africa. The rapporteur is right to demand that we now move to a consolidation, and that can only be done if we write off debt more comprehensively than we have done before.</p>
<p class="contents">Functioning globalised financial markets are no doubt advantageous. Presupposing stable development, they contribute to growth and employment. Despite that, there are still economic and social deficits and a lack of regulation and supervision. The report points that out. Concern about speculative commitments to the detriment of the real economy and the excessive volatility of the market brought about by an enormous increase in transaction volume for certain financial products are factors which make a reform of the international financial architecture more necessary than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">We have lived through 120 currency crises, and they cannot be abolished. We have not yet succeeded in developing a working system of early warning indicators, in making information transparent and in drawing up a code of conduct that works for everyone, and we have not yet solved the problem of moral hazard. So I consider it very important that this report's demands should influence the EU's negotiations, and the EU, too, must speak with one voice at the international level. It is not just about us having a monetary zone, but we must also speak with one voice internationally on financial market policy and on issues of the world's financial architecture. The introduction of the euro is a contribution to financial stability, and our financial system is better protected against external shocks, but we must move on, for the monetary union is only one contribution to stability in Europe and the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, in the Liberal Group, welcome the thrust of the report, because it grapples with the real issues and it avoids the sort of populist solutions which, I am afraid, are on offer in many of the amendments before this House. I am particularly thinking of the Tobin tax. It is, of course, the case that nobody, particularly liberals in favour of free inquiry, could object to the Commission's study on this subject. But I frankly believe that this is a false promise which really offers very little practical benefit to the countries that we are all, I hope, trying to help.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, the report quite correctly identifies as a potential model, the Chilean deposit system, which introduces an incentive for investors to invest long-term in an emerging market rather than going for short term paper because that involves a longer-term investment for depositors. That is the right way to go, and therefore I very much congratulate the rapporteur and hope that we will not support the amendments to an excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We regret that the motion for a resolution presented to us does not in the end meet the expectations of the explanatory statement which he had drawn up, and that is why we have thought it appropriate to introduce certain amendments aimed at reinforcing the political message of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first category of amendments relates to the ‘organisational’ aspect of the International Monetary Fund, which we believe to be currently in an unacceptable situation. That is why we are taking up an idea put forward by Jacques Delors, in this case that of an economic and social security council within the United Nations. We would like the Commission and the Council to express their views on this issue at the Council to be held next spring in Barcelona. Furthermore, we believe that the decision-making procedures and the composition of the governing body of the International Monetary Fund should be substantially reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second great area on which we would like to express our view is the need to combat terrorism, which has an extremely important financial dimension. This is why we feel there is an additional reason to make the recommendations of the FATF binding and to increase its mandate, as also requested by the European Council in Ghent. I believe that this would supplement the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to capital flows – in particular exchange operations – I will say no more, personally, about the Tobin tax, but I will nevertheless continue to demand an in-depth debate on taxes which could discourage speculative assaults on the currencies of a number of countries. In this respect, I believe there are some interesting proposals that deserve to be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only imaginable regulation is that which the most powerful impose on others, but they do so to their own benefit. The desire to democratise the IMF, which is controlled by the United States, is also ridiculous.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur recognises that the risk of financial instability is inherent to the operation of the economy. This is undoubtedly the case for your capitalist economy, but the seizure of social wealth and the means of production by a limited number of financial and industrial groups, their rivalry and their speculation, will come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">For future generations, the immense wastage and patent stupidity of your economy will serve as a demonstration that, in relation to the control of its collective life, humanity had not yet moved beyond barbarism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is right to call for tighter supervision, although that does not rule out a crisis. Interestingly, the strategy of the International Monetary Fund has shifted towards more focused support. This role of catalyst in stages of growth can preclude negative effects of the policy, such as an increase in the burden of debt for up-and-coming countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s request to coordinate a number of matters at European level is understandable. If these do not follow naturally on from global policies, Europe’s own policy would undermine the strength of the system as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I cannot see a role for the European Central Bank in global crisis prevention. Only a few months ago, the ECB was asked to absorb the slow-down in growth, although there was no reason to reduce interest rates within Europe. Striking a compromise between European policy and global requirements does not seem to be benefiting international stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many who believe that the introduction of a tax on global financial transactions could prevent future financial crises. Personally, I am glad that this opinion is not held by many in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I do not believe that introduction of the Tobin tax could prevent financial crises. Let capital make its way to where it is of the greatest use, in other words, let it be invested in new markets, developing countries and so on. By that means, growth can be produced. If we now make the transfer of capital expensive and limit and regulate it, the effect would only be counter-productive. Introducing it would also make sense only if it could be done internationally and without loopholes. This seems impossible, so that this tax will result only in additional burdens, bureaucracy and so forth, without the actual objective – the limitation of financial crises – being able to be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That has already been said. There are four areas I would like to touch on briefly. First, we want to make the international monetary system more stable, because financial stability is, among other things, a public good and a basic economic precondition for growth, employment and social justice – that is to say, a moral duty.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we demand not simply a reform of the IMF, we require of the public authorities the moral obligation to create optimum balance between the free play of markets and the need for them to be regulated in accordance with the fundamental principle of the eco-social market economy, and to guarantee a balance between the public and private sectors in public rescue measures in times of crisis. We demand of the Member States economic policies geared to growth and employment, and we demand the cancellation of debt, subject to appropriate economic and political conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, we begin at home. The euro is a stability currency even in the eyes of the world. The response of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank after 11 September was one of stability in the face of the crisis. The Stability and Growth Pact is a European response. The Commission and the European Parliament have, by a majority, expressed their opposition to the Tobin tax, and the Liège resolutions include measures as correctives to globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, we oppose measures to slow down economic development and ideologically motivated attempts to undo the Stability and Growth Pact or introduce the Tobin tax on its own, which create insecurity among those who work in the market. So I also regret that the Social Democrats' Amendment No 10 reinterprets the actual Liège resolution by inserting the Tobin tax. Remove this reinterpretation; in Liège we find ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Burg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I was astonished to read the briefing by Parliament’s Information Office, which presented the Goebbels report as follows: ‘In a resolution on the operation of the International Monetary System, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is critical of the introduction of a Tobin tax on financial speculations’. This appears to be the headline which is supposed to attract the press, and this still appears to be the subject around which the debates here revolve.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this does not at all do justice to the balanced and excellent report by Mr Goebbels. To start with, the resolution does not in any way speak in favour of, or against, the Tobin tax. The extensive explanatory statement does contain a few observations, but what is more important is that it also contains many other alternatives in order to achieve the two objectives pursued by those in favour of the Tobin tax.</p>
<p class="contents">Capital movements and foreign exchange markets must be founded more on actual economic reality and must be directed towards long-term investments and financial stability by taking a number of measures, but also by adopting a more flexible stance with regard to developing countries. Their debts should be cancelled and they must be granted an appropriate way of refinancing in order to be given a new lease of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Actually, one could say that, in fact, this report fits in perfectly with the Tobin tax action points. It would be unfortunate if the report were seen as an opposing force, for I believe that it complements the Tobin tax well.</p>
<p class="contents">In an amendment tabled by my group, a proposal has been formulated in an entirely neutral way that was also formulated in the ECOFIN Council. This amendment warmly welcomes the proposal by the ECOFIN Council to carry out such a study and further analysis. That seems to be far more fruitful than another instance of polarisation concerning the method: yes or no to the Tobin tax. In this way, those in favour of the Tobin tax can again endorse the objectives which are now actually on the agenda, and those against can be pleased about the fact that research can be carried out in a neutral way and that the objectives, namely, better management of capital movements and more opportunities for developing countries, can be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an interesting report that goes into considerable depth in an attempt to explore the various issues it raises and its resolution is informed and balanced. In our opinion, the report makes a constructive contribution to a debate of fundamental political importance and, furthermore, is very timely.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on how to create a better-working international monetary and financial system lies at the heart of our task of responding to globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Private capital flows – and the report also takes this view – are the main source of growth, prosperity and productivity. If our objective is to ensure that countries, both developed and developing, are able to take full advantage of the benefits of globalisation, the best option that I can picture is for financial markets and their operations to merge. Broad-based, deep-rooted and fluid financial markets will make funding investment easier, which will, in turn, enable economic operators to spread their risks more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation will prove beneficial for those operations that would otherwise be too risky for international investors, which will be of benefit not only to developing countries, but also to small and medium-sized businesses in our own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic benefits generated by the globalisation of finance are the result of the links between markets and operators having become stronger. Because of the nature of these links, the upsets passed on within a modern economy as a consequence of this process of globalisation are more rapid, for the very reason that borders that existed twenty years ago have disappeared. It is true that amongst the risks we will have to face, there will be financial markets with excessively volatile exchange rates and share prices. A ‘contagious’ effect can occur between one country and others and it is possible that capital flows will fluctuate.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Economic and Monetary Union we have stimulated stability and growth by means of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, which are fundamental factors for strengthening our economy and for preventing – or rather, fighting against – these financial upsets.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic and Monetary Union, therefore, contributes to improving the stability of the international situation in our region. It is also true, however, that various alternatives have been put forward across the world. I agree with the thesis of Mr Goebbels’s report. There are no panaceas that will help us confront the challenge of consolidating the global financial system. The report makes this point very clear and I hope that its resolution will be read not only by those for whom this document is officially intended and who have a professional interest in these matters. I hope that it is also read by the people who are – legitimately – concerned at the direction in which the process of international economic and financial integration is heading.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems and challenges inherent in the integration of financial markets must be addressed in a broader context, which is what Mr Goebbels has sought to achieve in his report and what we in the Commission are seeking to achieve in the study that the Liège Ecofin meeting asked us to produce on how we can respond to the challenges of globalisation, which we are intending to present next February.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been happening in recent years? I would say that since the crises in Asia, we have made substantial progress. Efforts have been made to improve macroeconomic conditions, economies are today more resistant to external shocks and the number of countries choosing to abide by internationally agreed codes and standards in order to make their economies more transparent is continually increasing. The G7 ministers and the Monetary Fund have made progress in a few key areas, such as, for example, the international financial institutions, which clearly act with greater transparency these days. There is also the International Monetary Fund itself, which has increased its capacity and is fine-tuning its instruments so that they will enable it to analyse, assess and oversee the stability of the financial system more efficiently. I would also say that coordination between the various national supervisory authorities has improved substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we cannot rest on our laurels as a result of these improvements. Much still remains to be done and, in its report, Parliament shows the correct way forward. The Commission is quite happy to accept your view that we must ensure full participation by the private sector in solving and managing financial crises. Not only in order to ensure that responsibilities in times of crisis are shared in an equitable way, but also that the private sector is appropriately and systematically involved, which is crucial to effective crisis prevention, thereby preventing dangerous and, ultimately, unsustainable, risk situations from arising.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, therefore, take note of the call for the Commission to consider the viability of introducing clauses for collective action on financial instruments such as securities. You all know as well as I do that the Member States do not fully agree with this position but it is a point of view that the Commission takes seriously, as we do all references to the fight against the funding of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The 11 September attacks have brought to the fore the abuses of the financial system by terrorists and the Commission has already adopted certain measures in this field. You have also made an effective contribution by finalising the codecision procedure on the second directive on money laundering. Nevertheless, we must keep making progress in this area. We are now in the early days of a process which will be long and we must continue working in this direction over the coming months. It is important that we make rapid progress on each of the proposals that provide valuable instruments for combating the funding of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a brief comment on one point that is still a source of some frustration to us, and that is the external representation of the European Union. The explanatory statement of the motion for a resolution refers to Europe’s conspicuous absence from the debate on a new financial architecture. You criticise the fact that the isolated initiatives of some Member States do not form a European policy. The Commission can only agree with this analysis. So how do we respond? What can we do? How can we improve the situation? I would say that it is not simply a matter of improving coordination and of speaking with one voice. Economic and Monetary Union has undoubtedly transformed the blueprint of worldwide financial and monetary relations, but the way in which we continue to address these issues in the main organisations and forums, including the Monetary Fund and the G7, is still based, to a large extent, on a purely national concept.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, therefore, only agree on the need to make progress. I think we will find it very difficult to formulate a meaningful policy in this area unless we clearly state our European positions as such at world level. This will require a more appropriate and clearly defined external representation of our interests. I am aware, however, that it will be very difficult to make progress in this direction unless we first make progress on the substance. Focusing the battle solely on our representation abroad is not as important as defining our own positions and producing coordinated policies on external matters. These two steps must be made in the same direction and at the same time. And on these points, Parliament can be sure that the Commission will continue to make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
