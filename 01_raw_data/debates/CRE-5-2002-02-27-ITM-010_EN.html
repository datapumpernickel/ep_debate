Light was shed on all the sectors. All the EU institutions were examined in turn because, even if it is ultimately the Commission that is responsible for implementing the budget, it does not, of course, act in isolation. It is bound by decisions taken in Parliament and in the Council, and it is dependent upon the effectiveness of supervision in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The agricultural area is a shining example. The Commission is proposing a reform of agricultural policy, but the Council and Parliament are resisting this and proposing that the subsidies be made still more bureaucratic, over-generous and vulnerable to fraud and trickery. The flax, milk and sugar subsidies are good examples.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a continual need for fundamental reform and a new administrative culture in the Commission. We do not always agree with the Commission, but we basically have the same objectives, namely that the Commission should become an efficient and modern administration. What is most important is that the Commission’s reform plan should proceed in the right way. My original plan was to compare the individual directorates-general of the Commission and offer a characterisation of each one of them. That would have been in keeping with the spirit of the reform, but it has not been possible to carry out that comparison. I should like to call upon the Court of Auditors to investigate what is practised in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The discharge for 1999 highlighted a number of very sore points in the Commission’s administration. One of the most important was the inadequate review of auditors’ reports and the insufficient degree of follow-up. In the report on the discharge for 1999, the Commission is asked to send Parliament reports twice a year, summarising all the auditors’ reports and their recommendations together with the ways in which these have been followed up. Apparently, the Commission will only agree to the internal auditing service’s briefing Parliament once a year, and that is absolutely not enough. The financial controller used to brief Parliament four times a year, and that is what we also expect from the new department.</p>
<p class="contents">The supply of information is always the biggest bone of contention between Parliament and the Commission. I have had an incredible amount of information supplied in connection with the discharge for 1999, and I should like to thank the Commission for this. However, clear rules that can be applied are needed, irrespective of the identities of the Commissioner and of the rapporteur for the discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework agreement is a mess. It can be used to withhold documents and to keep them confidential, for it is the Commission which, in the last analysis, decides whether a document is confidential. What is more, it is bureaucratic and leads to long delays. I have respected the framework agreement because that is what applies at present, but I think we should make efforts to have it renegotiated, and I should like to ask our President, Mr Cox, to honour his pledges concerning openness and reforms, especially in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control might well consider spending more time on evaluation. We must ensure value for money. It is unfortunately my impression that most evaluations are simply binned. The Commission has promised to submit results of evaluations that have been carried out. It does not go into how often and in what way. What does the Commission say to providing a briefing every quarter or every six months? There are quite a few practical issues arising from the discharge for 1999 that it has not been possible to follow up, either because OLAF investigations are not complete or because a disciplinary case is under way in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the big issues raised by the discharge for 1999, such as the IRELA case, are still being dealt with by OLAF, which does not put much of a move on. There has been a lot of focus on IRELA, the Institute for European-Latin American Relations that has now been closed down. I am not sorry that the Institute has been closed down. The Commission now has delegations in the majority of Latin American countries which attend to the links between Europe and that part of the world, but matters have to be properly cleared up. OLAF is at present in the process of concluding an internal investigation to clarify whether disciplinary procedures need to be instituted. IRELA still has EUR 3.4 million to repay. I should like to ask the Commission what the situation is regarding those repayments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to applaud the Commission, and especially Mrs Schreyer, for following up the Flechard case. This showed that it is possible to admit to a mistake and then change the rules. I really do think it is a splendid result we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">There is then the issue concerning the Stockholm Representation which, on the other hand, cannot be brought to a conclusion. I accept that the matter rests with the Swedish prosecution authorities, but we shall need to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like finally to say thank you for one and a half year’s worth of sound cooperation and, in particular, to thank Commissioner Schreyer. It has been a pleasure to work with someone so well qualified. As it turned out, it was not just cooperation but more along the lines of a good friendship, through which we have achieved fantastic results. That is something for which I should very much like to convey my thanks here in this House and, if this is to be the pattern for the future, then it is really something we can build further upon. It has been really splendid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament is required to exercise its powers of scrutiny over the Commission's expenditure. However, this is only possible with access to all the documents and information. Otherwise, the discharge decision does not constitute genuine scrutiny but is merely a formality. I therefore draw your attention specifically to the demand set forth in paragraph 4 of the report, which states that Parliament must have the same access to Commission documents as the Court of Auditors has.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must stop devising a wealth of new strategies and delaying tactics to withhold documents from us. The latest example is the van Buitenen report of 31 August 2001. I was the rapporteur on the first phase of the Leonardo programme in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, yet the Commission gave me absolutely no indication that fresh accusations of mismanagement had been raised and were being investigated by the Commission and OLAF. Indeed, if a third party had not drawn my attention to the situation at the very last minute, the Commission, despite its superior knowledge, would have allowed Parliament to grant discharge for Leonardo I. Since then, the Commission has played down the situation and deployed a variety of stalling tactics.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Mrs Schreyer, is this the trust and cooperation which you and your colleague Mr Kinnock never tire of demanding from this House? What have you got to hide? The entire report is apparently already in the hands of at least one German newspaper, together with the relevant OLAF report. Is not it time, Mrs Schreyer, for it to be made available to us as well?</p>
<p class="contents">The Framework Agreement, which was cobbled together and presented to Parliament immediately after the 1998 general discharge without any opportunity for discussion, has shown itself to be ambiguous and misleading, and clearly conflicts with our Rules of Procedure. It is therefore unacceptable in its current form. The Agreement must be brought into line with the Rules of Procedure, not the other way round, which is what Mr Bourlanges' proposed amendment appears to be demanding. I therefore ask you to reject Mr Bourlanges' amendment and to leave Parliament's rights of scrutiny – set forth in the EU Treaty – intact.</p>
<p class="contents">No committed European can genuinely be in favour of curtailing the rights of Parliament to benefit an already excessively powerful Commission, putting Europe at risk of becoming an uncontrolled and uncontrollable bureaucracy. This is the last thing our citizens want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the disgraceful affair of the adulterated butter, known as the Flechard case, I would have preferred more plain speaking. However, I have no doubt that the spineless investigation into the Flechard case – which concerns not only wasted money but also the risk these products posed to health – is an issue which will give us plenty to talk about during the 2000 discharge procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He also worked very hard on the main report on the 1999 discharge and produced excellent results. We wholeheartedly support this report too. I also believe that the Commission has been at pains to provide the relevant information within a short time. However, I naturally endorse the criticism voiced by Mrs Stauner: we have the impression – and this is reflected in the relevant paragraph of the Blak report – that the Commission is still playing its childish game of hide and seek with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of the last few days and the publications on a further van Buitenen report show that European reality does not take place between Parliament and the Commission, between a few officials and MEPs; it takes place in the real world, among 370 million Europeans, who cannot and should not continue to be led by the nose. I would be delighted if the Commission could finally move towards a more generous system – which, in my view, is an integral part of any democracy – regarding the disclosure of documents and the transparency of its administrative procedures.</p>

It is the Commission that deserves praise for this result, but also the rapporteur, Freddy Blak, for having managed this procedure with determination, common sense and intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">We are undeniably seeing progress in the field of agriculture, not least as a result of the implementation of the integrated management and control system, but it is equally true that no progress has been made in the monitoring of fraud in the food industry. This situation is paradoxical: a deviation by half a meter in the route of a tractor working the land or the replacement of a milk cow on a date that is not considered to be in accordance with the regulations can lead to a declaration of financial irregularities and corrections by means of statistical projection. Nevertheless, fraud in the food industry committed in order to obtain export subsidies is rarely monitored and when it is, cases of fraud often disappear within the labyrinthine processes of national justice systems, and do not result in Community sanctions or a public explanation of the facts. This is a state of affairs that we cannot accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an extremely intense process of collaboration which, while not always setting out from the same starting point, I believe nonetheless consistently yielded substantial results after intensive debate. I do not intend to review the entire procedure here; instead, I would like to highlight one aspect of our collaboration on the discharge, namely the issue of ‘access to Commission documents’. After all, a major change has taken place here compared with previous years, and this is due in no small part to the rapporteur's persistence.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission is happy to read in your follow-up report that you are pleased to have received all the documents requested in the discharge resolution. However, we have different views on how this was achieved. In my view, it clearly shows that the agreement between the Commission and Parliament facilitated this treatment of confidential information. Let me stress that I believe the treatment of the agreement is working very well in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the discharge procedure <span class="italic">per se</span> and the various reports that clearly bear the rapporteur's handprint. The same can be said of the follow-up measures or the measures taken during the budget discharge procedure. Again, let me cite just one example, namely the guidelines for the application of the proportionality principle for the writing-off of debts. There was considerable debate about this point during the discharge procedure, especially in the light of a 1994 case when Parliament felt that the decisions made by the Commission departments were lacking in transparency. As a result of our lengthy discussions, the application of the proportionality principle is endorsed on principle but Parliament has insisted that clearer and more transparent procedures must be adopted. The rule which has now been adopted in line with the proposed resolution is this: certain criteria must always be upheld, and above all, once a specific sum of debt write-off is involved, the Commission must make the decision as a collegiate body so that it is quite clear that a political responsibility is being assumed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention just one dissenting point on the follow-up report. The Commission cannot comply with the request contained in the follow-up report that the appointment of the accounting officers – that is, of the most senior officials responsible for keeping accounts – or of the financial controller, ought to be conditional upon prior consultation of the European Parliament. These are not interinstitutional posts but Commission posts for which the Commission itself is the appointing and decision-making body.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blak, in your statement a moment ago, you enquired about the further procedure with regard to IRELA. Here, the Commission has decided to take the next step. As you know, the Commission issued a recovery order, but no recoveries can be made as the Institute itself no longer exists. Nonetheless, it still exists as a legal body. The Commission has therefore agreed to take the next step and instruct the Legal Service to determine the extent to which there is scope to proceed on the basis of personal liability.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of the dossier compiled by Mr van Buitenen, I must point out that Mr van Buitenen has himself strongly insisted that only a few copies are in existence. I have not received a dossier from Mr van Buitenen either. As we have heard from my colleague Mr Kinnock, OLAF and the relevant departments in the Administration Directorate-General have examined the dossier. OLAF has designated eight experts from its area to examine the document. I must emphasise that there have been no delays here: the dossier's author himself conceded that it is likely to be March before the documents have been scrutinised. OLAF has now submitted a report. I have not seen it, but the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control has a copy. I believe that my colleague, Mr Kinnock, has also informed the Committee. As soon as recommendations are made to the Commission, the Commission will examine them and if new procedures are to be introduced, it will, of course, do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the issue of DAS as this is also included in the follow-up report. The aim is to ensure a positive DAS for the budget year 2003. I must reiterate on the Commission's behalf that we, for our part, cannot promise when a positive statement of assurance will be issued by the Court of Auditors for the means of payment as well, as this decision is a matter for the Court of Auditors, which has not set itself any benchmark stating when a statement of assurance will be granted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that during the eighteen months of discussions on the 1999 discharge procedure, we have concluded that it would be a welcome step if we could find common indicators by which to identify and measure progress on financial management. I assume that this issue will also feature in the budget discharge for 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission has reformed the system of financial management. If allegations of poor management are made, we investigate them, and if allegations of fraud are made, OLAF investigates them. I refute any claim that an investigation by OLAF would be a delaying tactic. This is not the case: OLAF was set up in order to investigate allegations of this kind!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it clear that there has never been a complaint that the Commission has tried to influence the findings of an OLAF investigation in any way. It would be foolish of us to do anything of the kind, for OLAF is an important body, not only in intensifying cooperation between Member States on combating fraud; it is, of course, also a sound and objective instrument by which to investigate internal matters. I am gratified by yesterday's judgment by the European Court of Justice. OLAF and its significance have been enhanced as a result of the ECJ judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's budget will undoubtedly continue to grow. There are new tasks ahead, and, of course, enlargement, in particular, represents a new and major challenge in the field of financial management. Against this background, I am sure that future discharge procedures and follow-up reports will raise a great many important issues which I hope we can resolve together with the same effectiveness as has been evident in the 1999 budget discharge. I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again for his collaboration.</p>

I should like to say here in the House – and this is something of which I am totally convinced – that that man should be removed from the Commission. He smashes and destroys European cooperation because his life’s work is to set himself up in opposition and to carry out assignments we cannot live with. I am very sorry to see something like this appear at the last minute, but I want to recommend to the Commission that it get rid of this man once and for all. He is a thorn in the side of all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
