<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Burg (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> It is a pleasure for me to present here today a virtually unanimous draft opinion of the European Parliament on two often very controversial topics: tax policy and pensions. This illustrates the urgency of this dossier. Two aspects that are very topical at the moment in the European Union are the ageing population and labour mobility. It also illustrates that the report is broad-based.</p>
<p class="contents">I was appointed rapporteur for this topic more than a year ago. The Commission notification had not been published at the time. We were waiting for a directive proposal and were initially very critical because you, Commissioner Bolkestein, presented nothing but a notification. Moreover, it took a very long time, until April of this year, before it was published. As it happens, we as Parliament are now late ourselves with the plenary discussion of my report, also late in the day, but that is purely for reasons of scheduling. Meanwhile, the report has already had its effect in part. The ECOFIN Council of 16 October decided to take a pro-active approach based on my recommendations. This has culminated in the automatic exchange of data and support in the collection thereof. The first success has therefore been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, rather apt for the report not to feature on the agenda until now. Indeed, it can enjoy the benefits of being discussed immediately prior to the Laeken Summit, to take place next Friday and Saturday. For this Summit also has the topic of pensions on the agenda. A joint report is scheduled for this Summit which has recently been adopted in the Social Council and the ECOFIN Council by order of the European Councils of Stockholm and Gothenburg and which concerns the social quality, the modernisation and financial sustainability of pensions. The Ministers have committed to starting a process of open coordination; Member States will be presenting reports before September of next year, and at the spring summit in 2003, more detailed policy on this subject matter will be outlined in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, in my report on the fiscal treatment of pensions, I too have called for the introduction of open coordination process of this kind. The fiscal policy of Member States is closely intertwined with Member State policy on the content and qualitative aspects of pension schemes. Indeed, the fiscal incentive to accumulating a pension and fiscal levies on pension payments are conditioned by requirements based on the view of Member States of what a sound pension scheme is, and the conclusion in my report is not by any means that we should simply put these requirements to one side to make way for opening the pensions market within the European Union, as some may be inclined to do. No, I would clearly draw a distinction between two different situations. The first situation concerns migrant workers who are allowed to take their pension schemes with them to another Member State on the basis of earlier directives. The Member State is to give these schemes the same fiscal treatment unconditionally, and the Commission is to be active in bringing matters before the European Court, and that receives my full support.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative situation is that all workers, including those who simply remain in their own countries to live and work, should be eligible for tax deductions in respect of contributions to a foreign pension scheme. This should not be unlimited in my view. In this case, the national requirements and conditions still apply for now. However, precisely in order to grow towards an integrated pensions market, I would call for this process of open coordination. Since the criteria for fiscal incentives have everything to do with these quality requirements in terms of content, it seems right to link this process with what is about to be launched in Laeken. I would therefore like to give this thought to Mr Bolkestein and the Belgian Presidency to take with them to this Summit in Laeken. As far as I am concerned, you can also plug into the time schedule that was chosen there and take the 2003 spring summit as a point of reference instead of that of Barcelona, because the topic will not feature on the agenda there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think I can make a brief reference to the recommendations of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment and the Committee on Petitions. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs in these committees for their contributions, and I hope that this report can help stem the flow of complaints and petitions, to which the Committee on Petitions, in fact, makes explicit reference, for that is, after all, the reason why we do all this, of course, namely the EU citizens who look forward to a truly border-free and obstacle-free Europe in terms of the movement of capital and labour, and in terms of encouraging the effective accumulation of pensions and fair taxation at retirement age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Member States apply different fiscal systems to occupational pensions in terms of taxation or tax exemption from contributions, investment income and capital gains of the pension institution and from pension payments. Eleven Member States use the EET system, three Member States an ETT system and two Member States a TEE system. If you read these abbreviations out in Dutch, it seems as if eleven Member States are constantly eating, two Member States are drinking tea non-stop, while three Member States are served a strange kind of intermediate course, and I have to say that, in my view, this strange intermediate course is sometimes rather underrated in the discussion. In my opinion, this is actually the most negative of the systems we have in Europe, because the tax office eats into it during the accumulation of a pension. This is, in fact, a true form of eating, and is possibly underestimated. People are too fixated on the differences between the two other systems. These differences in fiscal treatment may well lead to problems in labour mobility and mobility for the retired. Indeed, these differences could lead to the double taxation of migrant workers. Conversely, these differences could also lead to no taxation at all. Let it be clear that this contravenes the philosophy of the internal market. In addition, this situation adversely affects the flexibility of the labour market and undermines an important condition for the success of the monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">Something will therefore be done about this situation, and that is why we are also pleased with the communication. The rapporteur is right in noting that, due to unanimity requirements for decisions where taxation is concerned, we wait forever before anything changes. I would therefore urge the Commission to do something via the Court of Justice, so that Member States are forced to adapt to the realities of the internal market in one way or another and will no longer discriminate against those entitled to pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our ageing European society calls for clear strategies to ensure the adequacy of pension systems. Several measures, such as increasing the retirement age of an ever healthier population and thus increasing the size of the active workforce, are a crucial step in improving the ratio between the active working population and retired persons. But it is evident that other measures have to be implemented as well. The importance of occupational pensions schemes will rise in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European citizen would benefit from single market occupational pension schemes. The variety of occupational pension schemes and providers would be improved. The citizen and his employer could thus choose the most successful and best suited scheme, bringing the best interest rates, while offering full security of investment.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more Europeans work for relatively short periods of time in another Member State. They are still disadvantaged when it comes to their occupational pension schemes. Tax obstacles stand in the way of a fully functioning single market. The Commission communication sets a strategy to resolve these obstacles that are a clear disincentive to individuals who wish to contribute to pension schemes outside their home Member States, as well as pension institutions that wish to provide pensions across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission communication as a first step towards a solution of this issue. Like Mr Pronk, I wholeheartedly support the so-called EET model, as outlined in the Commission communication and in our committee's report. The EET model means that pension inputs are exempted from taxation. The pension scheme as well would be exempt and only the output would be taxed. This system serves to defer taxation to the moment the pension becomes payable, thus avoiding double taxation without the need to harmonise the level of taxation and without thus interfering in the Member States' taxation practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Tax issues are in the hands of the Member States. Like our rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, who has done an excellent job with this report, I also wholeheartedly support the method of open coordination. It is the only way we can achieve the results which our fellow European citizens need.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly urge the Member States to work quickly to achieve the necessary results for the benefit of our ageing population. Although we in the European Parliament may for the time being unfortunately not have the legislative means to decide on these issues, I can assure you that we follow them very closely and will do our best to achieve a common market for occupational pension schemes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am grateful that the rapporteur referred to the opinion of the Committee on Petitions and the fact that we have taken the problems of citizens seriously. I would like to point to the statistics published in the opinion, from which it may be noted that over 500 petitions in the past decade related to this issue, almost 100 during this term of office, and that 14 of these relate to the situation between Finland and Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">The large proportion of petitions on precisely this issue of the situation between Finland and Sweden is a natural expression of the fact that a free labour market has existed among the Nordic countries since the 1950s and that the Finns who moved to Sweden at that time are now considering moving back. According to one set of figures, several thousand of these people are living in the town of Haparanda, on the border with Finland, as they cannot afford to return to Finland. This situation shows the problems we shall face.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is so topical that it was highlighted by Professor Edward Andersson in a message in one of a collection of papers in honour of the sixtieth birthday of the Finnish Judge of the Court of Justice of the EC, Leif Sevón, as well as in the communication from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the problems on which still further light could be shed is that we in Europe apply such different variants of double taxation agreements within the framework of the OECD. The different variants of agreements in this area are a problem which I believe should also be covered by the open method of coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fascinating that this issue has been taken up by the Commission. I congratulate you. When a similar enquiry was conducted in the Nordic countries, former Minister for Nordic Cooperation Ole Norrback stated that the authorities did not believe that there was a problem in this area, although citizens thought that there was. He also found that he had learned more during the enquiry than he had in his eight years as a minister.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that quite a few of the measures proposed by the rapporteur will be implemented, for example access to better information on the rules which actually apply. I offer my wholehearted support for any courageous action on the part of the Commission, i.e. also taking cases to court when interpretation is at issue, in order to establish correct interpretations with regard both to taxation and to other similar charges with which we have problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe two of the problems to be the crediting of tax allowances and the level of tax deducted at source. It is particularly important that we work together to ensure that citizens have good access to information in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that there are Member States where workers accumulate pensions for themselves during their working lives requires full respect for acquired rights, and Member States where the citizens do not accumulate their own pension schemes, should therefore provide for adequate legislation in the short term in order to be able to face the anticipated problems caused by an ageing population. The call for solidarity between generations with regard to pensions should in the first instance be accommodated in the Member States themselves. International labour mobility should not be hampered by the different ways in which pension schemes are taxed fiscally. It is the task of the Member States to remove the existing fiscal obstructions in the short term based on proper consultation, and to better attune the different pension schemes. And cooperation among these Member States does not benefit from serving self-interest but from putting the interest of the citizen first.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wants to create an internal market for its citizens in a credible manner, cooperation among Member States will need to lead to the harmonisation of fiscal measures with regard to pensions. The EET scheme, in which premium contributions are not taxed but in which the payments are taxed, can then offer a direction for the mutual harmonisation of the fiscal rules concerning pensions. We therefore endorse the line adopted by the Commission and the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, to reach an internal market in which the structure, management and payments of cross-border occupational pensions are no longer hampered by fiscal measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today's report on taxation expands and continues the report for which the codecision procedure was negotiated as long ago as July this year. All of us take the view that occupational pensions – among other areas – will require greater fiscal coordination. We propose the EET system of deferred taxation, on the grounds that it is already a reality in the great majority of Member States. If we do not achieve this fiscal coordination, we will have distortions of competition within the financial internal market through differing tax systems, which we do not want to have within a single market of which we want to make the best possible use, including in connection with the introduction of euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1, proposed by Mrs Kauppi, expressly demands that the Council should make speedy progress towards a proposal for a directive on the activities of institutions providing occupational pensions, which would ensure mutual recognition of occupational pension systems and make a significant contribution to efforts towards effective tax coordination. It is regrettable that this amendment should be needed at all, as the ECOFIN council, like the European Council meetings at Lisbon, Feira, Stockholm and wherever else, determines priorities and, despite that, has managed nothing more that the sending-out of a questionnaire. I wish therefore to ask the Council why it stresses the urgency of this, whilst its actions do not reflect that urgency. What are the Council's problems with last October's proposal from the Commission? What does the Council have to say in response to the van den Burg report and to Parliament's resolution of July? With which individual demands is the Council having difficulty?</p>
<p class="contents">We want answers. We want them because we want to carry on negotiating in order to be able at last to achieve the aims of the action plan on financial services and implement Parliament's requirements – for the benefit of citizens and of enterprises and in the spirit of the common objectives that are so often invoked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to start by thanking Parliament for the unanimous support it has given via the van den Burg report to the Commission communication on the fiscal treatment of pensions. I have used the word ‘unanimous support’, as was also borne out this evening, not only from the words by the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, but also from the words by Mrs Thors, Mrs Kauppi, Mr Blokland, Mr Pronk and others. This is especially gratifying since this is a very important topic. There are three points which I should like to elucidate further, and these points are firstly, the subject of the open coordination, secondly, the pan-European funds and thirdly, the developments in the legal field.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution is asking us to develop a process of open coordination, and I would like to say that, in principle, the Commission is in favour of more coordination in tax matters. An example of this is the working party which is being chaired by the British Minister, Mrs Primarollo. This working party is looking into the harmful tax competition, with very active involvement by the Commission. However, I should like to say to Mrs van den Burg that there is a subtle, yet important, difference between open coordination and coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, open coordination is applied to areas of policy which fall within the national scope. However, the resolution mentions the need, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, for tackling double taxation and double non-taxation, and this means, by definition, that there is a cross-border element that, by definition, is one of the aspects of the internal market. There is, therefore, probably little scope for a formal process of open coordination which, as already mentioned, relates to topics which fall within the decision-making remit of the national states. And this is not the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, the ECOFIN Council of 16 October expressly approved the Commission proposal to take measures in order to tackle double taxation and double non-taxation. There is therefore very much a certain degree of coordination whereby the Commission retains the right, of course, to present further initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerned the pan-European pension funds, also mentioned by Mrs van den Burg and by Mr Pronk, I believe. In this field, the ECOFIN Council of 16 October did not subscribe to the proposal for pan-European funds. This does not mean in any way that the proposal has lost the Commission’s sympathy. On the other hand, I am perhaps slightly less enthusiastic about the suggestion made in the report and mentioned a moment ago by Mrs van den Burg, namely that the Commission would prepare a proposal for a statute of international pension funds. As I said just now, the ECOFIN Council was unable to endorse the proposal for pan-European funds, although these could function without new European legislation. Under these circumstances, I have strong doubts at to the proposal’s political chances of introducing pan-European funds by means of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, I should like to say a few words about the legal aspects. Last week, 6 December, the Court of Justice heard the Danner case, and this concerns, as I believe the Members are aware, a German citizen who emigrated to Finland and who wanted to continue with his German pension scheme, but unfortunately, the Finnish tax authorities refuse to grant him tax deductions on the contributions already made to the German scheme. During the hearing, the Commission supported Mr Danner and made reference to its communication on pensions. The verdict in this case can be expected next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, a second case came to light. A Swedish court referred a case concerning the deductibility of contributions paid to a foreign pension insurance company by a permanent resident of Sweden to the Court of Justice, and this means that the correctness of the Commission’s legal analysis will be tested twice in the near future. Mr Pronk also emphasised that the Commission should keep its promise that it will take action against Member States that infringe the Treaty freedoms, and I should like to assure Mr Pronk, as well as other Members who have mentioned this, that the Commission is in active dialogue with the Member States. The Commission has formally asked the Member States for information about their national rules, and is currently looking into the responses it has received, and I can assure the Members of this Parliament that the Commission will start proceedings against Member States, where necessary. As the Commission has indicated in its communication on tax policy of May of this year, a pro-active strategy for infringement procedures forms an important component of its approach aimed at making headway in the field of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, with the help of this Parliament and also of the Council, a certain dynamic seems to have come about in the field of tax exemption for pensions. I should like to say by way of conclusion: let us try to hold on to this cooperation, and in that framework, I gladly accept Mrs van den Burg’s offer of further consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I should like to extend warm thanks to Members for their excellent work and for the support for the Commission, and finally, I could perhaps say to Mr Karas that the Commission too is saddened by the fact that so little progress has been made on the work on the directive proposed by the Commission on pension funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Precious little has happened in this area over the past six months under the presidency that is about to come to an end. A circular letter, a questionnaire, has been distributed to the Member States. These questions have been received. Of course, work has been done on them, but that is all, really. I gather that the Spanish Presidency certainly intends to work on this with greater drive. Mr Karas, and the Members too, I believe, will agree with the Commission that such progress is extremely crucial and urgent on account of the demographic time bomb on which we are sitting, and I do not need to go into this topic any further. Everyone is familiar with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in this matter of the fiscal treatment of pensions, I should once again like to thank your Parliament and all the speakers for their support they have given the Commission proposal, and I hope that we will be able to continue in the manner indicated as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
