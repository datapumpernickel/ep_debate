I have no idea how I am going to fill the seven minutes allotted to me. But this is a very serious matter. Europe is becoming increasingly concerned with the role of the liberal professions. As they are part of the single market it is clear that issues concerning freedom in the single market are also extremely important for the liberal professions. Unfortunately, what one hears in European institutions is not always easy to understand, to interpret properly and to elucidate.</p>
<p class="contents">We do know that, a few months ago, the Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, made a number of statements in this connection. Mr Monti was attending an international conference when he said that, in his view, setting tariffs for liberal professions, which up to a point is done according to the law in some Member States through such mechanisms as fee scales for lawyers, is not without its problems under competition law. He also announced at this conference that the Commission would look into this problem. We also have the situation in which an Italian court submitted a request to the European Court for an advance determination in relation to which a hearing took place last autumn, and now the European Court will have to rule on the admissibility of Italian fee scales for lawyers under European law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have liberalised markets in many areas of the European Union. However, we have not normally liberalised them in such a way that we said from one day to the next, that’s it, we are now releasing you into a world of completely free competition. Usually there are transitional periods, statutory regulations for adjustment and so on, for example in energy policy and many other sectors. Only in the specific area of the liberal professions does it seem that there are no, or not enough, political considerations of this kind at the level of the European Union. I think it is extremely important that, in the future, the Commission takes a closer look at the liberal professions and starts to deal with their specific demands. They must deal not only with the people who work in the liberalised professions but, most decisively, with consumers as well. Fee scales were issued by national legislators in the Member States in order to provide reliable protection for consumers when they made use of the services provided by the liberal professionals. I think this aspect is gaining increasing influence in the policy of the European Union and must be integrated into any strategies that are developed.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Commission has just presented a paper on the services sector and the problems posed by the single market. This is very much to be welcomed. It just strikes me that this paper follows a completely horizontal approach and does not deal with the specific interests of the individual branches in the services sector, which is very big. In my view, the medical and legal professions, for example, cannot be dealt with according to the same criteria as the supermarket round the corner whose social task is quite different.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that the liberal professions are largely subject to specific special provisions attached to their profession in terms of competition, advertising, standards of behaviour and other obligations. Today at midday, we voted in second reading on the money-laundering directive which dealt with such obligations. That is why I believe that a specific political approach for the liberal professions is appropriate. We want Parliament to deal with this issue and we want to force the Commission, by means of this oral question, to tackle the issue of the liberal professions head on, which it has so far failed to do. That is why we have introduced this oral question with the text you have before you, which you are all familiar with and which I do not intend to go into any further.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say a few words about the task my political group feels we have to take on, which is the reason why this resolution was introduced. It is not enough just to talk about it; we must take advantage of this part-session to announce our demands in a brief Commission resolution. From our experiences in committee, the Commission normally complies with such requests. On the basis of this resolution, therefore, I expect the Commission to make concrete proposals and statements on the development of policy with regard to the liberal professions. I also expect it to answer the question of how, from a political viewpoint, it intends to deal with the modern developments that society entails. The liberal professions cannot ignore progress; they must of course bear in mind that times change and the world moves on.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final comment. Most liberal professions are also small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why there is special interest in protecting these groups and also a special obligation on the part of the Commission to deal with this issue. I have now spoken for six minutes. I will forego my last minute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this opportunity to be able to present our policy to Parliament on his behalf and to comment on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with you that guaranteeing the quality of services is of the utmost importance because customers, that is, consumers, are often in a weaker position than those who provide these services. A rule which is solely targeted at guaranteeing top quality services without distorting competition is clearly in the interests of consumers. This holds true regardless of whether the rule is introduced by the state or by a professional organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s competition rules do not therefore apply to purely professional rules. Whether a rule is a purely professional rule must be determined from one case to the next. In so doing, account must be taken of the impact of the rule on the freedom of action of members of the profession or of professional organisations as well as consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as determining compulsory tariffs or rates of charges is concerned, it depends, firstly, on who determines the fees or rates of charges and, secondly, on what interests are taken into consideration. The determining of uniform fees by members of a profession is a fundamental violation of competition rules. Justification on grounds of professional ethics is not recognised. At the same time, Member States only have the right to determine compulsory tariffs if these fees are objectively justified on grounds of the general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the view that this requirement is met if the mandate and the power of the authority issuing the rule in question is sufficiently clearly and unequivocally expressed in the rule itself and if there is no room for unlawful agreements to be reached between members of the profession.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does, however, have certain reservations concerning the interpretation of the case law referred to in the question, if this interpretation leads one to believe that only fees which are determined by professional bodies or associations of all members of a given profession can be subject to competition law. What is important however is that the existing, clear, objective and justified criteria of general interest, which are determined by the state, are met.</p>
<p class="contents">These criteria must include consideration of the interests of consumers and not only consideration of the interests of the profession. The quality of services should be guaranteed through other, less restrictive, means than the determining of fees. It is therefore not enough that a fee agreement is approved or confirmed by the relevant authorities in order for it to be exempt from the applications of competition rules.</p>
<p class="contents">A price agreement reached between members of a given profession, that is, between competitors, is a fundamental violation of competition rules. Moreover, a Members State can violate its obligations out of the EC Treaty if the rule in question removes the effectiveness of competition rules. This is the case, for example, when a state obliges the profession to determine uniform fees without specifying the criteria of the common good which have to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">A breach of contract takes place if a Member State transfers its power to determine fees to a professional association without reserving the right of supervision. For the sake of completeness, I would like to point out that the Commission does not support the determining of compulsory tariffs but at most tolerates it under certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">In areas in which compulsory uniform tariffs apply, competition must result from quality. It is therefore important for members of the profession to publicise their special fields and to be able to advertise. The Court of Justice just recently pointed out that advertising on every market is an important competitiveness factor since, in this way, the advantages of individual market participants, the quality of their services and tariffs are conveyed more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court confirmed the Commission’s opinion that a ban on comparative advertising seriously affected the ability of the most competitive members of the profession to expand their services and also had a negative impact when the customer base was confined to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of the country-of-origin principle, it must be noted that this principle helps to bring about a single market. It is anchored in the Parliament and Council Directive 98/5/EEC facilitating the permanent exercise of the lawyer’s profession and guarantees, among other things, that lawyers can establish themselves using the professional title of the Member State in which they completed their training by simply registering in the host country. The directive aims to enable layers who practice under the title given by their country-of-origin to establish branches and subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the Commission continues to ensure that the advantages of freedom of movement, which can be achieved through the country-of-origin principle, are weighed against the general interest, which is protected in the host country and recognised under Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently looking into how it can make further progress concerning the conditions for the cross-border provision of certain services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a liberal professional myself, in this case a doctor, rather than a lawyer, I have to say that my British experience of fixed professional fees – fixed in this case by government – such as cremation fees and attendances at coroners' courts, is that they are artificially low and have tended to benefit the state rather than the professional concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically I have recently been involved with asking the Commission to examine the restrictions applied by British health insurers in only paying the medical fees for treatments provided within the UK and refusing such benefits to British residents who wish to avail themselves of treatment in, for example, France. Last year I lobbied on behalf of a British lawyer wanting to register in France as a <span class="italic">notaire</span>, as non-French <span class="italic">notaires</span> are currently prohibited by French law, and this is an activity governed in many Member States by fixed fees. Currently I am my group's shadow rapporteur on EMAC on a proposed directive for a single market and free movement for insurance mediators, whose commissions are often fixed. Therefore these concepts apply to a number of different professionals other than lawyers, as I have already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market is one of the major achievements of the European Community and for that market to be complete it must include services as well as goods. I entirely agree with Commissioner Bolkestein that the services sector in Europe offers huge potential growth for competition and employment which must be to the benefit of all of Europe's citizens. The Commission's initiative in this area is therefore one that I strongly support and in accordance with the so-called single market principles, it should be possible to introduce in one Member State business models providing services pioneered successfully in another, and of course they should be subject to examination under the Treaty rules on competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am conscious of the need for proper consumer protection across a single market, but I also suspect that many practices which have grown up over the years, through tradition and usage, may have outlived some of their original usefulness. It is very important, therefore, that a thorough inquiry be conducted which will lead to a comprehensive debate so that special privileges and practices and exemptions which may be attached to the exercise of the liberal professions – and not just the lawyers – are properly scrutinised. It is necessary to ensure that they will provide a real benefit to the citizen, and are not merely privileges supporting the vested interests of all the professions concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is only starting to see the outer layer of the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Because I was thinking a moment ago that in the last part-session, Commissioner Reding, sitting where Commissioner Fischler is sitting now, gave us a detailed explanation of the agreement that had been reached between the Commission, FIFA and UEFA. That is a business worth many billions of euros and in that case it seems that competition gives way to quality. At times it seems that quality is very important, and I agree with this interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a profession, that of a lawyer, which is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world – they say that there is another profession that is older, but I am not going to mention it to avoid being accused of sexism. The law profession is very old and the danger of that is that lawyers deal with quantities. Using the words of Karl Marx, here quality becomes quantity, or the reverse, if you like, because lawyers are defending interests that can be quantified.</p>
<p class="contents">In the different countries of the Community, or at least in some of them, there is a system of protection through professional organisations, which is not perfect and could be improved but which at least establishes some guarantees, as there are too many unscrupulous lawyers who, left to the free interaction of supply and demand, could be tempted to act and abuse their position.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that the Commission is currently at a very immature time and therefore that we should look at this subject with a degree of calm. I think that we need to start seeing what is happening – I think that Mr Tannock was referring to this – in the different Member States, what makes it difficult for someone to go to a lawyer and, above all, why people are afraid of going to a lawyer.</p>
<p class="contents">That is to say, I think that there are real problems, but that those real problems cannot be solved by mathematically applying the rules of Community competition and much less by focusing solely on the criterion of prices. I think that the ideal would be for us to have a professional lawyers’ organisation covering the whole Community, not so much in order to protect lawyers but to protect consumers. We have to think about moving towards an area in which there is protection for people who go to lawyers, protection for consumers, protection for clients, and I think that the conclusion that we could therefore draw here is to invite the Commission to continue to look at the issue and, perhaps with the cooperation of Parliament, to see what the sectors involved say, including, of course, the clients, the people who would like to go to a lawyer, but who normally do not go out of fear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – I suppose I should start by declaring an interest as a member of a liberal profession to whom this question applies, being a lawyer. It seems to me that this week in Parliament we have been lobbied hard by lawyers' organisations supporting their professional position. In contrast, last week in the UK we saw the publication of a report by the Office of Fair Trading looking at competition in the professions, the very issue that we are looking at today. That report was based on two premises: first, that the professions are entrusted with the delivery of services of considerable public importance; but second, that any restriction on the supply of professional services will tend to drive up costs and prices and will limit consumer access and choice. That is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in this Parliament has tabled certain amendments. Yes, liberal professions have a special position in society, but that position and the services they offer should be enhanced by more competition and independent scrutiny. That is what we want to see the Commission look at.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you two UK-based examples. First, price: should this be regulated? Solicitors, my own profession, used to have a monopoly of conveyancing, the buying and selling of land. Competition was introduced, licensed conveyancers allowed, and it drove down prices, but not standards. I experienced this myself the other week. I had to renew the lease of my office. I was bound to use my landlord's solicitors. To set up the original lease they charged me GBP 300; that seemed quite enough to me. But to vary a couple of words in the self-same document, they proposed to charge me GBP 500. That, to me, is licensed robbery by our profession. They need to be challenged.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a constituent of mine recently came to me with a history of a dispute over the last 15 years. That dispute had taken him through five law firms, ruined his business and his family life, all about a debt that had actually been acknowledged in writing. He had had no help from my profession's complaints body. These are the kinds of examples that do the liberal professions no service; and sadly they are not limited or isolated. Yes, professional standards can be imposed by professional bodies, but they can only be further enhanced by competition and external scrutiny. That is why I ask colleagues to support the amendments tabled by my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to point out that the Commission has been tackling these issues for a long time now. In fact the first rule dates back to 1993. In total, the Commission has issued three resolutions on competition amongst the liberal professions, the fundamental principles of which have been confirmed by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Two of the resolutions were directed against uniform tariffs which could not be justified on the grounds of the general interest. In one case, which concerned the procedure to determine lawyers’ fees in Italy, the Commission is waiting for the interpretation of Community law by the Court. This ruling will prepare the way for the adoption of further measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the Commission believes that each of the liberal professions needs to be dealt with separately and not all according to the same pattern. The example the speaker from Great Britain presented concerning doctors is evidence of the need for separate treatment. I believe that, in my introductory comment, I said a great deal about consumer protection being our top priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
