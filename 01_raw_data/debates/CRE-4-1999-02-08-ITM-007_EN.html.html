Mr Virgin is stuck in the snow somewhere between here and Sweden. He may have got as far as Brussels and is probably now trying to come cross‐country with huskies. I apologise that I am not Mr Virgin, but I am presenting the report in his name.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly sad that he is not here, because this is an important report which he has worked very hard on over the last few years. I have only a few remarks to make in relation to it and one very important question to ask the Commissioner, a question which I hope she will be able to answer.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments look extremely technical and they are so. In particular, Mr Virgin, on behalf of the committee, considers that the new Annex C proposed by the Council should be deleted, as the ban on exports of the types of waste listed are already covered by lists of waste in the Basle Convention, and yet another list further complicates what is already very complex legislation. I would be grateful if the Commissioner could comment on the individual amendments as she goes through them and on their acceptability to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The general point I want to make is one that has been raised by a number of Members of the European Parliament, particularly from the United Kingdom. There is a scare in my country, and possibly other countries as well, that the net effect of this legislation would be to make it much more difficult to export used clothing of the types that are collected by charities to countries that have not replied to the Commission's questionnaire on the acceptability of exports of waste to them. Perhaps this sounds complicated, but it does not necessarily have to be. The trouble is that – perhaps they were not well brought up or something – a number of countries have simply not replied to the questionnaire sent to them by the Commission. The suspicion has grown amongst Members of the European Parliament that one of the consequences of this is that it would then be extremely difficult to continue to export used clothing to these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is, as we have understood in the course of the debates as it were, off‐stage, on Mr Virgin's report, that used clothing, when collected by organisations belonging to the churches, Oxfam, or whatever, ceases to be a waste once it is sorted and that sorted used clothing does not actually come within the orbit of this directive at all. Therefore there would be no difficulty for charities and others that export such used clothing.</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke this afternoon to the BIR – the Bureau of International Recycling – and was told: ‘Yes, that is our understanding, but there is legal uncertainty on this point". My question to the Commissioner – she may not be able to answer now but could perhaps write to us to let us know exactly what her position is – is as follows: is it true, therefore, that there is absolutely nothing flowing from this legislation to prevent charities from our countries exporting quite freely, with no bureaucracy about it, used clothing to those countries – predominantly, I suspect, in Africa – which import them at the moment? If it is true, then can we make sure that there is legal certainty on this point? If we need legal certainty, does that mean that we therefore need to have some adjustment to this regulation?</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to labour this point but it is one which has emerged in what is otherwise a rather technical regulation as a point that people can understand and about which many people are worried. I would be grateful for the Commissioner's reply.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kokkola </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL) </span> Mr President, Commissioner, any economic activity in developed countries unfortunately results in damage both to the environment and to public health. Waste is an unavoidable side‐effect of such activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Both toxic and non‐toxic waste cause huge problems in all countries in relation to reprocessing and storage. The export of waste from producing countries to recipient countries, either for reprocessing or for final storage, is a ‘solution" which is fraught with dangers, both for the environment and for the health of EU citizens. It is very important, therefore, that the entire process should be governed by strict rules and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is fully aware of this need and has put forward a number of measures and rules for the transportation of waste. One such regulation, which is contained in the document before the House, relates to the implementation of common procedures which are to apply to the transportation of waste of certain kinds intended for countries which are not members of the OECD. This regulation must set limits and respect the decisions of the countries involved, without, in so doing, causing major problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a well‐known fact that, in third countries, cheap labour, poor environmental legislation and a relatively free import system provide favourable conditions for waste to continue to be exported to them as recipient countries. Environmental organisations have set in motion information campaigns about the problem, both in developed countries and in those countries which accept waste for economic reasons. We must realise that waste is not just another exportable commodity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great pity that Mr Virgin is not here today to outline his report to the House, but we certainly agree with most of the points which he expresses. There is just one point on which our group does not agree and that is on Amendment No 2. We believe that the monitoring mechanism contained in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 259/93 should remain in Article 2 because a simplification of the procedure would lead to major pitfalls.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I also make the point that there is another important question: the question of monitoring compliance with this regulation. The European Union must put in place stiff penalties for Member States which are in breach of this regulation, and it must make available procedures to prevent the illegal exportation of waste which, as we know, is going on.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I wish to make has to do with the addition of a new annex, Annex 5, to Regulation (EC) No 259/93. I believe that amalgamating the lists of waste in the Basle Convention will simplify the implementation of the legislation. I would like to thank Mr Virgin – albeit in his absence – for his report.</p>

One such problem is that of public health and, as a result, our ability to help protect the most vulnerable populations, who are mainly children. There is the problem of our ability to help protect those we call street children, who often live in these non‐OECD countries. Then there is the risk of environmental dumping that leads to some countries being transformed into rubbish tips, particularly so‐called developing countries. This is because these countries are often forced to agree to all manner of deals to bring in the revenue required to finance their needs, particularly in terms of public facilities. There is also the problem of sovereignty, and of restricting the possible choices in some activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we are forced to try to strike a balance. On the one hand, we must be extremely strict, and this means introducing the highest possible requirements for waste shipments. On the other hand, we must leave these countries the flexibility they need to be able to choose the possibility of recycling. Recycling would then help these countries to establish industrial or semi‐industrial activities that would, as a result, help them generate income.</p>
<p class="contents">When we consider the idea of drawing up lists, namely the green list and the red list, it is clear that such industrial opportunities mainly affect products on the green list. In effect, we should keep to the principle that the danger level is linked to the product and not to the difficulty some countries have in responding. We are fully aware that all countries are not equal as regards administrative controls and techniques for the import, storage and processing of such waste. We should support them but firstly we should suggest the principle of transparency. We should consider the issue of extending the waste producers" responsibility. Perhaps we should finally take a good look at the volume of waste we produce. In other words, we should look at the risks that our consumerism poses to our common heritage, and also at the drawing rights we have awarded ourselves on the common heritage of the planet and, as a result, on the protection of the environment.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, I also wish to thank Parliament for the report, although Mr Virgin is not here, and for the active work done by Members on it. As Mrs Jackson remarked, there has been much disruption due to the weather today, so we must get by without Mr Virgin.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation deals with the shipment of waste on the so‐called green list for recovery to certain non‐OECD countries. Waste on the green list is waste whose transfer is generally not considered to pose any risk to the environment. Waste on the green list for recovery is traded as merchandise within the OECD and in the EU. I would also make it quite clear that the export of hazardous waste to non‐OECD countries is prohibited under current EC legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1994, the Commission asked all non‐OECD countries what control procedures, if any, they wanted to be applied to the shipment of waste on the green list. The proposed regulation is only concerned with countries which replied that they did not wish to receive items from the green list or certain of those items, and with countries which did not respond to the Commission's survey. Mrs Jackson asked me specifically to comment on the eight amendments which have been tabled, and I will say something about them now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept six of these, five in their entirety and one with a minor change, and the Commission can accept one amendment in part. There is only one that is not acceptable to the Commission. According to Amendment No 1, the Commission must inform the countries which are covered by the regulation on changes to Annexes A and B on a regular basis. The Commission can accept this, and we shall of course make sure that it happens. Amendment No 2 implies that the shipment of waste on the green list to countries which have not replied to the questionnaire can take place under the procedure for the orange list, which only requires tacit consent from the importing country. I am pleased to note that Parliament is no longer, as at first reading, demanding a ban on such exports, because that would be against WTO rules. But your proposal to follow the procedure for the orange list, i.e. based on tacit consent, goes in the opposite direction. The control procedures which you are now demanding will mean that the shipment is permitted if there is no answer from the importing country within 30 days, in other words you take silence to mean ‘yes'.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 1997, I heard it said in this House that it is unacceptable for the Commission to assume the right to interpret non‐response on the part of a country to its own advantage. The Commission agrees with that statement, and it is therefore more appropriate, where we have not had a reaction from a country, to apply a procedure based on express written consent. In this way we can make sure, prior to any shipment, that the destination country is really aware of the implications of the waste import in question. I would appreciate it if this comment could be duly noted. Thus the Commission still prefers the red list procedure, whereby the shipment can proceed after express written consent. This procedure takes account of both the exporter's and importer's interests in a transparent manner. In its common position, the Council has requested application of the procedure under Article 15 of Council Regulation No 259/93, according to which written consent but also a longer time‐limit are required. The Commission thinks that the solution applying the red list procedure strikes the best balance between Parliament's and the Council's proposals and therefore cannot accept Amendment No 2.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are Amendments Nos 3, 5 and 8 dealing with waste which, according to Article 39 of the Fourth Lomé Convention, may not be exported to ACP countries. These are useful proposals, since recital 9 in the preamble is clear enough and yet another annex with yet another list of waste may give rise to confusion. The Commission can therefore support these three amendments. Also, Amendment No 4 is acceptable to the Commission since the wording corresponds to that of Article 17(3) of Council Regulation No 259/93.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission can support a change in the time‐limit for periodic review under Amendment No 6, but cannot agree to consultation of Parliament in this connection, since the Commission considers that the regulation falls within the common commercial policy and that Article 113 forms the only legal basis. The Commission can support Amendment No 7, provided that Commission Regulation No 2048/98 is explicitly mentioned along with Council Regulation No 120/97. The Commission Regulation of 6 November 1998 involves an amendment to Annex V to the Council Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would come back now to the very important question of the shipment of used clothing, which Mrs Jackson had a good deal to say about in her speech and which I myself have raised on a number of occasions. It is quite clear that charitable organisations have been very concerned over how the proposal we are dealing with today might be interpreted. I know that three amendments were presented at the meeting in January of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but they were not followed up for procedural reasons. Certain misunderstandings have arisen in that connection. It is also clear that many representations have been made and there is widespread concern over the matter. It is true, as Mrs Jackson mentioned, that people are afraid that the export of used clothing for recycling will be prevented. I would therefore like to place on record the Commission's view that used clothing, when it is sorted, cleaned and repaired prior to export, cannot be regarded as waste but can be treated as products. Since the proposed regulation only applies to waste items, this regulation will not apply to used clothing and, with the debate that has taken place here today, we should be able to dispel completely the concerns which have been voiced by charitable organisations. I think in fact that it will give them much reassurance.</p>

But I agree with Mrs Jackson to the extent that, because of the many misunderstandings which have arisen, we should at least find some way of ensuring that the charitable organisations know what rules apply. We shall try to find an appropriate way of overcoming this problem.</p>
