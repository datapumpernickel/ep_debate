There were at least 40,000 casualties and we extend our deepest sympathy and the hand of support to Turkey at this tragic time.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has responded to the disaster with some EUR 45 million of emergency humanitarian aid in addition to bilateral aid from a number of our Member States. We must insist on urgent implementation of this Community assistance. The immediate need is for practical material assistance such as prefabricated housing, generators and specialist vehicles and equipment. The release of a further EUR 150 million in European Union aid will require the support of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In due course, given the fact that the European Union is a major contributor of humanitarian relief, it would be most useful for the Commission services and ECHO in particular to explore possibilities for improving the effectiveness of relief organisation in disaster situations. In addition, the Commission’s joint research centre should examine ways in which more effective warning might be given of seismic activity. However, we do not feel there is justification at this stage for the creation of some sort of new European research institute for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, amid the tragedy there is one encouraging sign. What was also buried in Izmit was some of the enmity between Greece and Turkey. Greek rescue teams were among the first to provide assistance in Turkey, a very positive and humane gesture that was reciprocated by Turkey when not long after Athens too fell victim to earthquakes. There have been many, other often low-level, gestures of rapprochement between Greek and Turkish people in recent weeks. Many of us wish to see progress in the resolution of the various issues which stood in the way of Turkey’s candidacy for the European Union. This requires generosity and flexibility on all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of the tragedy of Izmit let us hope for positive and permanent improvements in the relationship between the European Union and Turkey.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an irony of history that the earthquake in Turkey and the earthquake in Greece have brought these two countries closer together at last. I will not say reunited as yet, but certainly brought closer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed a rare coincidence that legal proceedings, whose fairness and rectitude I am not one hundred percent convinced of, and a conviction, of which, for fundamental reasons, I am even less convinced, specifically the death sentence against Mr Öçalan, have led to the development of an opportunity to bring a dreadful civil war in Turkey to an end. Sometimes this is the case in history; tragic events can set positive developments in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, instead of going into details, I would like to basically welcome the fact, firstly, that relations between Greece and Turkey have improved even regardless of the dreadful events, because both Foreign Ministers are prepared to speak to each other. I am very pleased to see that many European countries reacted so positively and made aid available immediately when the dreadful events occurred, and the European Union, furthermore, is considering, as a result, how a new beginning in the relationship between the European Union and Turkey can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent days I have spoken with some Turkish Members of Parliament, who also clearly expressed their desire for this new beginning. There have been a series of changes, new laws in Turkey. So it could be that, because of the awful events and a certain rethinking and reconsideration within Turkey, a new beginning will be possible in the next few months in the relationship between Turkey and the European Union, with the help of Greece. In all these steps together with, and with regard to, Turkey it is important to proceed in partnership with our Member State of Greece. The Foreign Minister, Mr Papandreou, has just established the prerequisites for us to enter into this new partnership with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be a long and laborious path. But for once it could be written in the history books that these terrible disasters in both these countries were the beginning of a new relationship, even a new political relationship, and possibly even a new economic relationship. Personally I shall also strive, as the former rapporteur on Turkish matters in this House, to achieve these new relationships between Turkey and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is an important strategic partner, but Turkey must also know that it must carry out appropriate changes in its law in order to achieve the prerequisites for clearing the obstacles to its free entry into Europe. Entry into Europe is conditional upon legality and respect for human rights. That is the only possibility. With this in mind, my group will attentively follow the latest endeavours of Commission and Council and will consider them positively, but critically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nothing further need be said about the number of victims. We also know that in Turkey in the near future there will be tens of thousands of homeless people who must continue their lives in the earthquake region for years without prospects. In these conditions it is naturally very important to reflect more intensely on how we could more preventatively approach this situation regarding earthquakes and Turkey. It can never be early enough to initiate fundamental thinking on the earthquake and its consequences. There is urgent need for international dialogue on this Turkish disaster to determine the best course for the reconstruction of the country. This dialogue could begin between the European Union and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what Mr Swoboda said just now, but given the situation we currently have in Turkey, i.e. the willingness to use its relationships with European partners, we should first – in today’s motion for a resolution – speak about aid for Turkey in a much more concrete manner, and show our Turkish friends that we are there for them if they need our assistance, and also convey the impression to them that, they will not be seen by us in a sweeping way as adversaries, as was so often the case before the earthquake in Turkey. The proposal of my Group would be that now, in addition to considering how we can best help Turkey in its reconstruction, we must also give additional thought to how we can offer Turkey some prospects for the future. While engaging in these reflections, we should also deal with Turkey much more openly and clearly show that, as far as the prospects of EU accession are concerned, we would be genuinely willing to accept Turkey as the thirteenth applicant country, should Turkey approach us. We will have enough opportunities to take advantage of this in the next three months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must, however, strive to see that out of this trauma comes something of a catharsis, so that civil society is reinforced by its great efforts to cope with the aftermath of the earthquake crisis. The Turkish Government should be made far more accountable to the needs of the citizen, and the forces of reform such as Mr Selçuk, President of the Court of Appeal, and his colleagues must be everywhere stimulated and supported. Such a cathartic effect would certainly allow us in the European Union to formulate a fresh approach to our relations with Turkey and to develop a more positive collaboration in a spirit of true solidarity, and Greece must show itself to be a willing partner in this project.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The catastrophic bible-like scenes in Turkey stretch over some 60,000 square kilometres, almost the size of Belgium and Denmark put together – an expanse which has affected the lives of 15 million people. </p>
<p class="contents">More than 15,000 people lost their lives in the earthquake. Every building within 80 to 90 kilometres of the epicentre of the earthquake is in ruins. According to statistics, this region once produced 30% to 35% of Turkey’s GNP and provided employment for thousands of workers. The purely economic repercussions of the earthquakes are great and it would seem difficult, if not impossible, to expect Turkey to overcome all that without any generous help from outside, without our active support.</p>
<p class="contents">In Greece, the destruction is not so wide-spread but the cost in human lives is grave with 138 dead, 3 seriously injured, and approximately 100,000 left homeless. The material cost is huge and the earthquakes cost both Greece and Turkey dearly. One particular part of this cost, and perhaps the most tragic, concerns the number of human beings who lost their lives, the number of families who were destroyed and the psychological shock suffered by the whole of the regions’ population, who are now filled with dread at the possibility of another earthquake. The people in those regions have had to summon spiritual strength to overcome the individual, family and financial disaster and to start building again from scratch.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, every cloud has a silver lining. The earthquakes seem to have destroyed houses on the one hand and built bridges between Greece and Turkey on the other. The earthquakes laid the unique foundations for co-operation between the two countries. The pain and the disaster have taught us that we can only cope with national disasters through co-operation and peaceful co-existence. George Papandreou and Mr Cem, the Foreign Ministers for Greece and Turkey respectively, finally decided to include the issue of Greek-Turkish co-operation in dealing with natural disasters on the agenda for dialogue between Athens and Ankara. It appears, as the speaker said previously, that every tragedy has a cathartic effect. However, in closing, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return once again to a suggestion which was also put forward by other speakers, that is the need to create a European research centre for the systematic study, research and implementation of new preventative methods for earthquakes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We refer to the resolution which we tabled concerning the need for action on a political, ethical and material level. I would just like, Mr President, to take this moment to inform you that in Athens, for example, there is now great concern and panic amongst the population derived from irresponsible reports circulating around the country of further imminent earthquakes. These are reports from scientific circles both in Greece and in other European countries because, as you know, everybody is following the progress of the earthquakes with great interest. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that if we were to do anything useful and long-standing – and I would like the opinion of the Commissioner on this – then that would have to be the setting up of that wonderful organisation we have been talking about – the one for the study of earthquakes, etc – which, in turn, would have to have a main code of ethics as regards its constitution and when, where, how and to whom information on earthquakes should be publicised. It is one thing to give out information to improve anti-seismic protection, for instance, and another thing to bandy about scientific information, albeit with good intentions, and to terrorise the population. And since this is a cross-border issue, Mr President, and the information is circulating from country to country, I believe that we should have some general, serious and scientific regulation throughout the whole of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will have to check that the aid will be used solely for that purpose and not for others. This, if you will allow me to say so, is the unanimous desire of the Greek people who, in a thousand and one ways, have displayed their moral and material solidarity. However, with those feelings of solidarity towards the Turkish people, we demand that the earthquake disaster is not looked upon as just an excuse to get financial assistance. We ask that this aid be blocked if the Turkish regime does not fulfil its promises to respect human rights, as in the case of Cyprus and the Kurdish issue, or at least show that it has some intentions of taking specific steps. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Greece, as has already been said, the disaster was also great. I myself have visited the region. It has instilled a sense of deep anguish for the future among the population, mainly precipitated by our discovery that profitability tends to have<span class="bold"> </span>transcended safety when it comes to property acquisition. Therefore, it is essential not only for Greece but for other seismogenic countries, to take the necessary measures to put up their anti-seismic guard so as to avert similar tragedies in the future. It is a fact that although governments and individual people cannot be blamed for earthquakes, the responsibility they bear for the extent of the disasters is huge, as has been proved by the earthquakes in Turkey and Greece. </p>
<p class="contents">We believe that there must be direct intervention, that the necessary funds should be taken from the 2nd and 3rd Community Support Framework in order to introduce a specific mechanism such as the one discussed by other speakers for the anti-seismic protection and for the prevention of disasters caused by earthquakes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards immediate action, it could grant generous help at no cost from funds from the unused resources of the legislated expenditure. Such swift granting of aid will save lives, mainly of children and the elderly, and will relieve the plight of the homeless, who are already imperilled by winter approaching. </p>
<p class="contents">The cost of the disasters in Greece is estimated to be at least EUR 600 million. Of course, EUR 100 million can be drawn from appropriations from the second Community Support Framework not expended by Greece. However, there is an urgent need for more long-term measures for tackling the problem at a European level. Reliable European and American seismologists have ascertained that South-Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area, including European countries, have entered into a prolonged period of heightened seismicity. </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, therefore, it is quite right to propose the establishment of an organisation but this organisation should not just restrict its activities to the study of seismic phenomena or to earthquake forecasts which, according to seismologists, is scientifically impossible – something that those colleagues who are proposing an institution for earthquake forecasts should be mindful of. This organisation should also define regulations and specifications for earthquake-proof construction, appropriate building materials, etc., and should also contribute towards providing informed advice to European citizens on any imminent Acts of God and the best ways to deal with them. I note that, aside from Greece and Turkey, other countries under threat include Albania and Italy where, just a few days ago, Mount Etna showed signs of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that we should reincorporate the sadly annulled B4-3400 into the Community budget which provided for urgent aid to disaster victims. There should be a high special reserve fund which will be transferred from year to year. It should not be abolished at the close of the financial year and should not have the low amounts that we witnessed in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I propose that the various public and private voluntary direct action groups for natural disasters within Europe should unite and conform to a uniform European standard. In this way, they can be called upon to intervene immediately in any European country stricken by a natural disaster, working alongside their national counterparts, so that rescue operations consisting all the bodies together can cover a wide expanse and meet all the requirements in as short a time as possible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a European of Turkish origin, I definitely wished to comment on the earthquake in Greece. I believe my Greek friends will understand me if, as a European from Germany, even though of Turkish origin, I say “<span class="italic">silipitiria</span>” (my condolences), and I say this on behalf of all people from Turkey. Indeed, this earthquake in Greece – enough has been said about Turkey – although it resulted in many victims, has achieved much more than hundreds of motions for resolution could. Precisely in this period of peace between Greece and Turkey we have an opportunity, here in the European Parliament, to bring the people of both countries together and to finally purge what they kept trying to teach me, and probably you too, in school in our history books, i.e. that Greece and Turkey supposedly hate each other. That is an outrageous lie! In fact Turkey and Greece have a great deal in common, and for this reason you can perhaps understand if I, a Green Member of Parliament from Germany, have made such an emotional speech. I wanted to express my gratitude to you and, in connection with the earthquake disaster in Greece, to again express my “<span class="italic">silipitiria</span>”.</p>

More than 15,000 people had to perish just because unscrupulous building firms, shamelessly making money out of shoddy construction, are protected by people in politics and administration up to the highest levels of government. Thus the earthquake often affected the poorest of the poor. While desperate people were digging their relatives out of the rubble with their bare hands, the state apparatus showed that it was first and foremost concerned with itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Kurdish province there are 500,000 militiamen and soldiers under arms in a war, which the other side ended long ago. Meanwhile the sight of a soldier in the earthquake area with a shovel in his hand is a rare one. Ankara did not just leave people to their own devices but also confiscated aid funds and hindered the work of foreign NGOs. This culminated in the Grey Wolves, the Nationalist Action Party, demanding of the Health Minister that Turkey should reject Greek blood donations for the victims. We cannot accept such contempt for people without protest. But the fact that both the Greek and the Turkish people decided to offer each other mutual help is a positive sign. And so, after the earthquakes, both the Turkish people helped the Greeks and the Greek people helped the Turks.</p>
<p class="contents">Please do not misunderstand me, but the industrialised nations of the West should not take the moral high ground where Turkey is concerned. They should rather at last admit their share of responsibility for the political and economic situation on the Bosphorus. Only then is the way clear for serious democratic changes in Turkey and for appropriate aid which is actually delivered to the victims. The European Union has spent thousands of Euros to assist the victims in Turkey. I therefore propose that we send a delegation to Turkey and to Greece to check whether the money has been used for the victims, whether the poorest people, the ones who really need the money, have actually received it.</p>

I also join honourable Members in offering the deepest sympathy of the Commission to all who lost friends and loved ones and all who have suffered injury in the terrible disasters in both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that nothing can heal the grief. Practical help can, however, ease some of the misery. The Commission took speedy action to try to assist the Turkish people and its government in their efforts to deal with the catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority, immediately after the earthquakes, was obviously to try to rescue and care for survivors. To this end, and in parallel with the systems provided by Member States and the wider international community, the Commission delivered EUR 4 million for first aid services and equipment through ECHO in two tranches. In addition, following a visit by the Finnish Presidency and Commissioner van den Broek to Turkey on 26 August, a financial package of EUR 30 million is currently being assembled to help with the current emergency and rehabilitation activities.</p>
<p class="contents">To permit swift utilisation of the funds, the EUR 30 million will also be allocated through ECHO. Emphasis will probably be put on temporary dwellings and repair works for essential public infrastructure like schools and hospitals. A more precise picture of needs will result from the joint assessment mission similar to the one that has just been called for, I would presume, that is being undertaken in the disaster areas by ECHO, the Commission’s representation in Ankara, the United Nations and the World Bank acting collectively. In the medium to long-term, reconstruction needs will clearly have to be addressed after comprehensive damage assessment. Meanwhile the Commission envisages the use of the following instruments to support further rehabilitation and reconstruction works.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, from 2000 onwards, Turkey should receive a share which reflects its important reconstruction needs from the MEDA 2 funds. Secondly, as this House will know, there are two regulations before the Council and this Parliament that will underpin the European strategy for Turkey. Those regulations foresee a total of EUR 150 million for Turkey over a three-year period which the Turkish Government regards as being of significant help. This week’s General Affairs Council committed itself to adoption and implementation of the regulations as soon as possible and asks the European Parliament - this is the Council speaking - to take this into account in their consideration. I hope that this House will seek to expedite its consideration of the legislation which has been here since last spring as far as my knowledge extends. I hope, therefore, that the honourable Members directly engaged in that consideration will not further delay their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Investment Bank is asked to make a special effort – we think around EUR 600 million worth of lending - to support reconstruction needs. Plainly that will require an additional allocation from the guarantee budget line.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these developments, the Commission envisages the possibility of acting in coordination with the IMF in granting Turkey macrofinancial assistance geared towards maintaining the reform process under what are evidently difficult conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that these short, medium and longer-term support initiatives will be of sustained help to the people of Turkey and we are sure that people right across the European Union will join us in hoping that the arduous task of restoring communities and morale will be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, and as we have heard from several honourable Members in their statements and speeches in the course of this afternoon, the people of Greece also suffered tragic deaths and damage in recent earthquakes and further tremors. As this Parliament will also recognise, there are no funds on the budget line for emergency aid within the Community. There is, therefore, little that the Commission can do to give material support to the efforts of the Greek people and its government in the short-term. However, together with the Greek Government, the Commission will look into the possibilities of reallocating some of the unused Objective 2 resources for reconstruction support in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent earthquakes, as several honourable Members have commented, were obviously unmitigated tragedies but once again they showed that the human capacity for mercy can be greater than any long-standing divisions. In the international effort for Turkish victims, the Greek Government gave instant support. When the earth trembled in Athens, the Turkish Government was one of the first to send relief workers and equipment. Let us hope that what we have seen graphically demonstrated, indeed movingly in this Chamber this afternoon, and the genuinely humane gestures undertaken by both Greeks and Turks in recent weeks, will lead to the strengthening of relations between the two neighbours and between Turkey and the European Union.</p>

I am sorry that you will have to remain here a little longer, but that was correct according to the official running order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
