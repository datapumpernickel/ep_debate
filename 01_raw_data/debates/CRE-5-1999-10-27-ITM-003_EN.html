I would just like to confirm that the Radical Members present will not be taking part in the vote this time either. This is because, despite the good will of numerous, individual Members – whom I thank – this institution has not found a solution regarding the non-attached Members, a situation which is intolerable from an administrative and financial point of view, but even more so from the point of view of Parliamentary privileges – we have no powers of amendment or resolution. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have been democratically elected just like you and we represent two and a half million European citizens, and yet, during the last part-session, in order to table an amendment we were forced to beg and sell it to another parliamentary group. Frankly, this is intolerable! We are taking this matter to Court and I think that we will win. Mr President, a month has already passed and the rapporteur of the amendment has only just been appointed. We are quite familiar with the slow machinery of this Parliament, where the average time for a report to come from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to this House is twenty-one months. Now, in these coming twenty-one months, we will not be reduced to a button-pressing machine and vote when you allow us to, voting on resolutions which we did not even have the chance of putting to your vote. I hope that many Members will hear the call to uphold Members’ dignity and privileges and support those who have been elected just like you and who, just like you, want to defend Parliament’s dignity. We are against groups and your bureaucracies!</p>

I hope we are not going to have our votes delayed every month by a diatribe about the position of the radicals and other non-attached Members. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has now appointed a rapporteur. If there was a delay in appointing a rapporteur it is because the representative of the radicals at the meeting of the coordinators to agree a rapporteur asked for it to be postponed. It was at their request that it was postponed in the first place. It is the height of hypocrisy to come here and accuse the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of taking its time on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, as regards the tabling of amendments you have exactly the same right as every other Member to table amendments with 32 signatures. If you cannot even get 32 signatures to support a position then it is not worth wasting the time of plenary voting on that position.</p>

<p class="contents">Before I set out the Commission’s position regarding the amendments voted through by Parliament on 16 September, I hope you will allow me to stress that the Commission has tried to examine Parliament’s suggestions in the same spirit that I am sure Parliament made them: how we can best deliver our collective European effort on the ground in Kosovo and in the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to Kosovo tomorrow with Mr Javier Solana to assess for myself how we are doing, so I will have Parliament’s views to support my very clear awareness of the need to get the Agency up and running as soon as possible. That is the best way we can reinforce the excellent efforts made already by Mr Franco and his team.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me set out our position on the amendments seriatim. The Commission can accept the spirit, provided changes can be made in certain cases to the wording of the amendments relating to accompanying measures, participation of local communities in reconstruction, coordination with non-governmental organisations, consultation of Parliament before the Agency extends its activities to other areas of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, of course, budgetary transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">This means Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 9, 15 and the second part of Amendment No 24. Some of the amendments – 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 21, 25 and 26 – relate to issues that are already addressed in the current version of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On the following points, however, we do not feel able to go along with Parliament: merging humanitarian aid and assistance for reconstruction within a single body, separation of Agency revenue from appropriations allocated to programmes, exclusion from the agency’s budget of contributions from other sources, approval of the staffing plan by the budgetary authority and a report on the possible winding up of the agency after 24 months. This covers Amendments Nos 5 and 23, the first part of Amendment No 24 and Amendments Nos 27 and 28.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope there will not be too much difficulty on those points with our position. I realise that the biggest issues for Parliament lie elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, of course, aware of the special importance the European Parliament attaches to two particular questions: the first relates to the establishment of the Agency’s headquarters in Thessaloniki and its operational centre in Priština, the extension of its mandate to the whole of the western Balkans and the bringing of its activity within the framework of the Stability Pact. This is the issue that is covered in Amendments Nos 3 and 18. Our view is essentially this. The Agency’s immediate aim is the reconstruction of Kosovo and thereafter, when conditions permit, of other parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is an instrument of the European Union and must retain its autonomy of action. Its headquarters can only be established in Thessaloniki as long as its operational centre in Priština retains its own autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that a compromise that might take account of Parliament’s wholly understandable concerns could be reached along the following lines. First, the Agency’s headquarters would be established in Thessaloniki and a joint declaration would be drawn up listing the general service departments to be located there. Second, another joint declaration would set out the terms for coordination with the Stability Pact while safeguarding – and I want to underline this – the Agency’s independence. Third, the Commission would undertake to report next year on the possibility of extending the Agency’s activities to other Balkan countries under a new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue which has given rise to a number of amendments is the desire to bring the Agency under the sole and direct responsibility of the Commission which would appoint the director. Independent experts appointed by the Commission would replace the Member States’ representatives on the governing board. The management committee would be replaced by an advisory committee. That covers Amendments Nos 6, 12, 14, 16, 19 and 22.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s view is that the presence of the Member States on the governing board would, on balance, be good for the Agency and would make it easier to coordinate the Community’s and Member States’ reconstruction activities. The Commission would point out that this proposal is based on the standard format used for all the European agencies, though there are admittedly differences with this one. This includes representation of the Member States on the governing board and specific rules on the line of responsibility. The management committee formula is in accordance with the existing rules.</p>
<p class="contents">But I do not want to rest our case there. The Commission believes that a compromise that might take account of Parliament’s principal concerns could be reached along the following lines. First, instead of the governing board having decision-making powers it could have an advisory role on certain issues including the selection and implementation of projects. Second, the Commission could be given the task of appointing the director in line with Parliament’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">So what next? I think it is quite straightforward and I welcome what Prime Minister Lipponen said earlier today in response to a question from the honourable Member. I shall take these proposals to the Council and try to persuade the Council to accept what I believe is a sensible compromise that should, in my judgement, be acceptable to everyone. What we all want, after all, is to get on with an extremely difficult job in Kosovo as competently and as rapidly as possible. We all owe that to our team in Kosovo. We owe that to the people of Kosovo themselves and I certainly do not think we should play politics with such an important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Parliament will feel that we have made every effort to find a compromise solution to this extremely important issue and I hope we will be able to work with the Council in a way in which Parliament would approve.</p>

The previous legislation has been revoked and therefore we must urgently take positions on the amendment procedures of the various regulations we are adopting, especially on some important and delicate matters, that is, whether the opinion of the Commission or the Council should prevail. They have two different points of view, regardless of whether an advisory committee is selected – which we chose – that put more emphasis on the Commission, or a regulatory committee which put more emphasis on the Council. I think that we should have been able to vote on this amendment because, especially in a fairly delicate area like road safety, and therefore the protection of citizens, it could have been very useful. I would, however, like to urge the Commission – I do not know whether Commissioner Liikanen is present, but, in any case, we have already discussed it in the general debate – to move quickly if it is to present a legislative framework covering all the subjects, so that an issue which is very sensitive from an institutional point of view can be addressed in an organised, thorough way.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I have been waiting patiently – or even impatiently – for quite a long time now because I wanted to raise this point before the vote on the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Could you explain why, when we have a very expensive and sophisticated system of electronic voting, we had to go through – and I choose my words carefully – the organised chaos of the previous vote. We have a system here which has three buttons to vote for candidate A or candidate B or abstain; this affords the perfect opportunity for secrecy, and I know we have used it before in similar circumstances. It would be less time-consuming and less expensive surely to have used that rather than go through the procedure we have just gone through. Could you explain why that decision was taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I am on my feet, Madam President, I would like to refer back to earlier this morning when you were in the chair. You will be aware – because I noticed a distinctly presidential frown – that a Member’s mobile phone went off during the speech of, I think it was, the Prime Minister of Finland. This was a gross discourtesy to the Prime Minister of Finland, and I felt the discourtesy was exacerbated by the fact that the Member then proceeded to answer the phone and continue with the conversation. What action can we take to eliminate this in future?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as I am on my feet and I have your ear, can you do anything about the fact that the some of the huissiers at the entrance are smoking on duty. I think it gives an extraordinarily poor impression of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the first point, we thought it best to ask the two candidates which system they preferred. We did ask them whether or not they wanted electronic voting to be used, given that generally, but perhaps even more so in this case, the vote could be a very close run thing, with a margin of only a few votes either way. In any case, as President, I did not want to have any disputes after the fact, with Members of Parliament saying that they had used the equipment incorrectly. This was extremely important to me. If both candidates had agreed to electronic voting, we would have gone ahead with that, but they did not. I can point out that voting using the ballot boxes took exactly, I have been told, twenty minutes. I think that is not excessive, and it will enable a ballot which cannot be challenged.</p>
<p class="contents">On your second point, I think you noticed my frown. I was aware of the telephone call straight away, but it was not something I could do anything about. I did make it clear that this was not good form, and I hope the person in question has taken this point on board.</p>
<p class="contents">On your third point, appropriate action will be taken because, again, this is not appropriate behaviour. These are matters which are unacceptable. So, a comment will be made.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p>

The European group of liberals and democrats always felt that the Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo should be based in Priština and only in Priština and should not, in some way or other, be linked with or part of, or work in tandem with, some other agency in Thessaloniki. We believe that this is the only logical position and it is also the only position that is in the interests of the Kosovars themselves. In view of the fact that the original text from the Commission is very clear in this respect and Mrs Pack’s amendment adding the Thessaloniki aspect is superfluous, our group has opted to vote against the report.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do want to make clear is that our group does support this Parliament’s position when it comes to improving the efficiency of the agency’s management and the procedures, and of course when it comes to making the agency subject to OLAF’s supervision; indeed how could it be otherwise for I penned these amendments myself. Consequently, we are particularly pleased that the Commission is to adopt many of these amendments. The specific answers that Mr Patten has just given this Parliament are, however, in stark contrast with the overwhelming silence on the part of the Council. The Council has systematically refused to enter into constructive dialogue with this Parliament about the content of the report. We consider this attitude unacceptable and, as far as that is concerned, we are particularly keen to support the position adopted by Mrs Pack, who endeavoured to delay this report up until the very last moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to clearly point out – sadly the Council is not present – that Parliament will, of course, have the last word on this matter under the terms of Budget 2000. To sum up, Madam President, as a group we were faced with what was in fact a difficult dilemma in that we had to decide whether to vote for a report that went some of the way towards accommodating our concerns but not on that one essential point, namely Priština. That is why we opted for clarity and consistency at the end of the day and voted against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In approving this amendment we are opening the door to resuming discussions with the Council on the future statute for the Members of the European Parliament, in the hope that this statute will at last be brought in with all possible speed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, this vote in no way signifies approbation of the resolution of 5 May 1999 on the Statute for Members. I still believe that with this draft statute the majority of the Members of Parliament failed to give the voters a clear signal that they want to renounce the excessive privileges and remuneration entitlements. That is why, on 5 May last, I voted against the aforementioned resolution together with my socialist party colleagues in the PSE group of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The SP will also continue to be a zealous advocate in the new European Parliament of a fair and just statute with a transparent remuneration system on the basis of costs incurred, and is therefore also able to identify with the proposals that the Council has drawn up on this matter. The socialist party believes that this statute should be approved as quickly as possible. It must form the basis for far-reaching reforms within the European Parliament so that our institution too is in a position to win back the trust of the citizens of the European Union.

<p class="contents">This is what the directive we are discussing today proposes. At the time of the first reading, the European Parliament proposed several amendments. We were pleased to note that many of them were adopted in the common position. This must also apply to the amendments proposed today.</p>

An important recommendation has been made on an organisation to promote global electronic commerce, Global Information Infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, as we develop a European frame of reference for electronic signatures, the European Union must also constantly work on the international level, so that the legal framework of the system can be strengthened. It would be to the European Union’s benefit to establish an international organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of cooperation must not, however, lead to an increase in regulation. Systems of protection must be allowed to develop freely and become as effective as possible with the help of market forces, and they must at the same time ensure that the confidence of consumers in the opportunities presented by electronic signatures remains firm.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This latest EU initiative, complementing others at the national level, will help create the right regulatory framework enabling European businesses to be at the cutting edge in developing electronic commercial services. In short, this e-commerce initiative makes A grade business sense.</p>
<p class="contents">British business is already at the forefront in realising the potential of e-commerce in Europe. More than 13 million people now have Internet access in Britain and revenue from e-commerce is expected to top GBP 10 billion next year. The Labour Government is likewise at the forefront in creating the right environment for e-commerce to thrive. We are introducing a bill, hailed as a model across Europe, to modernise contract law to take account of e-commerce. We are improving educational standards, encouraging life-long learning and striving to ensure that our schools are on-line. Indeed, by 2002 we will have connected every school in Britain to the Internet. We will also be opening a network of IT learning centres, or ‘e-libr@ries’, right across the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The great towns and cities of my own region, the North West of England, were built on the back of an earlier great economic revolution, the Industrial Revolution. What iron was to the 19th century, information technology will be to the 21st. And, just as the railways were the communications network that drove the Industrial Revolution, so the Internet will drive the new Knowledge Revolution. I want the north-west to regain its position at the forefront of technological progress. Through such far-sighted yet practical policies, I believe we can release the natural industriousness and imagination of the people of the north-west and once more turn the region into a powerhouse of economic prosperity for Britain, Europe and the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, like the economists of the Association for the Monetary Independence of France (<span class="italic">Association pour l'indépendance monétaire de la France</span>), I think that this is not a desirable objective, and that on 1 January 2002 it will be necessary to retain national currencies alongside the euro which will serve as a common currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European Parliament resolution discusses at length the technical measures to improve the transparency of the ECB. This is an apparently laudable objective, but one that is impossible to achieve. The European Parliament has indeed just proved this by getting into an imbroglio which it has not been able to get out of. Actually, the initial text of the resolution required that the way that the various members of the Governing Council had voted should be made public following each decision on monetary policy. Mr Duisenberg, the president of the ECB, asserted that he did not agree with this idea, for all sorts of reasons, each one worse than the last. In particular, he stated that making voting public would be an incentive to exert undue pressure on the members of the Governing Council. Professor Buiter, a member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, rightly replied that if the votes were to remain secret then this pressure would be applied in secret, and that would be even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs eventually withdrew the relevant section of the draft resolution so as not to get into trouble with Mr Duisenberg, and the European Parliament has just backed up this withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter is more serious than it first appears. In the first place, it demonstrates the timidity, nay subservience, of the European Parliament in its supervisory capacity. In the second place, it must be recalled that open voting is accepted in all great central banks throughout the world, particularly in the United States and Japan. Why should the European Central Bank be the exception to the rule? Why should it play the card of less transparency? The answer is simple. The central banks which I have just mentioned all work within a single nation, while the European Central Bank works with several different nations and several different peoples. By virtue of these differing circumstances, it is far more afraid than the other banks that particular Member States may exploit its internal conflicts. And to stave off this danger, it is forced to be that much less transparent. So, it’s all connected. Because it has jurisdiction over an area that is too diverse, the European Central Bank must distance itself even further from social reality. In so doing, in the short term it may calm things down on this or that vote, but in the long term it is ultimately condemning itself by cutting itself off from the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Understandably, in these conditions, I cannot give my approval to either the European Parliament resolution or the annual report of the ECB for 1998. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the reason why I cannot but approve the action of the rapporteur in deploring the lack of transparency in the ECB. Some progress has certainly been achieved, but this falls a long way short in comparison to the information made available by other central banks. Considering its high degree of autonomy, it is essential for the ECB to ensure a high level of transparency regarding decision-making on monetary policy. This would provide a guarantee of its credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it deplorable, for example, that Mr Duisenberg is opposed to the publication of detailed minutes of meetings, even though this is common practice in many central banks.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs requesting that brief reports of the meetings of the Governing Council should be made available to the EP, outlining the arguments “for” or “against” the decisions taken and the reasons for these decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it essential, furthermore, that, in order to promote effective collaboration between the ECB and the EP, the ECB President should be willing to brief Parliament regarding any significant decision on monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also insist on one requirement which the EP expressed with regard to the ECB. The Bank must endeavour to consider monetary policy in terms of sustainable growth and employment. The objective of price stability is not an end in itself; monetary policy must contribute to growth and the creation of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am taking advantage of this opportunity to express my views on the ECB to mention a problem which I feel strongly about, and which I have had to denounce on several occasions, the bank charges which some banks add to euro transactions. These problems are far from being resolved and they are still affecting European citizens within the euro area. An initiative must be taken as quickly as possible to put an end to these practices which have been denounced on many occasions by the European Parliament and the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By taking the fulfilment of the Stability Pact and of the respective criteria for nominal convergence as a basis, and making price stability the main priority, the ECB’s monetary guidelines come to be crucial for national and European policies in a huge variety of economic and social areas, including in the Financial Perspective of the European Union and of the Member States. </p>

He has earned our praise for the successful establishment of the ECB and the smooth introduction of the euro. To MEPs such as myself, the ECB’s annual and monthly publications have proved to be invaluable and of a consistently high standard.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret, however, that the ECB does not follow the high standards of transparency and openness set by the Bank of England. The Bank of England was granted operational independence in May 1997 in one of the first acts of the incoming Labour Government. Minutes of meetings of its Monetary Policy Committee, including voting records and reasoning, are now published after about six weeks. This boosts market confidence in its decisions and is a great example of open government.</p>
<p class="contents">It can surely be no coincidence that, since the Labour Government’s brave decision in May 1997, Britain has enjoyed a previously unknown period of economic stability and been praised by the OECD. It can also be no coincidence that the Labour Government’s decision was criticised at the time by the boom-and-bust Conservatives, who have a record second to none when it comes to economic instability and incompetence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the ECB follow a policy of openness and transparency similar to the Bank of England. Such openness should include the publication of minutes of its Governing Council with the reasoning behind decisions taken, particularly over interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be perverse for Britain to go from a position of transparency to one of relative secrecy. Therefore, if Britain is ever going to embrace the euro, the ECB must also embrace greater openness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More generally however, particularly when it dealt with the subject of immigration, the Council became bogged down in two contradictions which indeed both suggest either its lack of political courage or the mutual paralysis of its members, it is not very clear which.</p>
<p class="contents">The first contradiction: whereas, in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the means were proudly established to make immigration matters totally Community-controlled, the Tampere Council suddenly becomes more cautious. It is as if the heads of state and government, who are always willing, in treaties, to sign up to great European principles that do not commit you to anything, were suddenly appalled at the practical consequences of this new text. The difference in tone is so marked that it is hard to believe that these same people signed both the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions with an interval of six months. The contradiction becomes frankly laughable in the case of the French Government which, in the Amsterdam Treaty, signed in favour of the financial and physical distribution of refugees among the states of the Union, and which now recoils at the consequences of its own signature.</p>
<p class="contents">The second contradiction: the Tampere Council propounds its purely formal intention to control the flows of migrants and to combat illegal immigration at source, but, at the same time, staunchly proclaims, on several occasions, that legal immigrants must be given, I quote, “a set of uniform rights which are as near as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens”, and that as a priority a policy of integration must be set up to enable them to stay.</p>
<p class="contents">This is absurd. Obviously, the more rights you give legal immigrants, the more immigrants you are going to attract, including illegal immigrants hoping that their situation will one day be regularised. How much more time will it take for the Council and the Commission to see, in this matter too, the catastrophic practical consequences of the principles they publicly maintain? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, this, and taking into account the importance of the area of public freedoms, justice and security, demands that the Council’s unanimous decision-making procedure be assured, with respect to the sovereignty of Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">This Area, which has come to the fore in line with progress in dismantling the EU’s so-called “internal borders” and with the strengthening of its “external borders”, must not transform the EU into a fortress. </p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the concern to establish principles relating to respect for rights, freedoms and guarantees in this particularly sensitive area, and that measures leading to cooperation are necessary, for example in the fight against organised crime and money-laundering, the traffic in drugs and weapons and the trade in human beings, it is worth highlighting the fact that we will have to be particularly attentive to the coherence and the implications of the policies and measures that are actually adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The confirmation of the Geneva Refugee Convention “in its full and wide interpretation” is an important victory for the Greens and many non-governmental organisations. I regret, however, that for most asylum-seekers, the only way to get into the Union is still an illegal one. The new approach towards combating illegal immigration in the countries of origin bears a risk, since the cooperation could lead to a sort of repression. The Union must tackle the problem at its roots to truly improve human rights and economic conditions of people living in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group welcomes the increased efforts to fight money-laundering and trafficking of human beings. But we insist that increased powers for Europol must be accompanied by equally increased democratic safeguards at Union level to ensure respect for civil rights. This includes control by the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens think that the status of third-country nationals needs to be further improved beyond the Tampere proposals. Fair treatment includes not just the right of access to social services or education, but also the right to vote and free movement in the EU. The Charter of Fundamental Rights must include new and binding rights for EU citizens if it is not to become a mere political declaration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is probably because the agreements reached make such common sense and are of such obvious benefit to ordinary Britons that not even the extremist Europhobic Tories could find anything to complain and make a fuss about.</p>
<p class="contents">EU Governments agreed to create a common area of justice to tackle the common problem of organised crime, especially drug smuggling and human trafficking. There will now be greater cross-border police cooperation, including – at Britain’s suggestion – a new Police Chiefs’ Task Force and a European police college. There will also be greater cross-border judicial cooperation, including mutual recognition of court decisions in all EU countries. Fast track extradition will be introduced, which may even help bring ex-dictators to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, measures were agreed at Tampere to make it easier for ordinary people to travel, live and work across Europe. Long-term British residents from non-EU countries, from the Commonwealth for example, will now receive guaranteed equal access to education, health care and other benefits on the Continent. Furthermore, Britons facing legal difficulties abroad will now have easier access to justice, including access to legal aid and translation services and simplified procedures governing compensation and debt claims.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other measures, Governments also agreed common rules on providing refuge to those in need of political asylum and to draw up a Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Charter will, for the first time, set out all the fundamental rights enjoyed by EU citizens on one piece of paper. A milestone instrument, it will complement the European Convention on Human Rights now being incorporated by the Labour Government into UK law.</p>
<p class="contents">With all these measures, I will no longer be stuck for advice when constituents, facing legal problems abroad, call me asking for help. Britons will now have the same statutory rights on the Continent as all other EU citizens. For so long relegated to second class under the Tories, Britons are now first class citizens under Labour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
