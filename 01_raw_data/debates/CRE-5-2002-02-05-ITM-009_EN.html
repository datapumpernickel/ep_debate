<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, it is my pleasure to make this – albeit brief – presentation of the draft motor vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, which the Commission adopted this morning. Parliament is aware of the relatively severe practical limitations of the current Block Exemption Regulation, which is due to expire next September. It is not sufficiently beneficial for consumers, particularly where they wish to exercise their right to a single market. Moreover, the rules currently in force hinder the development of new methods, including Internet distribution; lastly, access to technical information for independent repairers needs to be improved too. We have therefore put together this Block Exemption Regulation, which the Commission has adopted today, and I would like briefly to outline its main points.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic line underpinning the regulation is that the new system must be more stringent than the existing regulations and must allow greater competition on the sales and after-sales markets. What are the main characteristics? Firstly, as regards the sale of new vehicles, flexibility and freedom to choose are the draft’s key points. When they select their distributors, vehicle manufacturers can choose between a selective distribution system and a distribution based on territorial exclusivity, but they can no longer combine the two systems. Both systems allow a vehicle manufacturer to guarantee that the members of its distribution network are qualified and that its distribution network covers all the areas of Europe, thus ensuring total coverage of the territory.</p>
<p class="contents">In both cases, the rights linked to the single market will be much, much better safeguarded than at present. In an exclusive distribution system, distributors will be assigned to a specific geographical area such as a city, within which no other distributor will be permitted to open a showroom or carry out sales activities. An exclusive dealership<span class="bold"> </span>may, however, sell to any potential buyer that approaches its showroom. This also applies to independent resellers, to those known as grey resellers. These resellers could be supermarkets, for example, and they would exploit the price differentials to buy vehicles in countries where the prices are lower and then sell them in Member States where prices are higher, thus helping to create a genuine single market.</p>
<p class="contents">If, on the other hand, manufacturers opt for selective distribution, the distributors can advertise and send out customised mail shots and e-mails to consumers throughout Europe, even visiting them in person. Consumers could, however, still encounter difficulties in dealing with a dealership from another Member State, particularly as regards simple, direct contact with the foreign dealership, payment of invoices and agreements regarding the delivery of the vehicle. We therefore deemed it necessary to adopt a more radical approach in order to bring about greater integration of the markets, making it genuinely possible for consumers to buy vehicles abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">A vehicle distributor must be able to open sales or delivery outlets closer to consumers’ places of residence, including in other Member States. On a practical level, this means, for example, that an Amsterdam <span class="italic">Volkswagen</span> dealer could open a showroom in the United Kingdom and sell <span class="italic">Volkswagen Golfs</span> there at the Dutch retail price, which is 23% lower than the British price. This, of course, would create the necessary market conditions for reducing the currently considerable price differentials of motor vehicles in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Then consumers are demanding multi-brand dealerships. The draft regulation makes multi-brand selling much more simple. The only permissible constraint is that the different brand models are displayed in different areas of a showroom so as to avoid confusion between brands. This display method is already used in car showrooms<span class="bold"> </span>and has proved<span class="bold"> </span>universally<span class="bold"> </span>satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the draft regulation seeks to reorganise the existing relationship between sales and after-sales services, allowing specialisation. Distributors will be able to opt to provide after-sales services themselves, as dealerships currently do, or they will be able to subcontract to one or more authorised repairers. These repairers must observe all the quality requirements set by the vehicle manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, block exemption makes intermediaries’ work much easier: one example is that of <span class="italic">Virgin Cars</span>, which buys vehicles on behalf of consumers and will now be able to find the best deal for consumers more easily.</p>
<p class="contents">All these factors give distributors more room for manoeuvre to organise their activities on the basis of market conditions, exploiting new sales opportunities and thus consolidating their independence from manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">Another way to reduce dealers’ dependence on manufacturers is by laying down the obligation for manufacturers to give sufficient grounds for deciding to cancel distribution contracts. If the distributor does not agree with the grounds given, it can have recourse to a mediator or a court. Moreover, the Commission has decreed, through this draft regulation, that a reasonable period of notice must be given before the cancellation of a contract, in most cases two years.</p>
<p class="contents">All these measures ensure that distributors can make full use of the new opportunities offered to them by this draft regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say a few words on after-sales services, which are also extremely important. The new draft regulation seeks to ensure that consumers have a genuine choice and that they can have recourse to both authorised repairers and independent operators. In the interests of the safety and reliability of all vehicles – we have placed great emphasis on this objective – we have to ensure that all operators can compete with each other in all sectors without this affecting the quality of the service provided, which must continue to be of the highest level.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation allows all vehicle manufacturers to set quality requirements which must be respected by all repairers who wish to be authorised repairers. Manufacturers can therefore guarantee that the members of their network comply with high quality standards. This avoids foreclosure of these markets as new operators could now be designated authorised repairers, provided, of course, that they are prepared to observe the requirements set by the vehicle manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also lays down the benefit for dealerships whose contract has come to an end of being able to continue to operate as official dealerships of their brand for as long as they satisfy the quality requirements. The general level of technical skill on the market is thus increased and a substantial Europe-wide network of official repairers is maintained. This will help to bring higher quality of service and greater road safety. Moreover, we can expect the proposal to have a positive impact on employment and small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal seeks to make it easier for independent operators on the after-sales market to compete. In view of the increasing complexity of motor vehicles, it is important for independent repairers to have better access to all the necessary technical information, including diagnosis devices, equipment and training. Any discrimination between official repairers which are part of the network and independent repairers is therefore unacceptable. The proposed changes also encourage the use of spare parts which are cheaper but of equivalent quality, making repair work less costly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by focusing on the procedure. The next stage in the procedure is consultation with the European Parliament and the Member States and the publication of the draft regulation in the Official Journal. This will allow the Commission to receive comments from all the interested parties before adopting the final regulation. The whole process should be concluded before next summer.</p>
<p class="contents">I am especially looking forward to giving a more detailed presentation of the draft regulation to the Parliamentary Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 19 February and to continuing the fruitful dialogue already underway between the Commission and Members of Parliament, particularly Mr Konrad, who is your rapporteur for the subject, and the Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have addressed a complex subject: a subject which is also extremely important, practical in nature and has wider significance. If we want the European citizens genuinely to identify with European integration, we cannot afford to let such a key element of the single market as that in motor vehicles to continue not to be a single market, for it would be unfair to the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We very much welcome the fact that this proposal's first outing has brought you to Strasbourg, and this is much appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">As became clear during discussions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I welcome many points of this proposal, including those on the sale of more than one make of car, original spare parts, access to technical information, and liberalisation as regards the separation of service and sales, but I have a query about how freedom of establishment within the internal market is to be regulated. We in Germany have a regulation entitled the Group Exemption Regulation, which states that a regulatory framework should continue to exist, subject to a time limit. That is something I welcome. The content, though, amounts to liberalisation if all it says is that individual dealers may be restricted at national level but entitled to set up as many subsidiaries as they like within the EU internal market. This modifies these rules and makes a nonsense of them. It will create problems for us and we must discuss this. Such is my first important question in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would have been very helpful if we could have had the text in advance, but I understand and hope it will be available very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise two points with him. What concerns British consumers – and much of it is addressed in his proposal – is clearly the question of price. Does the Commissioner see a role for putting price bans and price guarantees in the regulation so it is reviewed after a certain period to ensure that prices are converging? That would give a clear signal about the direction he wants to go.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns freedom of dealers and their ability to invest. He has moved substantially in the right direction but I am concerned, in the example he gave, about the ability of a dealer to Holland to go and invest and set up a dealership in the UK. How is that going to protect dealers who already have a substantial investment? Would it not be much better for them to be able to go and buy cars in Holland and sell them to consumers there, rather than have what could be a random solution which would actually dissipate the impact of the dealers' independence that he wants to give them? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What seems to me links the first two speeches is a concern that indeed would be there if a location clause could exist. One distinctive feature of today's Commission decision on the draft regulation is that the location clause is not there at any percentage level. This should go a long way towards alleviating those concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards making sure that prices converge, this is one of the objectives of the overall proposal. As you know, we keep regular track of the convergence or non-convergence of prices. We produce a report twice a year on the price of different models in the different Member States. That will be a powerful means of gauging the consequences, among other things, of this new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have resisted the temptation to become price regulators and to link specific competition arrangements for distribution to the size of the price differentials. It is not for us to say that this price differential is acceptable, but that this plus one is not. We are working on the roots of the phenomena, so that price convergence should develop.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Anglo-Dutch example, my answer briefly is that both modalities would be allowed, namely the setting up of dealers' outlets in the other countries and unrestricted trade without changing the location of the dealers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On competition proper, why not be even more liberal and refrain from applying sector-specific rules? Well, we have looked into this and a detailed analysis has brought us to the following conclusion. If we did not have specific rules for this industry competition-wise, the industry would fall under the application of the block-exemption regulation on vertical restrictions. That would have two main drawbacks. It would allow the industry to use very similar distribution agreements to those permitted at present, on which our evaluation report was pretty negative. Also applying the general regime would not be a satisfactory means of improving competition on the after-sales market. Independent repairers could be foreclosed from the market as a result. This is clearly something which could not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, all motor vehicles would most likely continue to be distributed through the same type of selective and exclusive distribution systems if no new regulatory regime was introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, the general regime does not offer provisions which are crucial in the car sector to ensure benefits for the consumer. This is the case with the so-called availability clause, which allows, for instance, a British consumer to buy a right-hand-drive car in a left-hand-drive country.</p>
<p class="contents">So, although we are in principle against sector-specific rules, as you have seen with the telecom package with my colleague, Mr Liikanen, we have moved some way towards the adoption of general competition rules. But here the particular nature of the situation has led us to firmly believe that a sector-specific rule would be more appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">As for supermarkets, for example, I can only say that, during the lengthy consultation process undertaken by the Commission, no supermarket or association speaking on its behalf directly expressed a desire to sell cars on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it would not be true to suggest that the draft regulation adopted today gives no business opportunities to supermarkets. A supermarket could become a mono- or multi-brand sales dealer if it satisfied the criteria laid down by the manufacturer. Similarly, it may act as an intermediary for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the two issues which do not relate to competition but have a bearing on prices, tax and the euro, I will not go beyond the answer I gave on the issue of the UK, cars and the euro. As for taxation, the honourable Member underlined that this is a national responsibility and it is tempting, but perhaps not entirely consistent, to argue that this is to be jealously guarded as a national prerogative and yet ask the Commissioner to lobby actively for harmonisation. I will, however, pass this message on to my colleague, Mr Bolkestein. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to make some comments. You have given the example of the distributor in Amsterdam who could open a branch in London. Let us bear in mind that distributors are dependent – as always, but even more in this case, given the quantity of the investments to be made – on manufacturers, and that contracts do not extend for very long periods. It is true that, in the event of a resolution, they could go to tribunals, but I believe that, in the majority of EU countries – at least, Commissioner, in yours and in mine – the indefinite extension of cases would lead to the bankruptcy of distributors.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, given that selective distribution is allowed, I would ask you whether, in order to achieve equality of prices between the different countries, it would not be more sensible, for example, to restrict this prohibition of the selective vendor selling exclusively to the final consumer or to other members of the network. That would favour parallel importers who would contribute to lowering prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is one of the reasons why we decided to introduce sector specific rules rather than fall back on the general regulatory framework for vertical restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress the following, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in our view improves and does not undermine the safe and reliable servicing of cars. It does not make it more difficult for car manufacturers to fulfil their obligations. The repairer to whom a dealer may subcontract the service if he or she so wishes must be entrusted by the manufacturer with the task of providing the services which dealers provide today. To put it bluntly, the only difference between an official dealer who provides after-sales services today and an official repairer in the proposed regime tomorrow is that the latter may not have a showroom from which to sell cars. Technical expertise, training, tooling, and service standards will remain those decided by the manufacturer and applied throughout its network. In these circumstances manufacturers are indeed in a position to comply with their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Naranjo Escobar asked whether there will be undesired consequences and whether it would not be advisable to have a transitional period while keeping the location clause for the time being. The time frame is already sufficiently structured because, after consultation, the final Commission regulation will be adopted before the summer of this year. It will probably contain a clause saying that it will be fully effective from October 2003 and we have taken into account also the situation of the existing dealers by introducing in the draft regulation an explicit notice for the termination of the contract. At any rate it is clear that what we have adopted today is a very deeply thought through and structured draft regulation but there is still to be further consultation and if we see important and persuasive arguments coming up in the consultation of course we will take them very seriously into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Berenguer Fuster, the Commission allows selective systems for many products in line with the policy it applies: the draft regulation neither imposes a particular distribution format nor prescribes in detail how agreements should be drafted. It recognises that other vertical restraints agreed between the parties may trigger economic efficiencies which lead to optimal investment levels by manufacturers, official networks and independent repairers.</p>
<p class="contents">If I can conclude with a slightly more general point, with this proposal we do two things. On the one hand we bring the forces of competition more vigorously into play. There is an injection of additional competition. On the other hand we free up the choice of modalities by means of fewer rigidities and more flexibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How, too, are we to ensure actual adherence to working standards and norms? Is it envisaged that there will be some sort of third-party certification, with neutral third parties checking that the standards have actually been kept to? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has a role to play in this. I would remind you that the Commission's position for the Nice IGC was that there should be a shift to qualified-majority voting in those areas of taxation which are crucial for the functioning of the single market. I would not expect Member States to top up with higher taxes. They would face constraints in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the new system bring about legal uncertainty for dealers? I believe not – on the contrary. We are also confident of avoiding the sometimes-feared economic consequences for dealers and employment. The draft regulation offers former dealers the opportunity to become official repayers within the manufacturers' network and to locate where they wish. At any rate we already know that, this draft regulation aside, several manufacturers are planning to restructure and reduce the number of official network dealers in their systems.</p>
