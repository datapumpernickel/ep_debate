Day after day, over the last few weeks, we have seen pictures of the dreadful famine in Ethiopia all over the media. While we all sit at home, replete after a good supper, our TV screens show us depressing new evidence of the sufferings of a people plagued by drought and hunger. This afternoon, in response to precisely that situation, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the famine in Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, one of the most important political institutions in the European Union, has a duty to take a stance on the matter and it is important that we do not remain silent in the face of such disasters but offer political, moral and financial support, given also that the EU is one of the biggest donor countries. The international Food Aid Convention we are discussing in plenary today could not take place against a more topical background, and its importance and necessity could not be demonstrated more clearly. The objective of this international convention is to contribute towards world food security, but also to make it possible to respond to acute food crises with different food requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">By and large, I welcome the new convention for I believe it incorporates some very good ideas and covers a wider range of products. But let me add a few general comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must at all events continue to provide food for emergencies such as drought and other climatic disasters. Here we need to ensure it is delivered rapidly and minus the bureaucracy, because aid can only save lives if it reaches the suffering people rapidly and in time. A binding strategy for closer coordination between the donor countries will help ensure that the aid really is effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should set a long-term objective in our food policy, which is to create food security in every part of the world, so that the supply of food aid can be confined to emergencies. Food aid consignments should gradually be replaced by measures to improve food security in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is extremely important in food policy to take account of the repercussions on local food production and markets. These repercussions must be monitored and, as I said, local production must not be jeopardised, for I believe that would be counterproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Commission has been asked to evaluate food aid to ensure that it is fully consistent with other development cooperation sectors and their principles. Naturally, the findings will have to be incorporated in our future activities, otherwise the evaluation would presumably be pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that we must be extremely careful to ensure that the aid actually reaches the target groups who are genuinely in need. In this connection, I am particularly keen to see women involved in the planning and execution of the programmes, for I think that would be a good step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to mention another point, namely the problem of food aid on the basis of credit. I welcome the restrictions in the new convention, for our long-term aim must be to abolish the credit system completely. Instead, we should increase still further the share of food aid in the form of grants. In that context, let me also say that I fully and wholeheartedly support the amendment Mr Fiori tabled for the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish, a word about the forthcoming WTO talks. Let me express my very serious reservations about linking the liberalisation of world trade to food aid provision, for that would be at the cost of the starving people, which can be in nobody’s interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, it is an outstanding example of how topical and necessary food aid is, even today. As such, we can hardly deny this Food Aid Convention review our approval. But we will not only lend our approval for the sake of international solidarity to relieve famine, but because this review encompasses a number of improvements compared to previous versions. After all, the nature and way in which food aid is being granted within the framework of this Convention to this day, has been, and is being, heavily criticised, and rightly so. </p>
<p class="contents">Under the terms of the Convention, cereal surpluses from Europe and the United States can be converted into cash and removed from our market. In this way, local food production is often thrown off balance and deeply discouraged. The Convention is used as a lubricant for commercial transactions and often clashes with social and cultural traditions. For example, our rapporteur already mentioned the important role of women in the supply of food. Big bucks are often made on the back of the poor by making huge charges for transport and operational services. The European Union has codes of conduct which deviate from this and which it tries to apply to its own aid. These rules are now also incorporated in this international food aid agreement. The Convention has changed significantly for the better, in our view, due to the fact that not only cereals, but also other products, including local products, fish and vegetables, can qualify, transport and operational costs must be proportionate to the value and the least developed countries, in particular, will be able to apply for this aid. In my view, the intention to promote local agricultural development is vital. Despite this, there is still a blemish on the new Convention. The European negotiators have succeeded in cutting mixed aid in the form of loans down to 20%. But the United States remain determined to use this type of aid, which permanently saddles the most needy countries with a debt burden, even if this is at a reduced interest rate and if it does not have to be paid off for another 30 years. But what is 30 years in the life of a nation? </p>
<p class="contents">We fully endorse the agreements which should prevent a great deal of malpractice, by detaching aid from commercial transactions, for example, and by warning against disrupting the local markets. This can happen very easily, both in buying products and selling food aid within the local market, because speculations and price rises are just round the corner. The example of Ethiopia illustrates that not only the purchase but also that the transport, distribution and preservation must be monitored very carefully and, Mr President, given that we were in Ethiopia, the orders had been placed, there were plenty of foodstocks, yet none of it was there at the right place or time of the famine, I do wonder whether we should not fine-tune our instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission proposal comes in for some criticism from the Budgets Committee in that there is no complete financial statement. I have to say, with the fluid nature of food aid it must be extremely difficult to project accurate financial figures. Now that the scope of aid has been widened, quite rightly in my opinion, from just cereals, this would be even more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased to read in the new Convention that least-developed countries and low-income countries will be given priority when food aid is being allocated. I am also pleased to see stronger provisions for promoting local agricultural development and local purchases as this also assists local economies and encourages local agriculture. There are now many areas of sub-Saharan Africa where, unless there is a dramatic climate change for the better, it is unlikely that food will ever grow again. I am thinking particularly of areas where the desert is literally burying the productive land. We are now seeing in Ethiopia an even more desperate situation, where food aid is being provided but there is no water to cook with. This is an issue that will have to be addressed in the future. Water will become more valuable than oil in future in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also good news that the new Convention covers transport costs and associated operational costs. Even if again this comes in for criticism from the Budgets Committee, it is not much good delivering food aid to a country’s ports if you cannot then distribute it to the remote areas by truck or by air to the people starving and in need.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that past programmes have had a beneficial effect where they can be carried out and the fact that sub-Saharan Africa has a steady and worryingly increasing problem probably reflects the instability in many of these countries caused by war. This has increased the number of refugees dramatically and worsened the problem of providing food aid. The continuous need for an international, legally binding framework which defines and provides the commitments and instruments for the delivery of food aid to the developing countries is obvious. The extension of the Convention and the new rules that have been introduced must therefore be warmly welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Clearly from the comments that we have heard already, the global institutional arrangements intended to underpin food security, as recent experiences testify very clearly, need serious attention. There is actually a loss of confidence in all forms of food aid except for emergency food aid. Internationally negotiated commitments to tackle issues of food security problems are not, in my view, properly understood. There is still an institutional resistance to radical reform of food aid policies. This is summed up by the kind of tinkering on the edges which characterises the re-negotiated Convention. The institutional Treaty-based arrangements for food aid are, in my view, still somewhat outdated and created with a world in mind where food aid was assumed to be a major feature of development and of humanitarian assistance and relief.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments have already been made here this evening for compensatory financing, for aid to agricultural development, for export credits and for local sourcing; all of these criteria, all of these priorities are very well understood. Something people have not mentioned is that the European Union has actually gone further towards translating the understanding of these issues into action than any of the other donors, particularly for instance the United States. We welcome the fact that in our food aid budget line we target food security issues and that budget provides financial assistance for food security. That is very important indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the challenge is to meet the needs of the hungry in the most locally sensitive way. We need to see foodstock plans based on knowledge and transparency. We need to have the knowledge of where the foodstocks are, we need to assess where they are and we need to access those foodstuffs when we have identified them. We also need to monitor all foodstocks that are held in the world, both public foodstocks and private foodstocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the context of the WTO debates, we also need to see a guarantee of the legal right of all human beings to access to food. This will mean, and many of us said this in Seattle in the debates, that we would require <span class="italic">inter alia</span> a food security clause in any future WTO agreements on agriculture. This would represent very real progress in the attempts that we make to tackle food security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Needless to say, structural food aid will continue to be necessary as long as we have so many seriously undernourished people. The aim of this prevention exercise is to secure the developing countries’ own foodstocks and to phase out dependence on donor aid. In other words, the intention is not to help Europe get rid of its agricultural surpluses or to promote rich countries’ exports by means of soft loans. Excess production within European agriculture must be drastically reformed in order to re-adjust the market, the world’s poorest regions should not be used as a dumping ground for products of stubborn European mismanagement, and our efforts to stimulate exports should not be aimed at the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world. The Fiori amendment is preoccupied with Europe’s own interests and is therefore wide of the mark. In fact, it promotes exactly the opposite of what is really needed, namely a strategy which leads to self-sufficiency. This means that the focus should be on stimulating local production. If this does not happen, our aid will have the opposite effect. The local producers will then be pushed out of the way from the outset by free or cheap products and the affected countries will remain dependent on the ‘oh so generous’ donors.</p>
<p class="contents">Another implication of a correct strategy is that soft loans would not be linked to compulsory purchases in the donor country. Moreover, the permitted 20% credit is not really of any benefit because it can lead to unfair competition. Despite what has been agreed, food aid must remain restricted to financial aid and a range of real food. As such, vitamin tablets from Canada do not form part of this. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, does the Commission share my view that European food aid itself should be streamlined and should be stripped of time-consuming red tape? Does the Commission think that this is feasible and could aid not be allocated via one development budget line? Mr President, the food problem can, in principle, be solved, even in Africa, provided we have a cohesive development policy intended to reduce poverty there instead of increasing wealth over here. Our aim should not be to fill the purses of a few but to fill the mouths of many. Only when we manage to achieve this will aid no longer be necessary.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being myself a producer of food under the provisions of the Berlin decisions, which have already been widely discussed in public, I am aware how insane and inconsistent it is to use various methods to cut production in the EU while there is hunger in the world. Nowhere is it written that sections of the world population that live in an environment that has been destroyed by natural disasters or wars must not be allowed to eat. One euro a day is enough for survival and offers a chance for the future. That is feasible, in any case. In this regard, the European Union, the Member States, politicians, industry and science must take responsibility and break down the wall between prosperity and hunger once and for all. How will future generations judge us, I ask myself? By the flood of megamergers that lead to ever larger and more uncontrollable giant undertakings, or by whether we manage to adopt targeted measures in the next ten years to combat poverty by cancelling the debts of developing countries, as an initial but necessary step?</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly refers to a whole range of guidelines on fighting poverty. For reasons of time I cannot go into them in detail. But the careful observer will notice that there are different weightings at work here. They are reflected in phrases such as “priority to the least developed countries” when allocating food aid, or “alleviation of poverty and hunger of the most vulnerable groups”. I am glad I am not one of those who have to distinguish on a daily basis between “a bit hungry” or “starving”, as it is currently presented in the media, while regrettably little is being done.</p>
<p class="contents">The main part of the report correctly makes reference to the fact that its aim, ultimately, should be to make food aid unnecessary. But we cannot do that unless the politicians agree that hunger is not a political weapon and unless the responsible leaders in every area of society all realise that we only have the world on lease from our children. We hold the goods of this earth on trust for our descendants. If we take that approach, then I am convinced we really can combat poverty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I wish to condemn the derisory extent of this aid compared to what is actually needed. The European Union prides itself on having given a commitment to supply 1.322 million tonnes of wheat equivalent, but, at the same time, the report states that there are 791 million people suffering from malnutrition in poor countries, 124 million of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa alone, where Europe is supposed to be particularly closely involved. Work it out for yourself: European aid comes to around 7 kilos of wheat equivalent per person per year, which is less than twenty grammes per day, and the report is cynical enough to stress the fact that food aid must not discourage local production.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not food aid that has ruined agricultural production in many African countries, however. It is the iron grip of huge European and American industrial or agricultural concerns, which have imposed the cultivation of hevea, coffee, groundnut, cotton and even out-of-season fruit and vegetables for the European market, at the expense of their own food crops. Even in terms of food production, habits have been foisted on the populations of these countries by forcing them to consume rice or wheat-based products, which they can only obtain on the world market, generating profit along the way for a handful of huge Western companies.</p>
<p class="contents">In places, the report smacks of “Lady Bountiful” and presents this aid as an act of charity on the part of Europe, but Europe, or rather its privileged class, is responsible for the ruin of Africa, and that includes the ruin of its self-sufficiency in food. It is not charity, then, that Africa needs. What it needs is the European and American multinationals to stop bleeding it dry. It needs Europe to provide the African people with simple machinery, such as water pumps and industrial products to compensate for what it plundered throughout colonial times and afterwards. Africa will then be in a position to develop its agriculture to a level where it can produce the food to feed its people properly. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I am not naïve enough to think that one decent resolution passed in the European Parliament will be enough to guarantee this. It would require an end to capital’s dictatorship of Europe as well as of Africa, and the only reason why I have voted in favour of this report is in order not to stand in the way of this aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiori (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, in our work on food aid we must not forget that, even today, there are hundreds of millions of undernourished people in the world. The endeavours of our predecessors in the Community institutions succeeded in reducing the total number of undernourished people by over 20% in the space of 30 years. In recent years, the trend has been reversed, which is extremely odd considering the efforts made by the Western world: in certain areas of our planet, the number of undernourished people is constantly on the up and the problem is heightened by natural disasters or, even worse, wars, which have continued to hit the headlines recently. </p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore congratulate ourselves on the fact that this issue is still on the agenda of the European Parliament and the countries of the European Union. I was very pleased to note that, as is the case in the Convention we are discussing now, the Community legislator has consistently striven to guarantee food security and not subsistence. The ultimate purpose behind our aid is to bring about food security: with the passage of time, the aid must be gradually replaced by tangible measures and sustainable instruments for consolidating that security, eliminating, at last, the need for any form of aid or intervention. </p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that our fellow citizens fully approve and support any initiative undertaken by the Community institutions on the matter of aid, or, even better, support for those communities which are less fortunate than we are. However, I cannot miss this opportunity to touch on an aspect, a principle which, I feel, is of paramount importance, precisely to our fellow citizens. In my opinion, the correct weighting should be given to European production. The Convention does not give any form of priority to European products, not even agricultural produce, which are intended for humanitarian aid. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe has always been one of the highest-producing continents in the agricultural sector. For example, the European Union is one of the world's largest producers of starchy products, which are essential for nutrition. This productivity must not be undervalued or underestimated in respect of the produce available on world markets, even in the provision of aid to the most disadvantaged communities. For this reason, I have tabled an amendment, not to the draft Convention, which, I am aware, cannot be amended, but to Mrs Schierhuber’s resolution. This amendment has been judged inadmissible, but my aim in tabling it was to provoke a debate of substance in this Chamber on a topic which, I feel, is of vital concern to our farmers, particularly at this difficult time for them in the aftermath of the reform of the common agricultural policy. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would stress that the purpose of my amendment, and the purpose, now, of this speech, is to promote the cause of Community products, in particular, agricultural produce, at the time of the conclusion of international agreements, and to urge the European executive bodies not to disregard the millions of people whose livelihood depends on European produce, and I refer not to consumers but to producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, the International Wheat Agreement comprises two separate legislative texts, the Grains Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention. The Grains Trade Convention was fundamentally amended as early as 1995, which meant there was no need to envisage amendments to the new convention. And that is why the Commission requested extending the period of validity of that convention until 30 June 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the Food Aid Convention, however, the Committee on Food Aid decided to renegotiate the agreement and in particular to take on board the recommendations of the Singapore Conference. The purpose of the new 1999 Food Aid Convention is to contribute to creating food security in the world and to enhance the international community’s ability to respond more effectively to acute food crises and the food requirements of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The new convention attaches special importance to the following points. Firstly, more consideration is to be given to local nutritional customs. Secondly, the donor countries can now express their commitments in tonnage, value or a combination of tonnage and value. Thirdly, the members of the convention must give priority to the least developed countries and the lowest income countries when allocating their food aid. Fourthly, stronger provisions are introduced for promoting local agricultural development, including possible triangular transactions and local purchases. More than half the relevant Commission resources will go to such transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that food aid to the least developed countries will be given purely in the form of grants. Overall, food aid provided in the form of grants will represent not less than 80% of a member’s contributions and members will strive to raise this percentage even higher. Next, in determining whether, and to what extent, the food aid provision on long-term concessional credit terms should continue to be covered under the Food Aid Convention, FAC members will take account of the results of the relevant multilateral negotiations. In this connection, the European Union and some other members reaffirmed their opinion that food aid provided under credit terms should no longer be included in the list of food aid operations. Our position is as follows: food aid must be clearly separated from commercial transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">My seventh point is that the new Food Aid Convention is intended to improve the monitoring of the effectiveness and impact of food aid transactions and cooperation between food aid donors, recipients and others concerned. Eight, the provision of food aid under this convention will not be tied in any way to commercial exports of goods or services.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, since several speakers raised this question during the debate, let me tell you how much aid we are currently providing for Ethiopia. The Commission and the Community are in a position to mobilise 542 526 tonnes of cereals between April 2000 and March 2001, i.e. immediately, this year. Let me also point out that during the negotiations we kept in constant contact with the food aid recipient countries so that we were always aware of their position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
