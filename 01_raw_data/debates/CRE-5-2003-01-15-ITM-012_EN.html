However, I shall endeavour to keep to the questions asked.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council had the opportunity – last December – to examine with the European Parliament the problems caused by repeated accidents of this sort during a general debate on the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Having expressed then its regret with regard to the disaster caused by the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>tanker off the coast of Galicia last November, it can now affirm that all the Member States and the Commission have decided to improve their cooperation, in a general bid to make ships safe and prevent pollution at sea. The new European Maritime Safety Agency is proof positive of this determination.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 and 9 December, the Council took measures, in the form of Council conclusions, on certain aspects of maritime transport and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Council approved five of the six acts proposed by the Commission in the Erika I and Erika II packages of legislative measures under the codecision procedure. The dates for the entry into force of these legislative acts have been selected for two reasons: to ensure they are applied as quickly as possible and to allow the port authorities to set up control capabilities where the port state is responsible for controls. As far as the phasing out of single hull tankers is concerned, the timetable laid down at international level by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is being followed, reinforced by the Member States’ commitment not to make use of the derogation allowed by the IMO. The Nice European Council, in a bid to strengthen the Union’s strategy on safety at sea, invited the Member States ‘to implement in advance the measures approved by the fifteen Member States where they do not require an international framework’.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions approved on 6 December 2002, and in points 1, 5 and 8 in particular, the Council invited the Commission ‘as a matter of urgency, to present a proposal concerning an accelerated phasing out of single hull tankers’, called upon Member States ‘to accelerate the transposition of the amended directive with a view to applying the enhanced control measures as soon as possible, and preferably before 1 January 2003’ and urged the Member States ‘to establish as early as possible and no later than by 1July 2003 plans for the identification of places of refuge for ships in distress’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would emphasise that the measures taken by the Council and Parliament apply to all ports in the Member States of the Community and to their territorial waters and therefore cover the Azores, the Canaries and Madeira. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident took place on 19 December 1999. I believe that the Commission did its work perfectly, because in March 2000 it presented us with this first package of measures. Parliament worked on it and, with more delay than we would have liked, we finally achieved a proposal in December 2000 – a year after the <span class="italic">Erika </span>accident – on which we had reached consensus with the then representative of the Council, the French Transport Minister. The day after that Council, in Parliament, as a result of the actions of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the whole agreement we had reached became deadlocked, and the first <span class="italic">Erika</span> package was not approved until a year later (December 2001). And the worst thing of all is that it was not just the Group of the European People’s Party that held up this <span class="italic">Erika I</span> package, but also the Council, which delayed its common position with regard to double hulls until August 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are facing another disaster, which took place in November 2002 – three years after the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident – the Council and the Member States have still not brought the measures in the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> and <span class="italic">Erika II</span> packages into force. Hence my question: why are the appropriate decisions not taken so that we do not have to suffer another such disaster, and so that the adoption of measures is speeded up with the efficiency that this case demands? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Standards must be established to prevent this terrible situation continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various approaches to solving this problem: one is that adopted by the United States in the wake of the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez </span>accident in 1989, by creating the Oil Pollution Act, in 1990. I would recall that the guarantee required of shipowners stands at USD one billion, that the liability required is unlimited and that, currently, Exxon Mobil is being asked to pay USD four billion in compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Double hulls, coastguards, etc, etc, form part of this approach. Another approach is that of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, a piece of legislation that, although a step forwards, is not being properly applied by the Council and the Member States, which prefer to move in the sphere of international mafias. On the other hand, there are countries, such as Galicia, which are suffering the consequences and whose populations, including fishermen and volunteers are having to fight the oil slick with their bare hands. I believe that the only solution is for the EU to create its own legislation (we could even call it the ‘Prestige’ law, imitating, in this case, the United States. Next, we should surely amend all international legislation. I wish to ask whether you will be adopting initiatives to achieve this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council recalls in particular that, on 20 December, it unanimously adopted a regulation instituting specific measures to compensate the Spanish fisheries, shellfish industry and aquaculture affected by the oil spills from the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. The Commission presented its proposal on 19 December. The European Parliament gave its opinion on the same day. The aims of the proposal are to help compensate the damages, by a contribution of the Community. Financial assistance is foreseen through the reallocation of funds including reprogramming the Spanish share (around EUR 30 million) of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance. Part of the budgetary resources (around EUR 30 million) for the conversion of the Spanish vessels that were up to 1999 dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco will also be used for the reparation of the damages in question.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 19 December 2002, the Council issued the following statement: ‘The Council, having in mind the serious accident of the oil tanker <span class="italic">Prestige </span>off the north west coast of Spain, welcomes the steps taken for the purpose of the rapid adoption of the draft framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Council notes the conclusions of the European Council of 12 and 13 December 2002 regarding maritime safety/marine pollution that welcomes the action undertaken by the Commission to confront the consequences derived of that event and ‘its intention to examine the need for further specific measures’ and, among them, ‘questions relating to liability and the corresponding sanctions’. Therefore, in full consistency with the measures to be considered in accordance with the Community powers in the fields of protection of transport safety and protection of the environment, the Council should consider complementary measures to strengthen the protection of the environment, in particular the seas, through criminal law.’</p>

<p class="contents">Would you accept that the problem that we face in the seas of Europe is not only about maritime safety and environmental pollution? It is the way in which our seas are used, for example for illegal immigration, organised crime, human trafficking, and indeed the abuse of our fisheries law.</p>
<p class="contents">Would you not accept that we need an adequate response mechanism and that the only way to address the problem would be to establish an EU coastguard? Do you not think we could learn from the United States' comprehensive approach to these problems?</p>
<p class="contents">There has been much talk in the Council and elsewhere about the problems of dealing with terrorism, yet we forget that such a danger could exist on our seas just as easily as in the air. If for example a terrorist attack using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons were to be launched at sea, a coastguard could be the first line of response.</p>
<p class="contents">I disagree with you that it is not within the Council's remit. It has always been in the Council's remit to consider ways of addressing the public's fears. Citizens are sometimes disillusioned with the EU. Would you not accept that dealing with problems that threaten their safety and wellbeing in a coordinated and comprehensive way will help convince them of the values of Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 5 by Alexandros Alavanos (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0837_EN.html">H-0837/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Settlement in Cyprus and accession to the European Union</span></p>
<p class="contents">An EU working document drafted with a view to the decisions to be taken in Copenhagen has been published in an Athens newspaper (TA NEA 3 December 2002), causing great concern. This document, which the newspaper claims is to be discussed in principle at COREPER level and by the Council of Foreign Ministers, refers to the accession of Cyprus and makes provision for two possible scenarios. The first envisages accession of the island as a whole, provided a settlement in principle of the Cyprus problem, based on the Annan plan, is signed prior to Copenhagen. The second envisages, in the event of Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash not having signed a settlement in principle prior to Copenhagen, the dissociation of the accession of Cyprus from that of the other countries and reconsideration in April 2003. The first observation to be made about these scenarios is that they directly link a settlement of the Cyprus problem to accession and, in any event, do not even address the commitment given at Helsinki that a settlement is not a condition of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Council take to implement the Helsinki decisions, which dissociated the accession of the Republic of Cyprus from a political solution to the problem, particularly when it is evident that the stalling tactics pursued by the Turkish Cypriot side have exhausted every time margin for negotiations of substance to achieve a just and viable settlement in Cyprus? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the question of unity, the European Union welcomes the commitment by both sides to continue negotiations, with a view to finding an overall solution to the Cyprus problem by the end of February 2003 on the basis of the proposals made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

<p class="contents">In the light of the recent events in Greece where the ‘plane spotters’ (12 British and 2 Dutch) were recently acquitted on appeal of spying charges, of which they had been wrongly convicted by a lower court, does the Council agree that this experience highlights the need for an EU-wide system of safeguards for defendants in criminal trials and more training for judges?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore does the Council agree that, although the ECHR does indeed provide safeguards under Article 6 by providing for the right to a fair trial, the time it takes to remedy breaches by Member States is too long?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover will the Council commit to dealing expeditiously and favourably with the proposal for a Framework Decision on fixing common standards regarding procedural safeguards for persons accused in criminal proceedings throughout the EU as announced by the Commission in its legislative and work programme for 2003? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Minister is right. I do not want to dwell on the experience of my own constituents in Greece, but I will just start by saying that there was relief that the appeal court in Greece recognised the planespotters' innocence: so the justice system did work in the end and we are all very grateful for that.</p>
<p class="contents">But certainly this and many other cases show that we do need to improve our criminal justice standards overall, throughout the European Union, on matters like the availability of interpretation and legal assistance and indeed judicial independence. I should add that I am critical of my own Member State, the United Kingdom, which is the only one of the 15 to subject people to detention without trial under anti-terrorism legislation so I am not criticising others while sparing my own country. But I would like to feel that the Minister was giving me some kind of response as to whether in his view the Council thinks this is an important priority. He said he could not comment on the European Convention on Human Rights but I think we are also talking about the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We are talking about the problems of implementing the European Arrest Warrant in some countries because of fears that there are not minimum standards throughout the EU. Could I get some kind of feeling from the Council that they consider this as important as the Commission does? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very serious problem for a great many citizens of the European Union, who cross the border from one country to another and come up against a very different set of laws, especially in the case of offences – I am thinking, for example, of young people using hashish or other soft drugs – which may land them in jail in one country and barely even qualify as an offence in another.

However, the plan mentions the setting up of a European Corps of Border Guards as just one of a number of possible future institutional steps, which could be considered in order to develop integrated management of external borders following an in-depth legal study addressing the question of the legal basis and identifying the instruments which would be necessary. The European Council in Seville noted that the Commission intended to continue examining the advisability and feasibility of such a police force and, as far as we know, the Commission has already started this study.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Seville also urged the introduction, without delay, of the common unit for external border practitioners, composed of Member States’ heads of border control, to coordinate the various measures contained in the management plan, the aim being to gradually introduce integrated management of external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">This common unit was created at the meeting of the Council’s strategic committee on immigration, frontiers and asylum held on 22-23 June 2002. The common unit, known as ‘SCIFA +’, immediately undertook to apply the management plan and met five times during the Danish Presidency.

As you know, this raises a great many questions, which are being examined and to which answers have to be found so that they can be resolved. We, both as the Greek Presidency and as a Member State, are very keen to move in this direction.</p>

The initiative we took a year ago, as a Member State, is most conducive to dealing with the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises. So what are these problems and where do we think we can help? We think we can help by reducing or, if possible, removing the obstacles encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises looking to expand, by giving them easier access to capital, by cutting red tape, by creating more networks, by raising the standard of skills and employment standards, by encouraging entrepreneurship within the education system and, of course, by encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises to innovate.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all cutting-edge factors that determine viability and competitiveness, especially the viability and competitiveness of the small and medium-sized enterprises we, the Presidency, are interested in promoting and that is what we shall do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The necessary consultations with the European Parliament on these matters are continuing and will be concluded by the end of January 2003.

<p class="contents">Recently, on 23 December, the presidency repeated the EU’s position in a declaration stating that the European Union was continuing to monitor internal developments in Venezuela closely with mounting concern. The European Union welcomes Resolution 833 by the Organization of American States, supporting the democratic institutions in Venezuela, and efforts by the Secretary General of the Organization to mediate. Against this backdrop, the European Union is forcefully backing efforts by the Secretary General of the ΟΑS to pave the way for dialogue and national reconciliation. The European Union is urging the institutions and people of Venezuela to underpin efforts to find a peaceful and constitutional solution to the crisis, so that the stability of the country can be restored and economic progress and social development promoted, with due respect for democratic principles and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council would point out that, in its resolution of 16 December, the Permanent Council of the OAS urged all sectors of society to preserve the free exercise of the essential elements of democracy to promote a constitutional, democratic, peaceful and electoral solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that the European Union is carefully monitoring the situation from afar, as you said, and is talking about constitutional solutions at a time when it is crystal clear who comes within the framework of the constitution of the Republic of Venezuela and who does not – I would remind you of the position taken during last year’s Spanish Presidency by the Spanish Government, which basically welcomed the coup against President Chavez – demonstrates that the behaviour of the European Union is not so very different from the behaviour of the United States which, on the face of it at least, is also sticking to a ‘watch and wait’ line.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Intensification of preparations for war against Iraq</span></p>
<p class="contents">The USA and the UK are stepping up preparations for an attack against Iraq, transporting soldiers and munitions to the region and preparing the way for civil war by arming all those inside and outside Iraq who might take their side. It has been reported that at least six European countries will be used to train Iraqi opposition forces, and the Hungarian Government has confirmed the existence of an official American request to use the Taszar base for training 4 500 Iraqis 'as translators and administrators'. These actions are completely at odds with the UN resolutions and cast doubt on the work of the inspectors.</p>

He is calling on other members, Mr President, China and Russia. Of course they too have a responsibility, but what will the four from the European Union do?

Obviously, the situation in the Russian Republic of Chechnya continues to cause the European Union a great deal of concern. It is clear from the most recent progress report by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe that, unfortunately, there are still serious failings in Chechnya when it comes to human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">With this human rights situation in Chechnya, it is a real pity that we let the OSCE Assistance Group mandate lapse. The ΟSCE has done a useful job since 1995, when its mandate started, and the ΕU has called on the Russian Government to make every possible effort to ensure there is a follow-on Assistance Group with a broad mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the constant presence of Council of Europe experts at the Office of the Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation, in order to safeguard human rights and political rights and freedoms in Chechnya, is fairly encouraging. It proves that there are Russian authorities working to resolve the issues raised by the ΕU and other agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Human Rights considered that Moscow has given sufficient guarantees to allow persons of Chechen origin who appear to be terrorists to be extradited to Russia. As one of these guarantees, Russia has confirmed that the accused will not face the death penalty, their health and safety will be assured and they will have unobstructed access to suitable medical care and legal assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the situation of people moved from Chechnya to Ingushetia is concerned, the ΕU has accepted additional assurances on the part of the Russian authorities that they will not be forced to return against their will. At the same time, concern is still being voiced about the fate of those who do return to Chechnya. The ΕU has insisted that suitable conditions for these people to return to and live in must be provided in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as preventing abuse by the security forces is concerned, recent comments by Russian ministers on the subject indicate that they are determined to curb acknowledged cases of abuse. We can only hope that the recent replacement of the head of Russian military operations in Chechnya sent the military establishment a clear message that the law must be obeyed by everyone without exception.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to understand the general climate of fear and insecurity among the Chechen people, as well as the anxiety of the Russian authorities, especially after the attack on Grozny on 27 December 2002. With all this and the unhappy political situation, due importance must be attached to efforts by both the Russian Parliament and the Government to impose adequate political control on military action in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the ΕU is currently examining its position and its strategy for the forthcoming 59th Assembly of the UN Commission on Human Rights. I cannot give you any details until suitable negotiations have been held with all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the reports that reach us – Mr Wuori has pointed this out – refer to a very serious human rights situation.
