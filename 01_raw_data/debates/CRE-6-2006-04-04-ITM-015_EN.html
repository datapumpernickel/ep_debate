This came before our Committee a year ago, the proposal was put to Parliament on 6 April 2005, and from the start of May our Committee began to deliberate on it. Since then statements have been given by the Committee on Budgets, on which Neena Gill has done such good work, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on which Giusto Catania has also done good work. There has also been a statement on this issue from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, drafted by Maria da Assunção Esteves. I would like to thank them all for their excellent, well-informed statements.</p>
<p class="contents">I might say that this year we have been very busy, and I also want to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee’s determined female – and male – members, who have assisted me in this, and all the others who have been involved. We are now at a point, then, where this is to be voted on tomorrow, and I was thinking of saying a few more words about this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It contains four Actions. The first is ‘Active citizens for Europe’, which includes town-twinning and which has now received a lot of positive publicity and feedback through the existing programme. Citizens’ projects also come under Action 1. Action 2 is ‘Active civil society for Europe’. This is a means of acquiring structural support for EU think tanks and civil society organisations as well as support for civil society projects. This is also a very important Action. Action 3 is ‘Together for Europe’: high-visibility events, studies, dissemination and information. Action 4 is ‘Active European remembrance throughout Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this programme was specifically to reach those Europeans who, for one reason or another, have not yet managed to take part in the European agenda. As we know, currently there are people who have for some reason felt the issue of Europe to be alien to them, and Europe has even seen growing exclusion. Through this programme we have tried to find those people and create a programme suited to them so that they too might experience what it is to act together, what European identity is, and how we can strengthen the common European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the recent events in connection with the European Parliament elections and the results of referendums show that far too few people are interested in matters that affect all of us. As we know, it is important to strengthen European identity and it is important to increase activity in which all nations of Europe are involved, thereby creating opportunities for everyone to participate. In a word, this programme has worked on the assumption that what we needed was not an elitist programme, but a programme that would be appropriate for all Europeans. Some might say that it is a bit of a patchwork quilt or that many issues of greatly varying importance have been put in the same programme, but it is tailor-made precisely in order to overlap successfully with some existing programmes and really give all Europeans the opportunity to get involved in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it appears that, although the Committee was almost unanimous (just two abstained and the rest voted for the programme), a few amendments are going to be tabled at tomorrow’s part-session. They mainly relate to Action 4, active remembrance. They also concern organisations which are already mentioned in this programme. Regarding these organisations, I would like to say the following: I hope that this part of the programme that deals with active remembrance will help us adhere to its original purpose of supporting memorial sites to the victims of Nazism and Stalinism, because the impact of these totalitarian regimes was a European-wide one and was not limited to a single country. Regarding this, I want to thank Marianne Mikko in particular, as it was she who made a strong case for the Stalinist component and wanted it to be included.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I must say that I hope that we will keep to our views on this. I also hope that the additional remarks which have been made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance with regard to these new organisations, <span class="italic">Maisons de l'Europe</span>, the Berlin-based <span class="italic">Institut für Europäische Politik</span> and the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, can be adopted as part of this programme. Unfortunately, time is so short and I have gone over mine, so I cannot speak here any longer, but I will say thank you for all the support. I hope that the vote will go as we on the Committee would like it to.</p>

Tomorrow you will vote on the report, which reflects a lot of work since that time, and it is an important step towards the adoption of the new generation of programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank all the listed committees, in particular the Committee on Culture and Education and its rapporteur Mr Takkula for his efforts, combining determination and modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report reflects this balance and shows that the committee shares the concerns of the Commission about the necessity to promote the active participation of citizens in the construction of a common Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is based on the conviction that the strengthening of active citizenship at European level is closely linked to the development of a sense of belonging to the European Union and of a European identity, which is complementary to other identities: national, regional and local. Common values, history, and culture with all its diversity will therefore be the building blocks of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary committee adopted several amendments that enrich our proposal with references to European values. I note with pleasure that the report followed the Commission's proposal on the various actions of this programme, ensuring continuity of activities that proved to be successful and the introduction of innovative projects and methods for citizens' participation. I appreciate that the report proposes the integration of a new, fourth action providing support for memorials to victims of Nazi and Stalinist regimes, as agreed by the European Parliament, Council and Commission in November.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to come now to the question of designated beneficiaries. The Commission has proposed a limited list of six designated bodies because of their uniqueness in the European arena. Three of them celebrate the memory or continue the work of the founding fathers, while the other three are pan-European umbrella organisations. All of them have been supported for many years by the European institutions. All of them contribute to the objectives of this programme. I appreciate the fact that the committee shared our philosophy and confirmed the choices. It proposed adding one more organisation: the Maison de l'Europe. All the previously mentioned characteristics apply to this organisation. This pan-European network of local organisations is aimed at engaging citizens in the construction of Europe. I am therefore pleased to say that the Commission could support this amendment, provided that it does not mean other organisations will be eligible for this designation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to give my thoughts on the issue of volunteering. This was mentioned in the proposal as an example of the field of interest of this programme. An amendment by the committee proposed deleting this reference. We believe, however, that volunteering is a powerful tool for developing social cohesion and commitment towards society and that it therefore deserves special attention within the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Those were, in brief, the main points to which I wanted to draw your attention. You will have noticed that our views converge on many points. Let me emphasise the importance of continuing our constructive cooperation, despite the current uncertainties about the financial questions connected to this programme. In the interest of citizens, we should make every possible effort to reach an agreement as soon as possible in order to prepare for the implementation of this programme by January 2007. Your vote will send an important signal to the European citizens, as another important step is taken towards a Europe for citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a key programme, be it citizens for Europe, or Europe of citizens. The last time we asked this question in 1992, half the EU citizens surveyed said that they never felt European. I think that figure has probably decreased over time, but not as dramatically as we would like. But whether we feel it or not, we are European citizens and we share the rights and privileges citizenship brings. This programme should make people aware and proud of their EU citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important to remember that we already have invested in similar programmes aimed at engaging with citizens. The problem has been that the Commission's strategy in this area has been piecemeal and confused. Therefore, what I would like to ask the Commission is: can it guarantee that this is not going to be just one more programme? Will it really make a difference? Will it be linking with other actions in a coherent, overarching strategy? I really hope so, but I would like the Commission to explain how.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking, as I am, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I am concerned that the ambitions are not backed by resources. Therefore, once again we are raising expectations only to dash them. I can understand all the Members wanting to address their preferred issues within the scope of this programme, but the funding for it, I believe, is far from adequate and we need to look very closely at some of the amendments that have been put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for paying special attention to organised civil society at local level, including the disabled. However, I regret that we have not pushed enough for the Commission to do more to reach the most disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish this programme every success and hope that the monitoring and evaluation issues that the Committee on Budgets has put forward are taken up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are no shortcuts to revitalising Europe’s role on a global scale. What it needs is for a real constituent process to be created, avoiding attempts to revive a constitutional treaty that has been killed off and erased by the will of the people. We need to build an intercultural society emphasising Europe’s mixed-blood identity and, above all, we must encourage the integration of immigrants and the extension of citizenship rights.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we also think that the European citizenship concept must be tied closely to residence, with the explicit aim of encouraging inclusion. In that respect, we believe that the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme can be a useful and valid means of promoting European citizenship rights, which should be increasingly dissociated from national criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme’s actions are worthy of support, and I refer in particular to town twinning projects and active European remembrance. I believe we need to be clear on the latter point, however. The 20th century was one of wars and authoritarian regimes, and there were countless victims of the deportations and mass killings carried out by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Twentieth-century European history cannot be commemorated, however, without remembering the victims of its Fascist regimes: in Italy, Fascists deprived men and women of their freedom for two decades, and there are many connections between the Italian regime and the Nazis.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain, Portugal and Greece only recently won back democracy and freedom. Antifascism is a European value and cannot be reduced to a national event, and we therefore believe that it is now worth remembering the victims of Fascism to prevent similar events from happening again. There are still neo-fascist groups in Europe today, who feed on xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.</p>
<p class="contents">Excluding the victims of such authoritarian regimes from the programme would be both tragic and a threat to the promotion of citizenship and a common European identity. We therefore hope that Amendments 62 and 63 will be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This identity, which after all is simply one more way of life, is boosted by the Citizens for Europe programme under discussion today.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme promotes an ethical awareness of the world, which is the deepest expression of European citizenship. The programme paves the way for a political model for cooperation between the general public and the EU institutions. This will help turn the citizens into participants in the European political process. This is why the programme is of key importance. Europe now has the task of becoming political and of moving from being a market to being a public area of debate.</p>
<p class="contents">This drive towards European citizenship, however, poses a major challenge for the institutions. The citizenship policy means that the EU institutions must also become more political. The issue of European citizenship very much revolves around the way in which the institutions promote people’s interest in European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an obvious need for institutional reform in Europe and for new rules that can attract and empower the European public. There is also a clear need for a political focal point around which there could be a European political sphere. Yet for this to happen, Europe needs to be more political in all of its structures, in terms of the citizens, the parties and relations between the institutions. Perhaps the European public debate is waiting to be kicked into life. Perhaps the European public debate is waiting for a defining moment and for a Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, European citizens have become increasingly sceptical towards the EU’s institutions and rapid EU enlargement. The programme ‘Citizens for Europe’ is intended to promote active European citizenship and to reduce dissatisfaction and alienation.</p>
<p class="contents">My group actively supports the programme’s main objectives: promoting European values and achievements and preserving cultural diversity, in order to foster cohesion among Europeans. This programme is one of the tools that could help the EU to achieve these objectives, by means of town-twinning activities, citizens’ projects, building up European networks in the civil-society sector, and adult-education centres.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as we have heard, the importance of ‘active European remembrance’ should not be underestimated in this regard, namely the preservation of memorial sites relating to Nazi and Stalinist deportation and mass extermination. Memorial sites for the victims of the crimes perpetrated by these totalitarian regimes, whose impact was felt throughout Europe, have been included in the programme and are to receive funding; both of which have the support of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed total budget is to be EUR 235 million within the framework of the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013. In view of the ambitious objectives of ‘Citizens for Europe’, this funding does not, of course, reflect the programme’s real importance as a tool for making citizens aware of their European identity and common values on the one hand, and the strengthening of and support for European integration on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I am pleased to see that Mr Takkula’s report has turned the Citizens for Europe programme into the Europe for the citizens programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I am less impressed with the way in which the Council of the European Union is full of the importance of involving the citizen in the European Union, but subsequently fobs us off with an excuse when it comes to funding the Europe for the citizens programme. The Council’s parsimony does it no credit. What is worse, it has made the discussion on the Takkula report particularly difficult, because when we talk about involving citizens in the European Union, we actually mean all citizens. This also, for example, includes those European citizens who have become the victim of dictatorial regimes or internal strife in Europe, or new citizens, immigrants and citizens from third countries who have lived in Europe for a long time, as well as citizens of all ages.</p>
<p class="contents">Were sufficient funds available – which they are not – we would have certainly been able to fund a wide range of projects that would have touched all those groups. As it happens, we can only fund a very limited number of programmes. To avoid disappointment on the part of people who are full of excitement when they come to submit their applications, only for the Commission to turn them down, Mr Takkula was brave enough to disappoint people at this stage, so as to make it absolutely clear from the outset who qualifies for funding and who does not. That is understandable and in general, I support this way of working.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to remembering victims of European dictatorships, however, this approach is painful and lamentable. Are the victims of one dictatorship more important than another? Of course they are not. We should try to avoid creating that impression, even at the risk of the Commission having to disappoint people at a later stage. That is why I hope that everyone will back the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in which we make an appeal to remember the victims of all European dictatorships. The European citizen should not be at the receiving end of the Council’s economy drives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still not too late. The final decision on the financial perspectives will be taken before the report returns to this House for second reading. I would make an urgent appeal to the parties involved to make more funds available for culture, in general, and the Europe for the citizens programme, in particular. Without citizens, the European Union is nothing, as indeed the Council, Commission and Parliament have proved time and again. We therefore need money on the table, because the programme offers many opportunities, including town twinning opportunities, support for think tanks and NGOs, as well as the promotion of contacts between European citizens, for example in sports clubs. They are all fine ideas, but fine ideas with no money to back them up are nothing but empty promises. If Europe wants to be there for its citizens, it should not leave them in the lurch now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Europe should be a matter close to the heart of its citizens; that is the basic idea behind the present programme. Promotion of active European citizenship should be increased. It is a matter of improving the integration of citizens, as most of them reject Europe, and know far too little about European ideals, values and objectives. The EU is alien to the majority of citizens, who do not consider it their homeland. European integration policy is failing. For many, Europe is too top heavy, too complicated, too unfathomable, too cold. That is why the rapporteur’s approach of arousing interest in Europe in areas that citizens are passionate about, for example sports clubs, cultural initiatives and leisure activities, is a very viable one.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a plea here today for the promotion of more Eurovision events through the medium of television. One Eurovision Song Contest a year is not sufficient to give citizens a lasting understanding of the diversity of this continent. Why is there not a European Cinema Contest, for example, or Eurovision dance contests, or ‘European Idol’, or European Saturday-night shows in which the individual Member States compete against each other for fun? This is the only way to successfully generate interest – maybe even enthusiasm – on the part of even apolitical European citizens in their – our – Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, there is frequent contact with representatives of European television companies with regard to the new ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive.

<p class="contents">It is important to be able to hold broad debates at the coalface on Europe’s understanding of itself in political and cultural terms, on its social responsibility and its future, and also on the role it wants to play in the world. After all, having the opportunity to speak to large numbers of citizens at the coalface – young people, the elderly, people in cultural organisations and political associations – about all Europe’s political issues is the only way to reach the people and their hearts more successfully than we have done in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the issue of Europe’s future is so central to this programme – but equally so is that of Europe’s past. Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that Europe is the continent whose totalitarianism, whose National Socialism and whose Stalinism has brought great suffering, murder and crime upon not only Europe but also other parts of the world. Therefore, I think it right that this programme recall that very totalitarian past, that we reappraise that past, and that we be sensitive and do everything possible to ensure that such things cannot happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to state explicitly, therefore, that I do not see this as a matter of competing with other dictatorial regimes that have existed in Europe. It is of course right to reappraise these at national level – and we are all attending to this – but it is equally right that this European programme make reference to Europe’s totalitarianism. Therefore, I, too, am in favour of the rapporteur’s motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The difference is not the result of an oversight by the Commission. It is the result of the prevailing culture in the European institutions. There will not be new citizens for Europe while the Europe of the institutions continues, with its policies, to exacerbate the social fissures and the identity problems. No programme for citizenship can resolve this divorce. Yet if the programme, right from the very name, is indicative of this primary urge, then that cannot be a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the change of name, although I should like to see the consistency that is currently lacking. I should therefore like to highlight three aspects: Given the scarcity of resources there are two options open. Either the money is concentrated on few, highly conspicuous actions or it is distributed among projects promoting European citizenship. The rapporteur has opted for compromise, while seeking to raise the stock of the second of those options. I would have gone much further. I have nothing against major events, but I am totally opposed to lying.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest virtue of this programme is that it can be carried out by the associative networks, which, on the ground, foster citizenship. Any deviation from this option would distort the very idea of citizenship. Consequently, the idea of earmarking a substantial sum of money for support for six, now eight, institutions, without any kind of contest, is similarly unsustainable. The normal procedure in any civilised society is to select projects by means of transparent contests. At the other end of the scale is the law of lobbies, arrangements and favours. In this particular case, eleventh-hour agreements were reached in order to accommodate two more organisations. I am not judging their actual merits, but I am criticising the complete lack of merit in this method of awarding grants. The exact opposite would be a lesson in Europe citizenship, whereby contests are run and, hopefully, the contestants are rewarded impartially on their merits.</p>
<p class="contents">My final question relates to the problem of memory. With the entry of the new countries from the East, it is perfectly understandable that the idea of associating the memory of the victims of Stalinism with the victims of the holocaust has emerged. That is fair enough, but does not tell the whole story. What is missing is something to honour the memory of the victims of fascism in southern Europe. Our view of citizenship must be that of respect for the pain of the victims, their families and their descendents. There cannot be any other criteria. In Portugal there is a citizens’ movement campaigning against turning the police headquarters of the old regime into luxury flats, rather than a museum. Each person brings his or her memories to Europe. With those memories, all of those memories, memory itself can be a component in citizenship. Fascism was an example of totalitarianism. It was also European. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more true since concerns are growing that in the globalised world understanding of Europe and its identity is vanishing.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, we must develop a multi-faceted, honest and democratic Europe that is open towards the rest of the world. We particularly need to pay attention to historical and cultural aspects. We need to promote measures to remember the mass deportations and the victims of both Nazism and Stalinism – I repeat, and Stalinism. We should preserve the evidence of these crimes. Such tasks bear witness to progress in the European Parliament’s thinking, as displayed by Members. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the formulations prepared by the Council. Incredibly, these have retained the connivance characteristic of the cold war years with the half-truths of European history imposed by the totalitarian Communist regime. The Council must be reminded that Stalinism too was totalitarian and was no less destructive a regime for those who died among Europe’s peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The Takkula report is good. It represents the now regular affirmation that historical truth does not distinguish between Nazi crimes and Communist crimes. Crimes are and remain crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">It surprises me that in this citadel of democracy, justice and truth motions can still be encountered that attempt to weigh in the scales of importance the memories of those who died in the Holocaust or in the gulags.</p>

I ask people in the Chamber to remove their headphones for three seconds. One, two, three. What did you hear? Absolutely nothing! That is the sound of silence that heralds the clamour for this piece of legislation. Are there demands to do something? No! Will it address the fundamental concerns of 450 million people struggling to earn a living or find solutions to everyday problems? No, again.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well known that something that you give but which cannot be disposed of has little value to the receivers since they have made no effort to get it. How cheap then is European citizenship, which is forced on people, is unwanted and cannot be refused or renounced.</p>
<p class="contents">So here we go again! Another huge propaganda project to distort and hide the truth. The hope and belief seems to be that this will cure the scepticism that is growing across the continent. Low Euro-election turnouts, vocal opposition to enlargement and the rejected Constitution are all, apparently, to be remedied by throwing EUR 235 million at projects to persuade the people that the EU is actually doing something good for them.</p>
<p class="contents">This is pay-as-you-go citizenship. The price rises as your rights go. The EU will not listen to the people it is meant to represent. Instead it attempts to bribe its way to a position of favour. Yet European integration is exactly what the people are increasingly opposed to. Why? Because each and every country is slowly waking up to the reality that one size does not suit all in the eurozone, and neither now will one citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said before that, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a stupid question. That millions of citizens in countries across the world agree with me is really quite comforting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Accordingly, the rapporteur’s Amendment 29 is of enormous importance to those hundreds of thousands of Central and Eastern Europeans whose families or family members were executed, were deported or died in Stalin’s gulags, for no reason other than that their survival was judged to be a threat to the illegal occupation of their countries, agreed by Hitler and Stalin under the notorious Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, there has been discussion of other amendments in the name of Mr Sifunakis: Amendments 62 and 63, which refer to conflicts in Spain, Portugal and Greece. It seems to me that these are important issues, but they should be considered in another context. I hope that the whole of Parliament will support Amendment 29, so that we do not dilute the message that Hitler and Stalin were joint criminals who vented their anger on the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The NKVD, the Soviet Union’s People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs, under Order No 001223, entitled ‘On the operative accounting of anti-Soviet and socially alien elements’, issued on 11 October 1939, was the prelude to the mass deportations ordered by Merkulov, the USSR’s People’s Commissar for State Security, and put into effect by his deputy, Serov. On the night of 13 and 14 June 1941, 34 260 people were deported from Lithuania, 15 081 from Latvia and 10 205 from Estonia. This was just the most notorious of the many deportations which continued until 1951. It is significant that the EU will now support the commemoration of the victims of both those dictatorships.</p>
<p class="contents">Without truth, there can be no reconciliation. The Russian people today are no more responsible for Stalin’s crimes than are the German people for Hitler’s. But European citizenship and good neighbourliness can only be based on respectful ...</p>

<p class="contents">That is why we need a programme which will be able to motivate European citizens on the weak points; in other words make them participate more actively in common ventures, with the objective of mutual understanding between citizens and between the different cultural and historic permutations of the European identity itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the 'Citizens for Europe' programme, in the report on his proposal on which he worked with a great deal of zeal, our honourable friend Mr Takkula has renamed it from its original title of 'Citizens for Europe' to 'Europe for Citizens', thereby filling a gap in the programme, which will join existing Community programmes such as the 'Lifelong Learning' and 'Youth in Action' programmes which mainly target young people.</p>
<p class="contents">However, European history also integrates two difficult periods during the 20th century which also form part of our common memory and history. The memory of the victims exterminated and displaced and imprisoned by autocratic regimes must remain alive. We cannot and must not forget the tragic moments which our continent experienced 60 years ago in the concentration and extermination camps at the hands of Nazism, nor of course can we or must we forget the crimes committed by Stalinism. However, we cannot keep selective memories alive. We cannot honour the memory of the victims of Nazism and Stalinism and, at the same time, forget the fascism and dictatorships of southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community, two countries in which fascism, over a period of 40 years, left tragic remains behind it. We also celebrate the 25th anniversary this year of the accession of Greece to the European Community. From 1946 to 1974, concentration camps operated in Greece in which thousands of citizens were exterminated for their political ideas. The islands of Yiaros, which the Romans also used as a place of exile, and Makronisi became a tomb for a great number of people who lost their lives there as a result of the hardship and torture which they suffered together with thousands of other citizens exiled to these islands at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">The common factor which links the states of southern Europe is that the stabilisation of democracy in these countries was achieved to a great extent thanks to their accession to the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The 'Citizens for Europe' programme which we are debating today will therefore acquire material and overall value. That is why the amendments referred to earlier by my honourable friend Mr Catania and others must also be adopted, because they supplement the most extensive and very important report by our honourable friend Mr Takkula. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on a well prepared report. The promotion of European citizenship is an essential condition for the European Union, which has been successfully enlarged, to function. The European Union needs a programme, especially after the 2004 enlargement, which devotes particular attention to its citizens. At the moment, the deficit of active democracy is one of the most acute present-day problems faced by the European Union, and therefore, we welcome efforts to form a European identity, to foster citizenship and promote active participation in the area of European integration. In Lithuania, public opinion polls indicate great mistrust in important state institutions by residents, and there is a sense that voter participation is decreasing. These indicators are also similar in the European Union. An average European has also little faith in, whether it be political parties, his country's government or parliament. By introducing the active citizenship initiative, the integration of European values will be noticeable in individual national societies, and the European identity, which is actively formed, will also have a positive influence on common European Union decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions of the European Union must become accountable not just to the governments of Member States and their delegations, but to the citizens of Europe. The implementation of measures will create greater transparency and a degree of responsibility in the political process of the European Union. European culture and its diversity will be fostered, and cooperation between citizens and organisations of various countries will be encouraged. The same evaluation of the past, Stalin's gulags and the fascist Holocaust, would strengthen European citizenship. It is important that this programme is accessible to all interested parties, that is non-governmental organisations and educational institutions. This initiative is the key to citizens having a conscious effect on their own and their children's future in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the meagre budget allocated to this particular aim, however, our efforts should focus only on the two most shocking and horrific of these regimes, whose effects were felt on a massive scale with consequences at global level. Stalin and Hitler’s regimes must become symbols of evil, and be imprinted on our children’s consciousness as murderous systems. This will prevent any recurrence of such regimes.

<p class="contents">As mayor, I have undertaken countless activities to promote a European identity, encouraging the citizens to participate and cooperate, especially through twinning and cultural exchanges in which young people and students, together with others, have played a leading role.</p>
<p class="contents">I find, in fact, that citizens who deal on a daily basis with problems that are often far removed from those addressed in this House need tangible demonstrations of the fact that there is a basis of common values for all 450 million Europeans. They will have to feel this very strongly if the gap between the people and the institutions is to be closed. I therefore support the Commission’s proposal and all the activities proposed, especially those that promote the European values of democracy, freedom and respect for human rights: I think they are valid and should be endorsed. I therefore hope that this project will be taken forward with as much institutional and financial support as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Other concomitant measures are needed, however. First of all, there is a need to improve communications and information on the activities of our institutions at a local level, and we should therefore promote information campaigns, debates and talks on major European topics. I also believe that any measure to promote so-called ‘European citizenship’ will be fruitless unless during the coming debates we take due account of the needs, demands and expectations of civil society.</p>

This programme represents the only opportunity for most citizens of participating in the body of European thought, and becoming involved, as active members of our civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, the referendums in France and the Netherlands have made it necessary for us to explain things better, to explain enlargement, to explain the Constitutional Treaty, to dispel people’s fears about globalisation. This programme makes all of this possible, with the help of intermediaries, who receive money from this programme. I am pleased that the Commission named some of these, therefore. Indeed, there is no need to reinvent the wheel; there are institutions that have been working on European citizenship for a long time already.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Allister – he is not here any more, unfortunately – who said earlier that he does not want to be a European, I can only say that I am a citizen of Saarland – a small German <span class="italic">Land</span> – I am a German, and I am a European. It is like a Russian doll; it is possible to be all of these, none of them are ruled out. Collectively, we are all committed to European values, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I deplore the fact that we have thrown ourselves too much into the issue of Nazi and Stalinist memorial sites. In this connection, I should like to say to Mr Sifunakis – who has also already left, unfortunately – that he actually exceeded his powers. His motion regarding these memorial sites was defeated in committee. The committee decided against it. Mr Sifunakis then proceeded to write to all the members of the committee as its chairman, requesting that they kindly follow him this time. As far as I am aware, that is something that has never happened in this House in my 16 years here. I hope that my fellow Members will not follow him.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one final point – one already touched upon by Mr Battilocchio: we need town-twinning activities, which do a wonderful job. This is another area in which it is possible to achieve more with a little more money than a great deal of other things that could have been devised. I would ask the Commissioner to include the three additional organisations we want to involve. These have done a wonderful job, and he can rely on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are unfortunately becoming further and further removed from the latter. I am convinced, however, that the present programme has the potential to contribute a great deal towards reducing Euroscepticism.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Pack has just said, one key aspect is town-twinning activities, which foster mutual acquaintance and understanding by means of common selective, but also structured, multiannual agreements. This is a very inexpensive communication project but, unfortunately, is not being recognised as such. If we were to increase investment in this project, we could dispense with many a brochure.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of citizens’ projects is to bring interested parties together to work on European issues, which makes it possible to reach a broad public. If included in networks, clubs and associations can be an effective tool for reaching citizens, strengthening social cohesion and preventing exclusion or discrimination among a wide variety of groups of people – an important basis for active citizenship and the European dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘active European remembrance’ campaign has been included in this programme for the first time, as the committee is of the opinion that European history needs to be discussed in the context of a broad public. The discussion has also shown – and this shows that we were right – that this important issue should not be dealt with as a small contribution to this programme – as a peripheral phenomenon, as it were – but calls for a programme in its own right. This is in order to draw attention to all forms of dictatorship and their victims, including, in particular, making young people and future generations aware of the atrocities perpetrated by past regimes, and to work on ensuring that our democracies are, and remain, strong enough to render such inhumane regimes impossible in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first thing that I welcome in it is the proposal to change the title of the programme from ‘Citizens for Europe’ to ‘Europe for Citizens’. This inversion of the words encapsulates the whole meaning of the culture that, from now on, should lie at the heart of Community action: the means and not the end for Europe’s peoples to achieve their aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that greater attention is being paid to the citizens and that there is a new-found sensitivity to issues of culture and European identity. This is shown by the fact that the agenda for this plenary session also includes the reports by Mr Hammerstein Mintz, on the opening of Council meetings to the public; Mr Cashman, on access to the institutions’ texts; and Mrs Prets, on the European Capital of Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House therefore have the opportunity – I would even say the duty – to make this Europe more transparent, more democratic, easier to understand and, hence, more acceptable. At such a difficult time in the European integration process as we are now experiencing, when nationalist, separatist tendencies appear to be gaining new legitimacy, disseminating mutual knowledge about our different cultures is certainly a vital means of social integration and of exalting the values that unite us, and it plays a key role in the fight against racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, that is why I think it is important to endow this programme with more substantial, more adequate funding. Mr President, the sense of belonging and feeling European also needs to be developed in Europe’s citizens, who no longer want to be subject to Europe but want to create it instead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The chance to observe new Stalins and Hitlers has unfortunately not disappeared even to this day. For precisely this reason our shared duty is not to allow the crimes committed by the Nazis and Soviet totalitarian Communism to be forgotten. We must remember the horror that occurred when the insane ideas of two tyrants subjected the peoples of Europe to mass murders, people slaughtered in death camps and the distortion of destiny, blackening the pages of Europe’s history.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of the difference in their individual ideas, both totalitarian regimes can be considered equal. Both Hitler and Stalin organised mass deportations, set up death camps and ordered mass murders, slaughtering millions of people, among them defenceless children. I can say with certainty that nearly every European family has a story to tell about the blighted fates of fathers, brothers or sisters. The crimes of Hitler’s Nazis and of Stalinism cannot and must not be forgotten, particularly this year, when 14 June will mark the passing of 65 years since the start of the ruthless mass deportations from the Baltic states. Thank you, Christopher Beazley, for reminding us of these facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we should foster among Europe’s peoples understanding of the principles of respect for democracy, freedom and human rights. We should do this so that no contemporary copycat Stalin could ever even dream that he would go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">We must actively support projects that preserve the memory of Nazism and Stalinism, mass deportations and the dead. We must show our children the places connected with mass deportations and concentration camps and we must preserve the memories of the victims.</p>

I would like to express my full support for this programme and congratulate Mr Takkula on the work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us talk about Action 4 of this programme, which is aimed at the preservation of the memorial sites related to Nazi and Stalinist deportation and mass extermination; I also fully support the memory of these hideous regimes that marked the European and world history of the 20th century.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add, however, that under no circumstances can we exclude other victims, who are equally innocent and unfairly treated by history, such as the victims of fascism and other European dictatorships. In fact, Mr President, less than a month ago, the Council of Europe adopted a resolution on the international condemnation of the Franco régime.</p>
<p class="contents">If one of the objectives of this programme is to forge a European identity based on common values, history and culture and to strengthen European integration on the basis of respect, mutual understanding and appreciation and cultural diversity, the European Parliament must not fail to acknowledge the history of many European countries which for years suffered repression and murder in their fight for freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain’s transition to democracy is inextricably linked to our entry into the European Union twenty years ago. And, within the framework of this programme, it is right to recognise the victims of this black period in our history, because that would quite rightly contribute to strengthening the citizens' ties with the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the lack of budget – which is a reality — cannot justify the exclusion of certain victims at the expense of others. We should not be comparing different wars or quantifying a massacre according the deaths involved, but rather remembering all victims, so that by preserving their memory we can prevent such events from ever happening again.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you, therefore, to support the amendments supported by more than 60 members from different groups in this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, because they will enrich the programme, on the basis of the full recognition of European historical memory and with a view to strengthening a feeling of citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has manifested itself most strikingly in the French and Dutch referenda on ratification of the EU Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">In other countries too, however, including those that joined in May 2004, there are negative manifestations of the information deficit. One positive aspect is the public’s desire for more information, and also their interest in rational and sensible activities. The Citizens for Europe programme under discussion today is an instrument with the potential for fulfilling this demand. Some of the actions set out in it are already proving their value today, and are being intensively pursued. One positive example of this is the twinning programme, which any community can participate in regardless of its size. The programme is particularly amenable to small communities, as it is very easy to obtain a grant and there are no unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles. The minimum grant for funding, for example, meetings between members of partnership communities is set very low so that where there is demand it will not be difficult to find the financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">The twinning partnerships of towns, and the way that citizens work together to solve European questions or to support voluntary organisations, can strengthen shared European values while at the same time respecting national and regional diversity. The Member States must supplement these actions with activities in the areas of culture and education. An emphasis on the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance, as well as support for multiculturalism and multilingualism should be recognised as a priority and a common interest. I would like to end by expressing my appreciation for the work of the rapporteur and for the willing cooperation of the Committee on Culture and Education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congratulations on your good work.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the European Union is becoming a fairground where the politicians of the Member States are guided only by their own interests and the objective of satisfying their voters. There is not enough of a feeling among citizens of the Member States of the European Union that they are actually citizens of Europe. In order to develop a feeling of citizenship, it is important to know one another’s history.</p>
<p class="contents">Before and after the Second World War, many European peoples languished under totalitarian rule. My homeland Estonia was wiped from the map by one of the most ruthless dictators in history, Stalin. We no longer had our own flag or national anthem, and our capital city was Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">Stalinism’s twin brother was Nazism. These two ideologies, which were born at the same time, divided Europe among themselves with the Hitler-Stalin Pact. Stalin held the entire eastern part of Europe under dictatorial rule for half a century. Hitler’s war machine violently subjugated the part of Western Europe in which local dictators were unable to seize power themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In seeking the equal remembrance of the victims of Nazism and Stalinism, I am fighting against the merely token acceptance of the new Member States into the European Union. I condemn all forms of totalitarianism. I would like to emphasise, however, that Nazism and Stalinism are the cornerstone of all other totalitarian ideologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Rulers like Franco, Mussolini and Salazar tortured their victims on the example set by Hitler and Stalin. Each Member State of the European Union should take responsibility for the just assessment of their dictator’s actions in their home country. At the moment, however, we are discussing Stalinism and Nazism, which transcended and did not respect state borders.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the duty of the Member States to collectively condemn the cruelties of Hitler and Stalin, which split Europe in two and separated it with an Iron Curtain. Let us therefore work together, in the framework of the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme, to jointly remember the victims of Stalinism and Nazism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to congratulate my friend Mr Takkula on his report. It is his first report, it is a big report and he has done an excellent job in raising all the key issues. I support every bit of it. I also support all the wording on Stalin and Hitler. I must admit that, although I am not a member of the committee, I fully support what Mrs Pack said. It is quite amazing that the chairman of the committee, Mr Sifunakis, takes a completely opposite view to what has been decided in the committee, but so be it.</p>
<p class="contents">If I did not know Mr Takkula well, having read this report, I might even think that he is a federalist, but perhaps not this time round.</p>
<p class="contents">My more general remark is really about European citizenship and national citizenship. Some people seem to think that we are somehow trying to create a European prototype, but I disagree. I am a federalist myself, but I think that identity is first local, then national and after that European.</p>
<p class="contents">I have lived in Brussels for seven years. To be quite honest, when I came to Brussels, I had a few prejudices about nationalities. For example: Finns do not talk at all; every German has the same sense of humour as our President in the chair today; every Frenchman always speaks through three points; no Italian has ever drawn an operative conclusion. That was the feeling I had when I came to Brussels. Those are the national prototypes that we have. To be quite honest, after seven years I think that my prejudices have only strengthened – in a very positive way, but, nevertheless strengthened. So we are certainly not creating any kind of a prototype European. It seems to me that the only time that we can really feel European is, for instance, through sport: the Ryder Cup in golf is a great example, and Eurovision is something that brings us together.</p>
<p class="contents">However, all in all, I think this report is great because it gives us four pieces of action. I can support each and every one of them. It has no propaganda in it, so I hope the Commission takes it seriously and takes on board all the changes that Mr Takkula has proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With a budget of less than EUR 300 million for seven years and with 36 countries involved, expectations are high. Nevertheless, in view of its four different action fields, implementation will be difficult. For this reason, I should like to thank Mr Takkula, who has made real efforts to achieve a balance and also to refrain from making any cuts in the small budget, for example in the field of town-twinning activities. These are citizens’ projects that strengthen European consciousness and identity at grass-roots level. We want to promote the active, civil-society projects in the EU, in which there is so much idealism: they need our attention and support. We want to support the public-relations activities of the Europe Houses and of the institutes operating throughout Europe. I would ask the Commissioner to incorporate our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth action is also very important to me, as a German Social Democrat. I hail from Nuremberg, the city of the Nazi Party conferences. In the present day, the city is making efforts to shake off its old image and restyle itself as a city of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone wanting to actively shape the future needs to be aware of his past, which is why action 4, ‘active European remembrance’, is so important. We need to remember the victims of the violent Nazi and Stalinist regimes, and also the relevant places and memorial sites. We also need to remember all the victims of dictatorships, however, and therefore I would ask you to support Amendments 54 and 55 by my group. The reason for this request is that we should be very careful not to play victims off against one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much has been said in this House about economic and social integration, but there has been a tendency to overlook the role of historical integration as a key element of integration. Europe has always reflected its past and continues to draw on that legacy today. Communism and Nazism were two totalitarian regimes that contributed equally to the bloody history of the 20th century. It is not appropriate to use the term Stalinism. Communism in general was a curse of the 20th century.</p>
<p class="contents">The nature of relations between European countries and nations is coloured by historical experiences, but even the most difficult and painful of these can be transformed into strong ties of affection. Pope John Paul II said that despite tremendous achievements in a number of areas, the 20th century was characterised by the mystery of evil. We have carried this legacy of good and evil with us into the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">The House has debated issues relating to historical policy on a number of occasions. I could mention the debates on the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, the anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the 25th anniversary of Solidarity for example. These debates revealed the extent of misunderstanding of basic historical facts and of our historical legacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The notion of a European identity must be based on acceptance of the truth about our past. Remembering the victims of mass deportations and extermination undertaken by Communism and the Nazis will not foster distrust amongst nations. It will instead remind us all of the fundamental right to freedom, the rule of law, and respect from others. This is the only way for the European Union to make its founding fathers’ message of unity in diversity a reality.</p>

We can easily agree that, although the consensus is strong, there are sometimes questions about programmes or European identity, but that identity is none the less emerging. We perhaps see it more from the outside than the inside, but it is complementary to our basic personal, national, local, regional dimensions; it is enriching.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remember tragedies in Europe, especially at a time when we are still looking for war criminals on the continent. It is not such a long time ago that many parts of Europe were full of bloody places, borders and mass graves, and it is important to remember that. I do not need to answer specific points because I covered them at the start.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding finance, we are in negotiations. I hope that strong support by Parliament, as seen recently in relation to citizenship, youth and education programmes, will be seen at the final meetings of the Troika or current negotiations on the Financial Perspective. We will mainstream citizenship issues via different actions and different programmes, because that is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point concerns the title. I think both the Commission and Parliament are partially correct. It is only partially correct to state that there is either Europe for citizens, or citizens for Europe. If you recall John Fitzgerald Kennedy’s message to the people, Europe can be built only on the foundations of mature citizens, and a mature Europe can deliver many answers to our citizens. So, we need both: Europe for citizens and citizens for Europe. I believe that this programme can contribute to such a mature community<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p class="contents">European unity cannot be imposed from above, but rather must be the outcome of everyone’s sense of responsibility. The actors must be families, social groupings, the widespread voluntary sector and grass-roots associations.</p>
<p class="contents">Bringing people together and encouraging local communities to meet to exchange experiences, opinions and values are all necessary for European citizenship to mature. Being a citizen of Europe means being part of a culture that has at its centre the richness of a life lived responsibly and loved creatively, a life to which we courageously bear witness against all comers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us keep an active remembrance, in which the horrors that we Europeans have witnessed may serve as a warning for a different future. Such a remembrance in my city, Padua, in my region, Veneto, will breathe life into the creation of a Remembrance Museum in Villa Venier, in the municipality of Vo’ Euganeo. The ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme is therefore an inspired idea that should be developed and passed on to every single country, town and municipality in Europe, and it has our staunch support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
