<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   – Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the European Parliament has been asked to make a statement on the tsunami and the destruction in Fukushima. After my statement there will be a debate in the form of a round of addresses from Members speaking on behalf of the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">One year ago, on 11 March 2011, Japan was devastated by a triple disaster. First, an enormous earthquake, measuring nine on the Richter scale, rocked the country. Then, a tsunami with 20-metre-high waves laid waste to a 400-kilometre-long coastal strip. The next day, the first of three reactor blocks at the Fukushima Daiichi power station exploded. A nuclear meltdown occurred – the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we in the European Parliament are commemorating the 19 000 people who lost their lives, the thousands who lost family members and friends, the more than 340 000 people who had to flee radioactive contamination and all those who lost their house and home for ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The dignity with which the Japanese people reacted to this triple disaster moved the whole world. The bravery of the nameless heroes of Fukushima, who entered the reactor and laid down their lives in order to prevent worse from happening, touched us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The drive with which the population approached reconstruction impressed us all deeply. The Fukushima nuclear accident initiated a global debate about the safety and the future of nuclear power.</p>
<p class="contents">This contentious debate is one that also permeates this House. Every one of us must decide for himself or herself where they stand on this debate. It is a good thing, though – however contentious it may be – that we have that debate in this House. That is because, although the energy mix – the individual combination of energy supplies from different sources – and thus also the decision in favour of or against nuclear power lies within the competence of the Member States – in other words it falls within the sovereignty of the national governments and parliaments – there should still be a debate at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, all of us in Europe are connected to the power grids of our neighbours. The energy decisions of one country have an impact on the lives of people in other countries. Ultimately, 30% of Europe’s energy supply is derived from nuclear power – and whether or not that is safe is something that affects us all.</p>
<p class="contents">While the earthquake and the tsunami in Japan were tragic natural disasters, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl was man-made. Fukushima could have been prevented. That is the lesson that has to be learnt from this accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside all differences of opinion between those who advocate and those who oppose nuclear power, there is one thing that is therefore undisputed, namely that we must do everything in our power to ensure the maximum possible degree of safety for nuclear power stations.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to many institutions, which merely discussed and debated after the tragedy, the European Parliament took action. We welcome the efforts made over the last year by the European Commission and the experts we have here in Parliament to make nuclear power safer.</p>
<p class="contents">That includes the voluntary stress tests carried out on 143 nuclear power stations in the EU in all 14 Member States in which nuclear power stations operate. The Commission will be submitting its final report on this in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, at this point, to reiterate my demand that nuclear power stations that fail the stress test must be withdrawn from the grid immediately. I cannot imagine that it makes sense to carry out a stress test and then to continue to operate any nuclear power station that does not pass that test.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the report on nuclear waste that we adopted in the House over the last year. For the first time there are binding rules and safety standards for handling nuclear waste right across Europe. In February, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety reached agreement on a report on energy efficiency. Cuts of 20% are to be achieved by 2020 in order to bring about more efficient energy use across Europe. The truth is that that would be an important milestone on the way to achieving our ambitious 20-20-20 targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us learn the lesson from the Fukushima disaster, which brought immeasurable suffering to the people of Japan, that, irrespective of the often irreconcilable differences of opinion that there are on this issue – in favour of or against nuclear power – we have a common responsibility for ensuring the maximum possible safety of nuclear power. We in the European Parliament, especially, have a responsibility to continue to implement tangible measures in future, as we have in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The warning from Fukushima is clear: not everything that can be done is justifiable.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean-Pierre Audy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday at 06.46, Strasbourg time, time stopped in Japan. In a joint prayer, the Japanese people turned their thoughts to those killed or injured by the natural disaster together with the serious nuclear incident at the Fukushima power plant.</p>
<p class="contents">One year earlier, on 11 March at the same time, 06.46, an earthquake of 8.9 on the Richter scale caused the loss of the plant’s electricity supply. The reactors shut down and the emergency generators went into operation. Unfortunately, 55 minutes later, 14-metre high waves devastated the plant: 19 000 dead, 340 000 displaced persons, an earthquake and a tsunami produced the greatest nuclear disaster in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) I would like to thank you for your initiative and to say that the dignity and courage of the Japanese people, their government and the families affected are in our thoughts. We are thinking of them.</p>
<p class="contents">This disaster led to a political debate, as you have pointed out, involving all sectors of the public. In the heat of the moment, some states decided either to shut down nuclear power plants immediately or to gradually phase them out. However, worldwide there are more nuclear plants being constructed than the number shut down, and so the issue is a topical one.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, this disaster is just one in the list of increasingly frequent disasters worldwide. Who could forget the earthquake in Haiti or the Deepwater oil disaster? Commissioner, the European Union reacted immediately, and I would like to thank your colleague, Mr Oettinger.</p>
<p class="contents">After the disaster on 11 March, the European Council met immediately, on 24 and 25 March 2011, and called for a comprehensive evaluation of the safety risks of nuclear power for all the plants in the European Union. The European Commission was asked to review the June 2009 directive on nuclear safety, and the programme was thus set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, all the Member States have carried out their evaluations; we await a peer review and the European Council in June 2012 will make an overall assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE Group would like thinking to focus on the following areas for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to safety standards, the European Union and its citizens must be assured that we have the best safety standards in the world. We know that these safety standards develop in line with scientific expertise and that they must be continually amended and made binding upon operators in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, governance must be reviewed so as to give greater independence to the national safety authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to transparency. In this sector, transparency must be beyond reproach. All national safety authorities must make their documents public to ensure that their citizens are properly informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must review development and the technical criteria relating to the selection of sites where nuclear power plants are located.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we must jointly improve emergency preparedness and response. I would like to remind Members of the proposal to create a European civil protection force.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, operators’ civil liability needs to be clarified. We must include all the costs of nuclear power within cost prices, including possible risks and the costs of decommissioning power plants, either through suitable insurance, or through own capital requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventhly, the full costs should be included – sorry, I just said that, in relation to risks and decommissioning.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighthly, I would like to mention scientific training and research. On this point, I welcome the Commission’s proposals to extend the Euratom research programme by two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Worldwide, we will not be able to resolve our problems concerning energy and competitiveness, maintaining our lifestyle while tackling global warming, without addressing all these issues, which are necessary for the operation of nuclear power plants throughout the world and, in particular, for maximum safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The focus shifts. Those of us who are decision-makers concentrate on other crises and problems, while the eyes of the media are turned towards something else. It is therefore extremely positive and important that we are now marking the anniversary of the disaster in Fukushima here in the European Parliament and other places.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of 11 March 2011 represented a disaster that few could have imagined beforehand. There was an earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown that resulted in the almost immediate deaths of more than 19 000 people and in 325 000 people becoming homeless.</p>
<p class="contents">The small town of Ukedo, situated immediately north of Fukushima, was completely destroyed. Many of its inhabitants also died. The town is no longer habitable. Its population has fragmented, with the people now living in surrounding towns. The town still exists, nevertheless. It remains in the survivors and in relations between people from workplaces, schools and neighbours, but as time goes by, even these links and networks fade away. Nothing will remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Fukushima was not only a human tragedy; this disaster, of course, also awakened the debate concerning nuclear power as an energy source. The most important lesson that I believe we can learn from Fukushima is this simple, but sometimes also difficult one: the future does not lie in nuclear power. Nuclear technology is certain to remain in various forms for a considerable time yet, but if states do not actively choose to build nuclear power plants as a result of policy choices, it will quite simply not be tenable. The market will not invest in nuclear power. Nuclear power is entirely dependent on subsidies. It will therefore become more expensive, while renewable energy will become cheaper. It is as simple as that.</p>
<p class="contents">Each country has the power to decide on its own energy sources. However, the political responsibility now lies with us in the EU, and we in the Member States can demonstrate that it is possible to satisfy the energy needs of the future by means of renewable energy. We are facing a major challenge in this area. The current view of alternative and renewable energy sources is that they are not efficient, sufficiently well developed or sufficiently widespread, and they are not something that is generally used by ordinary industry, society and citizens. If we are to succeed in this task, we need major investments in research, development and infrastructure and in actually cooperating with the market and society in developing this energy source.</p>
<p class="contents">We are holding this debate in order to remember and honour the victims of Fukushima. It is also a springboard for the future. What we need to demonstrate is that it is possible to learn from history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU should, and will, continue to give Japan and the disaster zone all the necessary humanitarian, technical and financial aid and support. In our opinion, Europe’s policy response to the disaster has been satisfactory. It was important that we did not take dramatic decisions with a long-term impact on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed, agreed and coordinated voluntary stress tests. We consider this was the right thing to do. My group looks forward to the final report that will be presented at the European Council in June 2012, and is confident that all the necessary steps will be taken to ensure that our nuclear plants are safe and even able to resist terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also recognise that it is impossible to create a 100% risk-free world. The main question now is what should the nuclear future of the European Union be? It is a question for which there is no common answer. The reality is that we do not have similar views in the European Union on nuclear energy as part of national energy mixes, so we cannot at this moment have a common answer other than that of focusing on the safety of nuclear power.</p>
<p class="contents">The disaster in Japan highlighted the risks of nuclear power, but this was not something we did not know about. Another answer is the common energy market. We should work on this, in order for governments to be able to invest in renewable energy resources that are environmentally sound, affordable and reliable. Even though we can accept nuclear power as part of our energy mix for a while, we will have to look to a different future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found what took place in many countries around the world at the weekend very impressive, as was the strength of the signal that we sent Japan, through which we showed that we will also continue to share the grief and dismay of the entire Japanese people even as we go on from last weekend. I also believe, however, that, one year on from this disaster, we need to give closer attention to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last week, I have had visitors from Japan with me in Brussels who I got to know a few weeks ago during a journey through Japan and to Fukushima. The delegation was headed by Eisaku Sato, who was governor of Fukushima Prefecture for 18 years. The entire delegation from the Fukushima Prefecture made insistent calls on, demands of and requests to the people of Europe that we cannot ignore. The people of the Fukushima Prefecture still feel abandoned in the very difficult and highly dangerous situation in which they live. They do not feel that the Japanese Government is actually taking serious pains to protect them, apart from anything else because the limit values for the ordinary population living in the region around Fukushima have been raised to such an extent that they now correspond to those normally applied to workers in the most heavily contaminated control areas of nuclear power plants. In other words, the Japanese authorities are very consciously accepting an increase in cases of cancer, other diseases and genetic damage in the Fukushima Prefecture in the years, decades and generations to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot look the other way here, and we must finally force the World Health Organisation to act responsibility in such disaster situations. It must not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to force it to turn a blind eye to so much irresponsible behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">The IAEA should also be facing criticism from Euratom, the European Commission and the Member States for claiming that the Fukushima nuclear power station was under control and for failing to retract that claim on the anniversary of the disaster. As things stand, the Japanese experts do not agree about the status of the situation in the ruins of Fukushima. Nobody can say how much reactor fuel is still smouldering there; the ruins have not even stabilised as yet. At any time, a tremor could cause these ruins to collapse, an event that would trigger the next disaster for the local population.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an objective of the IAEA to spread nuclear power throughout the world. We must not leave it, in this situation, with the responsibility for the entire world. Politicians, experts, farmers and citizens from Japan and the region are begging and demanding that they should be sent an international task force. The experiences gained in Europe from the Chernobyl disaster could save lives in Japan and could perhaps even help stabilise the power station.</p>
<p class="contents">The strongest criticism in Japan is aimed at the European stress test, which is now also being applied there. Of the 54 reactors, only two are currently operating. All the others are being inspected under stress test criteria. Toshiba engineers, which is to say people who are very much part of Japan’s ‘nuclear village’, the committed community that champions nuclear power, have told me that the Fukushima nuclear power station passed this stress test with flying colours a year before the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this stress test is truly dubious. The claim that we are improving safety by applying this stress test will be reviewed, in case of doubt, after the next nuclear disaster. It sends a shiver down my spine to think of a European-tested nuclear power station in Japan failing to withstand the next disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the representative of the Commission to carefully consider what Europe has to offer. Our know-how in relation to the energy switch-over and our experiences from Chernobyl are what is needed in Japan – certainly not the European stress test. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of the nearly 90 000 residents who were evacuated in the weeks after the disaster are still reluctant to return to their home towns, where radiation in some areas measures roughly 25 times the level for evacuation in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">The unprecedented events in Japan and the impact of the earthquake and tsunami on the Fukushima nuclear power plant have raised the profile of nuclear safety and led to questions around the world about the need for nuclear power. We take what happened at Fukushima very seriously and nuclear safety is, and must be, a top priority. There are lessons for both government and industry on how we continuously improve both existing and new-built nuclear power stations.</p>
<p class="contents">Following Fukushima the stress tests and investigation need to be robust and evidence-based so that the right lessons are learnt. We must remember that the Fukushima incident showed that two natural disasters can happen at the same time. The nuclear power plant could withstand the earthquake, but could not cope with a 20-metre-high tsunami that caused the power supply to the plant to cut off.</p>
<p class="contents">Here it is important to learn the lessons from the Japanese response to the crisis. Preparedness and disaster response capacity for an event of this scale should be constantly under review as part of an evolving process that takes account of the individual specific site. We must praise the brave emergency teams who brought the situation under control, but there were clearly issues that the authorities and TEPCO could and should have handled differently.</p>
<p class="contents">The events at Fukushima were a shock to us all, but I am confident that the reaction was, and still should be, sensible, proportionate and based on the facts. As the Commission is currently reviewing the EU’s legal framework, we would urge it to take fully into account the lessons from Fukushima and the stress tests; a rushed piece of legislation could have negative consequences for both safety and energy security. Regulators and industry should work together to ensure that we make continuous improvements to the nuclear safety of both existing and future nuclear power plants. After all, nuclear safety is paramount and should be at the top of our agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we pay heartfelt tribute to the many thousands of victims of Fukushima. We are honouring the victims and telling them that it has taught us a lesson: we need to learn to live with natural disasters, but, with nuclear disasters, we have the obligation to prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, that does not seem to be true. One year on from Fukushima, new nuclear plants continue to be built. One year on from Fukushima, new nuclear plants continue to be planned. Japan has, unfortunately, the memory of enduring tragedies: Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We Europeans too have the memory of an enduring tragedy: Chernobyl.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, Fukushima obliges us to reopen a debate that should never have been closed: the nuclear energy debate. One year ago, nuclear energy was unquestionable for the Japanese; today, two thirds of Japanese do not want it. They know that it costs lives. They know that this cost has no price; on the contrary, it is a cost that increases from one generation to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy of stubbornly favouring nuclear is the politics of arrogance. Here in Europe too we have a majority of public opinion against nuclear, but, despite this, nothing seems to change. There are 320 000 refugees in Japan today; 100 000 of those will never be able to go home again. What was once familiar is now dangerous; what was once comfort is now in ruins. It is the ruin of a building or house with radioactive vegetation; it is the ruined soil or the contaminated water. Moreover, Fukushima cannot be visited like, for example, a Maya ruin or a Roman ruin can. Nevertheless, like those, Fukushima too paints a portrait of a civilisation and the portrait painted by the ruin of Fukushima is that of our civilisation. The civilisation that chose to include a deadly technology in its development model.</p>
<p class="contents">No one is at fault for an earthquake and a tsunami, but there are people responsible for a nuclear disaster. In Japan, like Europe, many citizens have decided to set up nuclear-abolition campaigns. They know better than anyone that safe nuclear energy is something that does not exist. They know better than anyone that no stress test can simulate what happened at Fukushima. We know, therefore, that energy policies are national but, Mr President, there are no borders in the sky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is quite true that the cases are very different: with regard to Chernobyl it was an accident inside the power plant; in the case of Fukushima, the causes were external, an earthquake and a tsunami of unprecedented intensity among the greatest that have ever occurred, as far as we know from the history of the planet. This, however, can only raise questions about the safety of nuclear power.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not one of those who claim – given the incidents – that we absolutely must reject nuclear power, although in many countries, this seems to be the way they are going, but in any case a thorough discussion must necessarily take place, while taking into account, as has often been repeated, that it is a matter for Member States but that Parliament should also have a say.

This anniversary is an opportunity for us to convey our condolences to those who are suffering and to ask ourselves what lessons we have learned and what we have done about nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Long before the Fukushima tragedy, the Commission initiated a process of improving nuclear safety with the aim of developing a consistent European dimension based on high standards. The first milestone was the adoption of the Nuclear Safety Directive in 2009, followed by the Waste Management Directive in 2011. I would like to thank Parliament for the constructive role it has played in the adoption of these two key elements.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Fukushima accident, the Commission initiated a comprehensive risk and safety assessment of all nuclear power plants operating in the EU. This was endorsed by the European Council and by Parliament. As you know, the stress tests have been under way since June 2011. They are based on a common EU methodology. I listened very carefully to what Ms Harms said and I will convey this message to my colleague, Commissioner Oettinger.</p>
<p class="contents">All 14 Member States that operate nuclear power plants – and Lithuania, which is decommissioning its nuclear power producing unit – are participating in the voluntary process and have provided national reports which are now subject to peer reviews. As you know, our neighbouring countries are also committed to the EU stress test methodology. Switzerland and Ukraine are participating. The results of the peer reviews, which are an essential part of the process, will be known by the end of April. The final report will be presented by my colleague, Commissioner Oettinger, to the European Council at the end of June 2012. He has asked me to tell you that he will also be available for discussions on it with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the stress tests is expected to provide an objective overview of the nuclear safety situation in the EU, and will form a basis for legislative or non-legislative proposals that the Commission will bring forward to improve the nuclear safety framework. The main areas for improvement could be technical safety requirements, nuclear safety governance and emergency preparedness and response. Security threats, including malevolent acts, are an important part of stress tests, and a discussion group on nuclear security has been set up in the Council of the European Union to address these. The first results of that group will be published in its final report, also in June. This report will be annexed to the Commission report, which will be presented to the Council and to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the resulting recommendations is a national responsibility. However, monitoring and reporting mechanisms should be established to ensure the implementation of the necessary safety improvements. The fact that the results will be made public will help to ensure that all the necessary steps are taken to guarantee the utmost safety and security. The Commission will closely and actively follow all developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, it is necessary to strengthen the safety culture and emergency preparedness worldwide. The stress tests are already acting as an international benchmark, and from the very beginning the Commission involved the neighbouring countries, in order not to be alone in going ahead with these, but to extend the safety culture beyond our frontiers. International cooperation, particularly in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is more important than ever. The Commission intends to contribute to the updating of the Convention on Nuclear Safety with the aim of increasing its effectiveness, governance and enforceability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
