<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had very much hoped to be with you to discuss this point. She has been highly engaged developing the Commission's activities on Belarus since we took office. On behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Commission, I am pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with you on the situation in Belarus and on the Commission's work to support democratisation and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is deeply concerned about the absence of democracy and the rule of law and the lack of respect for human rights in Belarus. Belarus is in clear breach of its international commitments under the OSCE and UN charters. We have recently seen a worrying deterioration in the situation. The regime restricts human rights even more and is taking further steps against non-governmental organisations, undermining the rights of minorities, imprisoning citizens for political reasons and curtailing freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">We have condemned firmly the acts of intimidation by the Belarussian authorities against the Union of the Poles in Belarus. These incidents occur in the context of growing repression of political parties, NGOs and independent media outlets in Belarus. We believe such interference undermines minority rights, thereby contravening standards of governance to which Belarus has signed up as part of its commitments to the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Belarus has introduced decrees that place even more restrictions on foreign assistance, thereby isolating itself and the Belarussian people still further.</p>
<p class="contents">You may ask how the Commission has reacted. In response to the growing repression in Belarus we have increased our funding for democratisation and human rights by transferring EUR 2 million from the TACIS Programme to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights Programme, one of the two instruments which do not require the consent of the government. The TACIS Programme was refocused to address the needs of the population with the full participation of the civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">This year we have already signed 27 small contracts with NGOs worth EUR 3 million. We shall issue a further call for proposals under the EIDHR Programme in October, with a total budget of EUR 420 000.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also in the process of allocating more than EUR 1.7 million for three specific new projects for Belarus. These will be implemented by OSCE - ODIHR, the UNDP and the Nordic Council of Ministers. These projects will focus on human rights, democratisation, civil society and independent educational institutions such as the European Humanities University-in-exile.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall continue to address the broader needs of the population with the TACIS Programme and focus on health and social issues, higher education, training and environmental matters.</p>
<p class="contents">When alleviating Chernobyl-related problems, our approach is to fund project proposals put forward by the local communities.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most significant developments in our assistance is our support for independent broadcasting. In response to the suggestions from this Parliament and elsewhere, starting from 1 November we shall fund a daily radio news programme. The idea is to increase awareness of human rights and democracy issues in the Belarussian population, and provide it with factual news on developments inside and outside Belarus, which would not otherwise be available. The broadcasting will kick off in Russian, and Belarussian programmes will be phased in as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The start of independent broadcasting is a major step, and I am delighted that we were the first donor to launch such initiatives for Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we shall open a Commission office in Minsk early next year. The office will be headed by a <span class="italic">chargé d'affaires</span>. This will facilitate our contacts with local civil society and it will also assist our coordination efforts and the follow-up of our activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also looked at how best to ensure that all our policies towards Belarus are consistent and coherent. In trade we have carried out an investigation into violations of trade union rights under the Generalised System of Preferences and looked into the definition of annual textiles quotas. We also keep the EU list of senior officials covered by the visa ban under continual review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken the lead in the discussions on how to improve cooperation among the donors active in Belarus. We have organised three donors meetings this year. The first one was in Vilnius in March, followed by one in Kiev in July, and the latest one was held last week in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of democratisation in Belarus and the wellbeing of its people are matters that are very close to our heart and to the Commission's objectives. We are doing all we can to support those striving for the development of a democratic and pluralistic society in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, in addition to keeping up our focus on democratisation and human rights, we encourage the Belarussian democratic forces to work closely together. This is crucial in view of next year's presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to welcoming Belarus as a full partner in the European neighbourhood policy, as soon as the country lives up to its commitments on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, not only in words but also in deeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was more than a historical resolution, however, as it was also partly an appeal to solidarity within the European Union. We are now working on a resolution concerning Belarus, and this resolution should be an expression of our European solidarity towards those who need solidarity shown to them at present, as is certainly true of our friends in Belarus, the Belarussian people.</p>
<p class="contents">One might well ask why another resolution on Belarus is needed, when the last one was only adopted in July, just before the summer break. As the Commissioner rightly pointed out, however, the situation in Belarus is changing very rapidly. The political situation is getting worse with every month. The latest development to come to our notice concerned Mr Lukashenko’s administration’s crackdown on the democratically elected leadership of the Union of Poles in Belarus. The whole of the civilised world saw for itself how the largest organisation in Belarussian civil society was persecuted and its leaders brutally deprived of their office.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Polish Member of the European Parliament, I would like to offer sincere thanks to the Members of this House who helped and supported us in those difficult times. Representatives of all the political groups were involved. I believe the help and support provided by other Belarussians who share the same fate as Poles in Belarus was equally important. In particular, I should like to thank representatives of the Belarussian opposition for their support of the Union of Poles in Belarus at this difficult time. It points to the emergence of a network of solidarity in Europe. This network enables people who often needed help themselves in the past to support those who are currently in difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the European Commission should also be congratulated on the matter referred to by the Commissioner, that is, on the first signs of a review of the European Union’s policy towards Belarus. These are good signs, and I trust the good work will be kept up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These events should be of concern to each and every Member State here. This is one of the deficiencies in our approach: not all of us consider Belarus as our backyard issue, as indeed it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not be repeating what has been said. Instead, allow me to register the fact that significant progress has been registered since the last time we met and tackled this subject in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, Commissioner, the Commission is opening a representative office in Minsk and a broadcasting project is kicking off, even though some of us are not that happy with the way it is being tackled – and they may be right. Nevertheless, this is a first step on which we have long been insisting and the Commission should be commended for having kept its word.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must not stop here. The statements made by the country's President during the United Nations Summit are not a good omen. Some of our colleagues are still in prison – I mention Mikola Statkevich as a symbol for them all.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this interest in Belarus will not wane, as political appointments in certain Member States come and go. The situation in Belarus is too delicate to be used as a political football. It should be a long-term commitment – and, let us hope, not that long-term; let us hope that the situation is solved in the medium term. But it should be a commitment of the European Union.</p>

It is governed by an individual who has himself declared the Soviet Union to be his homeland, and who regrets the disappearance of that wonderful country from the map of Europe. This individual is attempting to cut Belarus off from Europe. He is clearly afraid of the wind of freedom that swept through Europe precisely as a result of Solidarity’s activities. I think it would be extremely important to ensure that as Mr Lukaszenko introduces charges for crossing the border, the Member States of the Union start to issue free visas to Belarussians, thus making it abundantly clear that Europe is not turning its back on Belarus as its leader maintains.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not simply a matter of gestures of this nature. Activities in Belarus need to be supported also. I was delighted to hear the Commissioner say that the European Commission is launching programmes for Belarus, but I am distressed that all this has taken so long. After all, the year is drawing to a close. I understand that there were technical obstacles to overcome. If these are permanent obstacles, it seems to me that there is a will in this House to cut through bureaucratic red tape and help the Commission to act efficiently and effectively. If we fail to do so and do not help Belarus, then not only will Belarus be a stain on the map of Europe but it will also be a stain on our consciences. Europe needs to be synonymous with freedom, and that means freedom for Belarus too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A dictatorship with no respect for human rights or for democracy is being systematically installed before our eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">This convergence of views even extends to the Commission and the Council. We must finally take action and use all means at our disposal to promote democracy and pluralism in Belarus. Those were Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s words.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not, however, satisfied with what has been done to date. The Commission has left the Polish/Baltic/Ukrainian initiative out in the cold. There is a very tricky danger on the eastern border, tensions among the neighbouring states, and no common foreign policy. Civil society, the only source of democratic potential and of hope in that country, is not receiving sufficient support.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commissioner has proposed up to now is insufficient. Our repertoire of diplomatic protests has been far from exhausted. The use of sanctions should be much more modulated and targeted. Talk is not enough. There must be much more financial support for civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commissioner to develop a special programme and to hasten to sit down at the table with the Council, so that genuinely coherent political, financial and economic measures can be taken and thus 2006 can see the beginnings of democracy in Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am, in general, able to agree with all the positions put forward in the resolution, but I believe that one area could be developed further, namely the significance of the independent trade union movement in Belarus. Independent trade unions have been among the key organisers of the opposition to the Lukashenko regime, but they are now fighting for their survival and existence under the tyranny. There is a great deal of cooperation between trade unions in other EU countries, for example Sweden, and independent trade unions in Belarus. I hope that they will be informed about the EU’s support for the democratic opposition. We have been reminded this week of the significance of Solidarity in Poland, and it is of course important to have a strong and independent trade union movement in order to achieve the changes required in Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said he would revive the Soviet Union. Lukashenko has delivered on his promise. The historic white-red-white Belarussian flag is banned and Russian is the official national language. This absurd antinational policy has now reached its nadir with the existence, in Minsk, of an underground lyceum, which is the only secondary school left in the country in which lessons are still taught in the mother tongue, until such time, that is, as the secret service tracks down the private dwellings that also function as classrooms these days.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I support the Commission’s initiative to contribute financially to independent radio transmissions for Belarus. In fact, that is what the Polish Government is already doing. Brussels would do well to take a leaf out of their book. Not only do the Poles earmark considerably more funds, but their programmes will also start straightaway in Belarussian this autumn. Meanwhile, the drastically deteriorated relation between Lukashenko’s Belarus and the three eastern EU Member States – Poland, Lithuania and Latvia – must be weighing heavily on the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The oppressive regime in Minsk even acts as if a NATO intervention were underway. This may result in a small border conflict. The major security risks for the European Union of 25 inherent in this prompt me to address a few questions to the Commission. What does it make of the initiative by Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine to coordinate their politics in respect of Belarus? Has the Commission taken steps to persuade Russia to shoulder its responsibility as President of the G8 and make a positive contribution to reducing the tensions caused by Lukashenko’s domestic and foreign policy?</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you Commissioner, as you are replacing Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, to pass on those questions that are, after all, essential to the EU’s security policy, not least in view of the CFSP.

The latest in the long list of such violations was the nationalistic hounding of Poles, culminating in the Union of Poles in Belarus being declared illegal and its activists persecuted.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of ground to cover, but this does not mean that we should be content with a ‘softly softly’ approach. On the contrary, we should drive forward relentlessly in our dealings with Belarus. If we are not to revisit the issue of violations of human rights in Belarus on a weekly basis, a permanent rapporteur for Belarus on the Commission’s side is needed. So too is an effective method of funding the democratic forces, and it is hard to envisage how such support could be offered without a specific instrument devoted to human rights. This instrument should be as flexible, fast and effective as possible concerning the provision of support in unfavourable legal circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we are holding yet another debate on Belarus testifies to the weakness demonstrated by Parliament and the European Union in this regard. This is the fifth time Belarus has been on our agenda, yet we have still not succeeded in prioritising the issue and making it a condition of the development of good relations between the European Union and Russia. It is true that the European Commission has been promising more and more, but it is still dragging its feet and acting reluctantly, slowly and passively where Belarus is concerned. As a result, the European Union’s credibility in this area has been compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to point out that even the administrative procedures adopted by the quasi-grotesque regime in Minsk have proved more efficient and effective than ours in the case of radio broadcasts. Belarus is broadcasting to the European Union, but from our side there is nothing but a deafening silence. I should like to conclude with a more general observation, namely that Europe has cast itself in such a ridiculous light with regard to Belarus that it has rendered its declaration on the Union’s common foreign policy completely meaningless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that we are now working actively on this important issue. This is due to our Polish fellow Members, in particular, and I should like to thank them explicitly for this.</p>
<p class="contents">It shows that history has an impact. There have been negative, nationalistic eras in history, but also repeated positive examples of coexistence. One such example was the coexistence of Poles, Lithuanians and Belarussians in a federation in the Middle Ages. That was Europe in miniature, and that Europe has repercussions today, in that we and our Polish fellow Members are all supporting not just the Polish minority in Belarus, but the Belarussian people as a whole; a people which is suffering oppression on a massive scale and which is unfortunately also threatened with attempts to restore the Soviet Union in one form or another.</p>
<p class="contents">Such attempts are absurd and doomed to failure but, as we know, these ideas are being toyed with further east. It is in the fundamental interests of the European Union, therefore, to give our neighbour Belarus and its people and civil society, much greater support than we have been doing and, in particular, to ensure that media freedom is pushed through.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to criticise in no uncertain terms the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, which broadcasts its programmes in that important European country in Russian: that is to say, in the language of the colonial power that oppressed Belarus for many years and shares responsibility for the situation now prevailing there. It is the right of the Belarussian people to be respected as a unique European culture, and this should also be reflected in the media promoted by the European Union. This culture forms an important part of the community of the European peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost 450 000 individuals used Internet Cafés in Minsk in 2004. At the same time, however, the state firm Beltelecom which is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Communications, continues to hold a monopoly over Internet connections. Mr Lukashenko’s regime is doing its best to control use of the Internet by civil society. It is also persecuting and oppressing individuals active in cyberspace, invoking undemocratic articles of the criminal code for the purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should be exploiting the most modern means of communication as it strives to promote human rights in Belarus. The role of the Internet in providing independent information should be the same as that of the radio in overthrowing dictatorships in the 20th century.

The 1995 Council of Europe framework convention on the protection of national minorities is being systematically and brutally infringed as regards the Union of Poles in Belarus and also other minorities such as the Roma. All this is happening in a European country located just across the Union’s external border. The European Parliament traditionally and quite rightly responds to violations of human rights, including the rights of national minorities in different parts of the world. Parliament cannot therefore remain indifferent to events in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Independence and Democracy Group supports the draft joint resolution, especially concerning the situation of Poles in Belarus. I therefore call for priority to be given to supporting the Union of Poles in Belarus and its legitimate leaders. Aid should be channelled primarily through Polish bordering regions. It should be clearly understood that the key to a genuine solution to most of the problems in Belarus is not actually held by Mr Lukashenko, but by his Russian godfather Mr Putin, a former KGB officer.

The European Commission does not have an adequate action plan to foster the development of democracy in practice. Occasionally it seems that, as far as the Commission is concerned, Belarus does not exist – it simply is not there. The coordination of action and information between European Union institutions, the Council of Europe and the United Nations is totally inadequate. The democratic forces in Belarus are currently totally fragmented.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to call on the Commission to draft an action plan to bring the forces of democracy together. Similarly, the Commission must continue to demand the immediate release of Mihail Marinich, the opposition leader who was convicted on political grounds. In relation to setting up an independent broadcasting station for Belarus, I would like to draw attention to two matters. Firstly, I would like to express my extreme disappointment at the fact that, because of the conditions of the competition that has been announced, the broadcasting organisations of the Baltic States and Poland cannot in practice participate. They cannot even take part in a consortium. However, it is precisely these neighbours of Belarus who have the greatest expertise regarding the processes taking place in that country. Secondly, broadcasts must be primarily in Belarussian, as Mr Posselt has already mentioned, so that the population can perceive them as their own. The fact that many people in Belarus know Russian better, and do not know Belarussian, is a direct consequence of Russification. That is a process we should not encourage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This impact remains to be felt, however. Funds from the European Initiative for Democracy have yet to be allocated. The solidarity fund for families of oppressed politicians is still under discussion. The Venice Commission has not been requested to conduct an international study on the validity of the referendum enabling President Lukashenko to continue exercising totalitarian rule for further terms in office. No European office has yet opened in Minsk, although the Belarussian Government’s mission is active in Brussels. Individuals who have oppressed non-governmental organisations, minorities and the Protestant churches are able to travel freely across Europe, because the visa sanctions only apply to a couple of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission to be more proactive and to display more commitment to these issues. I suggest drawing up a report on the situation in Belarus in conjunction with hearings and in-depth research, with a view to drafting a plan for the Union’s dealings with Belarus in the short and long term. This report would also be useful in establishing needs and threats, and the resources and types of action the European Union and the Member States should take.

How much longer must dissidents continue to be hounded for their convictions, defending fundamental human rights and standing up for freedom and justice?</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, whilst I am grateful for the action taken to date, I feel the time has come to adopt a more determined stance. How much longer can we tolerate the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded being held in such contempt in Belarus, a country with which the Union has a common border? Sooner or later dictators fall, leaving devastation behind them. I refer to fractured and terrorised societies where individuals lack a spirit of independence and belief in their own worth.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to help the people of Belarus to topple Mr Lukashenko, and we should also help them to lay the foundations for a free civil society and educate the younger generation. We should support the democratic opposition in Belarus and condemn violations of citizens’ freedoms and human rights. The Commission ought to support Belarussian culture, of which the Belarussian language is a part. It would therefore be a mistake to support radio and television broadcasts in Russian. We should not be party to the russification of Belarus, as ordered by Mr Lukashenko. European funds should be devoted to radio and television broadcasts in the Belarussian language. I would like to point out to the Commission that such broadcasts already exist. Broadcasts in Belarussian from radio and television stations in Poland are being received in Belarus, and this work deserves support. Similarly, support should be given to the proposed radio station to be set up by free Belarussians <span class="italic">émigrés</span> in Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine to broadcast to Belarus.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I thank you for your substantive and serious interventions in this debate concerning Belarus and the state of its democracy and human rights. I take note of the points raised and will pass them on so that we can digest them seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank you for your support for the Commission's work, including the opening of the Commission office in Minsk. As Mr Onyszkiewicz said, we cannot fail Belarus; we cannot ignore it. I agree with the various speakers who are very concerned about the road Belarus is still taking.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very concerned about the lack of focus on a strategic interest of Europe, something which is all too common today. We should not, in our ongoing existential reflection, neglect the question as to how we can best enhance a stable zone of liberty and democracy in our south-eastern and eastern neighbourhood, be it for instance Turkey or the Western Balkans, Ukraine or Belarus. This implies, inter alia, that we use to the maximum and further develop the policy tools that are available under the European neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There were some specific questions addressed to the Commissioner, and as I have said, I have passed them on to our services. However, I would like to make a point concerning the language question. Why do we support broadcasting in both Russian and Belarussian? There is one simple fact which we have to take into account: 65% of the Belarussian population speaks Russian at home, while 5% speak Belarussian at home. In order to get our message across, we have to take into account the fact that the majority of the Belarussian population speaks Russian at home. This is precisely why we have opted for broadcasting in both languages, Russian and Belarussian: Russian for pragmatic reasons – that is what most people speak every day; Belarussian for symbolic reasons – this is the language that heralds a new free Belarus, which we are all in favour of.</p>
<p class="contents">The voice of the European Parliament and its support for our initiative adds tremendous weight to the European Union's efforts to push for greater democratisation and respect for human rights in Belarus. This has never been more essential than today, in the run-up to the elections, which if fairly conducted could be a turning point in the country's destiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party. All too often recently, this Parliament has found itself debating the behaviour of the Belarussian Government, the last bastion of Communist authoritarianism in our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">President Lukashenko is continuing his illiberal policy by stifling the voices of a great many, mostly young people, who are demanding a future of freedom for their country.</p>
<p class="contents">Some fundamental rights of the individual are being constantly and deliberately denied by central government, which is instead tightening its grip and preventing citizens from freely expressing their thoughts, their political beliefs and their faith. Minorities in the country do not enjoy adequate protection but instead are often subjected to abuse and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is intolerable that all this is happening on our doorstep.</p>
<p class="contents">While we support President Barroso’s approach, we believe that efforts should be stepped up to increase the European Union’s presence in Minsk: to distribute information, carry out coordination and support activities, and monitor the situation, particularly regarding human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to have the ability and strength to take effective political action, not least through closer cooperation with the opposition political forces in the country, who, with growing support from the people, are fighting to ensure a different and better future for Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
