This policy was re-launched when the United States reworked its strategy and when the ESA and NASA reported exceptional successes that excited the world. Space policy is crucial for international cooperation in research, for the Lisbon strategy and for guaranteeing Europe’s independent access to space. The plan that we are discussing is of a horizontal nature in that it concerns many Community policies, from agriculture to communications. After the Galileo project we are awaiting the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security project. I share the desire to pool investment resources to achieve objectives that no country can achieve on its own, and I agree with the intention to take a more determined approach towards coordinating research, technological innovation and industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two issues, however, that I urge the Commissioner to take note of. The first concerns the repercussions, for the European programme, of the new strategy established by the most important space power in the world, with which we have strong ties in terms of collaboration. The second concerns the discrepancies between Europe’s ambitions and the resources needed to implement the most important part of the space programme, and this seems to be the issue that the White Paper has left open. The complex issues influencing this programme do indeed concern the constituent process as regards the competences for space and common defence, but also the political decisions, both national and Community, that are called for to make the European economy more competitive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe the intergovernmental level is enough today and, in a world where competition in space matters is growing, we must underpin the development of space and the European Union’s space autonomy with a strong political power, which is embodied by the European Union. I believe that is the essence of what has happened during this legislature. Personally, I am glad about it. Another thing that has happened is that we have launched an ambitious programme, the Galileo programme, in which a number of countries in the world are interested, China in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise a number of points about the White Paper and Mr Bodrato’s resolution. The first point is about the budget. I believe it is absolutely essential for us to be very ambitious about space and in particular that our ambitions about space should be part of an industrial policy. An independent space programme is not simply a matter of sending devices into Europe’s space, it is also about mastering the basic technologies and their civilian applications, of which there are a great number.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is about the link between the military and civilian. I think we should tie in our thinking, that of Commissioner Busquin and the DG for Research, with what is happening in the common foreign and security policy, because it is well known that the Americans and all the existing space powers, including the Russians and the Chinese, have devoted a large part of their space developments to military applications.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns enlargement. I think a number of the countries that are going to be joining Europe are not necessarily going to feel interested in Ariane or in space developments whose spin-offs today benefit mainly France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany, but not necessarily Lithuania, Cyprus or Malta. It is therefore very important that we send those countries a message. That is why I have tabled an amendment to the effect that we should bring astronauts from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into the corps of European astronauts and that we should plan a manned flight with one such astronaut very soon in order to involve them in the conquest of space and its magic and so that they will support it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is about US strategy. I do not know whether it is an opportunist strategy on Mr Bush’s part in the run-up to the election campaign. At any rate I am glad that Europe is in on it, but it must not for all that neglect the establishment of Soyuz in Kourou or neglect its independence in space matters. That is what I wanted to say to you, ladies and gentlemen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The White Paper talks clearly about a demand-driven space policy, while both the White Paper and the previous texts and official statements clearly indicate that the aim is to use space for military objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Some say that anyway space systems have a dual purpose: both civil and military. I would merely comment that the decision on one use or the other is a political decision. The fact that, for example, weapons exist which are capable of destroying the whole world does not mean that we will allow them to be used. Others say that space cannot be developed without state funding, and they are right about that, but they add that the only way to obtain such funding within the framework of competition is to develop the military side. I would ask them to tone down their worship of the free market and competition policy and I would counter-propose public funding for space research and exploration. I would also warn about the anger of the grass-roots movement if an attempt is made to use space to serve defence and security policy, a clearly aggressive policy which aims to turn the European Union into a second global policeman at the side of the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">The new approach may serve business interests, which will profit both via market mechanisms and from state funding for military applications. But it does not serve anyone else. On the contrary, the entrance of the European Union into the military use of space is a serious escalation in the arms race, which is extremely dangerous to world peace. It really is a pity that man's most advanced achievements will be used against him. But that is an unavoidable characteristic of the capitalist system. We have no choice but to categorically oppose the policy to commercialise and militarise space. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our fellow citizens often experience Europe only through the distorting mirror of standards, rules and constraints, and we must make space exploration one of the top ambitions of European integration, an ambition that would bring our fellow citizens both pride and definite benefits in their everyday lives, like the Galileo project.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuing a grand design requires resources, however. And today there is not sufficient political will to give European space policy the credits it needs. The Commission has tried, as the White Paper shows. An extra 4.6% increase in space expenditure every year is good, but it is a minimum. The Union’s Heads of State must understand that when President Bush is ordering flights to Mars and China is successfully launching its first manned spacecraft, Europe can no longer allow itself to lag behind. The time has come to change gear and give a real boost to space expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">To do that, we must look to the states, through the ESA and the large national agencies, which, like the DLR in Germany or the CNES in France, have irreplaceable experience. But we should also go beyond the intergovernmental level. The draft Constitution for Europe provides for the beginnings of a Community space policy. I am pleased about that, provided that in return for these new prerogatives the Union becomes a new source of funding for space. We cannot demand new competences without assuming the cost. And we must at the same time continue to seek external funding. The cooperation with India and China through the Galileo project is an example to be followed and built upon as the opportunities arise, with the Russian Federation, for example, like France has just done with the plan to establish a Soyuz launch pad in Kourou.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish by saying that if we really do not want Europe to be excluded from the conquest of space, funding cannot remain public. We must lift the taboos and say clearly, as the resolution invites us to do, that the funding of space policy must be opened up to private industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to pay tribute to Parliament for its unwavering support on these matters and I want to say that it was thanks to this encouragement that the Commission launched a wide-ranging debate in Europe on the future of the space sector, a debate in which some Members of Parliament were directly involved. Following that debate, the Commission adopted a White Paper, some of the important actions from which are raised in your question.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to develop space technology, the Commission proposes increasing public expenditure in the field, once a master plan has been drawn up setting out all the missing technologies, the players concerned and a timetable of measures. The sixth framework programme is already able to contribute to this field, in particular through the priority given to ‘aeronautics and space’ and to information society technologies. The Commission will be looking into how to continue this form of development in the next framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as access to space is concerned, the Commission, in close cooperation with the European Space Agency, supports the implementation of a series of measures, including most importantly the improvement of the launching service offered from the Guiana space centre. This action has already been adopted as a project under the Quickstart growth initiative and was presented and adopted at the last European Council. Definition work on the financial arrangements has begun in liaison with the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Multilateral talks have begun with the other space powers, which should result in the proposal of a regulatory framework that will be acceptable at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is looking into direct involvement in the maintenance of the basic terrestrial infrastructures for the future European space programme.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as Galileo is concerned, the potential role of the private sector should be that of final operator following a selection procedure conducted by the Galileo joint undertaking. The Commission will also be entering into bilateral negotiations with India. And a framework agreement has just been signed between the European Community and China.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the next few days, that is on 3 February, the Commission should be adopting a communication based on a detailed report drawn up with the European Space Agency and the Member States drawing the lessons from the initial phase and setting out an action plan for the ‘Global Monitoring for Environment and Security’ (GMS) initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">For the launch of the subsequent deployment phase, the Commission proposes that a formal coordination structure, possibly drawing on the experience with Galileo, be progressively put in place. The Envisat satellite is universally admired for its environmental monitoring ability and is a marvellous example of earth observation, in the field of which we are in the vanguard of development. Until this structure is put in place for GMS there will be a more lightweight interim solution, as provided in the framework agreement between the European Community and the European Space Agency. In this connection, I would like to point out the importance of Parliament’s opinion for concluding this agreement between the European Community and the ESA.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also drawing up a policy on access to space and launchers, for which the installation of the Soyuz launcher at the Guiana space centre is a specific example of the strategic cooperation that can be established between Russia and Europe. The final decision on this programme is expected to be taken at the European Space Agency’s Council meeting on 4 February.</p>
<p class="contents">In the White Paper, the Commission suggests that the Union should be able to be involved in keeping launch installations operational and in funding work and research with a view to defining a future space transport system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the White Paper, the Commission suggests continuing the activities connected with the international space station, because by so doing the Europeans will improve their experience in the field of prolonged stays in space. In this connection, I was pleased to hear Mr Savary’s suggestion, which of course concerned Europe as a whole, that astronauts from the future accession states should be involved. The international station may also be considered an essential intermediate stage before going on to explore the solar system.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned President Bush’s statement. It requires in-depth analysis. It does of course have consequences that affect us given the investment agreed by the European side, in particular to keep the international station accessible to European astronauts. We should not therefore sell the whole process without receiving assurances that that process, to which we are very committed, will continue. You also know – and this gives food for thought – that the European satellite that is observing Mars has obtained remarkable results, since you have seen the photographs which show that there might be ice on the moon. This was achieved using European technology, even though, sadly, Beagle has not managed similar success. But the spectral analysis of Mars is a leading European technology of which we can be proud.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, building on that, there is also the idea of seeing how we envisage manned flights, so that we are not left out of the race towards those objectives either. In cooperation with the ESA, the Commission will in 2004 be setting up a group of wise men that should enable the European Union to define its position on manned space flight.</p>
<p class="contents">These, in a few words, are the most important aspects. I am truly pleased to conclude by telling you that the Commission is including space and space research in its thinking on the future financial perspectives that are at the heart of the Commission’s debate and which Parliament will, on 10 February I think, be the first to know. We will be giving the first broad outlines of the financial perspectives. And when it comes to financial perspectives, it is clear that research and innovation programmes must have their funding increased, among other things to sustain a space policy that will be crucial for Europe’s technological progress and its place in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
