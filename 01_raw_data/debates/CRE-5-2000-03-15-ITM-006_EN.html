<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graefe zu Baringdorf (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, the point of this report is to allow the situation which prevailed before 1 July 1999 to be reinstated with regard to a provision which has been in force since 1 July 1999. The reasons given by the Commission are as follows: the Member States have failed to honour their undertaking to implement a control system and we therefore need to reinstate temporarily the situation which prevailed previously.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the Commission in its implied criticism of the Member States which have failed to do their homework but deeply regret that we are again in a situation in which we are unable to implement amendments and improvements to a control system which has been accepted and entered into force because the Member States have failed to carry out their duties. Nonetheless, we support the Commission’s proposal because we consider that the old rules provide a sufficient degree of safety, especially as the Commission is only asking for one year’s delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, however, left itself with an escape clause by asking for a further transitional period of three years under the provisions of the agreement with the Council in the Council decision on comitology of 28 June 1999 and we in Parliament consider that somewhat unusual. What you should have done, Commissioner Byrne, was to apply directly for four years, if it was going to take four years, especially as this would have given a sign to the Member States. If the Commission is leaving itself an escape clause in the form of a three-year postponement, why should we keep to our side of the bargain?</p>
<p class="contents">However, here too we said that we wanted to help out. We tabled a proposed amendment seeking to reduce this period to two years and it became clear during discussions with the Commission that it too was willing to go along with this proposed amendment. Then we noticed an unusual feature; we noticed that you had presented us with the statements of this decision on comitology in long prose texts, despite the fact that you agreed with the Council a long time ago that references to the article would be succinct.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, we have complied with the requirement and the practice which you have cultivated with the Council and, for our part, have now called in a proposed amendment tabled in my name for the new regulation to be adopted, still with the unusual feature that, because the legal basis was Article 37 and Article 152, you had submitted both Article 17 and Article 17a to us on the grounds that this was both a consultation and a codecision procedure. In the codecision procedure, Article 8 applies under the decision on comitology but not under Article 37.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the view that these two separate submissions are unnecessary and we have tabled a single proposed amendment which I shall read to you. We are calling for Article 17a to be deleted. The proposed amendment should read as follows: “Where reference is made to this Article, the management procedure under Article 5 in conjunction with Article 7 of Decision 99/468/EC shall apply and, in the case of a codecision procedure based on Article 251 of the Treaty, Article 8 thereof”.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission is able to accept this amendment. This is a codecision process. If the Commission and the Council are able to adopt our amendments, we can shorten the procedure which, given that we have been in a legal grey area since 1 July 1999, is a reasonable step. We have already had intensive discussions. I am curious to see what the outcome of your position will be. I hope that you will go along with our considerations, as tabled during the discussions, especially as we do not disagree in principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, we are dealing here with amendments to a directive concerning the intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine. I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his report and agreeing very strongly with the remarks he has just made. I suggested a single amendment during the committee stage of the debate, which was accepted by the committee, regarding the need for Member States to put in place a proper system of spot checks, inspections and controls to ensure the efficient implementation of these regulations. My amendment calls upon the Commission to monitor the Member States to see that they carry out the necessary inspections set out in these regulations, because if we are to mount a successful campaign to contain and eradicate tuberculosis and brucellosis, then the proper implementation of these regulations will be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also say that, sadly, these regulations are at the present time largely academic in respect of my own Member State because of course we have been banned from exporting live bovine animals from the UK for the past four years. Indeed, even the export of dead bovines is still being blocked in certain countries because although the ban on the export of beef from the UK was lifted on 1 August 1999, it is, as we all know, still being illegally maintained by France and Germany to this very day.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the pig sector the export trade is also suffering because during the past two years the pig industry has experienced acute difficulties. Indeed in Scotland, my own country, we have witnessed a 25% reduction in the national herd in the past twelve months. Unless urgent action is taken by the UK Government, a further 25% will go within the next few months. Now, this appalling situation has been brought about by a combination of issues involving the strength of sterling, the gold-plating of welfare and hygiene standards, which have been imposed on the industry by the UK Government, and the extra costs arising out of the BSE crisis. These factors are driving UK pig farmers out of business as more and more cheap imports are sourced by retailers and supermarkets in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it transpires that the situation could deteriorate even further as EU applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe are projected to increase their net exports of pigmeat by nearly 300% by the year 2006. At the same time they will be seeking derogations from the EU to enable them to produce pork to welfare and hygiene standards that would be considered illegal under current EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">If Britain is once again to reactivate a dynamic intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine, then immediate help is required to alleviate the catastrophic situation affecting rural Britain and affecting our pig and beef sectors in particular. I hope this message is getting through to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a case of negligence on the part of the Member States in putting these matters and the system into effect. This is an issue concerning serious animal diseases, and I think the most essential matter in this discussion is the fact that we have to quickly adopt the system to avoid repeated postponement of legal provisions that should take effect as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stevenson mentioned that exports from East Europe are increasing: we are now expanding the area of the EU to include the countries of Eastern Europe. If our own systems are not in order, how can we expect new Member States to be able to be ready to join our system of agricultural policy? We have to stress the importance of the fact that food safety and the European agricultural model should be a basic issue with us and one that serves as a vision of the future, but in the Member States we are ignoring issues of a basic nature which would help monitor systems that would ensure this. For that reason we will have to pay very serious attention in the future to ensuring that Member States really do adopt systems we are here taking joint decisions on. If that is not the case, there will have to be some form of sanction to ensure these matters are put right.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has approached this matter with his usual conviction and great dedication. I was very pleased to hear him say that there is no real conflict on the principles and objectives of the proposed directive. I have no doubt that the Commissioner will assist in reaching a satisfactory resolution because both Parliament and the Commission have a common goal in relation to this very important and very crucial area.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on inter-Community trade in bovine animals is central to the economic survival of livestock farmers, particularly from my own country, Ireland, where we export up to 90% of our entire livestock production – a very high proportion of which is live exports to continental Europe and beyond. In this regard, I support proposals for a further update of the 1997 directive with the caution that it must be done in a sensible way. We need to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy while, at the same time, providing total traceability with regard to livestock movement as well as safeguarding public health.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titford (EDD).</span></span>   – Mr President, this proposal introduces an extension of a current exemption to Directive 64/432 applicable to the Spanish Government. Without this exemption, it would be required to implement a system of veterinary checks for tuberculosis and brucellosis, for each bovine animal exported from its region. These are already, of course, implemented by many other states.</p>
<p class="contents">This exemption has important implications for my country. Whilst Spain is being given exemption, the British meat industry is suffering heavily from the implementation of an allied directive which requires ruinously expensive veterinary checks in our slaughterhouses. So rigorous are the requirements for veterinary supervision that we do not have enough British vets to carry out the work. But instead of giving us more time, the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid ending up in the European Court of Justice, my government has had to recruit large numbers of EU vets, 300 of whom come from Spain. If Spain has such a large surplus of vets that it can afford to send so many to my country, why is it having such difficulty implementing the system of veterinary checks required by this directive? It does not seem right to me that British slaughterhouses should be put through the hoops as a result of the Commission's action whilst Spain is allowed to default on its obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the Commission giving Spain such an easy time? Should it not be asking why Spain can afford to send so many vets over to the United Kingdom to implement a related directive and perhaps be insisting that some of these officials be retained in their homeland to implement Community law in their own country?</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, I believe that this proposed directive is wrong and I will be voting against it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Under EU trading rules and in the interest of food safety and consumer confidence in animal health status, annual testing is required to maintain the official TB-free status of our cattle herds. With a cattle population in Ireland of between 7 and 8 million in recent years, some 10.5 million TB tests have been undertaken annually in some 138 000 herds. Since 1954, when our TB scheme was introduced, we have spent in Ireland – a small country – EUR 2.54 billion on TB testing and subsequently brucellosis testing. I think that stands as a testament to our determination to protect the health status of our cattle herds in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, following disclosure of a reaction, a special contiguous testing programme for herds adjoining restricted herds is operated. Analysis of test data is carried out on an on-going basis by a special TB investigation unit. Routine post-mortem examinations are carried out by veterinary surgeons employed by the Department on all animals slaughtered. Animals which react positively to the TB test are slaughtered. From the earliest stages in the bovine TB eradication scheme, the Department of Agriculture has recognised the benefit of pre-movement testing, and we request that our particular amendment to the amending directive be looked on favourably.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I would like to ask the Commissioner to consider particularly is the fact that the only test provided for in the EU and under Irish legislation is the single intradermal comparative test as specified in Directive 64/432 of the EC. I understand considerable work has been done on laboratory-based blood tests for TB. The gamma-interferon test is the most promising of these, and is used under practical field conditions as an adjunct to the tuberculin test in herds. I would like the Commissioner to indicate where that now stands and how quickly we will be able to have a blood test accepted by the EU. The TB test we use now is herd-specific, not animal-specific. We need to get to the stage where blood tests for individual animals will stand up.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Plus, animal epidemics are again costing us a great deal of money. The main objective of the directive is to create electronic data bases from which information on bovine animals and pigs, and how they are kept, can be accessed, in order to foster safety and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">These new data bases will form part of the bovine animal labelling and registration system set out in the regulation. However, as the implementation of this directive and the long-windedness of the codecision procedure have given rise to difficulties, the Commission has concluded that transitional measures should be introduced in order to avoid problems with the trade in live bovine animals and pigs.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that Member States are always very slow to implement unwelcome Community legislation, which is why we need to discuss if a 3-year margin is really sensible. I think that Mr Daul’s proposed amendment of two years would be an excellent compromise. I should also like to point out in this connection that, rather than planting more trees, we need to clear the jungle of paragraphs and exemptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Absolute account must be taken of the Economic and Social Committee’s reservations concerning strict limits on exemptions and harmonisation of veterinary legislation. I therefore fail to understand that some countries are doing their homework while others keep finding excuses and dragging their feet. All that does is distort competition and, for this reason, I vote that we make the regulation binding on everyone as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This morning, in this Chamber, one of the Members made the statement that without rules there is no freedom. But I feel that where there are too many rules, freedom can become confusion. It is my opinion that this measure is suffering from a surfeit of rules. Since 1964, a series of laws have been adopted on this subject. Some were implemented, but many were not. The application of some of them was deferred, and others were not adapted by the individual States. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, in all probability, some of the States are at fault in that they have not aligned themselves with certain directives. However, we have to ask why it is that this happens so often and in so many States. It is very likely that this is caused by difficulties in implementing the directives. The delays in the adaptation of national legislation may well be due to the expense and tedium involved, as well as the fact that the process is often unproductive. Therefore, the message I would like to convey is that where there is an excess of rules and regulations, and in this case there is an abundance of rules in the preparatory measures of this text, which, in essence, I approve of, when the sheer number of different texts makes implementation difficult, then application of the text is deferred and we run the risk of creating not only legislative, but also practical gaps: legislative gaps on account of overlapping competences and confusion of legislation, and practical gaps because it appears that, in many areas, there is clearly the risk of insufficient control, and there is therefore a danger that consumer policy will not be aligned either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, may I first of all thank you for the interest you have devoted to the Commission proposal modifying Directive 64/432 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine. I am particularly grateful to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for his report on this proposal and to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the support given to most of the modifications proposed by the Commission and for the amendments included in the initial committee's report.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States encountered serious trade problems when implementing the updated animal health rules for intra-Community trade laid down in Directive 64/432 that came into force on 1 July last year. In order to facilitate the change-over to the new rules the Commission, based on Articles 37 and 152 of the Treaty, proposed amendments to the directive that include transitional measures to solve the most acute trade problems, minor corrections and clarifications in the annexes and a general mandate to the Commission to lay down transitional measures in accordance with the new comitology procedure included in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament agreed on two amendments tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to the Commission proposal. The first amendment requires the Member States to ensure full implementation of the directive and the Member States and the Commission to execute controls on the implementation. The second amendment seeks to restrict the period of application of transitional measures to two years. The Commission can agree to these Amendments Nos 1 and 2 and must therefore oppose the amendment from Mrs Auroi requesting the deletion of any transitional measures.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I regret that I am not in a position to accept written Amendment No 3 which Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf put forward last week. It modifies the comitology procedure by proposing for implementing measures relating to Article 37 to introduce a management procedure with the right of scrutiny. This is clearly against Article 2 of the Council Decision 99/468 on comitology which provides for regulatory committees in issues relating to animal health and it seems that perhaps it is not accepted by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf following detailed discussions with my cabinet that this is the position. But I understand that perhaps Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf may very well have misinterpreted the comitology and that he intends to amend it again during this plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me express my surprise and concern about this. I regret that I cannot accept your new amendment which replaces Article 17 and 17a by a single new article comprising the entire comitology procedure. It introduces a regulatory committee with the right of scrutiny for Parliament and I quote from the letter which he sent me: “in the case of a codecision procedure based on Article 251, Article 8 thereof” – that is Article 8 of Council Decision 99/468 on comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you of the importance that I attach to Parliament's role in the legislative process, in particular relating to comitology in the codecision procedure. The overall aim is to achieve quick and efficient results in order to translate policy into legislative acts. The framework for the comitology procedure is clearly established in the abovementioned Council decision. The right of scrutiny for the Parliament is foreseen for areas relating to codecision, that is Article 8. The amended Directive 64/432 is based on Articles 37 and 152 of the Treaty. The new provision concerning the implementing powers for the Commission to lay down transitional measures may have a direct effect on public health.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why the Commission, in this case, proposes Article 17a which refers to a regulatory committee with the right of scrutiny for Parliament. I refer you to Article 3 of the directive in particular which amends Article 16 of the original where it says: “where necessary to facilitate the change-over to the new arrangements provided for in this directive the Commission, acting in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 17a, may adopt transitional measures applicable for a period of not more than three years”. That is, and I am advised by the legal service, the appropriate way to deal with this.</p>
<p class="contents">In any situation where a basic legislative provision envisages amendment by a comitology procedure it must include in the basic provision the actual procedure for the comitology. That is why each individual provision which envisages such an amendment must identify the procedure quite clearly. Therefore, the power that is given to the Commission to further extend the period of time which is contained in Article 3 clearly identifies Article 17a as being the appropriate article to deal with this which incorporates Article 8 of the Council decision of last June, thereby giving Parliament full scrutiny powers in relation to any such proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Where reference is made in the current version of 64/432 to Article 17, this relates to implementing measures concerning animal health, that is based on Article 37 which are of no or, in very few cases, of very remote, public health concern. Therefore these measures should not be subject to the right of scrutiny of Parliament. For example, such implementing measures relate to the approval of procedures and sites for cleansing and disinfection, the format of disease reporting, the approval of assembly centres, the definition of additional guarantees for Member States free of diseases not transmissible to humans such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis or transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now make some remarks on the implications of the proposed amendment for the institutional balance. The implementing powers of the Commission are laid down in Article 202, third indent of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the Council Decision 99/468 that I earlier referred to which is the appropriate Council decision laying down the appropriate procedure for comitology. This system aims clearly at defining exactly the respective role of the executive and legislative power in the basic legislative instrument. Consequently, in the basic legislative act it has to be made clear from the outset which implementing measures are based on codecision procedures, that is, Article 152 and which provisions do not have as their direct objective the protection of public health and would therefore not be subject to Parliament's right of scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure must be made clear in the basic legislative provision requiring to be amended by comitology. Any wording leaving room for case-by-case negotiation would jeopardise the delicate institutional balance and also seriously undermine transparency. The wording proposed in the new amendment for the regulatory procedure with the right of scrutiny, and I quote: “in the case of the codecision procedure based on Article 251, Article 8 thereof” leads to legal uncertainty and is not in line with the agreed implementation of Council's comitology decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I note from the document that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has circulated this afternoon where he signals his intention to put forward this amendment at this stage. He says: “I think that it is not necessary to include two almost identical references to the comitology procedure just to make sure that the European Parliament does not ask for rights that it does not have”. Let me assure Parliament that it is not my intention, in setting out these two procedures – Articles 17 and 17a – to ensure that the European Parliament does not ask for rights that it does not have.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly committed to the procedure of codecision and I am firmly committed to the procedures laid down in comitology. I am firmly committed to the notion that Parliament will have full scrutiny of Commission proposals in circumstances where the legal structures of the European Union, that is the Treaty and the directive, allow for that situation. To deviate from that is to risk challenge in the European Court, which is something that I must avoid. Also I must reply to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf by saying that the two, as he describes, almost identical references to comitology procedure are not in fact identical. They are quite different and must be dealt with quite separately. However, it is in the interest of all the institutions that the procedures are clearly defined and transparent for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, adopting this amendment would mean further delaying the legislative procedure which could otherwise be concluded after the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I wish to confirm that I accept Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's Amendments Nos 1 and 2 but not the amendment on the comitology procedure that he has suggested this afternoon. Consequently I cannot accept the amendment of Mrs Auroi either.</p>
<p class="contents">To deal with the individual issues which were raised by speakers this afternoon, first of all, in respect of those points made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf which I have not already dealt with, he makes reference to the long prose text and that there is an agreement with the Council to be more succinct. You are, of course, quite correct in relation to that. That agreement, however, was reached with the Council subsequent to the initial drafting of this document. That is why it has been drafted in this way. It pre-dates that agreement. It will be automatically amended in the manner envisaged in the agreement with the Council. Therefore the concerns that you have in relation to this matter will be remedied automatically in accordance with that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">You also suggested that if the Commission goes along with your suggestion that there will be a shortened procedure. In response to that, if this particular amendment is withdrawn by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, having regard to what I have said here this afternoon, then it is also true to say that the procedure will be shortened and this matter can be dealt with on first reading. There is a significant risk that if the matter is proceeded with in this way and if the Council votes in accordance with the proposal put forward by the Commission, the matter will go to second reading, thereby creating further delays.</p>
<p class="contents">It has come to my attention as late as today, in consultation with members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that there is a concern which I was unaware of: of the interaction between Articles 37 and 152. I have made it clear that I am prepared to respond quickly to any invitation that the committee might wish to extend to me to discuss this important constitutional issue of the interaction between Article 37 and Article 152. I say that in circumstances where I also urge Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to give serious consideration, in the light of what I have just said, to the withdrawal of that particular amendment, having regard to the serious legal difficulties that exist in relation to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Hyland and Mrs Doyle, both of whom are concerned about the testing issue, I have taken note of what both of them have said in relation to this and I will make the appropriate inquiries.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is this: you tabled a text which no longer complies with the standard procedure agreed with the Council. We noticed that. We then table our proposed amendments, which you consider to be correct as far as principle and procedure are concerned. Then you differentiate between what applies to a report tabled to us under Article 152 alone and this report, which you have tabled under both 37 and 152 and you say that is why we need separate references to comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we too consulted our legal service and the text which I read out to you contains precisely this reference to comitology. The legal text is therefore confirmed. The Commission is being thick-skinned here; it is saying no, we stand by our proposal as we have already done on a similar occasion in the past here in Parliament. Hence, Mr Byrne, when you say I should consider withdrawing the amendment, I should like to ask you to consider if you do not agree with it, especially as it complies with the decision on comitology.

First of all, the agreement that was reached with the Council in relation to the shortening of the prose text is something which will automatically be dealt with in accordance with the agreement as I have identified a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the issue relating to comitology, I can only repeat what I said which is that in any basic legal text which authorises the Commission to amend that text by comitology, that text must itself identify what procedure is being adopted. What Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is suggesting be done in his amendment is to confer a discretion to deal with the issue in each case on a case-by-case basis, so that the text to be amended will refer to Article 17, but within Article 17 there will be a discretion as to whether Article 7 or Article 8 of Decision 1999/468 will apply; this means that somebody – that is the Commission – will have to determine in those circumstances which of the two articles is the appropriate one, depending on whether it is or is not codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">I submit that this is inappropriate, because it effectively confers a power on the Commission to make a decision on that issue as it were in its office, rather than enabling the reader to consult the text – the basic text – in any circumstance where the Commission is empowered to amend a provision by comitology, and to refer to that basic text. From that text it will be clear what comitology procedure is the appropriate one to follow: whether it is Article 17 in the version suggested by the Commission which applies to all of the circumstances in this particular directive, or Article 17(a) which incorporates the scrutiny procedure of the comitology, and which is appropriate to the circumstances set out in Article 3 – that is, where there is a further extension of time beyond 31 December 2000 and where the Commission can extend it for a further period as we have discussed. That gives clarity to the situation. It avoids any exercise of discretion by the Commission or anybody else. It leaves it clear to anybody reading the text what the appropriate procedure is that will govern this particular situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret I cannot make it any clearer and I regret I cannot accede to your request: I would ask you again, in the light of what I have said about making myself available to your committee, to discuss the interaction between 152 and 37, and to give serious consideration to withdrawing this amendment yourself.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
