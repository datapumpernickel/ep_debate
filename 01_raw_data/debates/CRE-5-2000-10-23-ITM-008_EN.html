<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Eriksson (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see you all here. The Commission’s communication affirms that democracy is a fundamental value of the EU Member States, the EEA States and the candidate countries, as well as a key part of external relations and development cooperation in the Union. It also affirms that real democracy requires all citizens, women and men alike, to participate and be represented equally in the economy, decision making and social, cultural and civil life.</p>
<p class="contents">There are major deficiencies in all these areas. The Commission therefore proposes to tackle the problem with a combination of measures. In tandem with integrating equality perspectives into all policy areas – what is normally called gender mainstreaming – specific measures for women will be implemented. I fully endorse that strategy and approach and consider that it is not an exaggeration to say that no efforts to promote gender equality are of lasting value unless women’s rights are strengthened at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">This work has gone quite quickly despite the fact that it took a little time at the beginning. The Committee has submitted 49 amendments. At the beginning we had 126, which indicates that we are incredibly committed. I am very pleased about this. We believe, for example, that it is very important for the Commission to guarantee maximum openness around this programme so that all interested parties can keep abreast of proceedings throughout the implementation phase. It is also incredibly important, not to say fundamental, that the various Community actions, the framework strategy and the Member States’ measures complement, and do not counteract, each other. This is, of course, also the Commission’s and the Council’s express ambition. The Commission has now identified five focus areas of strategic importance. I have no objections in this respect, nor has the Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come up with a new shock proposal, which is really a reiteration of what was stated in our opinion on the budget. We believe that 40 per cent of the Structural Funds should be earmarked to focus on women’s conditions and needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposed measures should be expanded to include reviews of individual access to medical and health care and to social security and pensions, an analysis of shortcomings in the organisation of work and perhaps also a study of the significance of a general reduction in working hours. What we have just recently discussed here in this Chamber are, of course, the social issues, and I wish once again to emphasise the repeated observation that over 50 million EU citizens are, in fact, classified as poor and that a large majority of those are women. This is, of course, something which needs not only to be observed but also to be combated, and with the help of vigorous measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a lot of detailed discussion of various assessment procedures. I shall not go into any more detail here. Rather, I just wanted to mention it. We have touched upon the idea that the plan must be to increase accessibility and also scope for active participation for non-governmental organisations. Discussions have been held as to how the candidate countries can be incorporated in the programme in a natural way. We have also discussed what we must do in order not only to give a mention to women in the developing countries but also to be able to do something practical in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">During the final phase of the journey, I have been in very close contact with people in both the Commission and the Council. We naturally want to include the strategy in the Council decision, too. What we mean in the Committee by <span class="italic">strategy</span> is, of course, not the Commission’s opening gambit, but that strategy beginning as from paragraph 2 (‘The Strategy’). I am saying this so that no mysterious or technical procedures cause this to be misunderstood, for no less than seven different amendments in the same spirit have been tabled. In other words, the Council too must adopt the Commission’s strategy. It is therefore important that non-governmental organisations should obtain influence in the course of implementation. One amendment is to the effect that it should be possible to hold an annual debate here in Parliament, together with the Commission. This perhaps affects only the Commission and Parliament, but I am very grateful indeed for the fact that you, Mrs Diamantopoulou and you, Mrs Péry are here, and I am very much looking forward to hearing your points of view on all the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the time available to us in committee did not give us a chance to process either the communication or Mrs Eriksson’s report although, having said that, we did make every possible effort to respond to the objectives set by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, of course, agree with the Commission’s justification of the need to integrate the question of equality into all aspects of European policy as well as adopting special measures. We also trust – and here we agree with the rapporteur – that the Commission will present a detailed budget for the programme, especially as regards the allocation of funds between the five high-priority areas. At the same time, we must stress the need for complementarity between the measures and main lines of approach in the areas of economic life, equal participation and representation, social rights, the civil society and the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that the programme will be open to all of society, that knowledge of it will spread far and wide, especially in women’s organisations, that it will provide an opportunity for dialogue and for raising awareness in all the decision-making centres in all the Member States and that numerous agencies will have the chance to make good use of it. Women will then feel close to Europe and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will be formulated as a result of their connections with this programme. We think it is extremely important to promote a positive image of women and visibility of their work and importance. We think that these projects will help women gain self-confidence in their role. Finally, we trust, as was said during the previous plenary when we debated older parliamentary reports, that we will have an evaluation procedure of substance and consistency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prets (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, we have had the fourth framework programme, and today we are discussing the fifth. The present reports by the Commission and Parliament show that despite the fact that there have been a number of successes over the past few years, the list of unfinished or unsatisfactory points is too long. Therefore it is still our goal for the next five years to consolidate the position of women in the policies of all Member States, both in terms of quality and content.</p>
<p class="contents">We need measures to be given substance, we require strategic goals and the implementation of policies such as equal opportunities in the economic and social spheres, social rights for women, taking into account their personal situations, and the need for childcare. Other points to be considered include the fact that women might want to take up a career later in life, or resume a career etc., gender roles, stereotypes, and the need for equal participation and representation. As far as the strategic goals are concerned, for example, in the sphere of ‘women in working life’, economic and employment policy issues cannot be dealt with separately from issues of social responsibility, social security, and a fair distribution of caring responsibilities. Problems to do with access to social security must be looked at on a case-by-case basis to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Community must do more in the way of assessing the need for additional initiatives, including, where necessary, implementing legislation and equal opportunities, and fighting discrimination. The European Parliament, the national parliaments and networks must therefore become more closely involved. Financial resources are indispensable, as is always the case when goals are to be achieved and there is a great deal of catching up to do. This programme is therefore conditional on funds totalling EUR 50 million being made available for the period from 2001 to 2005. This means that we must step up our efforts to achieve a women’s policy that crosses the institutional and political divide, and to enable the equal opportunities strategies called for to be implemented more effectively. We must invest our energies in the realisation and implementation of the planned programmes, and this must go hand in hand with well-timed evaluations and coordination with other programmes. We expect to receive an annual report from the President of the Commission, within the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament. It is also necessary to establish a Council of Ministers both in order to deal with the content of the work, and with a view to winning recognition for women’s policy. Making women’s policy an adjunct to other political themes does not do the matter justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s policy must also be a criteria used to assess whether the candidate countries are ready for accession. The European Parliament could lead the way here by setting a better example. I hope that the sixth framework programme will not need to be as comprehensive as the present one. For this to be the case, women’s policy will have to be taken more seriously over the next five years and not just included in all political, economic and social programmes, but actually implemented. Women’s policy is not – as happens so often – to be incorporated into programmes for minorities. At 52%, women are not a minority group!</p>

It encompasses all those areas where action is needed and, if successfully coordinated, could make a real difference to women in all aspects of their everyday lives. This could work if the framework strategy were an integral part of the programme, as an annex to it. This would ensure the implementation of the programme and I therefore support the comments made by the rapporteur earlier on.</p>
<p class="contents">There has not been a shortage of good ideas or good plans to achieve equality in the past but their implementation has often failed. This time the Commission is putting forward a new approach. It is very welcome but it is only valuable if it can actually be made to work. That means also reaching women in their own communities. The involvement of local and regional authorities in this process is invaluable. They are the largest employers across the Member States and the central providers of education, training and economic development and, as such, they are key players in achieving equality. I hope due regard will be paid to them in the final programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thomas-Mauro (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one is disputing that we should strive for greater equity between men and women. For too long, women’s role has been despised. In this respect, the Napoleonic Code, which was framed in France at the beginning of the 19th century and exported to every corner of Europe, must shoulder a large share of the blame. Women must once again be given a place that is in keeping with the vital importance of their vocation, and I am not entirely sure that Mrs Eriksson’s report makes any contribution towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, the texts before us are not entirely lacking in quality. So, Amendment No 2, presented by my own committee, grants single fathers the same rights as single mothers. Equality and fair treatment must work both ways, that is the ideal. I am delighted, moreover, that improvements in childcare facilities are planned in order to better support the reconciliation of professional and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">This report does, however, give some cause for concern. Amendment No 18, for example, which seeks to support action by candidate countries to combat discrimination must not afford any opportunity to foist on them social choices alien to their culture. In this respect, in New York, very distinct differences between the European Union and Poland emerged. By failing to respect Poland’s social choices, the European Union would be taking a very peculiar, and very disturbing, view of pluralism. Furthermore, Amendment No 19 on establishing an audit of equal opportunities within the public budget is extremely debatable. Indeed, the way the concept of discrimination has been manipulated makes it, in many respects, an empty formula used by a whole collection of sorcerer’s apprentices in order to achieve their ideological ends.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time we broke with an ideological vision of woman’s place in society. In this area, as in many others, it is essential for public authorities to exercise true pluralism in selecting their associates. It is not right for a handful of women, expert in making claims of society and living on intravenous injections of public monies, to monopolise the role of speaking on behalf of women.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I cannot but endorse the decision by the Committee on Budgets to break the monopoly held for so long by the European Women’s Lobby. I should like to see this House confirming this bold change of course. A decision of this type would be like a breath of fresh air to the strange alliances which too closely bind a number of pressure groups to the European Commission and to some political groups in this House. The women’s movement can only be strengthened by such a decision. I could go even further, and say it would be ennobled by such a decision. This is something my Group will take into consideration in its final vote.</p>

The low level of representation of women in political and economic spheres and gender-related violence are two clear signs that structural discrimination against women is continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme will undoubtedly help to ensure that the concerns, needs and aspirations of women are taken into account in all policies. The current situation requires that positive action measures in favour of women be implemented. The objectives that the programme sets out in five specific areas will help to ensure that all the action taken will be associated with at least one of those areas. Participation in economic life, which women should enjoy under equal conditions to men, employment, which is the basis for all equality and integration, and achieving the 60% target proposed at the Lisbon Summit, would also solve other problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of this objective in all Community programmes, within the framework of the Structural Funds, should be effected in accordance with Community legislation. Equality in participation and representation, balance in the decision-making process, greater participation in political life, whatever the process adopted, in order to achieve an increase in the participation of women, until we reach the 40% figure proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Equal access and full enjoyment of social rights for women and men, which would mean ensuring that the legislation is applied in the social sphere in terms of maternity leave, maternity protection, working time, employment contracts, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality between women and men in civil life, allowing women to fully enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms. We especially need to guard against and eradicate trafficking in women and domestic violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to encourage a change in the roles and stereotypes associated with gender, which will also help to solve some of the other problems above. In relation to this objective we will support the organisation of awareness campaigns and a European Equality Week in cooperation with the Member States, as the Commission proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that it is very useful to create a web site, not only due to the increasing use of computerised media, but because this will help women to familiarise themselves more and more with this new world from which they must not be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that we think is of particular importance is the evaluation of the programme …</p>

I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicole Péry, will be able to get through the programme in the Council in November. I hope there will be no repeat of the fourth action programme, when the erstwhile Federal Government under Helmut Kohl halved the budget, no less.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is pressing. Women are still not adequately represented in politics and in economic decision-making processes. According to EUROSTAT, approximately 77% of the recipients of low wages are women. Depending on the country and sector, women earn up to 30% less than their male counterparts. The framework strategy must be brought to bear in this regard as well. All the equal opportunities initiatives should be coordinated under one roof and translated into the five, specific, strategic goals. Other speakers have made the same point.</p>
<p class="contents">That would be the logical way to implement the gender mainstreaming concept. I am expecting the male protagonists to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherited notions of gender roles and stereotypes.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to see the leading politicians on our side, and call upon President Prodi, the Council, and the Ministers, to take full account of the gender aspect, for example in the context of the European Union’s foreign relations, and particularly where the enlargement process is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">More emphasis should be placed on establishing links between women’s organisations, which is something I called for back when I was rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme. Our parliamentary committee plans to stage a conference on this specialist policy area, together with the parliamentary committees of our Member States and of the candidate countries, in November in Berlin. I am hoping that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy. This is where Europe will again lead the way in the fight for women’s rights in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is great need of this, even though a quarter of a century has passed since the first Community directive on the equal treatment of men and women with regard to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the Commission’s new approach to be a very positive one, and the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme to have been well considered. Unfortunately, the report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is no improvement on the text put forward by the Commission. It overeggs the pudding, and includes unconsidered and indigestible proposals, worded in such a way as to make a first-year law student’s hair stand on end.</p>
<p class="contents">In committee, I had tabled a raft of amendments intended to do away with the worst of the incongruities, particularly those that demonstrated an outlandish mish-mash of strategy and programmes. The Commission has produced an excellent text. It is a very serious mistake, in politics, to mix strategy up with tactics or with programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">As is so often the case in reports by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, we have here a report including the ideological claims of the left wing coalition, the <span class="italic">gauche plurielle</span>, in this Parliament, like the claim that measures eligible for programme funding in a transnational context should include the analysis and assessment of, I quote, “the significance of a general reduction in working hours”. Do we really need to waste any of the paltry EUR 53.45 million in appropriations to cover five years on such an analysis? I think not. I am also of the opinion that the appropriations for the European Women’s Lobby, budget line A 3037, should not be included in the appropriations committed for the programme and I hope that the Commissioner will favour the amendments that I and the other members of my Group have tabled, above the rapporteur’s own far-fetched amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This programme is an important document for the Committee on Women’s Rights, which is why it provoked a great deal of interest and, of course, it forms part of the more overall strategy which was discussed with the Committee on Women’s Rights, the Committee on Social Affairs and the Council. It is the familiar 5-pronged strategy of participation of women in economic life, at the decision-making centres, in social policy, in civil society and in human rights, together with the new model of gender equality for the mass media and education.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cooperation with the committee was excellent, which is why we can accept a large number of amendments, either to the letter or in spirit. Specifically, we accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 28, 32, 43, 46, 48, 49, 51, 55, 56 and 59. We are also able to accept parts of Amendments Nos 3, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 20, 27, 35, 37, 45, 50, 53, 57 and 58. I think that the large number of amendments accepted is illustrative of the meeting of minds between the Commission and the Committee on Women’s Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two comments on the amendments which we are unable to accept, mainly for technical and legal reasons rather than because of a difference of approach. First, as far as the strategy is concerned. It is not possible for the entire strategy to form part of the Council decision, but I agree that some amendments could be made to the wording of the articles in order to make it perfectly clear that this strategy has been taken into account and forms the basis on which the programme will be implemented. Secondly, as far as the specific percentage to be earmarked from the Structural Funds is concerned. I should remind you that a regulation was voted through last year which clearly sets out how items are allocated and we cannot use a programme to change the regulation which already exists.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that we absolutely agree on the need to focus on complementarity between current actions and programmes and, of course, on the important role which non-governmental organisations must play in designing and implementing these programmes. And I should like to stress, in the light of certain comments, that the women’s lobby really does play an important coordinating role at European level and that there are no protests or complaints in the Commission about exempting certain organisations; on the contrary, European organisations as a whole are able to take part in all the programmes, such as this programme, EQUAL, the programme to combat discrimination, the programme to combat exclusion, DAPHNE or STOP. Major European women’s organisations therefore clearly have access to all the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I really do believe that the strategy behind this programme, the main objective of which is to implement mainstreaming in all policies, is a huge challenge for all of us, both at Commission level, with the cooperation between the individual committees which we need in order to obtain a final result, and at national level, with the need for horizontal action in every ministry so that the women’s policy becomes a horizontal policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
