<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Debora Serracchiani, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who worked with me to draft this important recommendation, the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the secretariat of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. After almost two years of lengthy and difficult negotiations with the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the Commission, Parliament has managed to make considerable progress, in particular, by guaranteeing greater competition between rail operators, oversight by a strong, independent national regulatory body that ensures fair competition, the requirement, for the first time, to handle complaints within a set time ranging from six to a maximum of 16 weeks, the creation of a European network of national regulatory bodies and a rendezvous clause for the establishment of a European regulatory body.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the new rules – which should also lay a solid foundation for the financing of infrastructure thanks to contracts of a minimum of five years – and the agreement that we secured to strengthen the current rules and to create a single European railway area should offer all railway undertakings fair access to a wider range of services, such as maintenance and station services, including ticket sales, in addition to providing equal access to the rail network.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, with regard to the regulatory body, a key element of the railway recast, the new rules lay down more stringent requirements for the appointment of its staff and in order to guarantee its full independence: cooling-on and cooling-off periods and a declaration of interest that the regulatory body’s members must submit. The recast also provides for the regulatory body to make recommendations to licensing and safety authorities to prevent, for example, safety rules being used to limit access to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The recast will extend the regulatory bodies’ powers to ancillary rail services and to overseeing the separation of accounts. It will be made clear that regulatory bodies must review both the draft and final versions of network statements, which are an essential instrument to ensure that all the operators are aware of the market access conditions. Furthermore, in addition to acting in a limited timeframe in the event of a complaint, regulatory bodies will be able to intervene with regard to the introduction of mark-ups on the direct costs of infrastructure managers, control the criteria for the introduction of booking charges and regularly consult railway users.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to Parliament’s involvement, we have also managed to obtain a network of regulatory bodies: the content of the information will be exchanged in a clear manner and will be guaranteed by the Commission, which will be required to evaluate how efficiently the regulatory bodies are cooperating with the new network and to propose supplementary measures to ensure a more integrated oversight of the European rail market, with the hope that in the future, a European regulatory body can be established.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to financing infrastructure, the multiannual contractual agreement no longer has a minimum duration of three years but five, and there is a provision requiring Member States to make good the deficit in the infrastructure manager’s accounts every five years at the most. A requirement has also been included …</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">The speaker interrupted her speech</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">In order to have a single rail market, we need to provide non-discriminatory access to the market. Therefore, even if the separation requirements for service facilities have not been imposed on all kinds of infrastructure, the opening up of the services market is far-reaching, with an extensive list of essential services and non-discriminatory access to infrastructure and services. A ‘use it or lease it’ clause has also been included for services that have not been used for at least two years instead of three.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to charges, in particular, noise charges, we have reached a compromise that is optional for Member States – although it will be mandatory to comply with the applicable EU rules – that envisages a bonus system to facilitate the retrofitting of trains. As for the European Train Control System (ETCS), a compulsory system is planned for all Member States that must be implemented on European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) lines: the introduction of a bonus-malus system for trains equipped with ETCS systems in accordance with common criteria set out by the Commission. The differentiation of charges will be completely revenue neutral for the infrastructure manager.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite my firm belief that there needs to be separation between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, we have reached a good compromise on separation that provides for transparency of financial flows between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings in integrated companies, as well as a rendezvous clause for the presentation of a legislative proposal on separation and on the opening of the domestic passenger market by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind Members that tomorrow, during the vote, amendments could be tabled. Should any of these amendments that are not part of this document receive majority support and be accepted by Parliament, the document would end up in conciliation. This would delay further still the opening of the debate on the fourth railway package. I therefore appeal to my fellow Members to understand the importance of adopting the railway recast tomorrow, so that we may then continue to work on the fourth railway package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its skilful negotiations, with a very narrow majority in the Council. I would also like sincerely to thank the rapporteur, Ms Serracchiani, together with the shadow rapporteurs, the Chairman and the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Ms Serracchiani managed to improve the text in the second reading significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just mention what the Commission sees as some of the main results. Firstly, the compromise package significantly strengthens the power of national regulators, with new independence requirements and increased areas of responsibility and means at their disposal. A formal network of regulators will be established to ensure particularly that cross-border traffic is adequately handled. The Commission intends to play a very active role in this network.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the new framework for investment in the rail sector will set out clearer obligations for Member States and infrastructure managers. It also envisages charging schemes to stimulate the deployment of greener and interoperable technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this text will facilitate access to the rail market for new entrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as requested by Parliament, the compromise package provides for more transparency in the financial flows between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings. It also includes a review clause which reflects the Commission’s commitment to issuing new proposals on separation and domestic passenger market opening by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, I need to make a formal statement.</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Commission underlines that it is contrary to the letter and to the spirit of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 to invoke Article 5, paragraph 4, subparagraph 2(b) in a systematic manner. Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to depart from the rule of principle which is that the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is delivered. Given that it is an exception to the general rule established by Article 5, paragraph 4, recourse to subparagraph 2(b) cannot be simply seen as a ‘discretionary power’ of the legislator, but must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and thus must be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission supports the agreement reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the recourse to this provision in nine specific cases which they have justified by reason of their potential impact on the functioning of the rail market and public finances, it regrets that such justification is not reflected in a recital’.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to stress that the Commission supports this agreement, which improves the text of the Council position. I am convinced that there is no better deal. The adoption of any further amendment, such as the amendment to Article 2(2) – the so-called Polish derogation – would inevitably lead to a conciliation procedure. This would not only put at risk the major improvements that the European Parliament has managed to obtain in this piece of legislation but also the possibility of putting forward new initiatives to promote the completion of the single European railway area.</p>
<p class="contents">The recast directive is a precondition for further initiatives to complete the internal market for rail services for which many Members of this Parliament have called. I want to reaffirm today that the Commission is fully committed to delivering a new package of measures by the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, we all noticed that, and it was very important that we were then also able to agree with the Council and the Commission about the entry into force and the individual deadlines, on the 30 months, and that also, in the end, legal action – things have, after all, often got stuck on that issue – was also restricted to a maximum of 16 weeks. These are very important steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), our focus was always on having a strong regulator in the individual Member States that works independently, has a sound technical material basis and sensible staffing, and that is also able to take decisions. These regulatory bodies need to cooperate in a network, as our aim is to achieve a common European railway market. For that purpose, we also need a point of contact in the Commission. We do not need some kind of great European regulator, but we do have a European Railway Agency that can take on such tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear and transparent cost calculation that is understandable for everyone, and that is, how expensive is a kilometre on the line? This is an absolutely crucial point. We were able to agree on this, but also on the fact that the Member States also cofinance the railways, which is crucial, especially when it comes to cross-border projects, so that a stretch of railway has an economic value. It was very important that we were able to agree on the five years, here, and if you want to operate railways within Europe – whether passenger or freight – the provision of mutual services is, of course, necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the agreement in connection with the noise requirements, we also need to take the citizens with us when it comes to the major lines. We need certainty in the ETS system too, but also trans-European reciprocity. It is not acceptable for the Russian Federation and Ukraine to be able to operate in the Union while we cannot operate there. These are also the subjects of the amendments, and we have to find a solution there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, I would also like to add my thanks to all those who played their part and, in particular, to the shadow rapporteurs. This agreement refines and reinforces the ground rules from 2001, which was a necessary move as there was a great deal of vagueness and too much room for manoeuvre on the part of the Member States. That led to confusion and, hence, to a railway market that does not truly function in the optimum way.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I have to say that there are a number of particularly important, controversial issues, which we have not tackled this time. Examples of such issues include the liberalisation of national passenger transport, whether or not infrastructure managers and operators are to be separated, and the strengthening of the European Railway Agency. These are very important issues that we have delayed dealing with until next year. I am very much in favour of this, as it makes a good debate a necessity, and I also believe that we need to properly examine all the consequences of a reform of this nature. By this I mean, for instance, the consequences for public service provision, as well as the social aspect of the railway landscape.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, this package, in the form that will be tabled for approval tomorrow, will help increase the impact of market forces especially in relation to freight transport, which is to be completely liberalised. There will be greater clarity in relation to the handling of complaints. There will also be more transparency in relation to financial flows and the way in which infrastructure managers are to be funded. Incentives to limit noise pollution and improve interoperability are being provided</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask you to support this package and not to approve any additional amendments. I will make that my last point. I offer the rapporteur my thanks once more, and I wish her every success.</p>

First of all, we need to draw a distinction between freight and passenger transport. For freight transport, liberalisation has delivered inadequate results, precisely because the legislation is insufficiently clear. We are now trying to solve that issue. However, at the same time, we do clearly also have to deal with far more important issues. One such issue is problems with technical interoperability, which are currently preventing truly simple organisation of cross-border freight transport.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to passenger transport, I will just say that that is absolutely not on the agenda. We as a group also played our part in that. It is a discussion that we will have next year, and you can be sure that my group will be checking that the rights of employees will be safeguarded and that the quality of the service delivered, public service in particular, will be ensured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have worked in a constructive, positive and pragmatic way, and we will vote in favour of this final compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached an agreement which is not one hundred per cent what we wanted. However, it took a lot of work to achieve this, and for me it is an acceptable package. In the negotiations with the Council, we Liberals and Democrats had to give in on the European regulatory body which should be responsible for breaking up the physical and regulatory barriers that still exist in the European Union. Today, these barriers still remain at national level, preventing and blocking the free movement of trains between some European countries. Instead of this, we have accepted the network of national regulatory bodies chaired by the European Commission. We hope it is a first step to having effective European supervision. We have also achieved in this request more transparency of financial flows in integrated companies, greater independence for national regulators, five years for the multiannual contractual agreement and more opening of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore recommend that you support the agreement reached in the second reading. I also ask you not to support the request for a Polish line exemption, in order not to delay this request. I hope that, after the vote in favour of this request, Commissioner Kallas will present, as promised, the fourth railway package, which should include the requirement for more separation, more opening of the market and, hopefully, the European regulatory body.

It was a difficult and protracted process but, in the end, a compromise was reached. The single European railway area was adopted back in 2001, yet we are still far away from it becoming a reality. There are countries with a strict separation of network and operator, but no other companies on the railway network, and there are integrated concepts with a great deal of competition. This needs to be cleared up, which is another reason why we favour this recasting. Clearly, this should have been undertaken much earlier, since the Commission sat idly on its hands for nine years. It then launched the court proceedings and we actually need to wait for the court’s decision before we can deal with unbundling and some other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a strong regulatory body that takes decisions quickly and is well appointed. I say this because we have a situation where a few Member States have no regulatory body at all, where decisions are taken in a fortnight in some Member States, while in others it takes two months, once all the forms have been filled in – and it can take two years if they have not – and there are Member States where you will not even have received an answer after two years. We have therefore pushed through the regulatory body.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we would like to have had the transitional regulation in place more quickly. Given that nothing has happened for nine or 10 years, to have to wait now for another six years – as has been proposed – is slower progress than we would have liked to have seen. We have, however, managed to achieve the following: transparency, information about money flows, a start on tackling the training issue, ERTMS, a European train safety system that makes cross-border rail traffic simpler, and we have eliminated unfair competition, especially in electricity prices. Fair prices are a necessity for everyone. No one should receive preferential treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard that the separation of networks and operators and the liberalisation of passenger transport will be included in the fourth railway package. The Commission has committed to this, but we also await the decision by the court. We therefore want to see the final realisation of the single European railway area, as it is to the benefit of both the environment and – of course – the European market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can accept that we have compromised during the negotiations and succeeded in attaining a reasonable compromise on several elements: separate accounting for railway undertakings and rail network managers; non-discriminatory access to rail paths and service facilities; transparent pricing, as well as strengthening the independent national rail regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">With this new directive, it is considered that railway operators across Europe will be able to enjoy improvements and benefit from fairer competition. Unfortunately, this will not be the case in some railway markets, particularly those with different gauges in the Baltic States and Finland. This market is dominated by profitable freight transport. In reality, it is not an internal EU market, but a market with third countries. This legislation and the deal we agreed on during the negotiations means that we will open up only the EU part of the market, without getting a reciprocity approach in relation to third-country markets.</p>
<p class="contents">To be honest, I would have never imagined that, for instance, the Russian Duma would open their railway market and not ask for reciprocity with the markets in other countries at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I really regret that the safeguard clause in the initial Commission proposal and Parliament’s first reading was rejected by the Council. At the same time, a deal is a deal and, if tomorrow we vote on some particular amendments for some very special lines for a very special state, I think we will make a wrong choice. If we do this, it means that we can legislate on whether the size of the country matters in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the very opposite is the case. Or is all this perhaps really about securing profits for those private companies involved in the railway sector and bringing about a quick break-up and privatisation of what have, up to now, been national railways such as SNCF and <span class="italic">Deutsche Bahn</span>?</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom, for example, shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy of liberalisation will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. The railway sector should not lose its economic, social and environmental role for the future, and therefore must not be broken up into individual free-market radical, profit-focused parts. My group is therefore on the side of the trade unions and clearly in favour of the idea of retaining integrated railway companies, which have crucial experience and skills, in public hands. These companies not only provide social security for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased volumes of rail traffic in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the majority from the other groups essentially followed the Commission proposal for a further liberalisation and privatisation of the railway sector. It remains unclear what competences the national rail supervisory authorities and the new EU regulatory body would each have in relation to safety matters. In any case, the safety of rail traffic must be prioritised above the supervision of competition rules. In Parliament’s negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the idea was always in the background that the fourth railway package would also herald the separation of networks and operators. This, too, is something that my group will resolutely oppose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to concur with the previous speaker in that I do not feel that there is any benefit to be gained from liberalisation. I greatly regret that the Commission failed to support the attempts of the Bulgarian Government to retain the Bulgarian state railways, as being state-run will enable them to develop more easily. I believe that privatisation is also now being imposed on a large part of the means of transport which are deployed for the trans-European network.</p>
<p class="contents">However, given also that I am one of the youngest MEPs in this Parliament, I would also like to share a dream of mine with you. The majority of us Members who are here today from the farthest-flung regions of the EU have travelled 7-8 hours, including by inefficient, polluting air transport, to get here to Strasbourg to attend the sitting. My great dream is for us to look from now on into the future and see the new super-efficient technology which may be powered by renewable energy sources. I am referring to magnetic levitation technology. We should look into a future when European citizens will be able to travel safely in every direction – north, south, east and west – using highly efficient, environmentally friendly rail transport travelling at the speed provided by planes.

<p class="contents">I never fail to be astonished when we discuss the liberalisation of the railways. We have been fighting for this for 10 years, yet we still do not properly have it – not anywhere! If we talk about the results of liberalisation, at the moment, all I can say is that, thanks to the failure to liberalise, the number of kilometres of railway and the number of jobs have fallen. That is the result. What we want is a railway that is more efficient, a railway that is open, as we know that, in Europe, the railway has a completely different future to what we see at present. We have been attempting to bring this about for 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the Member States doing, however? They are continuing to create more and more of their own new rules, year after year. A train travelling from Brussels to Germany has to change voltage four times. The trains have local and regional rules to follow, which number up to 3 000. No wonder then that the roads seem so efficient. Through an efficient railway, we are aiming not only to retain jobs, but actually to create them. That is what we want, and that message should also reach the citizens and the trade unions. We have concentrated on what is important, namely, a strong regulator. A strong regulator should clear away the distorting factors that still exist. Why should we discuss large structures if we do not yet even have an authority that can say ‘company x must be given proper access to the market’ – something that is still not the case in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Polish derogation, I would remind the Commissioner that a fourth railway package is on the way, and we need to respect people who come out and say that, in their region, things are a little different, including from a technical point of view at this point in time. Could you not send out a signal that we could attempt to tackle this issue by technological means in the fourth railway package and attempt to find a way to resolve the problem at that point? That would be a very calming influence today, and tomorrow you could say that the single European railway market is on the way, and perhaps somewhat quicker than certain people suspect. That would be a good signal, particularly also the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, as we need to work together to convince the Council. That will be our most important task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This legislation helps bring that about. In this respect, it will help, for instance, by opening up basic services for the market, which is a beneficial thing to do. I would also like to offer the rapporteur specific thanks for also having stuck to the multiannual financial plans between infrastructure operators and the Member States, as doing so facilitates long-term planning in respect of funding, which provides a certain degree of planning certainty and, above all, it will have a positive impact on the development of the European railway market.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard a number of times today already that the most important element in this legislation will be organising the national regulatory bodies as they actually should be organised, which is to say, with more powers and such that they are not as weak as they are in many Member States of the Union. The situation today is that we have regulatory authorities that are unable to make it possible for other competitors to enter the market, and this means that market access is made more difficult. Under this legislation, such unfair practice will, first of all, be monitored and then it will also be eliminated and made possible for punishment to be imposed.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns what I would definitely consider a step in the right direction, by which, of course, I mean transparency in the financial flows. In this respect, it needs to be very clearly emphasised that this obviously must not pave the way for the pre-emption of the separation of networks and operators, as that would be too serious an intrusion into national subsidiarity rights. We should therefore leave it at that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur once again, and especially also to the shadow rapporteurs, for the fact that we have produced such sound legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, all our citizens probably assume that we do. We have a lack of tracks in some areas, we have different gauges, we have different technologies and we also do not have fair competition. There are some countries where it is very difficult for other competitors to enter the railway market. That is something that we must do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer special thanks to Commissioner Kallas. He has grabbed the bull by the horns and set something in motion that has actually been due for 9 years, as we have noticed that the Member States are not implementing what we decided.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Ms Serracchiani, who has really done us all a great service here. We now actually have a process in which we emphasise a strong regulator. We have always said that that is the most important thing. The second most important thing is the separation of networks and operators, which is something that we have to discuss and on which we await the Commission proposal before we can see how far it corresponds with the reality on the ground. It is very important that we should have within the package what has become known as ‘mini-unbundling’, in other words, more transparency with regard to funding streams. Mr Ertug just addressed this issue, which I believe is very important. We must do everything we can to obtain a truly complete single European railway area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I have recently found out that the Commission took advantage of this recast, in breach of the applicable rules, to amend paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7 on the notorious ‘essential functions’, on the sly and with no explanation whatsoever. If this amendment to the existing legislation is adopted, it will make the alternative solution to the complete separation that the Commission has favoured for a long time less cohesive and less effective. What is this other solution? It entails allowing Member States to retain some degree of integration, while still separating the essential functions, so that they can achieve better operational performance for both passengers and goods.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the United Kingdom is beginning to rethink its decisions, and people are seeing that complete separation is not the best way to go, I do not see why we should rush to adopt this single model for everyone today. I therefore cannot support the proposed directive on the recast of the first railway package, even though I am in favour of strong regulation and transparency of financial flows. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, I would like to draw attention to a few problem areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that the proposed application of the principle of internalising external costs will lead to an unnecessary increase in the regulatory burden. The same applies to the proposal for noise charging, although it would be voluntary. In the case of the European Train Control System, I am sceptical about the measures to compensate railway undertakings for fitting their railway vehicles with the most advanced and costly equipment, although they are not able – through no fault of their own – to make proper use of it. In my opinion, the enterprises should actually be able to use the benefits only in relation to tracks on which these systems have already been installed, otherwise we are creating a virtual reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I have serious doubts as to the compromise regarding the possible creation of a European regulatory body. I am against such a large transfer of powers on the regulation and monitoring of competition in the rail sector to one regulatory body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was tabled by four political groups: the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, and concerns the right to exclude certain broad-gauge railway lines from the recast requirements of the first railway package. Endorsement of the amendment will show that we in Parliament are both consistent and credible. In November last year, over 430 Members voted in favour of this amendment, which means that over two times more Members voted for than against. Two months ago, at a sitting of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the members of the Committee also endorsed the amendment, by 30 votes to 13. So I do not understand the suggestion made by Commissioner Kallas that this amendment could in some way put at risk the adoption of the general idea underlying the recast of the first railway package. There has been time for this, meetings have been held about it, and it was, in fact, the position of the Commission which put adoption of this amendment at risk, which is why we are having to vote on it in plenary today.</p>
<p class="contents">What is affected by the amendment? It applies to a railway undertaking or undertakings operating successfully in the EU which are of regional importance and which use a gauge different from the dominant network in use in a particular Member State or across the European rail network. These are successful undertakings, often operating in places of high unemployment, and they represent added value for particular regions of the European Union. I would therefore like to ask all Members to endorse this amendment at tomorrow’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fine policy that makes European integration central to the day-to-day concerns of Europe’s men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is all too often criticised for not working properly but, through this directive, it is at last leading the way towards a major sustainable transport policy and facilitating an important railway investment policy that will boost employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted at the key measures that have been taken to organise the railway networks: the introduction of a national regulatory body in every Member State and the creation of a five-year multiannual investment agreement setting out financing commitments in relation to rail infrastructures. I am also delighted at the introduction of transparency in financial flows between managers and operators for integrated undertakings, the reminder about non-discriminatory access to certain services and the confirmation of certain guarantees that Members of the European Parliament had called for, especially on social aspects such as omitting any reference either to a minimum service or to complete separation between managers and operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, though, to voice a demand: let us stop seeing the liberalisation of the railway industry as the only strategic goal in the development of a single European railway area, as the Commission is doing.

<p class="contents">This fourth railway package that the Commission has announced will therefore have to encompass these elements; it will have to offer a more open playing field in the transport sphere; it will have to liberalise passenger transport; and it will also have to realise the total separation between infrastructure and operations in railway transport.

He has done an incredible job.</p>
<p class="contents">This process is an excellent illustration of the role of the European Parliament because it gives us a very good opportunity to represent citizens’ interests, along with the interests of the various countries, including Hungary. What is all of this about? What is it that I wish to highlight? With this compromise that we managed to achieve, Hungary is granted exemption in connection with a very important issue, an issue of derogation, no less. The single European Train Control System will not need to be installed on trains that were manufactured prior to 1985. The value of the engines of these trains is almost zero, and installing this system would cost far more than the actual operation of the vehicle. This compromise thus allows us to make good use of rational solutions and to allocate these sums to cover the costs of future purchases of new equipment and environmentally friendly engines instead.</p>

Through hard work, we have obtained a noteworthy result with regard to the powers of national regulatory bodies, but unfortunately, we have not managed to move towards establishing a European regulatory body.

We have failed to seize the opportunity, with the recasting, to put in place a truly far-reaching regulation of noise emissions. There are at least two reasons why we need to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in transport, there are clear rules governing noise emissions in all areas – on the roads and in the air – except for on the rails. Why should that be the case? There is no reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the refurbishment will not cost much – namely EUR 5 000 to 10 000 per car or carriage. I believe that that is an amount that actually could be raised.

We have a lot of railways in Poland – no less than 19 000 km of track. Of this, 18 600 km is being integrated with the European network, and this should be happening faster, there is no doubt about this. We do, however, have 400 km – or not quite 2% of the entire network – of broad-gauge track. We are asking you all to understand that for technical reasons, it is not currently possible to insist that these lines be connected to the rest of the network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that the proposed recast directive on a European railway area is a good deal after hard work, and I hope that you will vote in favour of the proposal. With regard to our objective, various mysterious, important and sensitive words have been repeated, but I will simply say that our objective is to create a fast and reliable cross-border railway system which can serve people and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Many barriers remain. The proposed, or intended, fourth railway package will propose additional steps towards taking down these barriers, including technological barriers which are very substantial. So let us not mystify matters. Liberalisation is not a goal in itself: it is a part of the whole package.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I am happy to answer the honourable Member – who has left the Chamber – who asked about the money for investment. I hope that the whole House will support the Connecting Europe Facility in the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework. It increases resources for railways substantially. So, yes, we have thought this out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was also accused of forcing somebody to privatise railways. This has never been the case. The Commission has never forced anybody to privatise anything.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the proposal for Polish derogation, we are trying to create a single European railway area: we are not yet trying to create a single Eurasian rail area. How can we achieve our objective with derogations, exemptions, exceptions, opt-outs and abstentions? These do not make our life any simpler. We have seven gauges in Europe – seven – but we do not have special laws and special regulations for every gauge. This issue has been discussed in Council, and in Council the proposal was not supported. I hope that tomorrow, the honourable Members will not support amendments which perpetuate the fragmentation of European railways. Of all transport modes, this is the most fragmented, and we must overcome the fragmentation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is due to the particular situation of the region and the specific character of the countries of Eastern Europe, which, at one time, were under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union. In my opinion, lines of this type cannot be part of the trans-European transport network. It therefore follows that railway lines of this kind should be excluded from the application of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first railway package directive was adopted in 2001 and contained three directives on the development of the EU’s railways, the licensing of railway enterprises and the distribution of railway infrastructure capacity, the implementation of railway infrastructure usage charges and the granting of safety certificates. The objective was to revitalise the rail sector by taking a first step towards the creation of a single trans-European rail network, and by making provision for the reliable financial structure required for that purpose. The directives of the first railway package were to be introduced into the law of the Member States on 15 March 2003, but the Commission postponed initiating infringement proceedings against Member States for the improper or incomplete implementation of the first railway package until 2008. Infringement proceedings were initiated against 22 Member States, which shows that the creation of a single European railway area is still a long way off. One of the most important issues, which will hopefully be resolved in this package, is the issue of access to and usage charges for infrastructure. In this area, what is important to Estonia is Article 32 of the common position of the Council and Parliament, which permits Member States that use infrastructure with different track widths, and in which third country goods are transported, to set higher infrastructure usage charges. This enables Member States to free themselves of the requirement to subsidise third countries’ freight transport. Another significant item is the opening of the market to enable different operator companies to enter the markets of various Member States, and they must be guaranteed equal treatment in the area of both infrastructure usage charges and times, as well as access to desired services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
