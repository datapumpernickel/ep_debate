<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, on the occasion of one of your first plenary sessions, you opted to put the issue of the fight against drug use on the agenda, which clearly reflects the priority that Parliament attaches to combating this scourge that is damaging the image of sport and the health of sportsmen and sportswomen.</p>
<p class="contents">Drug use is not, at the moment, only a matter of fair competition, it is also a problem of public health. The Commission shares the determination that you have shown in this field. In fact, as you know, I have made strenuous efforts for the past five years to bring drug use onto the Community’s agenda and to take the most effective action possible within our competences. On the day that I leave this portfolio, to which I have devoted a great deal of energy, I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to present you with a breakdown of the progress that we have made together and to set out some guidelines for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The breakdown is as follows: I feel that, in five years, we have done as much as we possibly could within the existing legal framework, and bearing in mind the reluctance on the part of several Member States and sections of the sporting world to consider Community level to be an essential level in the fight against drug use.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, sport is not yet a Community competence. To put it another way, the Commission could only intervene in strict compliance with its competences, and in this field, the Commission can only intervene, in any event, with the aim of complementing and strengthening action taken by sports organisations and by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, we have been obliged to behave like teachers in explaining what our powers and our limits are in this field. Indeed, on the one hand, we have been asked why the Commission did not take more initiatives, and on the other, we have been told that we were launching initiatives to harmonise procedures for checking lists of doping products; in other words that we were appropriating powers that we do not have. The reality is that we have done a great deal within our field of competence: information, prevention, training, awareness-raising and supporting projects such as the athlete’s passport, multimedia information tools and scientific studies. We have promoted dialogue aimed at cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What does that mean in specific terms? The beginning of my tenure coincided with a period in which drug use was making front page news, with the events of the 1998 Tour de France. We were able to see that national responses were no longer adequate and that cooperation – even coordination – between Member States was crucial. At the end of 1999, I asked the European Group on Ethics, whose President at that time was Mrs Lenoir, to give us its opinion. This was the first time that this body had spoken on the subject of drug use, and the opinion that it gave proved extremely useful in the ensuing years and will continue to do so in the future. It has been the springboard for everything that we have done. In December 1999, a Community support plan to combat drug use was adopted by the Commission. This plan was received favourably by Parliament. Mrs Zabel was the rapporteur at the time. We were calling, in particular, for the concern over drug use to be incorporated into all Community policies. Within the framework of that plan and with Parliament’s help, an annual budget of EUR 5 million was earmarked for projects to combat drug use – studies, research, conferences and actions. We were thus able to support projects that promoted both information and research in the field. I should like to mention, for example, our study on the use of drugs in gyms, together with projects involving young people and a list of the laws and regulations in the Member States. Three studies were carried out by external consultants: on the socio-economic factors of drug use, protecting the young and the European communication strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us speak now about WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency. I made a substantial personal investment to ensure that an agency came into being, and I fought particularly hard to advocate principles for the purposes of effective action, so that the new agency corresponded to the wishes of those wanting to see zero tolerance applied to drug use. I stressed the need for the agency to be independent and transparent. WADA was taking shape along the lines of what we wanted and was set up in 1999. Owing to a discrepancy between WADA’s budgetary rules and procedures and Community law, it was not possible to provide Community funding, and I do not see that this can change in the future. The draft Constitutional Treaty, which does make reference to sport, will not bring any change in this regard. It must be pointed out that WADA is doing an honourable job. I would like to see it become an international institution established under public law. This would, to my mind, make it more effective and give it more credibility than the current body, which is governed by private law, a factor that poses problems.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the fight against drug use is, by definition, an international phenomenon. This is the main reason why we arranged the Marrakesh Conference in January 2002, which gave us the opportunity to look into the problem of drug use with our colleagues from the Mediterranean area. I should also like to mention the European Year of Education through Sport, during which we set up an information and warning system for our young people; in other words, an entire prevention system. Prevention is the key word, because we are not here to be repressive, which is why the Commission must place the emphasis on the aspect of prevention. It must address the phenomena that help to create an environment that is conducive to the phenomenon of drug use – the educational background of sports coaches, the role of the medical field and the pressure for success coming from sponsors.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, very important work has been done over the past five years. It has been joint work, within the framework of which I have always been able to count on Parliament’s total support. In the future, this responsibility will fall to the new Commissioner, Mr Figel, and I know he is aware of the importance of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to make two points, if I may. Firstly, the Constitutional Treaty represents a source of hope in this field because it states that young people’s physical and moral integrity, particularly that of young sportsmen and sportswomen, must be protected. We must therefore step up support for the Member States and the federations, which will still be primarily responsible. Additionally, we can support Member States’ activities in prevention, information and awareness-raising.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention a very important aspect for all future action, namely the ruling handed down by the Court in the Meca-Medina case on 30 September, which had the merit of clarifying the place of the fight against drug use in the Community’s legal environment and which ultimately confirmed the Commission’s position - one such as I have been advocating for five years - and this is to be welcomed. The ruling stated that the fight against drug use did not pursue any economic goal. In the Court’s view, the International Olympic Committee’s anti-doping regulation does not, therefore, fall within Community competition law. The purpose of this regulation is to preserve the spirit of sport and the health of athletes. To put it another way, it is a sports regulation, which leaves the main responsibility for regulating the matter to the sports federations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am very pleased with both the conclusion itself and with the way in which the ruling was expressed. I have effectively been trying to demonstrate, for five years, that the Commission is not solely interested in sport as an economic phenomenon, but that sport is, above all, a social activity with educational and ethical aspects. I also know that my successor will follow this path, because it is important that Parliament support Mr Figel on this matter, as it has always supported me. We have a responsibility to our society, and, with sport being such an important element in this society, we thus have a responsibility in the field of sport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Polite rivalry and sporting ideals have now been sullied by athletes' intense efforts to win and distinguish themselves. Within the framework of this huge effort and of massive competition, science is contributing by finding new solutions which promise great performances. Today, however, I should like to comment on the case of women and young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of anabolic agents by female athletes, especially young female athletes, damages their femininity, while abuse harbours serious risks to their health, frequently resulting in their being deprived of motherhood. Within a broader framework, therefore, the disastrous consequences of anabolic agents on young people endeavouring to mimic their idols are becoming more acute and society clearly needs our protection. We therefore find ourselves up against a new reality, the much-publicised doping. These substances are available on the market in abundance in numerous forms, either via the Internet or via the television or by mail order and, even more, in gymnasia and at sports grounds, as reported in the media. However, what we are basically ignoring is the fact that doping is a practice not only among top athletes, but also, essentially, among a lot of young people, in that substances such as these have penetrated the young generation, filling aspiring champions with hope. I would remind you that the turnover from sales of anabolic agents exceeds EUR two billion a year in Europe and about EUR six billion a year worldwide. Even though WADA updates its list of banned anabolic agents almost daily, the social problem is becoming more acute and it is the young people watching their models humiliated who are the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need immediate solutions and action at global and, more importantly, at social level in order to identify the problem and promote the necessary legislative arrangements. The intervention of the European Union in this huge social problem, which damages both the image of sport and public health, is urgently required. Do we need to mourn even more victims before we wake up and accept our responsibilities? Just the other day, one of the best baseball players in the United States died of a heart attack due to excessive use of anabolic agents.</p>

The spread of this problem, not only in professional sport, but also in amateur, individual sport, is such that we need to give this major issue priority attention, so that we can coordinate the Member States in combating it.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that, as recorded in the Commission's 2002 survey, 6% of people who exercise in gymnasia and fitness centres use pharmaceutical substances which enhance their performance. In fact, the number is higher and these substances are not approved by pharmaceutical organisations. In other words, some 3 700 000 European citizens use these substances. Unfortunately, even despite our efforts, they continue to be used. This battle needs to be fought on four levels.</p>
<p class="contents">First, by highlighting the use of anabolic agents as a public health problem, as you quite rightly said.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, by creating a legal framework – and I am delighted that you corrected the point that WADA should be an organisation under public law – which will allow the European Commission to participate efficiently in its work, in accordance with everything we had the opportunity to discuss together. I know that this organisation is indirectly financed to the tune of EUR two million for various initiatives, at a time when the European Commission, as you accepted, does not participate directly in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, by taking action so that sport is promoted through education and is not cut off from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, by correctly labelling the relevant concoctions which are widely available on the market, so that they clearly state that they are anabolic substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, which I have the honour of chairing, decided at my initiative to organise a massive public hearing in November entitled 'Doping – An Obstacle to the Sporting Ideal'.

<p class="contents">The role of governments and the European Union and the action they take will be especially important in allowing the effective prevention of the illegal manufacture, importation, exportation and spread of drug use. Legislative cooperation to prevent the spread of drug use and collaboration between the authorities are the means by which the European Union can effectively address the drugs problem in sport and prevent it and any other drug-related abuse at the same time. Governments should also adequately ensure through their own legislation that drug dealers face the consequences of their actions to a sufficient degree. There should be no genuinely harmonised legislative action to criminalise drug use in sport, nor should any be planned, as this is not something that can really be compared to the issue of narcotics, although the two do share similar features.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, coordinates and promotes the fight against drugs worldwide. The European Union should, for its part, actively support the work of WADA. The International Olympic Movement has been quite actively involved in the administration of WADA, but the role of governments has been less assertive. The combined action and energy of the Member States of the European Union would make it possible to balance the involvement of governments in WASA, thus enabling the agency to operate more effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">A global government agreement against drug use in sport is being drafted under the auspices of Unesco. The European Union should actively monitor the drafting of the agreement and coordinate the views of the Member States. With its new competence in the area of sport, the European Union should take an active role in implementing, promoting and supporting the obligations under this forthcoming agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters relating to drug use in sport often make up quite a conspicuous number of sports news stories in the media. Nevertheless, we need to keep a sense of proportion. As in other areas of society, there are and always will be those in the world of sport who do not obey rules designed to apply to everyone. We in the European Union, however, must do all we can to try to promote a clean image of sports and physical exercise. Sport is beneficial, and promotes human health and welfare.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is perfectly clear, Mrs Reding, that you have done an excellent job of finally establishing a genuine fight against drug use, at European level and at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">The main problem is, indeed, that of our athletes’ health, particularly the health of professional or high-level athletes, and at that level, we would of course need more time to see how, from zero tolerance, we could also achieve a genuine public health policy that enabled our athletes in high-level competition to be up to the level required. What needs to be done is, therefore, a matter of medicalisation and of seeing how, with the doctors at our disposal, particularly independent doctors, and with regular independent checks, we can effectively achieve a genuine public health policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Numerous efforts have, of course, been made, but I do not think that they suffice.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, the Commission announced that it would promote a proposal for a recommendation to the Council in accordance with Article 152 and, in the first half of 2002, that it would publish a proposal on doping based on Article 152. Two and a half years have passed since then and we have seen neither the one proposal nor the other. That is a black mark on the European Commission's copybook.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry because, on 14 September, in reply to a question in the European Parliament, you told us that there was no legal basis for us to do more. Yet, in May 2000, you said that there was a legal basis and it was public health. The Commission should therefore draft a directive on the basis of public health and the European Parliament should give it its urgent attention.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This ever-increasing phenomenon is in fact not being fought with the severity it deserves and this is also probably why more and more athletes start using drugs, in some cases in the foolish belief that they are practically harmless or at least not very dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Drug use is also assuming really worrying dimensions as an economic phenomenon: it is in fact behind an enormous volume of business which evidently benefits large criminal organisations among others. Our question to the Commission is whether Community support measures in the battle against drug use in sport, which financed 32 pilot projects from 2000 to 2002, can truly show a positive result in terms of effective action, or whether instead the entire Community programme should be entirely rethought. Let us bear in mind first that it is actually today that the tenth conference of Sports Ministers is meeting within the ambit of the Council of Europe, with the aim of encouraging honesty and transparency in sport, and second the great educational values associated with the development of sporting activities, as evidenced in this very year of 2004, which has been the Year of Education Through Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask the Commission whether it should not actually commit itself more thoroughly to the battle against drug use and whether, after having financed research projects on the phenomenon, it should not now go on to finance information and persuasion campaigns, prevention campaigns in brief, which would be truly more incisive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
