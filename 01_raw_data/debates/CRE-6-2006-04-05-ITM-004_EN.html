I am now appearing before you for the second time, and you will perhaps recall the promise I made at the beginning of the Austrian Presidency, to the effect that we did not want this to be a presidency characterised by our own themes, aspirations and desires, but that we wanted to offer you a team presidency, one that would see us working very well together with you, the democratically-elected European Parliament, with the Commission, and – of course – with the Member States too. Regaining the confidence of the people is a massive task, and it is one that we can accomplish only together, and it is together that we must address the great issues that Europe alone can resolve. In so doing, we must make use of all the institutions. There is no point in one institution pointing the finger at another or criticising it. We are all in the same boat and must keep a firm hold of the oars and row together if we are to gain speed and be able to reach our destination.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that you too can see that we have, from the very outset, tried to establish this collaborative approach within a team presidency. Without making much fanfare about it, the past weeks and months have seen us, together with you and the Commission, able to achieve quite a few solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by giving you a brief report on the European Council. A year ago, under Luxembourg’s Presidency, we set ourselves the task of giving the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment new impetus. It is not enough to come up with rhetorical and woolly phrases; what we need instead is results and actions of the kind of which Robert Schuman spoke, when he said that Europe would not be built in a day, but by action, and probably by actions in the plural. We have also, and for the first time, brought about institutional change, by involving the European social partners in the deliberations of the European Council, which was attended by the President of the European Trade Union Congress, Mr Cándido Méndez Rodriguez, with the President of UNICE, the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe, Mr Ernest-Antoine<span class="bold"> </span>Seillière, taking part in the discussions, and with the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, present for the first time. The President of this Parliament, Mr Borrell, did of course speak for it and thereby make a very important contribution to this discussion on business and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our presidency has set itself very definite objectives. You have yourselves been able to see from the media that many of them were highly contentious. We have not allowed ourselves to be discouraged by this and have included several very precise formulations in the conclusions, particularly in those concerned with work and growth. The most important thing for us is that the employment situation should be improved for the sake of Europe’s unemployed, who number some 18 million. In practical terms, we want to achieve a 1% growth in employment by means of the national reform programmes and improved framework conditions, which would amount to the creation of some 2 million jobs a year, or, by 2010, a net increase of an extra 10 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is our quite deliberate intention to concentrate on the training of the young, so that 85% of young people under the age of 22 should get higher education. Our intention is that the number of school drop-outs should be reduced by 10%, and, quite specifically, that by as soon as next year, all young people should, within six months, be offered either a job, an apprenticeship or the chance of further training, with this period later being reduced to four months.</p>
<p class="contents">We have agreed a gender equality pact in the workplace, ‘flexicurity’ is being discussed in great detail at every level, and the globalisation fund proposed by the Commission provides us with the proper means of giving, through retraining or additional training, a new chance in the labour market to those workers adversely affected by structural change.</p>
<p class="contents">The next big issue is, of course, the question of how that is to be achieved, and we have taken the decision to prioritise the small and medium-sized businesses that were, formerly sometimes treated less than kindly. We have considered the practicalities of how we can make life easier for small and medium-sized businesses – of which there are some 23 million – by reducing official procedures and abolishing administrative rules. The Commission – in the persons of Commissioner Verheugen and President Barroso – has put forward a highly intensive programme of ‘better regulation’, following a Dutch model and providing quite crucial impetus towards a 25% reduction of administrative chores. We want to make it easier for young entrepreneurs to start up businesses. The intention is that they should be able to get one up and running within a week, with a single point of contact ensuring that small businesses do not have to deal with umpteen different administrative bodies, but can start operating as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much obliged to the Commission for raising the de minimis threshold, which, I know, was not an entirely simple matter within their own institution. Doubling this threshold is a vitally important initiative and enables us to make life much easier for small and medium-sized businesses and also makes it easier for us to encourage and support them. I would also ask you not to forget that we, through the European Investment Bank, have made available an additional EUR 30 billion through subsidised loans, guarantees and sureties, enabling small businesses in particular to make real strides in creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The third topic I would like to address is knowledge and research. We are perfectly well aware that one consequence of Europe’s wage levels is that we can get the better of our competitors only if we do more for training, research and knowledge. It was, of course, as long ago as 2000 that we set the 3% target. The only thing is that we have not achieved it. What is new about these conclusions is that we have got every single country, in the annex to the conclusions and which forms part of them, to commit itself to being able to actually achieve this 3% target in every year right up to 2010. My comment on the previous debate is that, if we succeed in this – and it will of course call for considerable efforts – the consequence of it will be that EUR 100 billion more per annum, drawn from the national budgets and from private industry, will be invested in research. That would be the most massive injection for growth that one can imagine in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still true that the European Investment Bank will help us out with EUR 10 billion in additional risk capital, and, if the private contributions are added to that, that adds up to an additional injection of EUR 30 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me as particularly significant that the European Council has adopted Mr Barroso’s idea of founding a European institute for technology, although it was at first highly controversial, for the understandable reason that there are those who fear the creation of huge parallel bureaucracies, while others fear that the existing centres of excellence could lose out. I fully support the basic idea that the Commission is putting forward here, the idea of creating a link between institutions of higher education and industry, between research and development on the one hand and the end users on the other. This would not be some sort of super-authority, but a perfectly developed network primarily intended to really cooperate with the institutions in the Member States. I congratulate Mr Barroso and the Commission on their proposal’s adoption and acceptance, and we look forward to concrete proposals for legislation by June of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is important while we are on the subject of the budget is the undertaking we have given to make substantially more funding available for students’ programmes and for exchange programmes for apprentices. You have already heard about the additional EUR 800 million in the budget compromise right now. That is a very interesting and important initiative towards giving young people new prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">What was interesting was that I recently read a number of studies that considered in a critical light the reasons why we have as yet not achieved the ambitious goals of our strategy – Lisbon, jobs, employment – and one of the reasons given by the Sapir report and also by the <span class="italic">European Policy Centre </span>was that there was too little 'national ownership' – dreadful term! – which means, in as many words, that nobody in the Member States actually feels themselves to be responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where I am setting a good example: at the last Council of Ministers in Austria, I decided that we would have a coordinator at ministerial level, so, with immediate effect, our Minister for the Economy and Labour will be the political coordinator for this whole process, and I will invite every Member State to do likewise, so that we will have policy coordinators who can then – perhaps in the Competition Council – monitor our achievement of the goals we have set ourselves. That would be a vitally important move towards establishing the credibility of what we have, together, undertaken to do.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that was of course completely new was energy policy, and here the prime mover was the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, although I also want to thank Tony Blair for having in fact set the whole thing off at Hampton Court. It was of course the first day of January this year that gave us a real wake-up call and raised the alarm, for it was on 1 January, while I was sitting alongside Angela Merkel at the New Year’s concert, that the Russians cut the energy supply – by 30% in the first night, and by 50% in the second. We managed – with the help of the Commission, of Commissioner Piebalgs and many others – to defuse the crisis within four days, but the problems have of course not gone away.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost all the producers are based in political crisis zones; nearly all global conflicts have something to do with energy. Raw materials prices are fluctuating wildly; there is but little diversification. Some of the time, and in some areas, Europe is at high risk of a black-out. Climate change, with all its attendant phenomena, is an issue that we have to face; an answer has to be found to the issue of the worldwide increase in demand for energy, and we must not, of course, lose sight of the enormous security risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole situation positively cries out for a new joint effort on the part of Europe, and the Commission has done a first-class job of preparing the ground with its Green Paper, which the Council has taken on board, also defining as its three objectives security of supply, the competitiveness of our own industry and the improvement of environmental quality. In practical terms, we agreed on a 20% reduction in energy use – something that I do not think goes without saying and is therefore all the more significant. What that in fact means is that the EU is setting itself the long-term target of decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. I regard this as one of the most important decisions that this Council has taken, and one which will demand enormous efforts if it is to be put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to increase the contribution of renewable energy from the present 7% to 15%; that, too, has been a cause of much controversy and is in no way an automatic process. Both at the national level and together, there is much to be done. The use of biofuels, which currently stands at 2%, is to be increased to 8%, and that will inevitably demand technology and research; it will involve consideration of second-generation biofuels, the implementation of CARS 21, and cooperation with the motor industry, and brings with it an enormous opportunity for growth, of which we want to make use.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the cross-border trade in electricity, we aim to achieve a 10% share between networks, which would substantially reduce the risk of a black-out for our consumers. It must not be forgotten that the pipelines, the networks, the power stations and network security offer economic opportunity, with between EUR 800 billion and EUR 1 000 billion invested in them, mainly from private sources. If we make wise use of this by way of a common European economic policy, it will prove to be a powerful generator of jobs and will also make us more secure.</p>
<p class="contents">Connected with this – and this is something else we debated frankly, without public disagreement – there is the requirement that there should be no protectionism in a relatively small market like Europe. Having been Minister for the Economy, and hence also for energy, for six years, I know what I am talking about here. There may well have been a time when we could all, off our own bat, create national champions or believe ourselves capable of disregarding European regulations, but those days are gone.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is for the markets to be opened up, and it has been agreed that this is what will happen to the electricity and gas market by mid-2007. The instruments to do this exist; the Commission is in possession of them, and so let it go ahead and use them without further ado, for one reason why it is the guardian of the Treaties is in order to guarantee security of supply to our consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that the energy mix has lost none of its importance, and the decision as to what source of energy to use still has to be taken at national level; that is something I want to make perfectly clear. Each country must make up its own mind whether or not it wants nuclear power stations; Austria’s position is quite clear on this – and I know that other countries take a different one – and that must be respected. I guarantee that it will be, and so, of course, does the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vitally important that we consider this not only in economic terms but also in the foreign policy context, and that is why it was agreed that the Commission, working jointly with the High Representative, Mr Solana, should produce a strategy paper on the foreign policy dimension of energy policy. With hindsight, these discussions and these decisions will be regarded as a breakthrough in terms of a genuine common European energy policy. Reviews to be carried out in every term of the coming presidency will ensure that this issue is not to be lost from sight.</p>
<p class="contents">It also, though, strikes me as very significant – and reaching consensus on this was not easy, for I had to spend a lot of time talking with all the Heads of Government in order to prepare the way for it – that I managed to get everyone to accept the decision on the services directive that your House took democratically and by a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful to the Commission for having, as soon as today, produced a proposal that is – as far as I can see so far – in line with this consensus. I really am keen that we should work together as closely as possible in a fast-track procedure at second reading in order to arrive at a joint resolution as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my thanks to the social partners at the European level for having played their part in this. The employers did not find this easy, but they did make a constructive contribution. Following this breakthrough – for that is how I regard the services directive – I would, though, ask for a similarly committed approach to a second important matter, that being the Working Time Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know how important it is that we make progress here, and how it will be if we do, but we will need to be sensitive in taking account of national peculiarities. I regard this as an example <span class="italic">par excellence</span> of an area where the subsidiarity principle can come into its own. A sensible compromise is preferable to having no solution at all. I would be very happy if we were to be able, during the Austrian Presidency, to achieve together real progress at all three levels – services, the Working Time Directive and the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the budget. I know as well as anyone that bringing it into being has been a problematic business. Some of you, of course, may be permitting yourselves smiles of amusement in the knowledge that it has – contrary to what one might presume – demanded hard work on the part of three presidencies: Luxembourg, the UK, and now Austria. This budget is for a period of seven years and is intended to provide not only legal certainty for the programmes but also, and primarily, to enable the new Member States to implement the things for which they hope. I really am appreciative of the way in which – as everyone in this House has in fact pointed out – we have thought in terms of the whole and not of individual interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Believe me, I too have had to intrude on several internal security zones to arrive at this common consensus. As you will be aware, this has also called for a very great deal of dedication on the part of the Austrian Presidency’s negotiating team – our finance minister, our foreign minister and of course myself – in our dealings with Mr Barroso and Mr Borrell, to whom we are very grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">You will also be aware that we had to stick closely to the December compromise; we were able to offer up to 3.5 billion, although Parliament wanted 4 billion, and it testifies to the presidency’s teamwork that the Commission eventually helped us out by coming up with the missing half billion for administrative expenses, so that Parliament got the minimum of 4 billion in the programmes that it wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">If one includes the European Investment Bank in the analysis, one comes up with some interesting results. There will be a billion for strengthening the EU’s external aspects, and an extra billion will really stiffen the sinews of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. You can add to that EUR 5 billion for the Lisbon Strategy, half from the European budget and half from the European Investment Bank, cash. The rest are loans, taking the figures up to 10 billion for research, 20 for the trans-European networks, 30 for small and medium-sized businesses – all in all, EUR 60 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been some very considerable shifts, and I believe that this is a compromise that we can honestly recommend should be accepted. I must now also go to COREPER and to the other Member States, but I do think we have already achieved something that really is credible in the eyes of the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is foreign policy, where we have, quite apart from managing such crises as bird flu, the row about the cartoons, the gas crisis and the great foreign policy issues, to clarify a number of points, but that is not the main issue today. There is only one issue I want to mention, because I have seen that Alexander Milinkevich is up in the gallery, and that issue is one that also featured at the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Belarus is, of course, a tragic one; I can tell you right now that that is how I personally see it. I had, yesterday, the honour and pleasure of a long personal conversation with Mr Milinkevich. He is a calm and reasonable man and deserves from us every conceivable political and economic support wherever it is required, especially through the various party families, for the opposition in Belarus is constituted by a platform composed of the most diverse groups. The state’s forces having been brutal in their treatment of demonstrators, hundreds are still in jail, and thousands of students have lost their places at university; workers have lost their jobs and families their incomes. A number of Member States have formed a coalition, the Visegrad states – Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary – among them, and Austria is also playing its part by offering scholarships to Belarusian students, and this is what prompts me to ask the Commission for support, in order that we might give Belarus real help. Above all, we must join together in raising our voices and demanding the prompt release of the internees, in particular of the presidential candidate Alexander Kosulin.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should also stress that the EU has no interest in isolating Belarus, and certainly not its people. We should also support civil society in Belarus in establishing the democracy they want. The regime there will be subject to the restrictive measures we adopted at the European Council for as long as it continues its authoritarian approach and systematically suppresses civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have three months of our presidency ahead of us, and I know that there is a lot of work in store for us, but I am confident that we will – as we have done before – resolve the important issues through good contacts and good cooperation. I am very confident that you will, as you have done before, have your own contributions to make, which may well be critical or exacting, if you have particular thoughts or ideas. I can promise you my absolute cooperation, and I will also try to move as much as possible forward at Council level, without great fanfare and proclamation, but rather in such a way as to achieve real results. That is my programme, and I believe I can point to its having achieved a certain amount even before our presidency has reached its halfway term.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr Schüssel, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the prevailing scepticism and contrary to a certain cynicism that is taking hold today, I believe that it can be said that, despite the difficult times it is experiencing, Europe is making progress, and the European Council of 23 and 24 March demonstrated that an enlarged Europe can also make progress. The momentum initiated last autumn has put Europe and our institutions back at the centre of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The message emerging from the European Council is clear. Europe needs to tackle the main problems linked to economic growth and employment. The week before the Spring European Council, I presented to you, in this Chamber, the issues at stake in that meeting, which was a crucial meeting because it represented the first occasion on which the revived Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment was to be implemented. I can tell you today that the objectives set by the Commission have been attained. I am thinking not only of the excellent reception given to our Green Paper on energy, but also of other practical proposals, including the one concerning the European Institute of Technology. In saying that, I am not speaking merely on behalf of the Commission, I am also speaking on behalf of the general European interest: I believe that we can unreservedly congratulate ourselves on the outcome obtained by this Spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Guided by the excellent work and the perseverance of the Austrian Presidency, the Heads of State or Government have accepted the principle of partnership for the new Lisbon Strategy. They have declared themselves ready to move into top gear and they have also taken major decisions paving the way for the actual implementation of our commitments under the new Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have monitoring mechanisms. We have 25 national reform programmes. From now on, the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the political forces, the social partners and public opinion in general can embark on a course whereby measures take the form of results: they can move on from the stage of rhetoric to the stage of practical measures in the form of results. The key word in English was ‘delivery’: the practical presentation of results.</p>
<p class="contents">The main example taken up by the European Council concerns the move towards a genuine energy policy for Europe. The person who recounts the history of European integration in 20 or 25 years’ time will be able to say, without any exaggeration, that an energy policy for Europe was launched in March 2006, under the Austrian Presidency. We are only just at the beginning with this, and it will not be easy. There will be resistance, but there is resistance because there is change. If there were no change, then there would be no resistance. On this matter, I can assure you, on behalf of the Commission, that it will exercise all of its powers in relation to integration, because – and we wish to state this firmly – there is no reason why Europe should have 25 energy markets. There is no reason why, in this day and age, Europe should have 25 national energy policies. We need a common strategy for Europe in relation to energy. There is no room for nationalistic reflexes. The Member States have reaffirmed their desire to work together in seeking common solutions and acknowledge the Commission’s central role in terms of setting up open and competitive markets at Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Lisbon Agenda, we have no time to lose and we now need to get results. It was in this spirit that, immediately after the European Council, Mr Verheugen and I met the national coordinators overseeing the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda. We informed them of the Commission’s desire to thoroughly fulfil its role not only in terms of providing support and assistance, but also in terms of monitoring the implementation of the national reform programmes. I wish to congratulate Mr Schüssel, who has just announced his desire to increase the level of representation responsible for monitoring the Lisbon process in his own country, Austria. We should also like to take advantage of this to launch an appeal to all of the Member States to do the same. Sound technical preparations are obviously important, and we are very pleased with the technical level attained for this exercise in the various Member States. That being said, we also believe that it is important for the programme’s success that we increase its standing in the political hierarchy, as Mr Schüssel just announced in relation to Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission will continue to provide impetus at European level. We also agree on the need to launch exchanges of practical experiences. We believe that the time has come to hold meetings in the various Member States, something that we are going to do from autumn onwards. This close contact with the Member States is crucial when it comes to making progress with our programme, but it is not enough. Allow me, in this Chamber, to lend my support to Parliament’s powerful message concerning the need for the greater and even more extensive involvement of all of the actors concerned at this crucial stage of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made efforts to clarify the levels of responsibility and competence of the various institutional, economic and social actors at European, national and regional level. We must now promote a genuine kind of ownership of the Lisbon Strategy by all of these actors. I call on you to focus all of our efforts on the crucial reforms with a view to preparing Europe to rise to the challenges of globalisation, together with that of an ageing population. We can win the globalisation battle.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do so, every one of us must also participate in the communication efforts and in the public debate. I welcome the partnership that exists between the European Parliament and the national parliaments. As recently as January, you debated the Lisbon Strategy in this context. I can only encourage you to pursue this dialogue and offer you the Commission’s support. Your Parliament and the national parliaments are the key actors in this debate because, together, they all represent the people of Europe. We will be unable to make a success of the necessary reforms without the broad support of the people, who will ultimately benefit from our efforts. </p>
<p class="contents">There was vision in this European Council, but it was also a practical European Council. It left everyone with an in-tray of work for the coming months. Not least, it gave the Commission a clear mandate for action over the coming months, and I want particularly to thank Chancellor Schüssel for his team work, team spirit, the way he understood, the way he supported the role of the Commission and the need to give consistency and continuity over time for the work that will follow different presidencies of the European Council. That approach of partnership between the Council, the Commission and Parliament is essential. Without that spirit and cooperation we will not be able to achieve real progress.</p>
<p class="contents">One area where Parliament’s role has already been decisive in finding a compromise was and is precisely that of the services directive. It took some time to convince the Heads of State and Government, but eventually the European Council backed the line that Parliament agreed and that also received our support.</p>
<p class="contents">If you remember, since the beginning I have said, and the Commission has said, that if there was a real, clear consensus from Parliament, we would be ready to work with you to resolve this services directive issue. Yesterday, we presented to you our amended proposal and you see that it fully reflects the compromise endorsed by a large majority in this House in February. The revised text preserves the balance between the urgent need to unleash the full potential of the internal market for services and the preservation of our European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, we presented the communication providing clear guidance on the application of Community rules on the posting of workers. As to freedom of movement for workers, I also want to commend the announcement made by several Member States following the Commission report in terms of anticipating the end of the transition period for the free movement of workers. After Ireland, Britain and Sweden, we now have Finland, Spain, Portugal and most recently the Netherlands, which have announced their wish to anticipate such freedom of movement for workers, so that is the way for us really to have an enlarged Europe that works.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also follow this amended version of the services directive with a communication on social services of general interest. We are also working hard on health services. On the basis of the text now presented, I expect the Council and Parliament to conclude the legislative procedure rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention three areas where I believe the European Council took decisions which will have a real and lasting impact. First, business: we all know that for new jobs we must look to business and small and medium-sized enterprises, because they create most of the jobs. The decision to cut red tape for new business is a sign that Europe is now becoming open for business. As for SMEs, I was glad that the Commission received support for its approach on state aid rules and for cutting administrative burdens. We will take this work forward swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, knowledge: the proposal for a European Institute of Technology excited some debate. Good. I take it as a sign that the EIT has real importance. A flagship for European excellence in education, research and innovation is a genuinely new idea which needs imagination and drive to work. With the green light from the European Council, we will be working to flesh out the plans and to show how the European Institute of Technology will be an effective catalyst for knowledge and growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my introduction, the European Council paid particular attention to energy. It put the Union on the path to a real energy policy for Europe. It endorsed the triple goals of our Green Paper: sustainable, competitive and secure energy. It also set out the practical measures to be taken, including some of the 20 specific proposals set out in the Commission Green Paper: a real internal market for energy, a coherent external policy, effective support for energy efficiency and renewables. The Commission’s forward programme for energy is now very busy. As a result, I really believe that specific measures will be delivered. It was important for this not to be a one-shot show. Now it is very fashionable to speak about energy, and now Member States accept what – let us be frank – two years ago would have been impossible to accept: that we need a common strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">So, for the June European Council, as Chancellor Schüssel said, the Commission and the High Representative will come up with some ideas on the external dimension of energy policy. We decided to put that matter under constant review, monitoring it every year at the spring Council. That was important in terms of consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">After all those internal points, the European Council was also able to send a strong message of commitment on the Belarus situation. The Commission is working with the Council very actively to promote the reinforcement of civil society in Belarus and to support the independent media so that the citizens of Belarus have access to media that is not censored and not controlled by a government that does not respect the fundamental principles of a democratic state.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now moving in the right direction. We are putting words into action. We know what we should do; we agreed to do it, and now we are doing it. We are doing it in partnership with the European Parliament, the European Council and Member States, and also with businesses, trade unions, consumers and citizens across Europe. I believe that is the only way to deliver more growth and new jobs. I believe that is the right way to get out of a very negative situation for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, there is now a feeling in Europe of scepticism, sometimes cynicism. The right way to change that is to deliver concrete results, to resolve the services directive issue, as we have been doing, to settle the financial perspectives, as I hope will now be done. I will not comment on that now, because I did that in my introductory remarks. So, if we can achieve results, we will create the best atmosphere for settling the institutional problems that have to be settled and for creating a new impetus for this Europe. That is our duty. We should do more to achieve it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Gert Poettering, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the European Council, Chancellor Schüssel, spoke of the responsibility that the European institutions have in common, and the President of the Commission has just been talking about actions. Addressing the President of this House in particular, I can say that my impression is that we – by which I mean you three and the whole European Parliament – find ourselves today in a situation in which this sense of community and of shared responsibility for the future of the European Union is making itself felt. It is my profound conviction that this is a good opportunity to restore, by our visible actions, the mindset that makes this European Union appealing to those who live in it, and to do this also with reference to other issues that we are not debating today, such as the Constitutional Treaty, to which we have to find a solution. That is our shared responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to note that the President of the European Council is working hard, together with us and with the Commission, on the common destiny of Europe, and doing so unspectacularly but with professionalism and efficiency, and sustained by European conviction. People – often wrongly – see Brussels as a symbol of bureaucracy. Success will be ours if we – and on this point it is particularly the Commission that I am addressing – carry the Lisbon process through to a good conclusion, spelling it out that we want less bureaucracy; what we want is a freer internal market, for the stronger the internal market is, the more we will succeed in opening up the market in the European Union – something in which the services directive is an important instrument – with less regulation, fewer subsidies, and more competition, so that we become all the more competitive on global markets. It follows that we must go for fewer laws and more freedom for businesses, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, for the less bureaucracy and the fewer the costs that small and medium-sized businesses have to bear, the greater the capacity for job creation. That is what matters most of all, for we are not talking here about the economy in the abstract, but about the people of the European Union, and that is why I am glad that the President of the Council has just had something to say about young people, for the worst thing of all, in fact, is for young people to have nothing to look forward to, and that is a state of affairs that we must do everything in our power to prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to energy policy, we have heard from the Polish Government, which does not demonstrate much commitment to Europe, that it expects European solidarity in matters of energy policy, and I say that they are right to do so, for this European Union is founded upon solidarity. We need a European energy policy, but what I would also say to the Polish Government is that, if they demand solidarity in this area, we can expect them to display the same solidarity when it comes to the future of the elements, the substance, and the principles of the Constitutional Treaty. Solidarity is not a one-way street, and on it we keep on meeting one another. We need solidarity with one another for the sake of our European future.</p>
<p class="contents">As my time is up, let me make one final observation: perhaps we have to give some thought as to how this House and the chairmen of its groups can adequately express themselves; they do not need as long as the President of the Council and the President of the Commission, but we must share out the time properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this House has just welcomed Alexander Milinkevich. It was my group that expressly invited him to be here today. While we debate energy and the economy, we must never lose sight of the foundations on which we stand, namely our values, human rights and human dignity, which are the reason why we are taking a stand for democracy in Belarus, and it is our doing so that makes our defence of human rights in Europe, and around the world, convincing.</p>

Before the last meeting of the Council, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the President of the Party of European Socialists, submitted on its behalf a plan of action for growth and employment that we had drafted together with the socialist ministers of the economy and finance. At the heart of this action plan is the use of state investment and public expenditure as means of stimulating private spending, the very same thing that you spoke of when you said that the available resources of the European Investment Bank would be used to this end. That is a good socialist approach, and, in taking it, you can count on our support.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards energy policy – and this is a topic to which I should like to return, since it is at the heart of your report on the European Council – it is indeed the case that we need a single European strategy for it, and the first thing to be noted when we consider one is that the Member States decide their energy policy for themselves. Please allow me to reiterate this point. You have again told how, at the moment that Russia turned the gas tap off, you were at the New Year’s Concert, sitting next to the German Federal Chancellor. Now I do not know whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship at work here, but that is something we can disregard. Perhaps you could do me a favour and say to her, not at the next New Year’s Concert, but the next time you meet her: ‘Angela, do as I do and leave energy policy alone’. As far as nuclear power is concerned, that is the right thing to do, and you will get a lot of support for doing it, not only from people in your own country, but also in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial issue is about how we apply solidarity to our handling of energy policy. This is something that the Council has to decide, and it cannot follow the example of Buridan’s ass, which stood between two piles of hay and ended up starving to death because it did not know which one it should eat from. It is of that that the European Council reminds me in almost every area, for the problem is always the same. We hear the Council making fine statements about what Europe has to do, and when its members – your fellow Heads of State or Government – go home, they forget the undertakings they gave to Europe and answer only to their national publics. There you see the European crisis in a nutshell; that is what our institutions have to overcome together. The European Parliament is playing its part in this. We have put together a decent services directive – the adoption of which by the Commission was announced yesterday – and I regard one of the highpoints of the last Council meeting as being the Council’s unanimous statement that they would make that, too, one of the planks of their common position. That is a good sign. It shows that Europe – under this House’s leadership – is making headway. It is an unfortunate fact that this cannot be left to the Council and the Commission alone, and so we will carry on biting at your heels.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment, Mr Schüssel: I have to agree that everything looks good around the middle; the Austrian Presidency is doing a good job. Today, again, you made a number of remarks – and you know perfectly well to what I am referring – in which you alluded to certain aspects of what needs to be done over the coming weeks. All in all, you are a smart operator: you assured Mr Berlusconi that you were willing to help him save Europe from Communism, only then to meet with Mr Prodi a couple of hours later. You know how to balance different interests in such a way that it works to your benefit. If we can all make good use of that skill for the good of the European Union, then we will be right behind you.</p>

Congratulations to the Austrians for avoiding a row. The Presidency conclusions were, as so often, pledges of economic reform in directly inverse proportion to acts of economic reform. But the optimists among our number note that the tone of these Presidency conclusions is different. As Mark Twain said of Wagner’s music: ‘It’s not as bad as it sounds.’ Even socialist prime ministers have accepted that the game is up, that the market has to come in to give us growth and prosperity. All Council members accepted that environment policy can make an important contribution to jobs and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making progress and, combined with the prospect of an interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspectives and the economic growth that we now foresee, there is hope again for our Union. I welcome in particular the Commission’s decision this week to mount legal challenges to those flouting the rules of liberalisation, because that is the kind of action that we need from the Commission to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is remarkably resilient. Progress may not be made in one area, but it springs up somewhere else: an energy policy for Europe, a good step forward; or more countries wanting to join the eurozone. The drive for common endeavour may come now from the challenges from outwith, rather than conviction from within. But I hope that the Austrian Presidency and the Finnish Presidency that follows it can take this new spirit forward and help us to reconstruct a constitutional basis on which to build our Union for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group believes it is time to drop the focus of the spring Council on economic reform. You need three Councils a year. You need to discuss other issues – important issues such as Belarus. You could have discussed, as proposed by some Member States, the issue of Guantánamo Bay, where EU residents are still kept.

Too often in recent years we have seen in Rome, in Paris, in London and even in Berlin attempts to unpick the Community method, to pull Europe apart at the seams – national capitals that risk enhancing global anarchy in the name of preserving national sovereignty.</p>

<p class="contents">That being said, Mr Barroso rightly pointed out that the people expect results and that the European Union’s legitimacy comes from the obligation to provide results. We need instruments and resources first, however. In this respect, allow me to turn to Mr Schüssel and the Council – since we are, in fact, debating the Council’s conclusions – and put three proposals to him.</p>
<p class="contents">My first proposal concerns the EU budget, which was discussed a short while ago. I believe that it must simply be repeated that this budget is insufficient and inconsistent from the perspective of the Lisbon objectives. The proposals currently on the table are EUR 110 billion below the figure proposed by Parliament and EUR 200 billion below the figure proposed by the Commission. My first suggestion is that we therefore need to speed up the work on the European Union’s own resources, as you yourself pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The second suggestion concerns the role of the European Investment Bank. I believe that what has been decided is interesting, Mr Schüssel. EUR 30 billion is all well and good, but ten times that amount is actually needed, according to economists’ estimates. From that perspective, I believe that the Council ought not to paint itself into a corner and agree to open a debate on the European government bonds. We must harness the savings of the general public in Europe in order to finance both sustainable transport networks and eco-efficiency. To begin with, this could be done in the context of the eurozone: the Council conclusions refer to this. I believe that this is an important point.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, here is my third suggestion: I believe that the debate within the Council on the development of taxation systems in the countries of Europe must genuinely move forward. As you are well aware, in the next 20 years we will be faced with the problem of funding social security systems in nearly every country in Europe. If we continue not to take decisive measures enabling tax to be charged on mobile bases, including at European level – which, I might add, brings us back to the issue of own resources – then the present situation will endure, with greater inequalities in the distribution of incomes together with an increase in the number of poor people that social safety nets will no longer manage to support.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have three suggestions, Mr Schüssel, and I would hope that the Council, under your Presidency and under subsequent Presidencies, will look into these types of proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Where are the practical measures to address the need to double economic growth and jobs with rights in order to reach the levels of 2000? Where are the responses to unemployment, which has reached 18.5% of young people of working age under 25 and around 10% of women of working age? Where are the responses to the growth in unstable, poorly paid work, at a time when 32% of employed women work only part time and over 43% of employed young people only have a temporary contract, without any future prospects?</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the only responses put forward have been the few vague commitments in terms of jobs, without any reference to the quality of that work or the practical measures to achieve this, and this is the most glaring symptom of the increasing tensions in a number of EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly shocking that there have been no responses to poverty, which affects over 15% of the population, and that poverty has not been deemed a serious violation of human rights. Social inclusion should therefore be at the top of the political agenda of the Commission, the Council and the Member States, and this is simply not the case at the moment. I should therefore like to propose a challenge. What is needed is a change of direction, whereby the accent is placed on economic and social cohesion policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I wish to begin by saying that I absolutely deplore the way this House has been used this morning, in this debate, to fight national political elections. If we in Parliament cannot show enough maturity to deal with the real issues of the European Summit and the European Council, rather than going back to basic party political bickering between different individuals, then it is a sad reflection on this House. In fact, a lot of positive things have come out of the European Council meeting that we should be promoting very strongly, in particular the commitments given to increasing employment opportunities and increasing the amount of money to be put into research and development; assisting in the expansion of the lifelong learning and education and training programmes; utilising the resources available to the European Investment Bank to kick start small and medium-sized enterprises, to give them an opportunity to create the jobs and to create the economic wealth and growth which is necessary within the European Union. The overall new policies that we are trying to work towards include a common energy system, where we recognise, of course, the rights of the Member States to deal with their own energy issues, but also see where those individual Member States can cooperate with each other to guarantee minimum resources as regards safety and security, with regard to interconnection and to guaranteeing the proper use of funding for research and development as regards new renewable energies and in particular on biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">In our desire to help the environment, whilst at the same time reducing our dependence on imported fuels, we could use new energy crops to run all of our public transport in the European Union, if we so wished. We could use solar energy to heat our houses, if we so wished. We could use biomass to heat factories, schools and hospitals, if we so wished. However, that requires us to make an investment to guarantee that the technology is available for all and, through our taxation, to give preference to energies that are less damaging to the environment, as we did with the introduction of unleaded petrol many years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the positive side, yesterday we saw where Parliament can respond. With regard to the services directive and the financial perspectives, Parliament is willing to act as a political body to ensure that it can deliver on behalf of the European citizens, in cooperation with the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">However – and this is the downside – when we speak about small and medium-sized enterprises and encouraging greater growth in research and development, and put forward the wonderful idea of a European institute for technology and expertise, the one thing that is missing in all of that is a proper EU legal framework for the protection of intellectual property rights, because companies and businesses will not invest in R&amp;D unless they are guaranteed protection for their ideas. We have failed miserably in the European Union to put in place a proper legal framework to allow that money to be utilised alongside the public funding that is available. We have delivered on our commitments, we must now ensure that we can deliver on our future promises for the future generations in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will comment on the phrase he used, when he said that we need to get past nationalistic reflexes; of course he used the word 'nationalistic' to make national reflexes sound scary.</p>
<p class="contents">But did we not teach national reflexes to the peoples of Europe at the time when communism and internationalisation reigned supreme? In the face of the internationalisation of communism, we cultivated national reflexes in the people. We named the League of Nations 'League of Nations', not 'League of States'; we named the United Nations Organisation 'United Nations Organisation', not 'Organisation of United States', precisely in order to cultivate national reflexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are telling them to abolish these reflexes, precisely because we need to serve the globalisation which is the other face of internationalisation. That is the truth, and when you talk about a common energy policy, it means that you are committing the states to not being able to have their own national energy policy. If they do not have their own national energy policy, it means that they cannot have better relations with the Gulf States, which have oil, or with Russia, which has energy. Consequently, you are taking all the peoples, all the states hostage and, of course, the people understand that and that is why they react. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The services directive and the Financial Perspective are coming up to the finishing post, the Presidency’s record for the first half of its term is a good one, and there are plenty of winners, including SMEs, young people, the trans-European network projects, and much else besides.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remind ourselves: the Summit a year ago was a flop, with its debates dominated by accusations and counter-accusations, and everyone saying that the EU was in crisis. Half a year ago, the Summit was rejected; the EU seemed paralysed, with little to show for itself, and a large majority in this House repudiated what emerged from the December summit. What, then, is happening today? Our Parliament has demonstrated its capacity for driving things forward; none of the three institutions has thrown in the towel, and the Council is once more capable of negotiating and getting the job done. Together, we have brought the EU back on course; we can all feel that in our bones. We cannot – and I certainly do not want to – separate this success from the Council’s Presidency and from its President, Wolfgang Schüssel. His experience, his professionalism, his way of working, his habit of taking action rather than making speeches, has brought us all together and made today’s result possible. For that we are grateful, and we Austrians can take pride in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Financial Perspective has involved the reallocation of a total of EUR 7.9 billion; together with what came out of the Summit, the services directive provides us with the most potent programme for growth and job creation in the EU for years. There is more work to be done on it, so that what we have set ourselves we may actually bring to pass. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One fact is that there has certainly been some progress on the energy policy front, at any rate as far as the last Council is concerned, but what we have to concern ourselves with now, Mr President-in-Office, is its implementation. What I would like to see is a lot more thought given to implementation and infrastructure. Reference has already been made to Poul Rasmussen and his initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, we adopted the directives on the Trans-European energy networks; we now have to get our hands on the money for them. Since there is too little for that purpose in the European Budget, we must find national budgets that will contribute their share. You said that we are all in the same boat, and that everyone has to row; I do not see everyone bent over the oars just yet, but I hope that will happen.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the foreign policy elements – and this is something I would like to address to the Commission – we have been making this demand ever since the Commission was appointed, ever since it took office. It is late in coming, but it is on the way, and I hope that we will get some statements in this half of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Council is right to say that our atomic energy policy is a matter for the nation states. While I do of course endorse the Austrian approach, the issues of safety and of proliferation, along with the comeback that atomic energy is making, will have major roles to play, and that is where I would like to see more being done.</p>
<p class="contents">Science and research: the list included with the Council conclusions is actually a sad one. Two countries – Sweden and Finland – are way out in front, and it is thanks to them that we hit the 3% mark. Nor, alas, is even Austria far enough advanced to reach 3%. In this respect, too, we all need to pull on the oars, particularly those of us with higher incomes and greater economic clout, who must row more strongly, so that we achieve the 3% we have aimed for.</p>
<p class="contents">My last remark has to do with the services directive. I am grateful for your support. This will be an essential element in the social Europe, provided that we can get it through this House and that you can get it through the Council. That is quite crucial. Although you referred to the employers, you did not mention the employers in the cooperative sector – which is itself of vital importance – or, in particular, the employees’ representative organisations, which have done much to bring about the social Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Promising the creation of 10 million jobs was, after all, strongly reminiscent of the first Lisbon summit. The emphasis on youth was something else that tended towards the rhetorical, and, to judge by the French example, the young do not appear to have taken much notice of it. I regard the globalisation fund as a reward for those who reject reform; fostering structural change is what the structural and cohesion policies are there for.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz is also right to say that the Member States would not pull their weight. At an energy summit held in Berlin yesterday, everything was up for discussion except the opening up of the electricity and gas markets. Not a lot is to be expected of the Member States on this front, and so it is all the more encouraging that the Commission is at last rejoining the fray and instituting proceedings against the Member States, not least the French, in respect of their protectionism on the energy markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The necessary response, then, is not to do as in the past and make promises, but to make more competition possible, and the fact that the Commission is at last doing something about this gives cause for hope. I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I would say to Mr Schüssel is that it is yet to be seen whether opting for 20% more energy efficiency and 15% renewable energies amounts to a breakthrough. For my own part, I am convinced that the most important thing about this is that we need, in transport and energy, a new culture, so what do I mean by that?</p>
<p class="contents">If it is indeed efficiency that we want, we need to forge an alliance with artisans and banks in order, at last, to make headway with our stock of buildings. We need an alliance with the major cities in order to make our cities, once more, welcoming and pleasant places in which to live; we need less traffic and to be mobile while consuming less oil. The reason why this initiative does not, I think, do sufficient justice to this is that the Commission relies too much on big business rather than on an alliance with small and medium-sized businesses and the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three specific questions that I would like Chancellor Schüssel to answer. The first has to do with research into energy. How do you propose to explain to the Austrian public and to Austrian small and medium-sized businesses the fact that we, in the fifth research programme, will be spending, or intend to spend, five times as much on nuclear power than on renewables? How, too, do you propose to carry on a debate about nuclear issues in Austria and Europe when Mr Barroso has deleted any reference to ‘risk’ as regards the atom from the Green Paper? I have to tell him that an ideology-free debate is one in which we also discuss the risks associated with things nuclear.</p>

I say that it will not, any more than will the national budgets, if you care to take a look at those. The funds that are needed for research and development, for training and education, are quite simply not being raised as they should be.</p>
<p class="contents">At your summit, you said that more needs to be done for the small and medium-sized business sector, and you were right to do so, but, if I want to do something for the small and medium-sized business sector, if I want to create jobs, then I have to do something to bring about an increase in public investment, and it is an unfortunate fact that that is not increasing, not in the Member States. I have to do something to build up domestic demand, and you cannot do that by cutting incomes, by trying to extend people’s working lifetimes, by substituting private insurance schemes for social security systems founded upon the principle of solidarity. That is precisely the wrong way to go about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, we need to replace the Lisbon Strategy with a strategy of European solidarity and sustainability. Just take a look at the results. The risk-of-poverty threshold has not changed; it stood at 16% in 2000, and that is the level it is at today. During the same period, long-term unemployment has risen from 3.9% to 4.1%. The percentage of people in work has risen from 63% to 64%, which represents a slight improvement. We are a very long way from what we undertook to achieve, and the reason for that is that the strategy is wrong. This Lisbon Strategy in its present form will get us nowhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Netherlands has already made the suggestion that two European summits per annum for decision-making are quite sufficient; I would argue in favour of abolishing these talking summits, because the promises made appear impossible to fulfil upon the return home. I only need to mention France in order to prove my point. French energy companies are carrying out foreign take-overs, but the borders remain closed for foreign take-overs in France, and now that the services directive is on hold, foreign workers are also barred. In that way, one step forward is accompanied by two steps back.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the riots in France are a demonstration of how difficult it is to reform the social system. The Lisbon process is running aground in the protest of the electorate. We will need to drive home to protectionist France too, though, that the social system is untenable without reforms. The EU may no longer tolerate France’s braking effect. If a European summit of Heads of Government were to come to a decision to that effect and to enforce it, then its meeting would be wholly justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Council acknowledges in the conclusions the exceptional importance of creating a more favourable entrepreneurial environment and praises small and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone of the European economy, speaking of the need to support them and to support entrepreneurship generally, but unfortunately this is only a paper exercise. The European Council has missed a unique opportunity to proceed from words to actual deeds. I was expecting the politicians to find the courage to support the Commission’s original proposals regarding services in the internal market, especially the principle of country of origin, and that the Council would thus give clear signals that it really was thinking seriously about developing the entrepreneurial environment. That did not happen, however. The Council opted for the emasculated and populistic proposals of this Parliament and ended up doing nothing whatsoever for small and medium-sized enterprises apart from issuing words of encouragement. I cannot see this being the path to fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy and greater competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet what is the feeling that one is left with? While on the one hand notable progress has been made in the field of energy – progress that six months ago would have seemed unthinkable – there have been other areas in which sadly we have not gone as far. Why is that? It is because the Lisbon Strategy committed the cardinal sin of not giving the Commission the responsibility for implementing, and being the focal point for, this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now made an effort and this is why progress has been made. Much more must be done, however. The Member States must give the Commission that responsibility and the resources to facilitate this much-needed progress. In this regard, I must say that we wholeheartedly welcome the support given to the European Institute of Technology. After all, it makes no sense to have 25 European research policies that are not geared towards the key objective of the knowledge-based economy and that still lack the resources and the critical mass to be able to compete with other more developed economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, if we wish to send out a clear message today that the Lisbon Strategy is alive and if we want it to be implemented quickly, we must give the Commission the resources to enable it to get the European Institute of Technology up and running, which to my mind would be a very important step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that when a Frenchman speaks English, the President leaves the room. The second is that when a journalist asks him if a promulgated law should be applied, the answer is ‘yes’ in Brussels and ‘no’ in Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">‘You had better get used to this, no matter how hard you work’: that is what the people of France have taken away with them. Trouble is brewing in this country; in the space of ten months it has been subjected to three revolts: the first one manifested itself in votes cast at the ballot boxes and expressed a form of hostility towards capitalism; the second one manifested itself in the riots in our suburbs and expressed a form of revolt against discrimination; and the third one manifested itself in strikes and demonstrations and expressed a form of revolt against all the insecurities linked to employment. From that, I deduce – and forgive me for talking a little more about my country – that, for your next Council more than for this one, and irrespective of what you did there, there is an aspiration that needs to be fulfilled, namely mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fellow citizens felt that there was much more of an ‘every man for himself’ attitude during that period. France must take on its share of the responsibility for this, because it is no stranger to that kind of attitude, but it is not the only one. We therefore need confidence, and trust in each other as befits its Latin roots. The Commission and the Council must follow this path. Another aspect relates to protection because, in a way, our fellow citizens fear that Europe does not protect them enough. Good luck! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ageing of the population in Europe is, in fact, not so much a challenge as a life-threatening problem, not only in terms of keeping our social security systems, and therefore our economies, intact, but also, quite simple, of securing the continued existence of European peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, solutions are sometimes put forward that only make matters worse, in fact. Just think of the plea for fresh, large-scale immigration. The Commission has published a Green Paper in a bid to explore this route. Whilst this may serve the short-term interests of some companies or industries, you can certainly not count on public support for it. The problems are already incalculable as it is. If the EU wishes to alienate itself from the public even more, then it should go down this route.

<p class="contents">They are hopeful in the sense that, for the first time, a Council text includes a paragraph dedicated exclusively to the launch of the common energy policy, because it stresses issues on which the European Parliament has been insisting for a long time, such as the correct application of the existing directives, the need for the Member States to fulfil their commitments in the field of interconnections, the lack of investments in infrastructures and in research and development, and the need to complete the internal energy market: a series of proposals that we hope the Member States will comply with as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us face facts, however. Once again, the Council has shown a lack of vision and ambition in the crucial field of energy. With the exception of a couple of issues, such as the need to speak with one voice on the world stage and the possible creation of a solidarity mechanism to deal with situations of crisis, the other measures are already provided for in various directives in force and in agreements from previous summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we need a frank discussion amongst Heads of State or Government on the political obstacles that certain governments are placing in the way of the proper operation of the internal energy market. Conclusions advocating the creation of a single market cannot be signed when, at the same time, national champions are being proclaimed and a form of protectionism which seriously harms the process of integration is being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by telling the Council that we are pleased with its proposal that the existing obligations should be complied with, but disappointed that it lacks the political courage to establish a genuine common energy policy, which this House and the European Commission are calling for and which the Union urgently needs, because its future depends on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be interesting, for example, to know what the Commission thinks, from a European point of view, about the Baltic gas pipeline and European solidarity. Furthermore, having accepted Parliament’s views on the Directive on the liberalisation of services, the Commission should offer us a directive on services of general economic interest.

<p class="contents">On the Lisbon Agenda, I welcome many of the Presidency conclusions but, sadly, Europe has yet to find an answer to its underlying economic malaise. Governments find it easy to sign declarations of intent but harder to put into practice what they profess.</p>
<p class="contents">On the services directive, I admit I am unhappy with the Council compromise. I have always urged the British Government and the Council to go further in a liberalising direction, but my words have fallen on deaf ears. Mr Blair talks the talk; he says he is leading the way and that the rest of Europe is falling into line, but I think he deludes himself – and not for the first time. A truly liberalising services directive would be the most fundamental sign of Europe reforming, which it desperately needs to do now and not at some vague date in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The most disappointing aspect of the Council was, however, the fundamental failure of leaders to speak forcefully on the rising tide of protectionism. We expected to hear something – at least a memorandum – from Mr Berlusconi, as he seems to have spoken on every other subject recently, and from Mr Blair. But what happened? The Council meeting could have made clear its determination to fight the protectionist threat to Europe’s prosperity and the functioning of the single market. It was the perfect time to seize the high ground and it failed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, it is left to President Barroso to make the case. I congratulate him on his continuing determination on this issue. Last week in Florence he said that national governments were giving in to populist temptations. I agree. It is time to consider what action should be taken against those who seek to attack the basic rules of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I also congratulate Mr Barroso on the action he took yesterday to clamp down on energy giants in Europe, which are using their industrial muscle to hinder competition and distort the market. This legal action against those who are trying to restrict an open European energy market will be welcomed by all those of us who believe in free markets and the completion of the single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union’s priority must now be innovation in its broadest sense, together with investment in knowledge. This will lead to economic growth and increased employment. It is therefore surprising that yet another Council is cutting expenditure on research and on educational programmes. In some cases the percentages of the cuts are actually in double figures. How can such decisions be justified? How is the Union supposed to compete when its economic growth is barely 2% and average unemployment has reached 9%?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s budget has been put on a strict diet, but if it becomes gradually slimmer it will not be able to cope with the needs of an expanding Union. In addition, an emaciated Europe will not be in a position to compete with the United States, China, and India, whose economies are robust.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise reached yesterday on the negotiations concerning the Financial Perspective is certainly welcome and awakens some slight hope that the Lisbon Strategy will not simply remain on paper but will become a priority aim. Paradoxically, however, it continues to appear at the end of the list of expenditure, and by that stage funds have usually run out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The distinction made by the Council between the Belarusian authorities and Belarusian society is particularly significant. This important distinction was proposed by the European Parliament as the basis of the Union’s strategy towards Belarus. It is not enough, however, just to condemn the fraudulent elections and the use of force, and to call for those imprisoned to be released. More and more targeted sanctions are needed. The list of persons banned from entering the Union should be extended and bank accounts frozen.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the European Commission in particular are not doing enough for Belarus and they are reacting too slowly. The Union should be providing much stronger and more specific support to civil society in Belarus. Belarus should be treated in the same way as Ukraine was in its time. Firstly, we should call for the fraudulent elections to be held again. Secondly, a sizeable solidarity fund managed by non-governmental organisations should be set up to support Belarus. Thirdly, we should call for more than the token effort made to date to ensure that independent television and radio can actually be received in Belarus. Belarusians themselves should be employed to provide the information broadcast. Fourthly, the scope of certain Union programmes like the Erasmus student exchange programme should be broadened to include Belarus and its civil society. Fifthly, and this is my last point, the Union and its Member States should arrange stronger diplomatic representation in Minsk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I am very glad that we succeeded yesterday evening in achieving agreement on the financial framework, so that we now have enough time to allow things to really take off in 2007, with all the programmes being implemented. We are very confident that you, Mr President of the Commission, will very soon approve and review what the Member States have come up with by way of structural policy, so that we do not waste time.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are talking about the summit, I have a second comment to make; I do not believe that competitiveness can be decreed from on high; it has to grow from the bottom up. I would of course like to see all the things you, Mr President-in-Office, quite rightly set out this morning brought to life and implemented on a local basis. It is quite plain to me, when I see how, in Germany today, it still takes between seven and eight weeks to set a business up, because people are sent from pillar to post, that it is on the ground that things have to happen. I hope that the initiatives you have taken will help to achieve that, and I can tell Mr Schulz that people in Aachen, which is so close to the border, know perfectly well just how uncompetitive German legislation is even in North Rhine Westphalia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to make a few brief comments, firstly, on the objectives: What would we like to see? Should we actually be setting ourselves targets? To that there is the inevitable criticism along the lines of ‘what about their implementation?’ Or are we not, then, to set ourselves targets? I tend towards the view that, yes, we should be bold enough to set ourselves definite targets, targets that are capable of being reviewed, notwithstanding the risk of one or other country, or perhaps the whole European Union, failing to achieve what we have set ourselves 100%, but the ten million jobs – 2 million a year – is a realistic target.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, we managed to create 2 million extra jobs in the European Union, and we can now take pride in the real chance we have now that the economic cycle is in a relatively healthy state and many European countries are beginning an upturn, and this is something we must not talk down. Yes, of course it will call for national commitment and for funding of infrastructure. In Austria, for example, we are making a very good job of this, and other countries will do likewise, but the goals are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who have said that the European Council should be done away with altogether, I have to say that I really do think that is the wrong idea. What we have to do is invest more time and more energy, and that may even mean meeting more often – perhaps with fewer cannon and mortar effects and less media hype – but real work, hard work, is what is needed if we are to get anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my second topic: A number of speakers have described themselves as less than completely satisfied with the financial perspective, measuring it solely against what the Prodi Commission originally proposed. Now you are all experts; you know perfectly well that this proposal was not realistic. It cannot be said that we now have EUR 200 billion less than what was proposed then; if you compare that with what we had over the past seven years, there has been an increase of over 100 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">There have, in particular, been enormous increases in those programmes that your honourable House regards as important. If you take only the example of research and development, provision is made in the budget for an increase in excess of 75% over the next seven-year period. The amount allocated to the trans-European networks has doubled; that available for lifelong learning has been increased by 50%, so now between 30 000 and 40 000 more young people virtually right across Europe, have the opportunity to learn. For the neighbourhood policy, 40% more has been made available; the foreign policy budget has been increased by 250%.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two options open to us: either we send the people out there the message that all this is far too little – which they will actually believe, for you, Members of the European Parliament, enjoy a great deal of credibility in your electoral districts – or we can say that this is a great advance, bringing us closer to the targets we have set ourselves, and then they will take that seriously and say, yes, that is a significant step forward. I repeat: every single one of you knows that, and you are all aware of the position I am in, caught between those who have to pay up and those on the receiving end. All that has to be extracted from the national budgets, and you know that. The only solution is a new definition of what is meant by ‘own resources’; that is the only way to deal with the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Getting this Financial Perspective off the ground in the first place was a great achievement, and for it I would like to thank Mr Barroso, the President of your House and all the groups in it, and the negotiators. It was not easy, but we do now have the chance to get down to work straight away. I really do ask for general support, for people, wherever they are, want to hear that we are getting somewhere with things, and not just about the disputes that go on between the groups and between the institutions. Nobody out there is interested in the question as to whether EUR 500 million more could have been found somewhere or whether or not the Council was offering EUR 500 million too much.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters to them is whether we can now get stuck into the job for the next seven years, in the people’s interest and in Europe’s. I am ready and willing to do so and I very much hope that we will work together on the constitution issue every bit as well, so that we may well not have a solution in place by June, but we will be able to map out a way whereby we will achieve the better legal basis that we all need.</p>

An honest assessment would certainly reveal that these results have overall been welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that not all of the honourable Members are entirely satisfied, because there are naturally differences of opinion. There can be no denying, however, that we have seen results in the energy sector, in SMEs, in research, in the employment objectives and overall in the new system of governance of the Lisbon Strategy. Consensus has also been achieved at European Council level as regards the services directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards energy, I wish to underline that our work has certainly not finished at the European Council and that the results of yesterday's Commission meeting will show you that the Commission is determined to ensure that all of the principles of Community law are upheld: for example, compliance with the principles of the internal market and with competition rules. This is a vital prerequisite if we want to retain credibility, both within and outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards SMEs, a particularly important step was the encouragement by the Austrian Presidency and the Commission to reduce the red tape that hampers so many potentially job-creating initiatives by companies.</p>
<p class="contents">As for research, for the first time all Member States were able to accept workable research and innovation objectives, and this is extremely important. Equally important was the broad support for the idea of the European Institute of Technology and for the Commission now having a mandate to put forward a proposal. The fact that employment objectives were set is also very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline one new aspect that arose at this European Council to which Chancellor Schüssel did not allude, but which I feel is worthy of mention. To some extent we already work in team presidencies. Chancellor Schüssel, as President-in-Office of the Council, has taken every opportunity to introduce the debate to the Commission, and to the forthcoming Finnish, German, Portuguese and Slovene Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is important in terms of ensuring the continuity and sustainability of the Commission’s efforts. The Commission is also able to provide such continuity and consistency over time because, however good the Council presidencies may be, they change every six months. There needs to be constant effort, which can only happen if the Commission takes the lion’s share of the initiative and if Parliament provides constant support.</p>
<p class="contents">These points were positive. Similarly welcome were the confirmation of the agreement in principle on the services directive, and the news we received last night, or I should say early this morning, on the financial perspective. I am totally convinced that if we achieve practical results, if we manage to resolve problems on a regular basis, we can take this Europe of projects forward, regain the confidence of our citizens and find a better environment for resolving some of the institutional issues that need to be resolved. I therefore feel that we can look forward more positively to the June European Council, which of course will not be able to resolve the constitutional question, but which will certainly be able to point the way forward towards defining Europe’s future. The Commission is working actively with the Council to this end and we hope to be able to make a worthwhile contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">With this team spirit, this spirit of partnership, Europe can and must move ahead.</p>

<p class="contents">This measure might not be enough to overcome the chronic deficit in European R&amp;D expenditure, and a great effort is still required if the objective of devoting 3% of GDP to R&amp;D is to be attained.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to involve the private sector in this effort, since we can clearly see that public budgets are not enough. We therefore need to make progress with taxation in order to encourage businesses to invest more readily in R&amp;D.</p>
<p class="contents">This purposeful policy is what we are awaiting from the revised Lisbon Strategy, which needs to offer a stimulating, effective and, above all, simplified European regulatory framework for European businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
