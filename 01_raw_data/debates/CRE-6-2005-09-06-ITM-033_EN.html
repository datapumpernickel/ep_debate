<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Exports of products from FYROM</span></p>
<p class="contents">As part of the European strategy for the Balkans, the Thessaloniki European Council (June 2003) called for the extension of the Europe-wide system of diagonal accumulation of rules of origin to include the Western Balkan States with the aim of boosting economic growth through support for the export trade. To this end, the Commission is in the process of setting up a zone for the accumulation of rules of origin, initially comprising the EU, Croatia and FYROM. FYROM has, in fact, already concluded a bilateral free-trade agreement with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures has the Commission already taken to ensure that products exported from FYROM to the Member States of the EU are not shipped under the constitutional name of that country but under the name recognised by the UN and the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">If, nevertheless, the FYROM authorities persist in using their constitutional name on the accompanying documents, certification or any other documentation relating to the exported products, what measures will the Commission take to uphold the collective decisions of the EU on this matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003, the Commission was invited: 'to prepare the extension of the pan-European diagonal cumulation of origin to the countries of the region in a manner consistent with all relevant Community policies and dependent on their administrative capacity'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently analysing different possibilities to allow diagonal cumulation with the countries concerned. In any case, any further possibilities of cumulation for the Western Balkan countries will be built on the basis of the stabilisation and association agreements developed under the stabilisation and association process.</p>
<p class="contents">The current SAA linking the EU with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in force since 2004, and specifically Protocol 4 thereof, clearly sets out the requirements and procedures for granting preferential treatment to products originating in that country, including the movement certificates and other proofs of origin. The text of the agreement refers to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the only designation of the country and accordingly that is the only name that can be taken into account as the country of origin on the movement certificates and other documentation required for preferential treatment to be accorded. Consequently, Member States' customs administrations should not grant preferential treatment to goods which do not comply with the relevant provisions of the stabilisation and association agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under this provision, accessing any user's terminal equipment, such as a personal computer or a mobile phone, or storing information on that equipment is allowed only if the user is given clear information about the purpose of such activities and if the user is offered the right to refuse it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a general rule when such devices are intended for a legitimate purpose, but the situation is different if the purpose is malicious and the intention is to harm a computer system or its user. These forms of malware are clearly banned by the e-Privacy Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As is generally the case with European Union directives, the choice of remedies, penalties and enforcement tools lies with the Member States. However, in February 2005, the 25 Member States went beyond the e-Privacy Directive by adopting the Framework Decision on illegal attacks against information systems. Under this Framework Decision, spyware-related activities involving illegal access and interference with information systems are punishable by criminal penalties of no less than one to three years' imprisonment, and of no less than two to five years' imprisonment when committed by organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">However, legislation is not enough on its own and may produce the expected results only if it is combined with other measures, such as complementary enforcement measures, industry cooperation, including standardisation research, and better user awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as enforcement measures are concerned, the EU has a contact network of spam authorities – CNSA that aims to ease enforcement cooperation between national authorities on spam and related issues. The last meeting of this network was mainly devoted to spyware, often spread via spam, and the challenge it represents for enforcement authorities and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Spam, spyware and adware are just examples of the many security threats that risk undermining the value of the internet and of electronic communications. The Commission is therefore planning to put forward a strategy for a secure information society that puts together various actions to make electronic communications networks safer from fraudsters, harmful content and technology failures, and to increase trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Another big step towards improving internet security was taken by the Commission in 2004, when ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency, was established. This Agency has already hired its first members of staff and developed its work programme, and, in August 2005 – just a few days ago – it established itself in its headquarters in Heraklion, Greece, and will soon be fully operational.</p>
<p class="contents">ENISA will help the Community, the Member States and, consequently, business communities to prevent, address and respond to major network and information security risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its document entitled 'Financial Perspective - Why 1% is not realistic', the Commission explains that 1% of GDP entails a huge cutback in funding for Bulgaria and Romania as well as for the full integration of the 10 new Member States. Nor will the 1% enable an agreement to be reached to ensure financial balance between the 25. Second inconsistency the strengthening of competitiveness urged by the UK Presidency is incompatible with its 1% proposal.</p>

<p class="contents">As the Honourable Member implies, the deadlock on the financial perspective has done nothing to reduce the urgency to reach an agreement. There is a real risk that the necessary measures will not be in place to allow Union policies to be delivered effectively beyond 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remain focused on the goal of a better balanced budget with a good compromise between existing spending on our tried-and-tested policies, and our new policy agenda for growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will provide full support for the UK Presidency, and looks forward to working to promote a timely agreement. The Commission also looks forward to the efforts of the Presidency of the Council to lead the debate and take the initiatives required to reach a compromise. When there are significant differences between Member States on the function and the focus of the EU budget, the need for compromise is very clear to everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to work actively to find a compromise which will enjoy the necessary support amongst Member States, and will allow for the agreement of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to the interinstitutional agreement setting up the new financial perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No. 42 by Justas Vincas Paleckis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0612_EN.html">H-0612/05</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: New measures to project the idea of a united Europe and tell citizens of the Member States about the EU's practical achievements</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the media and society as a whole are engaging in ever more frequent discussions about ‘the democratic crisis in Europe’, ‘the distance between the bureaucrats and the citizens’ and the fact that ‘people’s real lives are being ignored’. For the most part these are populist slogans that seek to use the wave of Euroscepticism for political gain. However, as the outcomes of the aforementioned referenda have shown, there is a real difference between the official position of the EU and its Member States and the opinions of the public. This is a sign that calls for decisive action, especially as the governments of EU Member States are often keen to take the credit for positive initiatives (including those backed by the Commission), while they blame ‘Brussels bureaucrats’ for negative, unpopular or unsuccessful decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission’s position, and what plans does it have to address the matter? More specifically, how do the Commissioners view the situation? Are there plans for new measures to be taken to project the idea of a united Europe and provide information on the EU’s practical achievements? How is the Commission going to coordinate its actions in this field with the governments of the EU Member States?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> For this Commission, communicating with the citizens of the European Union has been a key strategic objective from the start. This is why we have been engaged in a lengthy and comprehensive analysis and consultation within the Commission itself and in an equally comprehensive dialogue on this issue with many of the actors concerned, and Parliament in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the Commission has developed a new approach to European communication based on three strategic principles that all clearly put the citizens at the heart of European policies. Firstly, the Commission will further improve its efforts to listen to citizens and to take their views and concerns into account. Secondly, it will better communicate how its policies affect their everyday lives – an aspect mentioned by the honourable Members. Thirdly, it will go local and adapt its communication to the different citizens' sensitivities according to their country, region, language, and their age, sex, profession, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 July 2005, this materialised in the adoption of the internal action plan to improve the way in which the Commission communicates Europe. The aim of this plan is to improve the organisation of the Commission's ongoing communication work on the basis of the three principles. Concretely, this plan gives details of 50 very pragmatic actions – most of them to be carried out immediately, i.e. within the next 12 months – to make the Commission's existing comprehensive communication work more professional and effective. For example, the Commission will make better use of those communication tools that most people prefer – i.e. the audiovisual media and the Internet – and will do this in the language they understand. It will provide its staff with specific training in communication skills and recruit communication specialists as well. It will integrate communication aspects into policy formulation right from the beginning and it will reinforce the Commission's representation offices in the Member States and help them better focus on acting as our ears and spokesmen on the ground by simplifying and reducing their administrative burden.</p>
<p class="contents">However, communicating with European citizens is a task that goes far beyond the Commission's remit. Therefore, the next step will be the White Paper on communication, which is meant to engage all stakeholders and all institutions. In this paper, the Commission will set out the policy vision and the initiatives that it thinks have to be undertaken in the medium and long term, in cooperation with other actors. Among these actors are the European institutions: Parliament, in particular, has an essential role to play. Both the Commission and Parliament already have long-standing good cooperation in this area, which has gained even further momentum in the last months. However, if we really want to achieve substantial change in European communications, it is true that it is even more urgent to enhance cooperation and coordination with the Member States in order to set up a strong partnership with their governments and regional authorities, civil society and the media as well. The White Paper will address the role of all the stakeholders and launch a broad consultation procedure in order to give them the possibility to define and organise their input. Based on the results of this dialogue, common actions will be defined.</p>
<p class="contents">Good communication is essential for a healthy democracy. However, the public debate on Europe in the first half of this year has shown that at present there is no agreement or understanding about what Europe is for and where it is heading. This is why we need not only a new approach to communication, but also a good discussion about the future of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission is developing a plan D – as I have called it – where D stands for dialogue, debate and democracy. This is also in line with the declaration by the Heads of State and Government at the June European Council stating the need for a reflection pause to organise a broad debate. In order to reconnect Europe's citizens with the European project, they and their organisations must be given a stronger voice, and we, the decision-makers, must develop the ability to better listen to their concerns and expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's role in this process would be that of a facilitator, providing support to Member States and civil societies to make this plan D happen. However, it is essential to avoid as much as possible a top-down approach, as democracies are by definition bottom-up. Again, this is not something that the Commission or, for that matter, the EU institutions can do alone. If we are to succeed in creating a more citizen-driven Europe that can meet the challenges of today's globalising world, Europe's policies must also be solidly anchored in the governments and parliaments of each Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The institutions are blaming each other. The Commission will, of course, use the argument of Member States not wanting to do this or that, or not implementing policies. The Member States or their governments are keen to take credit for something that is going very well, but if something happens where they have to compromise, they will say it is the fault of Brussels. Parliament is also part of this blame game now and then. We have to create, first of all, a modern story of why we need European cooperation. When people have been asked in Eurobarometer opinion polls, for example, most have said that it is a good idea to cooperate. They see the added value of working together to counter so many of the problems that one nation can no longer deal with alone. But we also have to address young people to get them on board. We have to have some kind of common message of why we need the European Union. The peace argument is of course still valid but it is not enough. The young generation needs arguments about how we want to deal with today's problems and tomorrow's problems as well – the ones that they face and are affected by.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to ask for Member State governments, of whatever political colour they might be, to be loyal to the project and to be able to explain the pros and the cons, the problems and the challenges of being involved in such cooperation. However, first and foremost, we must deliver results, so that people can see that this brings an added value to Europe. We work together and we are able to solve some problems for citizens by working together in this European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The EU's information strategy</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has previously claimed that the EU's lack of legitimacy in the eyes of citizens and the prevalent scepticism regarding the draft EU Constitution were due to inadequate communication. In other words, there was nothing wrong with the EU or with its draft Constitution: the problem lay in people's ignorance. Following the referenda in France and the Netherlands, the Commission has launched Plan D, in which D stands for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Does this mean that the Commission has changed its assessment? Does the Commission now consider that the EU institutions have already gained too much power at the Member States' expense and would gain even more if the Constitution entered into force? Or does democracy merely mean that more communication, that is, political propaganda from Brussels, will persuade citizens to change their attitudes and accept the EU as it is now and as it will be in future under the terms of the draft Constitution? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should not spread political propaganda. Informing people is one of our responsibilities in serving the public. It is about transparency and accountability. This is an area in which the Commission has cooperated constructively with the European Parliament for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 July, the Commission adopted a package of measures designed to improve communication and with the help of which we wish to show in a clear and pragmatic way how we can improve the dialogue with people throughout the EU. It is also proof of our commitment to more dialogue, consultation and debate about the role of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Our measures are based on three principles: listening better, describing how EU policy affects people’s everyday lives and giving the message a local slant. The first principle in particular, that of listening, shows that we are prepared, and have the will, to continue with further democratisation. It is about more actively soliciting people’s views and, right from the beginning, taking account of these when new policy and legislation are drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lundgren asks me whether I believe that the EU institutions have already been given too much power at the expense of the Member States and would be given still more under the proposal to establish a constitution for Europe. My answer is no. Firstly, the fact is that every decision to give powers to the EU institutions is an independent decision by the Member States. Moreover, the purpose is not, of course, to <span class="italic">weaken</span> the role of the national governments but to <span class="italic">increase</span> their opportunities to achieve goals of common interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the whole of the debate we are hearing here in the Chamber, not just today but at other times too, shows of course that what actually happens is precisely the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember what has happened. We have put forward a proposal about establishing a Constitution for Europe. Referenda on this proposal have been held in two founder Member States, with the people voting against it. Surely this cannot be treated as a problem to be solved through more propaganda offices and more money for providing information etc. Must we not respect these votes as a grass-roots decision, that is to say one rejecting the Constitution? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is also why we are asking ourselves what the explanations are for these ‘no’ votes. What is the import of the ‘no’ votes in the Netherlands and France? It is important to carry out this analysis and simply to listen to the arguments that were used.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a fair knowledge of what these arguments were in both France and the Netherlands and of what the explanations for the ‘no’ votes were. The votes also reflect a situation and problems that are more far-reaching and that exist not only in those countries but also elsewhere around Europe. In my opinion, too much of this project has been reserved for a fairly small political elite, this being a situation we must change.</p>
<p class="contents">People today demand more of our democratic systems. They are better educated and better informed, and they want to be involved and to feel that they can influence matters. It is in this area that we must improve the way we operate. As I see it, there are also two routes to go down: one involving a right and the other an obligation. The right is the right I have as a person to be given information about what is going on, how decisions are made and what is being decided of relevance to me, my everyday life and my future. The obligation is the obligation of these democratic institutions to inform people about what is happening, what decisions are being taken and how people can be involved and exercise influence. We cannot pretend that we do not have this obligation also to inform. Some people call this propaganda but, for me, this is a very important task of ours. Providing information should be one of our fundamental tasks. It must, then, be done in a professional and efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">Can you imagine <span class="italic">any</span> other institution of this size not being engaged in public relations or the task of communication, that is to say having no relationship with those people whom you in Parliament have to represent and with whom we should have some dialogue and discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of the 13 countries that have ratified, two have done so by means of referenda. Those votes are of no less value than those of the countries that have withheld ratification. The European Parliament is legitimated by reason of being directly and democratically elected. The Commission derives its legitimacy from the European Parliament and from the governments elected by the national parliaments, and this entitles it to argue politically the case for objectives held by a majority of its own number. I therefore want to ask you again whether it does not make sense for it to get involved in day-to-day political debate. If, for example, a manifestly false assertion is made in a given country, should a contrary position or correction on the part of the Commission not be communicated on the same day via national press conferences or by other means, so that such views cannot take root? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Out of curiosity, I looked at the agendas of local councils. I looked at different local authorities in Sweden in order to see what in actual fact ties in with the decisions taken by the European Parliament. In every case, there were at least three or four issues that could be directly linked up with the debates conducted in this Chamber and the decisions taken here. Naturally, these were issues of common interest, such as those relating to the environment, trade or competition. That is why it is important for local politicians to be able to explain that these are concerns we share with other European countries. That is why we also have regulations that are European in scope. It is in this way that we must try to solve the problems and to adjust the regulations so that they are applicable at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">That is certainly what will take the longest time before it has become a natural part of the political debate at all levels, but it is something for which we must strive. The debate is one in which we must engage with the Member States, the governments and the political parties. You in particular have an important role to play in ensuring that people are aware of these matters at all levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The way in which waste legislation is enforced varies widely between the Member States, and even between regions within the same Member State. There are also wide differences in waste legislation itself within the European Union. This leads to large volumes of waste being transported across borders, with cases of fraud by criminals operating in the area of waste-related crime regularly being uncovered by the judicial and police services.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission plan <span class="bold"></span> in the light of the opinion given by the Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice in case C-176/03 <span class="bold"></span> to take steps to draw up a legal framework for combating waste-related crime at EU level, and what, in the Commission's view, are the priorities with regard to combating waste-related crime? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, this proposal specifies that Member States shall ensure that certain activities are criminal offences, when committed intentionally or with serious negligence, as far as they breach the rules of Community law. It particularly refers to the fraudulent cross-border transport of waste referred to by the honourable Member in his question.</p>
<p class="contents">On 27 January, however, the Council adopted, instead of this proposal for a directive, a framework decision based on Title VI of the Treaty on European Union. This text criminalises a number of actions that damage the environment, committed either intentionally or by serious negligence, and makes them liable to criminal penalties. This list of offences includes the unlawful disposal, treatment, storage, transport, export or import of waste, including hazardous waste, which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States had to adopt the measures necessary to comply with this framework decision before 27 January 2005. The Commission is currently studying the national transposition measures notified to it by the Member States in order to provide the Council, as specified by the framework decision, with a report enabling it to check, no later than by 27 January 2006, the extent to which Member States have taken the measures necessary to comply with the framework decision.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, the Commission, which, with the support of the European Parliament, went to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to challenge the legal basis adopted by the Council, is waiting for the judgment to be delivered shortly, on 13 September I believe. As Mr Staes mentioned, on 26 May 2005 the Advocate-General delivered conclusions that are very favourable to the Commission’s position, as Mr Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer suggests that the Court annul the relevant provisions of the framework decision of 27 January 2003. If the Court follows its advocate-general, a new legal instrument, this time a Community one, will have to be adopted to protect the environment through criminal law, including to prevent the fraudulent cross-border transport of waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, if the Court of Justice pronounces its judgment on 13 September, the Commission will need to take prompt action to deal with something that is – in my view –a serious crime. You, Commissioner, are responsible for justice and police matters. This is a serious crime and represents a risk to the environment, very often also a risk to food safety and public health, and those engaged in it are also often criminals linked with the mafia – a term I use in its traditional sense.

<p class="contents">In June the Director-General of DG JLS told the LIBE committee that a 'no-fly' list is simply a list of people the US has decided it does not want entering its territory. It does not mean that they are necessarily suspected of any wrongdoing, they just decided they do not want to let them enter its country for various reasons based on a number of rather general criteria which we are in the process of seeking to elucidate further with the American authorities.'</p>

<p class="contents">As you probably know, the United States authorities are considering a so-called emergency amendment, which would require airlines to check all passengers against a United States no-fly list for all flights overflying the United States. The Commission would seek opportunities to discuss any such proposal which could have implications more generally for international air travel. The European Union has a rigorous policy on aviation security, but that does not include a no-fly list.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of persons in a no-fly list, however, does not mean that they are guilty of, or suspected of, involvement in criminal activity or other wrongdoing. Rather, the United States authorities, on the basis of wide range of information, have determined that the individuals in question should not be allowed to fly to or over the territory of the United States, either because their presence in the United States is deemed unwelcome or, because by travelling on an aircraft they might pose a security risk. Such decisions and the criteria on the basis of which they are made are exclusively the domain of the United States Government, which alone is responsible for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the occasions on which flights are diverted are relatively few, we recognise the concern and inconvenience they may cause. The Commission will, therefore, pursue clarification of the United Nations no-fly list in talks with the United States, as I promised earlier in the summer. For example, early and effective communication to airlines of an up-to-date no-fly list is an essential aspect. The Commission is in the process of seeking to elucidate further with the American authorities on that criterion, in order to prevent in the future cases of false positives. I will be discussing this and other issues during my next meeting with Secretary Chertoff in Washington in early October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that we can now be very proud that these two proposals have already become a reality. With regard to the first proposal, as you know, the European Police College (CEPOL) was established by the Council Decision of 22 December 2000, and I think we can say that it is now in a position to fulfil its role. Two Council decisions in 2004 gave it legal personality and named Bramshill in the United Kingdom as its permanent headquarters. A proposal presented by the Commission in October 2004 with the aim of improving the legal framework of the CEPOL is waiting for formal approval from the Council. I think we can tell you that a political agreement has already been reached within the Council itself, in June 2005. As Parliament’s reservations have all been resolved, I think that the decision will be formally approved in the course of September 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal relating to the setting up of a specialist European service for external border controls, too, has led to the establishment, by the Council Regulation of 26 October 2004, of a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States. This agency, based in Warsaw, has started work and already has a budget of more than EUR 6 million for 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, one of the most important tasks is training the officers in the police forces of the 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Agency for External Borders, however, the actions have obviously not yet been defined in the sense that you wish. Personally, I have always said that I was in favour of joint training for all the Member States’ border officials, so that if in the future the conditions warrant it, we will be able to prepare a European border officials force and a border police force. Opinions still differ on the matter, but to me it seems necessary for the Agency to be able to start to help the Member States immediately in operational checking activities at the borders.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I can say that the first task I have entrusted to the Agency concerns the Mediterranean, and in particular support for certain major measures relating to the control of the Mediterranean’s maritime border, partly with a view to strengthening relations with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean – in other words, a task that is extremely important for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, Member States can also put forward proposals for joint operations and pilot projects which the agency may then decide to co-finance. The agency shall evaluate the results of all operational activities carried out under its aegis. If Member States carry out operations at external borders outside the framework of the agency, they shall report on such activities to the agency.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the joint return operations, it follows from Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 that the agency shall provide Member States with all necessary support in organising joint return operations. The agency will at this stage not carry out return operations itself, but only provide technical assistance to Member States. In this context, it should also be noted that the agency shall identify best practices on the acquisition of travel documents and the removal of illegally present third country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">A credible European migration policy necessitates the use of return operations in order to uphold the integrity and effectiveness of the asylum and immigration systems of the Member States. However, such return operations must always be carried out in full respect of the human rights and safety of returnees. The Commission expects the agency to play a major role in developing and promoting at European level the highest possible standards in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague programme asked for the establishment of common standards for persons to be returned in a humane manner and with full respect for their human rights and dignity. It called for the submission of a Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 September 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive providing for clear, transparent and fair common rules concerning returns, removal, temporary custody and re-entry which take into full account, I repeat, respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the person or persons concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the internal organisation of the agency, the Commission can inform you that the management board of the agency decided on 30 June 2005 to launch an evaluation of the need for establishing specialised branches on the basis of the results of this evaluation. The management board will decide if and where the agency shall establish specialised branches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the Commission urges the Member States to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol’s participation in a supporting role in joint investigation teams is expressly provided for by the Protocol to the Europol Convention of 28 November 2002, which has not entered into force. At the moment, it still needs to be ratified by five Member States. Indeed, that Protocol cannot result in Europol being given operational powers until the Member States themselves have implemented the framework decision of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams. On this point, the Commission shares Parliament’s opinion regarding the disappointing outcome of the instruments transposing the framework decision. As it is a field that falls outside Community competence, unfortunately  may I say  the Commission does not have the right to institute infringement proceedings against the Member States that have not implemented this framework decision. Nevertheless, Europol has participated in a number of cross-border investigations that do not fall within the precise framework of the joint investigation team and, at times, has coordinated some of them, such as Operation Ice–Breaker on 13 June 2005 targeting Internet child pornography, during which 153 searches were carried out simultaneously in 13 different countries. Involvement in this investigation enabled it to strengthen its position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in its 2002 communication on democratic control over Europol, the Commission supported the idea of a joint committee of national parliaments and the European Parliament responsible for discussing matters related to Europol. It would be worth relaunching this idea. In this regard, the Commission is quite willing to participate in this type of parliamentary meeting. As you may know, two half-day meetings have been scheduled in Brussels in October, between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, specifically regarding parliamentary control of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Four sub-topics are on the agenda: the European arrest warrant, Eurojust, Europol and the exchange of sensitive information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issue, as many of you will probably know, concerns the conformity of two reference circulars, one adopted in 2000 and the other in 2004, regarding the issue of visas and the circulars on specific subjects implementing the two reference circulars. The first circular, adopted on 3 March 2000 and known as the Völlmer circular, has been deemed by the Commission not to be in line with the principles of the Common Consular Instructions currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">We then examined the subsequent circular, adopted in October 2004, which replaced the previous circular from 2000. The conclusion that we came to, after our first stage of thorough examination, is that the 2004 circular remedies the general issue of conformity with the Common Consular Instructions in force. We also said, however, to the German authorities in our reply, and also of course to Mr Wuermeling, that, even though overall the 2004 circular seems to be in line with the Common Consular Instructions, clarifications, specifications and improvements in drafting are necessary in the text of the circular in force, adopted in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also asked the authorities of the German Federal Government to provide some replies on the specifications required, and I can assure you that contact with the relevant authorities is continuing. Obviously, I intend to provide further replies as soon as the answers have been given to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Resettlement and refugee quota</span></p>
<p class="contents">Resettlement of refugees is an important instrument in finding sustainable solutions to serious and protracted situations involving refugees. However, at the present time, only a few countries in the world accept refugees through resettlement.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU could play an important role by introducing a common refugee quota. More Member States should take part than at present to enable the EU, in close cooperation with UNHCR, to work more strategically and to coordinate resettlement with other long-term efforts, such as targeted aid for assistance with return and reintegration.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Hague Programme, the Council has called on the Commission to develop regional protection programmes in partnership with third countries and in cooperation with UNHCR, including a joint resettlement programme for those Member States wishing to take part.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission been able to launch a joint resettlement programme yet? What view does the Commission take of a permanent resettlement programme within the framework of EU cooperation? What are the Commission's views on the willingness of the Member States to take part in a joint resettlement programme? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Voluntary resettlement will be an important element in every regional protection programme in terms of providing a lasting solution for refugees and demonstrating the partnership element to the third countries involved. Resettlement can help alleviate the burden of the regions of origin and consequently enhance their protection capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the development of an EU-wide resettlement scheme, the Commission believes that it is more appropriate to follow a step-by-step approach, as resettlement is a policy that is new to most Member States. At present, the objective pursued by the Commission is to maximise the protection benefit and overall impact of the resettlement activities to be undertaken under the regional protection programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is therefore to encourage and facilitate to the greatest possible extent Member States' participation in the EU resettlement effort. In order to achieve that objective, the Commission services are working on an amendment to the Council decision of 2004 establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2005-2010, which would envisage that resettlement activities could be substantially financed by the Community as of 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is due to be presented for adoption by the Commission in October – very soon. As one of the stumbling blocks to any new policy initiative lies in budgetary support for its implementation, the financial underpinning of such a new policy is vital, as you understand very well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the possibility of contributing to the actual resolution of protracted refugee situations through the strategic use of resettlement in the framework of regional protection programmes, combined with a strong financial underpinning of resettlement activities to be implemented in this context will provide – I am convinced – Member States with the incentive to participate in EU resettlement initiatives. The Commission has noted that several Member States are currently considering setting up their own national resettlement programmes. Moreover, there is no broad consensus among Member States on the need for a coordinated and systematic approach to addressing protection issues in regions of origin and an increasing acknowledgement of the fact that the targeted use of resettlement has the potential to deliver comprehensive and effective solutions to protracted refugee situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the basis of the evaluation of the pilot regional protection programmes and taking into account the operational and logistical needs of managing resettlement on an EU scale, the Commission will examine the appropriateness of bringing forward a proposal for a more structured approach to resettlement at EU level, which might lead in the long term to the development of a permanent EU resettlement scheme, something I firmly hope to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
