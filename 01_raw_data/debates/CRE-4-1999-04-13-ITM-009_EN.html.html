The investment will therefore be substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">We do agree in principle that we must continue to reduce emissions and improve air quality. Nevertheless, Commissioner, we must also bear in mind the proportionality principle and the Batneec concept: the use of best available technology not entailing excessive cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I do believe we should take measures which are genuinely necessary, but only those which are necessary at the moment. Others could perhaps be taken later. The gas and electricity markets have been liberalised. Great efforts are being made by all the companies involved. The directive now under review came into force ten years ago. Much good work has been done on desulphurisation and denitrification and improved technology has been introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The levels proposed by Parliament"s Committee on the Environment are particularly demanding. It might be possible to attain them where natural gas is used, but it will be very difficult to do so in the case of coal and residual fuel. The point I would like to emphasise, however, is that it does not make sense to set these levels because there is no need to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of acidification needs to be dealt with, but not all countries are affected. The Spanish delegation will therefore oppose most of these amendments, given that gradual progress will be made in the future. At present, these amendments do not make much sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The wisest course of action might be for the Commission to issue a directive or a recommendation on negotiable permitted emission limits or to apply the ‘bubble" concept used in the United States. The Commission could also introduce negotiated agreements which can work and not just insist on setting strict levels which are not met, as you must certainly be aware, Commissioner. For as a result, all environmental legislation does for Europe is to generate intense frustration.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oomen‐Ruijten </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, the purpose of revising the directive we are looking at today is to cut the level of emissions from large combustion plants. The measures proposed form part of a European strategy for combating acidification. It remains unclear as yet when work will begin on a directive on national emission limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds. The large combustion plants directive is directly relevant to the question of emission levels. The forthcoming emission limit values will be a policy package allowing Member States the freedom to decide for themselves how they achieve the required cuts in emission levels.</p>
<p class="contents">I really agree with everyone else that things ought to have been done in a different order – first the limit values and then this directive. But in any event, given that there is still a good deal of wrangling going on over the other directive and because we set a period of ten years in the 1988 directive, we now have to do something. And I know a little about this directive on large combustion plants. In the mid−1980s, as a member of the Dutch Parliament, I asked our environment minister to take action in the Netherlands and in Europe in the light of the proposed rules on them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the feeling that if I were now to show this Commission proposal to Japanese and American industry, it would produce the reaction ‘no wonder you will never manage to establish a proper industry for the environment." I would point out that the requirements for new plants, and indeed also for old plants, which can remain operational up to the year 2014, are considerably tighter in a number of Member States than those which the Commission is now proposing to us. As rapporteur, with the backing of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I therefore amended those requirements. When I was called this morning by a spokesman for Scottish industry, for example, asking if this directive had implications for Scotland, I told him yes, not only for Scotland but for the whole of the United Kingdom and Spain as well. I am confident that the United Kingdom will not wish to go on living in the stone age, but that there too something will have to be done for the environment, for the natural world and indeed for human health. I am confident that the British too will wish to act, and the transitional period I am proposing will be the best way of tackling the problem of existing combustion plants.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at what goes on in Germany with brown coal, for example, and knowing that mines producing brown coal are essentially far dirtier than ordinary coal mines, I have the feeling – and I say this for my Spanish colleague"s benefit – that requirements for these could and should be far stricter than those now being proposed. I do not understand it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy asked me if I had considered carefully the technical basis of my proposal. Yes, I did. As we were drafting this directive, I came across the Dutch Government"s 1997 order which contains requirements for large combustion plants which are considerably stricter than the ones before us today. So I had a frame of reference, a yardstick. The new Dutch requirements, those in Germany, in some of the Scandinavian countries and in Austria too are far stricter. I wonder why we should not have the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add one more element and that is liberalisation. I am all in favour of liberalising electricity supply markets. I always have been, but in that case you have to be confident, when setting the price per kilowatt hour, that differences in environmental quality will not be so great that pollution limits in one Member State and pollution tolerance in another Member State are ultimately a barrier to liberalisation. So from the point of view of liberalisation as well, I think we have to seek requirements which are as far as possible the same. I would urge my Spanish colleagues to think again.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues from the Socialist Group have tabled amendments to the effect that the requirements which I propose to apply in respect of existing plants by the year 2005 should be postponed to the year 2010. I most strongly advise against that course. Why? Because it would further weaken our negotiating position vis‐à‐vis the Council. I am familiar with David Bowe"s argument, who urges the rapporteur and Parliament to be careful not to be too tough, because then the Council might attack us and might change the legal base. In response to these colleagues, I would say that if the Council wants to act and wants to change this result of codecision, it has to do that by unanimity, and unanimity means that Parliament and the European Court of Justice also have to have their say.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bowe </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should first of all like to welcome the work done by the rapporteur and her report. It is certainly a very impressive report and it is one which the Socialists will be happy to support for the most part. It will bring about substantial improvements in the emissions from very large combustion plants, usually burning coal or oil, which make such a substantial contribution to the amounts of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides that go into the air, which cause acid rain and which have health effects upon human beings, such as asthma.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a question of controlling these plants by one particular means – there are other means to controls these plants as well. There is pollution control – and I was the rapporteur some years ago, on measures which are now being implemented to control emissions. There are also the negotiations on the national emissions ceilings limits which we are expecting the Commission to bring forward as quickly as possible. These two together will exert an effective and proper control.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's report and the amendments tabled tend to extend the scope of the directive and make the limits with which both existing and future plants must comply more stringent. I do not think it is a particular problem for new plants to comply with these regulations though I recognise that there are problems for some of the older plants. It is therefore our suggestion that a little more time is given to them, a reasonable timescale in which the necessary investment can be made so that these plants can comply.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards extensions to the scope elsewhere, I would draw the Commissioner's attention to the deletion of some of the exemptions, with regard to offshore plant and with regard to some of the large gas turbines used in mobile machinery etc. where, again, the emissions are significant and need to be addressed, recognising of course the particular circumstances that exist in those cases.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very conscious of the issue already mentioned by Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten, that if we try too hard to set very tight limits, many Member States fear that we will be dictating their energy policy to them, which, of course, is not our right as a Parliament. For that reason we have to recognise that and recognise that we have to give a degree of flexibility within this proposal. Coupling this proposal with the national emissions ceilings limits and with IPPC we can do that. The whole thing has to be taken in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that we will get a result, after second reading, where we have substantial improvements in emissions from these plants, where we have substantial improvements in the environment and in the air quality around these plants. I recommend this proposal to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">One last comment. I have visited large combustion plants in two or three different states in the Union, particularly in my own, the UK. I have not seen anything that is stone‐age and I would invite Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten to visit, perhaps, the Drax power station in Yorkshire. She will see that it is her knowledge of the industry which is prehistoric and not the plant that is operating.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Virgin </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten on an excellent report. Some time ago, Parliament approved another report concerning future strategies for dealing with the acidification of soil and water. One of its objectives was to resolve the problem of acidification by 2015, when emissions were to have reached a level that nature could accommodate. The Commission agreed with the line taken by Parliament. To achieve that objective, however, we have to tighten up the requirements, for example as regards combustion. This report, with the stricter measures proposed by Parliament, is a step in the right direction. Furthermore, the Commission has carried out extensive studies into the effects of combustion emissions. Of course, it is not just their effect on the environment that is a major cause for concern; people's health is also at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">A comparative study of coal combustion with flue gas cleaning and nuclear power, carried out over a ten‐year period, shows that 20 000 lives have been saved as a result of reduced emission levels achieved by using nuclear power in the EU. The proposal concerning the premature phasing‐out of nuclear power therefore has some very serious implications for both the environment and people's health.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also convinced that the use of economic instruments, for example taxes on sulphur and nitrogen emissions, could serve to improve developments and in practice tighten up our existing requirements. Taxes of this kind have been a great success in Sweden. Trading of emission rights might also be worth investigating, since this practice can have a beneficial effect on the environment at a low cost.</p>
<p class="contents">The burning of fossil fuels also produces large amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the greenhouse effect – possibly the most serious problem. In any event, it is a sign that we should cut back on the burning of fossil fuels as much as possible. This is also an area in which the trading of emission rights provides a means of achieving some stability in our efforts to reach the requirements laid down in the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

In Germany, 67 % of the forests are exposed to acid emissions containing sulphur dioxide and nitrogen compounds which exceed the critical level. In France, 22 % of forest areas are affected. There are of course other countries whose forests are relatively unaffected, for example Spain, where the corresponding figure is only 1 %. But at the same time, emissions from Spain contribute to the acidification of an area five times the size of its own forest areas. Moreover, nine EU countries are net contributors to the acidification of areas outside their own borders, while five countries – Germany, France, Austria, Sweden and Finland – contaminate in this way an area smaller than that of their own forests.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures show that emissions from large combustion plants create a problem which should be a priority for common, supranational regulation. It is therefore a good thing that the Commission has submitted this directive, even though it is not nearly strict enough. Parliament's proposal on the other hand, in the shape of the Oomen‐Ruijten report, comes significantly closer to what is required from both an objective and an environmental point of view. For the most part, the Greens can therefore endorse the Oomen‐Ruijten report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blokland </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, large combustion plants account in total for 63 % of sulphur dioxide and 21 % of nitrogen oxide emissions in the European Union. SO<span class="sub">2</span> and NO<span class="sub">x</span> are the principal causes of acid rain and they are hazardous to health. So it is very important that emissions of these substances should be reduced as a result of this proposal. I am therefore pleased that the European Commission is also applying the directive to gas turbines. However, there must not be derogations for off‐shore platforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that existing technology allows SO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions to be cut to 100 mg per cubic metre, a general emission limit value of 200 mg per cubic metre certainly warrants support from Parliament. Standards for NO<span class="sub">x</span> emissions can also be tightened up. An essential point made in the report is that existing large combustion plants too must ultimately comply with the emission limits, since these plants as a whole are responsible for much of the pollutant emissions. Otherwise, the measures will not have any substantially discernible effects in terms of cleaner and healthier air.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, very dirty fuels must not be given an advantage in the form of higher emission limits. Rigorous standards apply to waste incinerators, but the emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels may also impair air quality, and consequently public health. This proposal represents a major advance, and I am grateful to Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten for her hard work.</p>

One can see images of nature with water, animals and snow. It looks clean and healthy. Unfortunately, most of what you see is pretty much dead as a result of acidification and pollution imported from afar – from countries and regions which shall be nameless, but which are certainly very much aware of the fact that within their borders they have large combustion plants which are making these beautiful images virtually lifeless, in spite of appearances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Oomen‐Ruijten report is therefore particularly relevant for my home region, for the survival of both animals and plants, as well as for the streams and everything else that is touched by acidification. I am therefore pleased to note that the majority in the Environment Committee has actually had the good sense to support the rapporteur's proposals to tighten up the requirements contained in the directive. I would refer in particular to the proposal that the directive should be extended to cover existing plants, an aspect which the Council obviously has not been able to tackle adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing plants are responsible for a considerable proportion of the emissions. Should the Oomen‐Ruijten proposal be adopted, it would mean a reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions of 1 to 1.5 million tonnes a year. That is equivalent to between 10 and 15 times Sweden's total output of sulphur emissions. By comparison, the United Kingdom spews out 2 million tonnes every year.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be virtual madness to wait for a further five years until these combustion plants stop of their own accord. Of course there are objections: the proposal would cost money – but the technology is there. We know that it would be expensive for all of us, because we all have these plants. But the benefits would be incalculable. I only hope that more people in the House can be persuaded to think about saving more lives.</p>

There is a proposal in Amendment 19 for longer time limits when abatement equipment malfunctions or breaks down. The twenty‐four hours proposed by the Commission is by no means enough for equipment to cool down, to discover what the problem is, for the repairs to be carried out, and for the equipment to be started up again. This is especially true if problems happen to arise at a time when the plant is being manned by fewer people than is normal, such as at night, on public holidays or at the weekend. If the time limit is not changed an efficient, modern power plant will have to be closed down temporarily virtually whenever there is a problem, and replaced with plant that cannot match it in terms of its ability to protect air quality. This cannot be in the spirit of the proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">At Community level we want to promote both the increased use of biofuels and combined heat and power production, to minimise greenhouse emissions. To attain these goals higher emission limits should be permitted for biofuels, as the proposal prescribes, and the air protection requirements for small combustion plants must be technically and economically reasonable.</p>

We therefore have to do everything we possibly can, and one indication that we can do more than the Commission has been prepared to is this report on large combustion plants which has been produced by Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the most important aspect of the report is that it includes old plants – those which came into use before 1987 – in its provisions concerning harmonised legislation and limit values. Without this, this directive would be fairly hollow, as these plants have a long lifespan, and if we did not extend the directive to include old plants, the effects on emissions into the air would be nil. I therefore wholeheartedly support the proposal that old plants should be included.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also have to make sure that these rules are extended to the applicant countries, as we cannot allow any sort of freeloading in this area. Obviously, resources have to be allocated to achieve this goal. I also believe we must improve methods for exploiting biofuels and for combined heat and power production, but, as far as biofuels are concerned, I believe it is essential that they should be subject to the same limit values as apply to other fuels.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pollack </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, a technical directive being is amended and there are many aspects being addressed by different speakers. Problems concerning older plants obviously depend on which energy source is used by which Member State, and these vary enormously. We know that existing large combustion plants are responsible for about two‐thirds of the EU sulphur dioxide pollution and nearly a quarter of nitrogen oxides, and these have very serious effects on health and the environment. Therefore this revision is urgently needed. I very much favour trying to move to more cogeneration, as other Members have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as rapporteur on air quality, I wish to concentrate on two main aspects. The first is covered in Amendment No 1 which links what has been done in this directive to the still‐awaited long‐term ozone strategy. The aim of this must be to bring harmful emissions from these plants in line and to below the level of critical loads. If we fail in this, we are doubly failing, both in protecting the environment and in protecting public health. Although we do not yet have the ozone strategy because of the paralysis in the Commission, we know that sooner or later the emissions limit values will have to come in line with it. We need to make it plain to the new Commission, when it is sworn in, that the ozone strategy and the national emissions ceiling, that Mr Bowe mentioned, are urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to Amendment No 15, which argues for greater public information. This is the same approach we took in the daughter directives on air pollution. Some people do not seem to like public information very much but the people who live near these large combustion plants need to be fully aware of whether their health is at risk from increased air pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend them to the House and trust that they will have the support both of the Commission and, more importantly, of the Council.</p>

It is certainly true that because of the liberalisation of the internal electricity market we also need to harmonise environmental legislation. That is an important step forward. Hopefully it will be the first of many!</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, however, harmonisation in turn results in distortion of competition. I will explain this using the example of NO<span class="sub">x</span> emissions. Let us assume that NO<span class="sub">x</span> emissions are equal to 200 mg/m<span class="sup">3</span> . In the case of large plants, technological improvements can definitely be made. I understand that. But for coal, and in particular lignite, this means an increase in the price of electricity of between one and two German pfennigs. That is not a negligible amount. These producers might well be forced out of the market as a result. This will mean the end of the competitive advantage – or the fair terms of competition – which they have enjoyed hitherto. Incidentally, producers of nuclear energy will be pleased about this, since nuclear energy will not be affected and will thus be relatively cheaper. Anyone who advocates it will certainly be pleased.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to have fair terms of competition, however, we must at least bear this in mind. In Germany, the rule is 200 mg/m<span class="sup">3</span> . When it was introduced, it required considerable investment; it was fairly expensive. People can live with that. If we now want to bring it down to 100 – and from a technical point of view, this is no problem for gas – it will mean a corresponding increase in price. In terms of competition, this means being forced out of the market. What will happen then? Then the regions concerned will receive regional aid from the European Union or the nation state. The taxpayer will pay for it in the form of regional aid. That cannot be the intention!</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that we need to strike a balance here. I do not say this lightly, because of course I know that clean air is always better than dirtier air. But 200 mg/m<span class="sup">3</span> is, I believe, a perfectly appropriate value, and we should stick to it.</p>

For many Members, including some in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, the limit values put forward by the rapporteur for reducing emissions of certain pollutants from large combustion plants up to the year 2005 went too far. We are hearing similar arguments in the discussion on car exhaust gases. It is my impression that the technology is available to achieve these values. Of course, it requires a considerable financial effort. That is also why it is so important for us to promote, through the LIFE programme, the development of and scope for using modern technology which is able to achieve these aims and these limit values. Who else, if not the European Parliament, would already be fighting to push through ambitious targets to reduce air pollution? Up to now, it has been thanks entirely to the European Parliament that values and aims have been achieved which were frequently presented as being unattainable in the time available.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Linkohr, you are familiar with the car debate. Ladies and gentlemen, please do not forget that the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force on 1 May 1999. Then we will also be consulted on this proposal under the codecision procedure, and will therefore have the possibility of pushing through not only what are admittedly quite ambitious demands for limit values for both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, but also demands to include old plants, which have hitherto been ignored and which present a particularly urgent problem. I would ask you to bear in mind that this is the first reading. We shall then see how the Council responds, and in the second reading we will have to discuss where we go from there. In my view, we should already be making proposals which are technically feasible, and then later we will have to calculate what goals we can achieve.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking in particular the Committee on the Environment and the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten, for the very detailed consideration the proposal has received, in spite of the fact that we are discussing a very technical proposal. As many speakers have emphasised here this evening, large combustion plants account for a substantial proportion of the emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides in the EU. Precisely because of the extent of these emissions, and because they are transnational, it is necessary to have solutions at EU level, and it is also vital to ensure that EU legislation is brought up to date. That is why this proposal was one of the elements of the Community's pollution strategy, which several speakers have also referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">In many areas, the Commission is able to support what are constructive amendments. The European Parliament is right to refer to the aim of the Community's pollution strategy, so the Commission is able to accept Amendment No 1. I share the view expressed by both Mr Bowe and Mrs Pollack that we need the two proposals which were ready to be presented and which will now have to wait until a new Commission has reached a decision on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands very well the European Parliament's interest in allowing economic instruments to be considered as a means of reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides, as expressed in Amendment No 3. We shall be able to consider the possible use of such instruments against the background of the development of the proposal for energy taxes, so I shall not say any more on that subject. We have discussed it several times.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the European Parliament's wish that technological development should continue to have an impact on large combustion plants, and is able to accept Amendment No 5 in principle. How the committee"s aims can best be met in this respect must be considered against the background of how the directive on integrated pollution prevention and control is implemented in this sector. The Commission also agrees that information about the environmental impact of large combustion plants should be readily available. From this point of view, the Commission is able to accept Amendment No 15, which Mrs Pollack in particular referred to, in so far as it can be achieved through the register of polluting emissions which is under development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is still working on a proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings, which I mentioned before. It is a vital part of the Commission's strategy for combating acidification and tropospheric ozone and for the protection of human health. This will set national limits for emissions of a number of pollutants. They will be cost‐effective at EU level, and will be determined on the basis of the relationship between the emissions and their environmental impact. This will give Member States the opportunity to achieve the required reductions in emissions in the most cost‐effective way, while at the same time the EU's environmental targets will be met. Consequently, the current proposal only covers new plants which receive operating licences after 1 January 2000. Against this background, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to extend the scope of the proposal to also cover existing plants. This affects a number of amendments, and I shall list the ones we cannot accept. These are Amendments Nos 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 to 18, 20 and 21.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed emission limit values are intended as ambitious minimum requirements to be met throughout the Community, which is something Mrs Oomen‐Ruijten and Mr Bowe touched on in their speeches. We have therefore chosen to set what are ambitious minimum requirements which must be met throughout the Community. They are approximately twice as tough as the requirements contained in existing EU legislation. Even tougher emission limit values can be used if they are justified by local circumstances or are necessary to meet national emission ceilings. Therefore, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to accept Amendments Nos 7, 9, 11 and 13, although it has noted the European Parliament's wish to see tougher minimum requirements at EU level. I am quite sure this is a question we will return to later in the procedure. Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 19, 22 and 23 cannot be accepted for technical and other reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express my satisfaction with the report. The European Parliament has shown a very constructive approach which can form a sound basis for discussions as the legislative procedure progresses. We are convinced that through its attitude, the European Parliament will help to bring us closer to the goals we are all aiming for, which are to combat acidification and tropospheric ozone and to improve public health.</p>
