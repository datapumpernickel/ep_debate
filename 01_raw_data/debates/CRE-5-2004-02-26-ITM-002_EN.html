Armenian and Turkish cultural workers have met in an Armenian monastery in Eastern Turkey. Eduard Shevardnadze’s son-in-law has been arrested at Tbilisi airport, suspected of corruption. Violent conflicts have taken place in Ajaria between supporters and opponents of the province’s leader, Abashidze. Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliev, has met his Armenian colleague, Robert Kocharian. Imprisoned Azerbaijani politicians have gone on hunger strike. The American FBI is to open an office in Tblisi.</p>
<p class="contents">These and many more things have happened in recent days in our European sister countries, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. It is not, however, from the European media that I obtained all this information, in spite of the fact that the three countries are members of the Council of Europe and the OECD and have their sights set on full membership of the EU. Neither the general European interest nor the EU’s official interest in the South Caucasus features very prominently if war and revolution are not the issue. The Council did not even wish to involve the South Caucasus countries in its strategy for a wider Europe, but fortunately appears to have changed its mind.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Parliament’s urgent request, a special representative was finally appointed in 2003. A number of other contributions have been made by the EU, especially in connection with the Regional Environmental Centre in Tbilisi. Generally, such efforts are too little, too late, as was seen in connection with Georgia's Revolution of Roses, in which the EU was overtaken by both Russia and the United States which both pursue classic power politics in their own interests. The EU claims to have other ambitions that have more to do with solidarity. In the South Caucasus, there are three countries that believe in the EU ideal and that want the EU to play the main role as peace broker and provider of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">My report contains a large number of proposals as to what the EU should do politically, economically and in terms of peace. It is a question of influencing Russia to adopt a more constructive approach, of supporting the three countries’ precarious democratic institutions and of developing partnership between regions of the EU that govern themselves in the manner of Åland, Scotland and Catalonia and of Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. This could show that self-government may be a reasonable alternative to full sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a question of helping the South Caucasus escape from the nuclear power trap, of developing renewable forms of energy and of ensuring that oil assets are handled in accordance with international environmental rules. It is a question of practical conflict resolution, for example through the opening of the Baku to Jerevan railway line in exchange for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani provinces. To my surprise, I see that the largest political groups are moving the rejection of this, but approval of Amendments Nos 5 and 18 would seriously upset the sensitive balance of the report. The same applies to Amendment No 2 by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. If we were to approve this and delete the reference to our own 1987 decision in connection with the deaths of countless Armenians in 1915, the balance of the report would shift in favour of the one side.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that I am able to support all the amendments apart from Amendments Nos 2, 5, 6, 16, 17 and 18. I have withdrawn Amendment No 9 and, in Recital P, I propose a split vote so that the word ‘blockade’ can be deleted, because there is no blockade. There are, however, considerable restrictions, which is bad enough and something that I criticise, but the correct choice of words is very important in situations such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliamentary elections are to be held in Georgia on 28 March 2004. This will be the crucial test of what democracy amounts to in the Revolution of Roses. With a seven per cent barrier, there is a danger of all opposition being excluded from Parliament. I know, partly following a one-to-one meeting with the Georgian Prime Minister, Zurab Zhvania, in Rome the other day, that the Georgian leadership is concerned. Not enough is being done, and measures are required, perhaps a lowering of the barrier, if Georgia is not to become the odd phenomenon of the world’s first democratic one-party state.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have all been exposed to lobbying. This is legitimate and can provide valuable information, but it would not be good if, this afternoon, one of the parties to all the conflicts that exist in the South Caucasus were to be able to declare itself the victor and say that the European Parliament was on its side. I have tried to write a balanced report that does not come down on the side of any one party but simply on the side of peace and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes this timely and thoughtful report and I would like to congratulate the honourable Member on his work in producing it. The evolution of the report over a number of years demonstrates the Parliament’s commitment to ensuring that the South Caucasus region attracts the attention it requires. The attention and time given to the report has allowed it to be refined and focused so that it provides an extremely useful policy tool.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the analysis of the dangers and difficulties facing the region and we are pursuing policies that should encourage stabilisation there. To that end, our country strategies place the fight against corruption, and support for institution-building and poverty reduction, at the very heart of our assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">For the region we have programmes dealing with drug trafficking, border management and environmental matters. Unless these key issues are tackled, the chances of achieving stability in the region will be very greatly diminished. We have pursued these objectives since the southern Caucasus counties achieved independence in 1991 and we have devoted over EUR 1 billion of assistance to the region. We will continue to be ambitious in our efforts while working within constraints of the resources provided by the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Time prevents me from covering each of the many issues highlighted in the report in detail, so I hope the House will excuse me for focusing on what I think are two key points: namely, the relationship which the honourable Member referred to between the Southern Caucasus and the European Neighbourhood Policy, and the role of the Commission in assisting conflict settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">On the relationship between the Southern Caucasus and the European Neighbourhood Policy, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, in its discussions of 26 January 2004 on how best to support the new leadership in Georgia, concluded thus: 'The Council invites the Commission, in consultation with the High Representative, and taking account of the EU Special Representative’s proposals, to bring forward a recommendation on the relationship of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to the European Neighbourhood Policy. The Council looks forward to considering this recommendation before the end of the Irish presidency.' I hope that we may be able to bring forward that idea, perhaps in May, but certainly by the end of the present presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome that commitment. Accordingly, the EU is closely monitoring developments in all three countries to see whether there is continued progress towards democracy and in the economic sphere. We want to see a credible and a sustained commitment to reform, clearly reflected in concrete steps forward, for example in fighting corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of conflict resolution and reconciliation, the European Commission continues to provide its full support to the OSCE and to the United Nations in their efforts to solve the Region’s frozen conflicts. I was pleased that we were able to discuss some of these matters with the Presidency-in-Office of the OSCE at the beginning of this week.</p>
<p class="contents">We stand ready to assist in post-conflict reconstruction following peace settlements, or to assist measures agreed between the parties to the conflict which would reduce tensions and raise confidence between the two sides. I am very pleased to say that the Commission has recently been able to implement a third phase of post-conflict rehabilitation activities in the Georgia-South Ossetian conflict zone to assist the return of internally displaced people and refugees, and the restoration of infrastructure which will, we hope, help to build confidence between the two communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The very welcome appointment of the EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus in 2003 was an important step for the EU. The Commission is pleased to be fully associated with his work and we value his close cooperation. The report which the honourable Member has presented rightly identifies the need further to develop EU policy for the region; we look forward to participating in this important process with the Special Representative.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission takes note of the call for a stability pact for the region. When the issue was first raised a couple of years ago there did not seem to be that much support for the idea, and I am not yet wholly convinced that the time is yet ripe to return to it. It certainly has budgetary consequences which we would want to look at in some detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude my rather rapid overview of the subject by once again commending the rapporteur on his report. I would like to thank him for what I am sure will be an extremely important contribution to the debate on the EU’s policy for the South Caucasus region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to ensure that we stabilise and support their small business sectors and improve their infrastructures. Why is this such a cause for our concern? It is so, quite simply, because we depend on them and they on us. If, in certain of these states, there are unsafe nuclear power stations, then, should anything happen, its consequences directly affect us, simply because of their geographical situation. If, then, we endeavour to export as much as possible of our knowledge and expertise to them, we will be doing so in a win-win situation. It is for that reason that it matters to us that our aid programmes, TACIS being one example, should, as well as providing support, help countries to help themselves, so that developing states do not have to make all the mistakes we made in the course of our industrial history.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also, let me add, dependent on the region for our energy supply, one example being the transport of crude oil. It follows that it is in our own interests that pipelines should be safe, that the tankers arriving here should be safe and not pollute our waters. If, then, the South Caucasus enjoys technological progress, it also, and at the same time, means safety and progress for us. We are grateful to the rapporteur for being so willing to take our suggestions on board, and also to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the consequences of the enlargement of the European Union is that these hotspots are closer to us, and the prospect of a neighbourhood policy based on the present partnership and cooperation agreement should help to stabilise this region.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, elections were held in all three Caucasus states, and an ad hoc delegation from the European Parliament, of which the rapporteur was a member, found that these elections did not always bear any relation to our democratic conceptions of what elections and democracy are about. If you combine ethnic conflicts, mass poverty, corruption and a lack of democracy, you get an explosive mixture, to which you can add the still-unresolved conflict centred on Nagorno Karabakh, the consequence of which for Azerbaijan was the loss of 20% of its territory, along with great floods of refugees, and which from 1992 to 1999 alone, cost the European Union something like EUR 180 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sought to avoid pouring oil on the flames, to take account of the opposing parties’ sensitivities, and also to give due consideration to Russian and Turkish influence in the region. Political solutions cannot be imposed through the back door; the parties involved, along with their strategic backers, must themselves help to defuse tensions. Non-intervention is of course inadequate as a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of a special representative to the region may, therefore, have been helpful, not least because it gave the EU a more visible presence in South Caucasus. What would be most helpful, though, would be a visible <span class="italic">détente </span>in relations between Turkey and Armenia, which would involve Turkey lifting its blockade. The Stability Pact that this House is quite right to want for the South Caucasus has no real prospect of success unless the conflicts between neighbouring states are resolved, particularly Turkey’s with the countries there.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our humanitarian and democratic interests, and also our energy strategy considerations, that mean that there is no alternative to a more in-depth strategy for the South Caucasus. At the beginning of this year, the foreign ministers, too, took this into account when they called on the Commission and the High Representative to include Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in the new ‘Wider Europe’ initiative. If tension is to be reduced, there must be an awareness that, although the concept of a Wider Europe is worthwhile, there is hardly any prospect of it becoming reality unless the countries between which there is conflict involve Turkey, Russia, the USA and the European Union in their efforts at resolving it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to significant aid, we need an extremely ambitious European strategy and perhaps a broader mandate for Mr Heikki Talvitie, the European Union’s Special Representative for the South Caucasus. Commissioner Patten too has spoken about this, but I do not believe that the fight against corruption to reduce poverty and drug trafficking, or even the analysis of the elections can be enough to establish these measures as a strategy for the zone. It is clearly difficult to operate in a fragile situation in which at least three endemic disputes are simmering. Nevertheless, it is becoming more and more essential that a plan is presented. The usual procedure sometimes calls for global objectives to be achieved with just one conference. I do, however, believe that, in the case of the South Caucasus, we need to proceed gradually, step by step, in the disputes and in cooperation; otherwise we risk obtaining a very poor result.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Gahrton gives a very detailed description of both the situation and the needs, and I agree with the rapporteur that the South Caucasus region needs to be given a well-defined status in the context of the policy we call ‘Wider Europe’<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">If stability is to be achieved, then it is essential that Russia is involved. President Putin – having the day before yesterday dissolved a government that has always maintained considerable ambiguity towards the countries of the former Soviet Union, and in particular, towards the South Caucasus – will also have to indicate some direction for the Caucasus. The meeting between the European Union and Russia, which will take place next March, could be an opportunity for this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The interests and values that are all necessary for cooperation must be clarified in both form and substance. Furthermore, we must consider the fact that the opening, in two years, of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline will be of enormous strategic importance. We do not know if the billionaire Mr Khodorkovsky, for example with his company <span class="italic">Yukos</span>, intends to conclude agreements with the US company <span class="italic">Exxon</span> and nor do we know to what extent the new President Putin would be in favour of such a development. Similarly, we do not know what the chain reaction would be in either case. Discrediting the pipelines for environmental reasons is merely a rhetorical exercise. The oil must, in any event, go from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea. During the cold war, the planning of the pipelines sought to avoid Soviet territory, but the situation is now changing. I do, however, believe that the report by Mr Gahrton expresses appropriate concerns about this and other unknown factors in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to oil resources, Azerbaijan will be rich and Georgia will have transit rights whilst Armenia will have nothing. This is how the new sources of wealth can create new imbalances, which can be smoothed out only though political mediation. One simply has to realise that the future situation will not allow a stalemate, or status quo, to continue for long in areas where conflicts rage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I entirely share his view that it is in the interests of Europe and the EU to associate the region more closely with Europe. There are positive signs but, as Mr Gahrton himself said, there are quite a few threatening clouds.</p>
<p class="contents">In Azerbaijan, matters are heading in the wrong direction. A year ago, I met with the new, recently elected President, Ilham Aliev. In response to direct questions on electoral fraud that had by then already taken place, he flatly denied any such occurrences and referred to his own, and Azerbaijan’s, role in the Council of Europe. Following the autumn elections, we know Aliev’s game. Freedom of expression is crushed, and opponents are thrown into prison. If Azerbaijan is to become a genuine partner of the EU, the country must be fully democratised.</p>
<p class="contents">A humanitarian disaster is taking place in the refugee camps, in which those driven out of Nagorno-Karabakh live in extreme poverty. I have myself visited a refugee camp, and I wish in particular to address Mr Patten and say that the EU has a big responsibility when it comes both to money and to putting pressure on the parties involved in the conflict. I think that Mr Gahrton’s report shows that we need a stronger EU in the international arena, especially if we are to be able to take vigorous action in the area immediately surrounding the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say that, so far as the movement of the countries of the South Caucasus towards democracy is concerned, the velvet revolution in Georgia at last opens up what is, we hope, a promising prospect. This new situation will hopefully draw the European Union’s attention, at last, towards this extremely important geostrategic region and erase the offence that was given when it was omitted from the list of our new neighbours. These countries, which are members of the Council of Europe – a Council that they would like to see as an antechamber to the European Union – lay claim to a European culture and must be integrated as a matter of urgency. There can be no doubt that our Union will reach the Caspian Sea in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore do everything we can to help this region, which is highly sensitive to latent regional conflicts, find solutions and ensure that nothing permanent or consensual is negotiated outside democratic frameworks that combine transparency with the participation of all players, citizens and politicians. The European Union must mobilise all its resources and make maximum efforts to give the South Caucasus this democratic infrastructure, as it has done for other regions, because this region remains a silk road for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of the EU Special Representative is certainly a step forward, but it is far from enough. The Union must invest, really give itself the necessary resources and give real resources to these fragile states, so that the secessionist tensions that are causing difficulties in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Adzharia, for example, will die down, allowing a lasting peace to be established, based on appropriate statutes. That is the only way these populations of the South Caucasus will ever have a future, and we all know that. The development and transition of these small post-soviet countries must be considered not in the light of their present precariousness but in that of the Union’s means and the potential of local resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Community funding must also be provided to help close the Armenian nuclear power plant in Medzamor, which is in an earthquake zone. A conversion to sustainable, reliable and economic energy can and must be based on renewable energies. The South Caucasus is turning over a new page in its history. This is all too rare an opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, and the European Union has been absent for too long to miss its appointment this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very difficult for the states that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union to stand on their own feet, and all of them have similar problems in establishing democracy. The European Union’s policy objective is to encourage a willingness to live as a neighbourhood in the South Caucasus and to manage conflict. Moscow’s objectives are precisely the opposite. As we have just heard the report on Russia, let me state my view that we have to get to grips with these things as a matter of urgent necessity. Now that fourteen years have passed since the Soviet Union collapsed, it is quite bizarre that Soviet passports should still be treated as valid, and, most of all, that they should be offered to people in secessionist regions – in Georgia, for example, but also in others. That it should be possible to issue them with such passports, give them visas and make them practically independent of their own states is a very regrettable state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members have already made reference to energy policy. I regret that it has not yet been possible to find a date on which to hold an energy congress here in Brussels, which this House offered to organise jointly with the Commission. I would like again to ask Commissioner Patten to do everything possible to make it, at the very least, possible for a congress of this kind to be held this year, for these states need the hope that the EU gives if they are to be able to turn away from corruption and build up truly stable democracies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is very good; it proposes a policy framework and contains specific, very interesting proposals for this important and sensitive area.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to take this opportunity to make certain comments of a general nature. There have been catalytic developments over recent months in the area, in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The new president of Georgia is currently in the USA for talks with President Bush. There is an acute presence and mobility in the area on the part of Powell, on the part of Ivanof, on the part of the USA and on the part of Russia. And what are we doing? Our representative is in the area, but is that enough?</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes the Union, irrespective of individual initiatives by its Member States, appears as an observer, albeit an active observer, but that is not enough. The South Caucasus is our neighbour, with historic, cultural and political ties with Europe which go back hundreds, if not thousands of years. The Commissioner, who is an intellectual as well as a politician, knows about Prometheus Bound, the expedition of the Argonaut and the Golden Fleece, about Jason, who was linked with the area of the Caucasus. It is an area of particular interest to Europe and to its new supplies of hydrocarbons. We must not overlook the fact that you can reach the heart of Europe via the Black Sea and the Danube.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union's priorities are often defined by the historic and economic relations between its Member States and Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia and we overlook the new state of affairs. We need to support democratic developments, peace and development in the area. There is a need for a more acute presence in the area, by improving our relations as regards regional cooperation with all the countries on the Black Sea at economic, political and cultural level. We need to understand that the area, in essence, is a part of Europe, culturally, politically and historically, and we need to address it as such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now it appears the coating on pipeline joints is poor and likely to result in major oil leakage and pollution. BP apparently knew this a year before securing the backing of international funders. The credit should be suspended while an independent enquiry is carried out into the safety of the pipeline for local people and the environment, and also into its financial viability, if at least EUR 800 million needs to be spent relaying it.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey's guarantees to the BTC project regarding opt-outs from new environmental and social laws break its obligations under the EU Accession Partnership: they would be illegal if Turkey were already in the EU. The Commission has failed to act, so NGOs are now taking the matter to the European Court of Justice.

There is no need to remind you that it is thanks to his initiative that the European Union now has a representative in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The one and a half minutes allotted to me allow me just a few very quick thoughts. There is one aspect of the region which, no doubt for diplomatic reasons, does not seem to me to be explicit enough in the report, namely the strong American presence. Will that presence have a destabilising influence, as it has in other parts of the world? As you know, in November 2003 there was a kind of revolution or coup d'état in Georgia. I happened to be there at the time as a member of this Parliament’s delegation. The events are known as the ‘rose revolution’ because there was no bloodshed. Well, I can tell you the rose revolution did not smell of roses. It smelt of oil and if it did not smell of dollars, that was because we have known since ancient times that money has no smell. There is further diplomatic silence about the dissident regions of Georgia, such as Adzharia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is one point on which, as a supporter of Catalan independence, I want to distance myself from this report. It is the question of separatism. There will be no peace in the world, in my view, unless we respect the wishes of peoples. The right of peoples to self-determination is fundamental. The international community has a duty to allow the democratic exercise of that right in the South Caucasus as in Western Sahara. This applies to the Adzharians, the Abkhazians, the Ossetians and to the Azeris of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Nagorno-Karabakh, Mr Gahrton says that he explained to its president that the solution might be based on a principle of broad autonomy, as was the case of the Åland islands under Finnish sovereignty. The president replied that he would accept Finnish sovereignty. Why not take him at his word? Finland could be offered a kind of international mandate with the task of ensuring basic rights are respected and organising a referendum so that ultimately the peoples of the region can shape their own destiny, in complete freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share the concerns expressed by others in the debate about the stalemate in Nagorno-Karabakh. The December talks which took place in Scotland were a step forward; they were the first bilateral talks between the representatives of the two countries. We need to break the stalemate and use the OSCE network. This network is well placed to develop an approach that spans security and economic aspects and promotes regional cooperation and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Widespread human rights violations are often the precursor to conflict. In Azerbaijan we know that almost 1000 people have been arrested since last year's elections. 100 remain in custody, despite the fact that the government now claims there are none. In Armenia there is alarm at the widespread problem of human trafficking. There are reports that many thousands of women and children have been sold into exploitation over recent years, in particular ending up in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The European Union must not ignore these human rights problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have just expectations of Turkey to act as a force of stability in the region, stimulate regional trade, enhance regional security cooperation and help revitalise the peace talks.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline – due to pump a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to the Mediterranean – there are major concerns that the host government agreements do not take into account human rights considerations, and that the environmental and social impacts of the pipeline go against the equitable principles for sound projects.</p>
<p class="contents">As our colleague has already made clear, as a matter of urgency we need immediate investigation into claims that 15 000 joints already laid contain a faulty coating that would lead to seepage. A recently leaked report contained allegations that one of the consortium's consultants showed that the consortium, including BP, knew about these problems before laying the pipes and even before signing the agreements with Georgia. The funders, including the EBRD and the World Bank, who were providing USD 125 million each, were not aware of these concerns. I call on the Commission to ensure that there is a proper and exhaustive investigation into this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hence the need to promote the creation of a framework for security and cooperation in the region, in the form of, say, a stability pact. The rapporteur is sufficiently perceptive to see that such a pact requires a climate of confidence to be established and that it therefore has little chance of seeing the light of day so long as Turkey continues its incomprehensible blockade of Armenia and Ankara obstinately continues to deny the Armenian genocide, for example. In that regard, the Parliament’s 1987 resolution unfortunately retains all its relevance and it is appropriate that the report should refer to it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the down side, however, the report shows partiality, or at least inconsistency, about Nagorno-Karabakh: the reference to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is inconsistent with the demand for unilateral concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seems to me that the desire to enshrine in international law a principle of the right of autonomy for minorities would be a threat to peace. The United Nations Charter refers to the right of peoples to self-determination. </p>
