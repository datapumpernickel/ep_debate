<p class="contents">The striking fact of 2003 was certainly that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly could return to a normal rhythm of work following the cancellation of the November 2002 session due to circumstances of which you are aware. On this issue, the result of the mission carried out by the ACP Co-President and four ACP parliamentarians in Harare should be particularly welcomed. They managed to persuade the Zimbabwean Government to agree to the head of its delegation in the Assembly no longer being someone who is covered by the Council’s restrictive measures. The ACP Co-President’s personal commitment to ensuring that only the head of the Zimbabwean delegation can take the floor during the session in Rome should also be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from this important aspect, six points deserve to be mentioned as regards the work of the Assembly in 2003. The entry into force of the new Rules of Procedure allowed the debates to be better structured. The more informal organisation of Question Time with the Commission, at the sixth session in Rome, proved its worth and led to a livelier debate. It was possible to organise and carry out four joint missions in 2003. The Women’s Forum was a success both at the 5th session in Brazzaville and at the 6th session in Rome. It was possible to significantly improve and deepen cooperation between the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the United Nations. Finally, two important reports were adopted, one on children’s rights, and those of child soldiers in particular, and the other on the use of the European Development Fund and the discussions initiated on its budgetisation.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future, Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation basically proposes to invite the Assembly and its Bureau to continue to organise Question Time to make it livelier and more informal; to re-balance the agenda of the sessions and to give more speaking time to Members of the Assembly; to ensure better continuity between sessions by strengthening the facilities of the Standing Committees; to improve the availability of documents, in particular via greater use of the Internet; to develop the role of the Assembly in the implementation of the political dialogue provided for in Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement; to continue its work on human rights through greater involvement of civil society; to make practical arrangements for sending to Zimbabwe a joint delegation, freely chosen, provided that it can move around freely and meet anyone it wishes; to develop the role of the Assembly as a forum for dialogue with the World Trade Organisation; and, finally to take into consideration the desire of Members of the Assembly that the sessions in Europe take place under good conditions, outside of the workplaces of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation gives a positive view of 2003. The difficulties of the previous year, which culminated in the cancellation of the session of November 2002, have been overcome thanks to efforts on both sides, in particular from the Co-Presidents and the Bureau of the Assembly. The latter was also able to resume a normal rhythm of work. Improvements have been made to the organisation of its work, allowing it to make its voice heard more clearly and to actively participate in the political dialogue provided for in the Cotonou Agreement. I hope, Mr President, that our Assembly will be able to adopt the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the members of the Assembly know and as noted in Mrs Flesch's report, my colleague Poul Nielson is actively involved in the work of this Assembly and the Commission services are trying in any way they can to support it with documents and information, while the experts in the standing committees are also now preparing the Assembly reports. Thus, I think that the Commission's genuine interest is clear, as is its close and efficient cooperation with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention three points. The first is that we absolutely welcome the setting up of these three standing committees following the approval of the new rules of procedure in 2003. Thanks to preparatory cooperation between these committees, the reports present a high degree of accuracy and the debates in plenary are much clearer, specific and detailed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that the setting up of the Women's Forum is very important. This forum has provided the possibility for women's opinions to be heard and the possibility for mutual support. Thus, there is the possibility for the Assembly's proposals to be enriched with issues which relate to equality of the two sexes and the broader participation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a very important forum for political dialogue between MEPs and MPs from the ACP countries and, consequently, it is the Commission's duty to support this entire effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take advantage of the seventh plenary Assembly in Addis Ababa to inform you, even though you already know, that two of our colleagues, Pοul Nielson and Pascal Lamy, will be speaking, and I should like to express my best wishes for a successful Assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good to see that the degree and quality of cooperation between the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the United Nations reached unprecedented levels. I think its is especially worthwhile that enhanced cooperation with the UN is visible in the matter of child soldiers, as is evident from the report. This is an area where the battle cannot be ended before it is completely won. Even one child soldier is a gross injustice to humanity and its future.</p>
<p class="contents">There are an estimated 300 000 child soldiers under the age of 18 involved in some 40 conflicts throughout the world. Using children as soldiers is a violation of their human rights and deprives them of their childhood and the chance for education and building a better future as a result. Being a soldier always causes serious psychological and often also physical damage in children.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of child soldiers has increased with, for example, the development of weapons technology, as children can be made to use ever lighter and smaller weapons. The reason for the increase in the use of child soldiers is also due to the nature of modern warfare: most of today’s armed conflicts are civil wars. In the time of the First World War just 10% of the war’s casualties were civilians. Now the corresponding figure is 90%. Civil wars are waged between different ethic groups, which in practice means civilian populations. In this way children become targets and easily recruited additional troops. Children obey orders more readily than adults. Children have had to witness atrocities and carry them out themselves under coercion. Many guerrilla movements even prefer child soldiers to fully-grown combatants. Furthermore, children are prepared to take risks that adults would refuse to. One example is Iran, where children were used as messengers in minefields.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Save the Children Alliance was heard when the UN Security Council met in mid-January 2003 to discuss the plight of children in armed conflicts. The debate was preceded by the third report by the UN Secretary-General on children and armed conflicts. For the first time in an official report those responsible for using child soldiers were named. This is a significant step forward because it allows international pressure to be put on those who grossly violate children’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This otherwise excellent report is still in need of some small stylistic improvements. The Question Time in Rome was certainly animated, as points 6 and 26 state and which is all too commendable, but as it is actually mentioned twice, one gets the impression that this is an altogether unusual exception to the rule and that the basic nature of our work is lifeless and anaemic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The references which the excellent rapporteur makes are to the fact that we now have a parliamentary status and a very different way of working but, most important, the ACP representation is of elected Members of Parliament and not of ambassadors, which used to be the case in the past. I am sure if the previous speaker were to look at the evidence she would see that was the case. It is because we have this parliamentary status under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement that we have a new and dynamic maturity.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary assembly is a very special institution: it is the democratic arm of ACP-EU cooperation and provides a voice for the people in the 93 countries which are represented there. It is our task to build credible and workable partnerships through dialogue and consultation between our respective parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">In our last Joint Assembly we worked on the EPA trade negotiations, human rights, governance, the European Development Fund and environmental concerns. Our entire effort is to ensure that we deliver the promise and vision of Cotonou. Our work should reflect that unique subscription between the EU and 78 ACP countries to those values which are enshrined in the agreement. Those values are central to our work here in Parliament and to our work with developing countries, and that is democracy, the rule of law and, above all, the eradication of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are conscious of the difference of opportunity that exists between our ACP colleagues and ourselves. We have access to staff and technology to assist us with our work, and far greater opportunities to cooperate and work together, as we are now in our preparations for Addis Ababa at the end of this week.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have far more of a tradition of parliamentary scrutiny. I am delighted that Commissioner Nielson has on a number of occasions expressed his support for the Joint Assembly and for financial resources to be made available for us to be more effective in our work and for the participation of ACP Parliaments to be greater, because, after all, it is their legitimacy and accountability as parliamentarians that is at the heart of our work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am encouraged by the growing confidence of ACP parliamentarians, and that has been demonstrated, as Mrs Flesch says, by the extensive participation now from both sides in the debates we are having. We comment on it because it is growing and developing as confidence increases. In the past it was the European parliamentarians who dominated every debate and that, I am glad to say, is no longer the case. They are absolutely hungry for information in order that they can be more effective in their parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some countries – such as Senegal – are making a priority of parliamentary training and capacity-building in their national indicative programmes. But we need to do more to encourage more JPA parliaments to have this facility. We are now preparing for the seventh session of the JPA in Addis Ababa this weekend and I am sure that we will continue to work in an increasingly impressive and focused way in 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am finding it a little harder to come to terms with certain euphoric elements that I will highlight in the text itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Kinnock pointed out at great length, the new Rules of Procedure of the ACS-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly have created structures allowing for a real, fruitful dialogue. It appears to me a little premature to herald it as a world model at this stage. There is no doubt that in future, it can become a world model in the field of development cooperation and a place in which people with equal rights can have an open and transparent dialogue, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> about democracy and the protection of human rights, thus enabling us to enter into binding agreements with each other. We are not that far yet.</p>
<p class="contents">There are structures in place and both sides must now make effective use of them. This will require an increase in resources on the ACP side and quite possibly, a change in mentality on both, because the EU partner will also change following the accession of ten new countries. I wonder whether the sound results which we have already achieved in the joint working party, and which are reflected, among others, in the report on child soldiers, can be repeated shortly in our general assembly, where the tone of discussion has picked up a great deal, even though I still sometimes miss the ACP's equal participation. Our forum should develop into an effective North-South Parliament with a real impact on the orientation of our attitudes, for example with regard to world trade. Not only do we want <span class="italic">fair</span> trade, we also want <span class="italic">free</span> trade. I think that we will have to determine our policy in tandem with the ACP beforehand and that we should not always agree among the rich before we head to a conference in Cancun or wherever.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN's Millennium Declaration lists major issues in which we would like to make real improvement, for example by halving global poverty and with regard to good governance, health, education and an end to the oppression of women, these should all be items on the agenda, the progress of which we can measure in the framework of the ACP-EU meetings. We must become real partners in the development of North and South, and I should like to emphasise that consultation is necessary at all times if we are to be spared the disastrous effects of such incidents as those in Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, the original institutions implemented by the Lomé Conventions and confirmed by the Cotonou Convention, notably the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, have manifestly endured and are livelier than ever, and the report by Mrs Flesch clearly shows the innovative developments in the Joint Assembly in 2003. At the same time, however, the objectives and the substance of the cooperation, which these institutions are there to implement, are tending to weaken, degenerate, be trivialised, break apart and dissolve, to the point where, soon – if we let this carry on – they will consist only of financial aid with an upper limit and of standard free trade agreements that could be more a source of difficulty for the ACP countries than real instruments to aid their development.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur stresses, the creation in 2003 of three standing committees, in particular a Committee on Economic Development, Finance and Trade responsible for looking at the extremely delicate issue of negotiating future partnership agreements, reinforces the continuity of the Parliamentary Assembly and allows the quality of its work to be improved. The system of co-rapporteurs is original, and the work of the committee will lead to stronger, more finely tuned, better prepared and less routine resolutions, which will lead to much more in-depth debates than was possible in the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, the institutional framework is enhanced and fine-tuned, we need to ask ourselves about the future of the cooperation instruments themselves. If future economic partnership agreements merely apply the principle of equality of competitors, is there not a risk that they will create insurmountable accounting problems for ACP countries by making them lose out on a large part of their customs revenue, which is an important, and sometimes an essential, part of their budget? Moreover, is there not a risk that putting Community merchandise and local products in direct competition with each other without sufficient safeguards will weaken or even suffocate a number of sectors of activity in the ACP countries?</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to do our bit to avoid these wayward developments, then this unique North-South parliamentary forum that is the Joint Assembly, must ensure that major negotiation of partnership agreements is carried out with the necessary ambition and energy, in particular in the area of agriculture, which is the platform for development. The ACP countries will, however, only have a sufficiently strong agriculture if it is adequately protected as a budding industry as it gets off the ground. The Cotonou framework, that of regional economic zones, can be seen as the most appropriate framework to promote the establishment of homogeneous regional common markets with a common external tariff.</p>
<p class="contents">It is by working in this direction, Mr President, that ACP and European countries will no longer find themselves on different playing fields in future negotiations regarding agriculture and world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The work has acquired a better structure with the three committees, something that has improved the preparatory work prior to the plenary. Question time has also improved. It may of course be further improved if the answers to the questions reach MEPs in good time, so that the Commission does not merely read out the answers but provides scope for debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally should like to emphasise the constructive cooperation between the ACP-EU Assembly and the UN when it comes both to child soldiers and children’s vulnerability in war and to the debate concerning the International Criminal Court. These are two major and important political issues of precisely the kind that our Assembly should engage with, for they are about finding sound forms of cooperation in which both sides learn from each other and support the policy we consider to be important in the international arena.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States has removed its financial support from those countries that do not back the US’s demands that all Americans in general must be exempted from being brought before the International Criminal Court for serious war crimes. This measure can and must be supported both politically and financially by the ACP-EU, especially by the EU. It is gratifying to note that, of the Latin American and West Indian countries, it is only Belize that has given in to the US’s action and, of the African countries, only Nigeria, whose President ratified an agreement with the United States that was contrary to the Nigerian constitution and in defiance of the Nigerian Parliament. It is gratifying that most other countries have resisted the pressure from the United States. The ACP-EU Assembly plays an important political and economic role in major, crucial issues in the international arena. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
