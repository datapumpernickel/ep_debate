<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Izquierdo Rojo (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the fact that this House has accepted the proposal to produce a report on this issue, ‘Women and fundamentalism’, thereby allowing us to confront this serious problem and to hold this debate and the subsequent vote despite the difficulties involved and the current pressures. On behalf of the hundreds of millions of human beings whose rights are denied or restricted as a result of fundamentalist pressure, I would like to thank the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the European Union must defend the universality of human rights in a globalised world in which fundamentalists represent serious threats to freedoms, human rights and peace. This report offers useful proposals which will help to combat them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of them, Mr President, is that we must not allow religious fundamentalism to become a taboo subject, since problems are not solved by ignoring them or covering them up, but by being aware of them and confronting them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, fundamentalism cannot be combated by means of fundamentalism under another guise; the history of humanity is awash with disasters of that type. On the contrary, fundamentalism is reduced by promoting and exercising democratic freedoms, promoting the emancipation of women, pluralism and ideological and cultural diversity, the promotion of openness and the acceptance of differences and social and economic well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, one of the key elements which has proved to assist in the fight against fundamentalism is modernity, in a plural and multicultural sense. There can be no social modernity without human modernity. The desire to modernise a society while denying women democracy ends in failure; hence our condemnation of partial modernisation processes on the part of leaders of States which want only to modernise economic and technology aspects, while maintaining the basic principles of obsolete patriarchal societies in tact.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are currently the main bringers of social modernity. However, Mr President, there is no single model for the emancipated woman. Women’s identity must be personal and individual, differing in terms of religion, tradition and culture. Stereotypes, dress, values, lifestyles and behaviour must be a question of personal free choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, another of the key elements for preserving society from fundamentalism is secularisation or the separation of public affairs, which belong in the political sphere, from religious beliefs and convictions, which must be free and respected and which belong in the private individual sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">The space occupied by religion in a social and political whole must involve a very broad range of possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the accusations being levelled against this report are unfair. It distinguishes and differentiates between fundamentalism and the normal practice of religion in a clear and respectful way, despite the fact that during the eras of certain religions in the past such a distinction has not existed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are facing a violation of human rights on an immense scale. Just in the case of women and at the present time, we can identify hundreds of the millions of people whose rights and freedoms are being restricted, violated and denied them.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the time limits laid down in the Rules of Procedure, I have not been able to dwell on the death sentence by stoning imposed on Safiya Husseini, in Nigeria, nor on the Iranian women who are publicly flogged, nor those women, photographs of whose lynching I have seen, nor did I arrive in time to prevent the execution by stoning of Maryam Ayoubi last year. Despite the fact that the Iranian authorities had replied to the Commission that it had not stoned women for three years, the UN and Amnesty International have stated that that execution took place.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I would like this report to be just a first step, followed by other specific parliamentary proposals, which will demonstrate, in each country and case by case, what a human life is worth in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We recently witnessed the collapse of the Taliban regime, which highlighted the tragic position of women in Afghanistan. We recently witnessed the trials and tribulations of Safiya Husaini, condemned to death by stoning by an Islamic court in Nigeria for having a baby out of wedlock. A similar verdict has been passed in Sudan. All these cases show just how topical this report is. They also turn the spotlight on the violation of women's fundamental freedoms and rights by fundamentalist, anti-democratic regimes centre stage in a most dramatic manner.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened in Afghanistan with the rise of the Taliban is one very typical example. Women were deprived of their most basic human rights overnight. Like every other anti-democratic regime, the Taliban based their power on subjugating women and going back to their roots. Under these regimes, the sexual conduct, way of life and reproductive functions of women, even the way they dress, are generally controlled by religious leaders, allegedly abiding by scriptures and cultural traditions, while inhumane, violent and humiliating punishment, such as whipping and stoning, is the order of the day. We must not forget that about 5 000 women are murdered ever year by male members of their families for reasons of honour and that the perpetrators go unpunished. One hundred and thirty million women throughout the world have had their genitalia mutilated and that a further 2 million women a year are exposed to such practices.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to point out here that fundamentalism does not thrive just in developing countries; it also thrives in Europe. I think there is a serious problem in Poland. I have here an indictment signed by 100 public figures accusing the Catholic church of unacceptable interference and attempting to control women's reproductive functions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fundamentalists have turned the myth of their religion into a streamlined ideology which forms the basis of their polity, and it is absolutely vital for the West to understand this fundamentalism. Our intelligentsia must make this effort. At the same time, Europe’s Christian, or post-Christian, society must re-affirm its own, moral identity, this with the intention of being better able to protect its own values, and of understanding what is happening in the rest of the world, or what is happening with the 2.5 million Muslims who live in the European Union today.</p>
<p class="contents">The treatment of women under fundamentalist regimes, the topic of this report, is a burning issue. Denial of their rights and their dignity is unacceptable, but unfortunately, the rapporteur failed to draft a report which draws a distinction between religious perception and the place of religion in society on the one hand, and religious fundamentalism on the other. As a result, religion is being denied what other institutions and movements are being granted, namely the freedom of opinion and expression of this opinion, even if that opinion is partly seen as not conforming to the development of society. I share this view.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the PPE-DE Group in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has not accepted the text, despite however much it is opposed to the oppression of women. Together with a number of feminist groups in Afghanistan, I have personally in my group launched a support campaign in order to give them the chance to emancipate. If Europe wants to have any influence at all, and that is, after all, the aim of our campaign – the aim is not to launch an empty slogan, but to exert influence – we will need to learn to understand fundamentalism, whether we like it or not. I should like to conclude my speech with a reaction of the mufti of Marseille. It is in English, and I think that he is right and that it should determine our attitude too.</p>

On behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome the report, which emphasises Europe's responsibility for ensuring respect for fundamental rights and democratic principles as well as the secularity of nation states. Throughout the world, however, women's rights are being restricted or breached on the pretext of religious or cultural traditions or the law. This does not apply only to Islamists, but also to other religious groups.</p>
<p class="contents">After difficult negotiations, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities is proposing more than 30 paragraphs of specific measures, which have met with the agreement of four groups. We deeply regret the fact that of all groups the Christian-Democratic Group was not prepared to take part in compromise negotiations. The rapporteur was willing to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to fight against the suppression mechanisms of the fundamentalists should, after all, be the subject of a consensus. The Afghan Taliban provided us with an example of how they first jettisoned women's rights, then forced women to wear the burka, and finally denied them education and medical care and cut them off from any kind of paid employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In a joint declaration, the Women's Rights Committee in the European Parliament and the women of the Council of Europe call for an international group of female observers to be set up to see that Afghan women have their unrestricted human rights restored to them. We condemn any kind of fundamentalism, offence or crime for reasons of so-called honour, such as stoning or genital mutilation or withholding reproductive rights, and that includes in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the EU, we need to influence immigration laws and asylum policy so that reasons for persecution which are gender-specific or not related to a particular state are recognised. In my country this is the subject of a major debate and there too it is the Christian-Democratic Group which is refusing to compromise.</p>

However, on a smaller scale too, there are women across the world who are being oppressed, abused or discriminated against in the name of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">In many Islamic countries, girls are genitally maimed, although this is not mentioned anywhere in the Koran. In fact, the Koran prohibits this practice. This is no longer religion, but fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Some fellow MEPs labour under the misapprehension that I, along with other MEPs, denounce any religious interference in politics. This is incorrect. We welcome the fact that people are involved in European politics. This comes about via industry, environmental organisations and the unions. Needless to say, religions will also lobby for their interests and their ideals. The fact that churches defend their political agendas here among MEPs is a credit to our institution. I am therefore delighted with the Vatican’s attention to this report, as documented in the authoritative Spanish newspaper, El Pais, among others. As a first step towards an open dialogue with the Vatican, I should like to say the following in response to their criticism: we simply want women to be able to decide for themselves whether, and if so when, they want to bear children.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also focuses on the difficult position of women in developing countries and of lesbians. These are real problems which would be solved far better if politicians were to join forces with churches. Cooperation always leads to better results. Our joint fight against capital punishment or poverty is a good case in point. Would it not be wonderful if, on the road to yet more cooperation, we could start an open dialogue with regard to the Vatican’s position on condoms? Last year, 2.6 million people died of AIDS in Africa. If the Vatican stops the ban on condoms, we might be able to rescue a percentage of these people.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore enter into this open dialogue so that we can together fight fundamentalism at some stage in future, on the understanding that each take up their own responsibilities. I should like to thank the rapporteur and the fellow MEPs with whom we have cooperated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a source of violation of human and women’s rights and fundamental freedoms, as enshrined in the international treaties and conventions, and exercises its baleful influence not only directly, but also via religious rules, cultural characteristics, customs, political campaigns and social standards. Women’s rights are human rights, and this must form the basis of our actions. As I see it, and as we hear, women wish to accentuate the equal qualities of, and not the differences between, people. Let us transcend our religious differences in order to achieve a more humane world, preferably without violence. How many wars and how much violence find their improper origins in religious intolerance, often fed by political interests rather than religious perception? The unnecessary, pointless violence between Muslims and Hindus in India serves as a recent example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a major credit to this report if, thanks to the suggestions mentioned in it, an extreme danger of fundamentalism, namely the suffering of women and girls in Afghanistan, were turned into an example of how things can be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to explain. In the report, we asked the Council, the Member States and the Commission to take a joint initiative to send a special group of observers, specialised in gender equality, to Afghanistan to ensure that women’s rights, as enshrined in international agreements and Treaties, are observed, and that aid and reconstruction policy takes sufficient account of the gender equality issues. In this way, the tragedy caused by the Taliban, as well as the solution to it, can be used in the fight against other forms of fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is also praiseworthy for the fact that it expresses the wish that in the future directive on procedures for granting asylum in the Member States, account should be taken of various forms of female persecution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we have come this far, I would like to thank my colleagues who have put in so much effort to draw up a number of new amendments. I would particularly like to thank them for showing the courage to address the role of Saudi Arabia, something which we otherwise tend to keep quiet about, given that we live, it might be said, in an era characterised by neo-liberal economic fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many different sorts of fundamentalism both within and outside the borders of the European Union. I cannot help but mention last week’s scandal, one of many scandals over the years. This time it concerned the United States. The Catholic Church has protected those of its representatives who have sexually abused children in their congregations for a generation. What is worst is when degenerates of this kind are also defended with the aid of the law. In this case, I am thinking of the current cases in Nigeria, where women are sentenced to be stoned to death for having sexual relations outside marriage. I am also thinking of the legal proceedings taken in Portugal against women who have had abortions and against those who have helped them to have these abortions, as well as of the recent referendum on the same issue in Ireland. These are just a few examples among many which demonstrate the right assumed by men to control women and children as their personal property. This often takes place in the name of religion and often under the protection of the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fundamentalisms affect more than just the lives of women, they affect the lives of people in general, and for that reason they must be opposed and rejected on principle for they are at the root of a vision of society that is based on conflict. It is precisely because of this intrinsic nature that they have such negative consequences for women, becoming a sort of ethical justification for abuse and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, respect for fundamental human rights is a cultural even more than a legal heritage, which is shared by the Member States of the European Union, a common value which has to contend with practices, customs, religions and cultures with which Europe comes into contact mainly because of migration. I would like to make it clear, however, as a Catholic, that I am absolutely convinced that Catholicism is not guilty of the forms of fundamentalism that the report appears to suggest it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the call for the adoption of a universal moratorium on executions and the death penalty, an effective, incisive action, a campaign against mutilation, flogging and stoning, such as we have carried out and will continue to carry out for cases such as that of the Nigerian woman, Safiya Husseini. I would like to draw your attention to a number of issues which I feel need to be addressed, calling upon the Commission and Parliament to reflect on them once again: to reflect on the right of the family, on the minimum conditions for the right of asylum, on integration, with regard to which we need to move away from a form of hypocritical rhetoric which drifts between full integration with the Member States of the European Union and respect for identities, and on the need for a clear separation of Church from State, or rather of religion from politics.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we confirm our rejection of any form of violence, particularly violence and oppression inflicted on human beings, be they men or women. We call upon the Commission not just to guarantee that the Community acquis on women’s rights will be respected in the talks, but also to analyse all these problematic issues further, for there are at least as many unresolved issues as issues which have been resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every serious attempt to do something about this deserves our support. After all, women are equal to men and deserve respect for their talents. As a Christian, I have adopted this attitude based on the Bible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the report on women and fundamentalism offers no solution to the problem. Quite the reverse, in fact. The report tips towards a similar kind of intolerant fundamentalism to that which it means to fight. Respect for the deep conviction of worshippers is nowhere to be detected. The report arrogantly prescribes what is good and evil. Religions are treated with a negative and biased approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The report’s basic ideology is founded on the belief that people determine for themselves what is right and wrong. People only have rights. Any mutual ties of love and care, of solidarity and self-denial are treated with suspicion. This appears to me to be unadulterated egotism, despite the veneer of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements about motherhood form the most disappointing part of the report. Motherhood is, by definition, not a purely personal matter, if nothing else because children develop their own personalities. Furthermore, the father is depicted in an appalling manner as somebody who exercises control over the reproductive capacity of women. As a father, I feel deeply hurt by this statement. Is the rapporteur looking to abolish men, by any chance?</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the work that has gone into this report by the rapporteur, but I hope that it will be rejected. Let us look for other ways of improving the position of oppressed women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a lay person, I make exactly the same request, which, I feel, restores dignity to those who have faith or religious beliefs and restores dignity to those with political responsibilities. Ladies and gentlemen, the problem is precisely this: the separation of religion from political power and political decision-making. The problem covers more than just the religions we describe as fundamentalist, it is more than just the extreme case of genital mutilation and the Sharia: it is the general, standard situation, which is common in our countries too, the fact that there needs to be a separation of Church from State, of religion from politics.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the heart of the matter, this is what we must have the courage to do. It is too easy to condemn extreme cases or Afghanistan; it is more difficult to take a look at our own home, more difficult to talk about the continual interference: I refer, for example, to scientific research, to the ban on the use of supernumerary embryo cells for scientific purposes, I am thinking of the Church’s positions on therapeutic cloning and the obedience shown by the political class. Therefore, the meaning of this debate, of this report, for us and for all the women who live in Arab countries, whether extremist or not, is that the dignity of each individual and the respect for the religious beliefs of each individual will be safeguarded only if we assume our responsibility to separate religion from politics, Church from State.</p>
<p class="contents">There you are: this, I feel, is what we must have the courage to do, without limiting our focus, so to speak, to extreme situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take care. If we do not make the separation absolutely clear-cut and make indulgent concessions to the claims of cultural relativism, we will not help the women of Arab or European countries who are fighting for recognition of their role in society and their integrity at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">History teaches us – and modern times also show us – that women are the first and most vulnerable victims of fundamentalism and it is this which interests Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Violations of women's human rights are a daily occurrence in numerous areas of the world, in various forms and in various sectors of public and private life. And if we exercise a little self-criticism, we must admit that it was the destruction of cultural monuments by the Taliban and the terrorist attack on 11 September which made us aware of the situation of women in Afghanistan. And cultural and religious customs and traditions are constantly cited in Afghanistan – as they are elsewhere – as an excuse for violating these rights. It is true that women and how they live are always the last bastion of resistance to progress in a country or society. So what we see is that, while numerous countries accused of violating human rights, especially women's human rights, are finding the courage to introduce economic reforms which often fly in the face of traditional or religious precepts, when it comes to women and their rights, change is resisted at every turn.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group and the rapporteur differ on the role which religion plays in people's lives. We do not accept that religion and human rights are in opposite camps. Anyway, keeping the faith cannot go hand in glove with suppression and violence. This was the thrust of repeated amendments proposed by my political group in committee; however, the rapporteur failed to pay them any attention, which is why my political group has tabled amendments before plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than fight our citizens' religious convictions, our approach is to mobilise all the political means at our disposal to ensure that the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights are applied to all policies, as the European Commission did recently when it took the initiative to strengthen these policies in its foreign relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a political issue of the utmost topicality, which must be addressed carefully but quite firmly. It is our view that, in the European Union, equal rights for women and men, the right of all of us not to suffer public and domestic violence and to undertake the tasks that are within our ability, which we wish to undertake and which benefit us, is one of the greatest privileges we enjoy. We wish to share these privileges with all the women in the world. The violence we see throughout the world, particularly the situation of Afghan women under the Taliban regime, also exists, unfortunately, in other countries in which the dignity and will of women are trampled on for religious or ideological reasons. We must condemn and fight effectively against the various forms of fundamentalism that exist in the world and which allow such situations to exist. No one will be able to understand why the European Parliament is not adopting a strong position on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Many compromise amendments have now been tabled. We must make an effort to reach agreement and we need to keep an open and tolerant mind on this matter. We cannot adopt a fundamentalist approach to this issue of intransigence toward the enormously serious situations taking place across the world and, in some cases, for example concerning the decision on reproductive rights, even within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this report is to secure a vote against all forms of fundamentalism. If the European Parliament does not approve the report, it would, from a political point of view, be extremely serious; it would send the message to the world that the European Parliament cannot agree on how to fight the various forms of fundamentalism that currently exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am slightly uncomfortable with this report. I accept that it took a certain amount of courage to draw up this report, but I am not convinced that it had to be so ambiguous. The line between religion and fundamentalism does not seem to me to be clearly drawn. This certainly does not mean that fundamentalism is bad and religion good, but rather that we must not confuse religion with fundamentalism and vice versa. Speaking, not as a politician, but as a researcher who has studied the history of women, I know one thing: there is not a single religion that has not created a hierarchy between the sexes. This is a historical fact that cannot be denied. All those of us who want to oppose fundamentalism in any shape or form must face up to this historical fact without being hypocritical about it.</p>
<p class="contents">In every religion, there is a hierarchy between the sexes. Some do promote certain women’s rights, but few create and promote gender equality. That does not exist. We just have to put up with it, as it were. Personally, I am in favour of separating church and State, as you can tell from my speech. My words are addressed to all followers of religion. Fundamentalist or not, you are well aware that no religion has produced a theory on equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">This report makes me uncomfortable as there are some things that are not right. Recital T, for example, states that fundamentalism and feminism can be reconciled. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is possible to cobble together or come up with strategies for emancipation despite fundamentalism, as certain Iranian women have proved to us, but that does not make it true in all cases. Similarly, when I read in Article 31 that religious leaders must be asked to grant women the right to control their own bodies, I must protest. They will not do it! They are fighting against contraception and abortion. We know it, fundamentalism or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us think seriously and clearly about all that. We will undoubtedly disagree, but each person’s position will be clear to us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it accuses the religious organisations of barring women from leading positions in the hierarchy, it is not attacking the kind of fundamentalism which is a threat – Islamic fundamentalism – so much as the Church, which restricts priesthood to men. The report contradicts itself when it calls upon the European Parliament – moreover in arrogant, disrespectful terms – to impose its own views on matters of dogma and ideology on the Pope and the patriarchs. This prompts me to wonder what is happening to the European Parliament: is it the parliament of the peoples or a parliament serving the occult powers?</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes two mistakes. The first is to equate Islamic fundamentalism with the principles of the Christian tradition, which have been dismissed as obsolete and reactionary, whereas the Christian and Catholic tradition is an integral part of the heritage of values and common culture of the European peoples. The second is to see Islamic fundamentalism as a degenerate sect of Islam when it is actually the current, authentic interpretation of Islam which is taught in all Islamic universities. It may be politically correct to disregard these facts but in doing so we are preventing Europe from defending itself against the danger represented by Islamic communities, governed by the severe rules of the Sharia which takes as much notice of women’s rights as it does of our right of the family and all the principles of freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am perplexed by many parts of the report and I want to go back to the crux of the matter, which I feel has been comprehensively defined by Mrs Bonino in her speech, and state my views clearly once again.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is the separation of religion from politics. From this point of view, if there is to be such a separation, it has to be understood that there are two ways of looking at these two radically different dimensions of life; so much so that, in actual fact, the only fundamentalism I truly fear is the fundamentalism of those sorts of idealisms which can no longer see the sense of reality in dealing with each specific subject individually by different means. Therefore, when this report calls upon us not to recognise States in which women are excluded from government and it is referring not to a normal State but to a State such as the Vatican, for example, I realise immediately that there is something wrong, for we are being asked to trespass on Member States’ prerogatives and interfere in something which does not deserve such treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, if religion and politics are to be separated, the problem is the freedom of the Church, which must not be conditioned by political points of view or prerogatives. Therefore, when I read in point K of this report that, when religious bodies carry out activities of a public nature, they are, just by doing so, as good as committing a crime against an alleged European law; that is, if, by way of example, a religious body were to run a hospital or a school, it would in some way be a threat to European law, I find this extremely disturbing.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I confirm once again my support for the fight to uphold women’s rights, but I must strongly reiterate my concern at the report’s method and subject matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that each one of us, men and women, took part in meetings, seminars and conferences to confirm, once and for all, that equality between men and women is vital for the democratic development of our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The values of the European Union laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights include the right to human dignity, the right to the integrity of the person, freedom of thought, conscience and religion and equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, here, in this Assembly, let us accept our responsibilities. It is up to us, the men and women of Europe, to apply these rights and ensure their application within the European Union and to defend and develop these values in the rest of the world. Here, I would like to point out how important the adoption of this report would be in this battle, as we must keep on tirelessly reminding ourselves that women are the primary victims of fundamentalism. They are victims of violence, social, economic, political and sexual discrimination, psychological and physical abuse, oppression, and are refused all the fundamental rights: equality, access to education and politics, and all in the very name of fundamentalism, which is the antithesis of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We can and must take action. We must promote and protect democracy and human rights in our Association Agreements. We must also ensure intercultural dialogue between the two banks of the Mediterranean by increasing monitoring for more active participation of women in the actions and programmes we support.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must support women seeking asylum in the European Union having suffered persecution in their own country in the name of fundamentalism. The defence of women’s rights and equality between men and women must be one of the cornerstones of our actions which requires specific attention from our Assembly. In this Assembly, from now on, with the vote on this directive, let us give women the means and the signal to cast off their chains and let us once more assume our responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The history of this report, in the first place, shows that this initiative is untimely. What was originally a report on women in Islam has ended up as a convoluted, ambiguous report with no real coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">In not wishing to attack Islam head-on, which I understand, the definition of fundamentalism has remained vague. Yet is fundamentalism not a caricature of religion? We are all in agreement with regard to separating the temporal from the spiritual, and, from then on, it is not really within Parliament’s remit to get involved in the ambiguous area of comparative theology. However, certain points deserve our agreement, in particular the statement that, within the territory of the Member States, customs and beliefs that are counter to human rights, and in particular women’s rights, cannot be tolerated and that the family rights of the Member States take precedence over those of the countries of origin of immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, equality between men and women is not a matter of theory. Women must be promoted, along with their position and role in society, not simply as women, but because they are part of the same humanity, and therefore the same dignity, as men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is illustrated by such things as the situation of women in Afghanistan, the stoning of women, or traditional practices such as female circumcision which, unfortunately, are still being carried out, also in Europe. In fundamentalist societies in particular, women are often denied fundamental rights and freedoms, and often have no access to adequate assistance, health care and education. This is why I was pleased with the proposal by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities to draft an own-initiative report on the topic of ‘Women and fundamentalism’ and this is precisely why I am disappointed with the poor quality of the present report. I regret that we were unable to find a compromise within Mrs Karamanou’s opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Izquierdo report is right to call attention to the adverse effects of fundamentalism. However, if the topic and the intention are good, it does not necessarily follow that the report is good. The report goes too far where it lumps together religion, fundamentalism and human rights violation. The report is more anti-religion than it is pro-woman. It has adopted the wrong approach because solutions are sought in half-yearly reports, the setting up of an open university for women only, special mobility programmes for women – as if women needed this – and intervention in countries which act in accordance with their legislation but which, in the eyes of the rapporteur, nevertheless offer women inadequate protection. The report is also inconsistent. It is fair to call for the separation of church and state, but it goes on to prescribe requirements for the internal organisation of religious traditions. Moreover, the report is full of careless formulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has tabled amendments, which can improve the report to some extent. However, even if they were all adopted, there are many instances left of over-simplification, lack of editorial clarity, duplication, obligatory repetitions of EU legislation and proposals which fall outside our remit.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, representatives of human rights organisations, women’s organisations, churches and women in churches have made an urgent appeal to vote against the report. One thing is certain: women and religion, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and Parliament, along with the fight against fundamentalism, deserve a better report than this one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Historically, culture and tradition have put women into the situation of inequality they suffer today.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst violations against women in the world are currently carried out on behalf of religious fundamentalism. Religious fundamentalism is also political and, when women and girls live under it, their lives tragically offer them no possibility of escape.</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of the freedom of thought which the Members from the People’s Party advocate, quite rightly, the Izquierdo report argues in favour of the separation of the powers of Church and State, that is, between religion and politics. That should be the report’s most significant argument. Many women are awaiting our commitment on this issue. We must defend the values that we, men and women, espouse in order that we may live together in freedom. In the name of that freedom of choice and decision which is denied to the majority of women in the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not agree with the exclusive determinism for women, which condemns them for the rest of their lives. It is not true that women can participate with the same dignity as men because they are excluded from practically everything which may give them that dignity. In the name of tradition, religion and fundamentalism, women are stoned, murdered and mutilated.</p>

To start with, as far as fundamentalism is concerned, I think that we have to analyse the concept outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Treaty, the European Union is a union of independent states. Religion is a purely private matter for each individual and keeping the faith is a personal decision for each individual, assuming of course that keeping the faith does not run counter to the basic principles which unite all the Member States of the European Union. On Women's Day recently, we discussed Muslim women in Europe. Islam is the second most important religion in the European Union today. The European Muslim women who spoke highlighted the fact that the Koran is interpreted solely by men. Women are never involved in interpreting the Koran. However, any interpretation of the Koran or any other religion in the European Union cannot be respected unless the basic laws and principles of the European Union are respected first. This means that the basic principle of equality of men and women is a principle on which any other priorities and principles must be founded.</p>
<p class="contents">However, outside Europe, fundamentalism really is a very important problem, as many of the speakers have described. I think that identifying, describing and condemning the problem is very important, but Europe will be guilty by omission if it fails to take very specific measures to deal with it worldwide. The European Commission has proposed specific measures to mainstream the gender dimension in all forms of foreign policy, in external trade, in development aid, in all the European Union's individual agreements with third countries and at summits organised between the European Union and various continents, such as the Europe/Africa, Europe/Asia and Europe/Latin America summits.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is quite specific. First, last year, as part of mainstreaming in all individual policies, the Commission presented the action plan on development relating to women. It contains very specific actions on how to take account of respect for women's human rights, the involvement of women in development aid and the development of each country, and how to apply this action plan, with incentives and, where necessary, with sanctions. Similarly, we are organising an initial seminar in March for experts from the 15 Member States and delegates invited from all over the world to debate a foreign policy action plan to be complied with by the European Union and the Member States. We are preparing a Council of Foreign Ministers in 2003 at which the main item on the agenda will be a foreign policy action plan and recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very important report because it focuses the debate on what is now one of the most serious issues at global level, the crime perpetrated against women on the grounds of religion or cultural mores, a crime which affects hundreds of millions of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
