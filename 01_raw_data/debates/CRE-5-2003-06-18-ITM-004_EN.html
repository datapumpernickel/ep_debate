<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   The next item is the extraordinary debate on the European Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Iñigo Méndez de Vigo and Klaus Hänsch, let me congratulate you and the 30 colleagues from this House, along with President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, his vice-presidents and the other members of the Convention for a truly remarkable achievement. You have produced a draft Constitutional Treaty which is clear, which is balanced, which is based on a single option and which could work. The ultimate vindication, if one was needed, of Parliament's total belief in the Convention method an open, inclusive, participatory and democratic preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Convention are also innovative. It was an operation which was originally conceived to address some of the business left over at Nice, and then broadened to answer a catalogue of questions from Laeken. The Convention has now produced a constitutional blueprint with a broad institutional balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal represents a radical improvement on our existing Treaties – way beyond what many may have expected. The first reactions, as I have followed them in this House, have broadly endorsed the result of the Convention. I am aware that nobody in an exercise like this can be 100% satisfied. But no politics anywhere can please all the people all the time. I am sure everybody can think of various improvements to different Articles, but to draw up a balanced project for tomorrow's Europe to which have contributed 28 national parliaments, 28 governments, the European Commission and the European Parliament and to get, at the end, a coherent result is something which should not be minimised. It should not be lightly discarded or unbundled. Those who would seek to unravel the broad consensus which has been created would bear a political responsibility and risk a result that would tend towards the lowest common denominator, precisely the result which the Convention wished to avoid – and it ably managed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Some further work is required, and the Convention has expressed a wish to complete its work on parts 3 and 4 of the Constitutional Treaty in the first two weeks of July. I hope the Convention will be authorised to proceed in this way, in particular as regards the part 3 of the Treaty on the policies of the Union. We hope that the Convention will find the means to avoid gridlock on European Union decision-making, through excessive reliance on the veto mechanism. In this way it will achieve coherence with the rest of the text which responds to the double challenge of enhanced democracy and greater efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council is expected to convene an IGC later this year. I support the approach that the conference should be as short as possible and should conclude its work in good time for the 2004 European Parliamentary elections. I also strongly recommend that the Accession States should play a full and equal role in the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to ask the European Council in Thessaloniki to consider how best to associate the European Parliament with the working of the IGC. There is widespread recognition that in previous IGCs European Parliamentary participation played an important and constructive role. It is in the logic of the progress, the participation and the shared ownership that has emerged from this Convention that the role of the Parliament should be enhanced in the dispositions that would be made for the next IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">Having the Treaty agreed well before the next European elections is essential. Our voters, the citizens, have the right to know what they are voting for, and what role the Parliament they elect is destined to play in the wider Europe of tomorrow. I also hope the new Treaty will contribute to making the next elections, along with the historic enlargement – although our sixth direct elections – our first real <span class="italic">European</span> elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude, as I began, by congratulating our colleagues who contributed so effectively to the deliberations of the Convention; by acknowledging, on behalf of the European Parliament, our debt of gratitude to all the <span class="italic">conventionnels</span> and to the leadership of President Giscard d'Estaing. A sound basis is now available to the governments. The Convention has given its lead. We call now on the governments to give theirs.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Méndez de Vigo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Chairman of the European Parliament’s Delegation in the Convention.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, thank you very much for your words and I would like to congratulate you on having called this plenary session just a few days after the closing session of the Convention and just a few days before the European Council in Thessaloniki. This Parliament will be the first to debate the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">And it is with emotion that I would like to point out that, in 1997, it was this Parliament, in a report for which Mr Dimitris Tsasos and myself were rapporteurs, that approved the replacement of the intergovernmental method with what we then called the Community method for the reform of the Treaties. That Community method, enshrined in the Resolution of 19 November 1997, is the Convention. The European Parliament’s option has therefore been a successful one, because I would like to say quite seriously that, in the 16 months of the Convention’s work, we have done more than in ten years of Intergovernmental Conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr President, we have a Constitution. I remember how this Parliament was also a pioneer, through the report by Mr Olivier Duhamel, in calling for the constitutionalisation of the Union. This constitutionalisation is going to increase efficiency and is going to produce a Union of results. Many of our requests are in the text: the pillars disappear, the Union has a legal personality, we are going to reinforce the Community method, we have guaranteed the Commission's monopoly on initiative, a legislative procedure in which the Council and Parliament are on an equal footing will become the normal procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also achieved a move from unanimity to qualified majority in many areas, and this Parliament will be involved in 70 of them, when at the moment it is involved in 34. We also have a great simplification of methods, Mr President: we have ended up with five decision-making procedures and we have managed to use a language which was far-removed from the Community jargon.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have also democratised the Union, starting with the first article of the Constitution, which speaks of the Union's double legitimacy, something which this Parliament has always advocated as a Union of states and citizens. When I entered this Parliament in 1992 it was a consultative assembly. After the Constitution this Parliament will be a Parliament worthy of its name. And this democratising effect also impacts on national parliaments. I would like to pay tribute to Mr Napolitano and his report, for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because we have created a means for involving national Parliaments in the Community procedure by means of the early warning system. I would also like to say to all of those people who have always noted a degree of rivalry between the national Parliaments and the European Parliament that our main allies in this Convention have been the national Parliaments. And I would like to pay tribute to them for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, Mr President, that we have done something enormously important, something we have fought for in this Parliament, which is to integrate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution. We called for this before Nice and we did not achieve it, but the Charter of Fundamental Rights is now going to become the document which will give Europeans their identity.</p>
<p class="contents">And not only have we reinforced the representative institutions, but also the participatory ones. The Constitution has recognised the role of non-governmental organisations and associations, and we have incorporated popular initiative as an instrument for semi-direct democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, when Mr Giscard d'Estaing was asked last week who had won, he said that in terms of this Constitution the European Parliament had won. I believe the citizen has won. I believe this is a triumph for the European citizens, who are going to have a Union capable of producing better results, a more transparent Union and, above all, a more efficient Union. And allow me to say that, as Chairman, I have been very honoured to carry out this task. Very honoured because the 32 members of the delegation – we have not distinguished between members and substitutes – have done exceptional work in defending the positions of Parliament and in providing technical and political support at all times for myself, for Klaus Hänsch and for Andrew Duff.</p>
<p class="contents">Please let me say one more thing, Mr President: go to Thessaloniki. I believe that this Parliament's political message is a very clear one. You have said that this Constitution represents radical progress. I believe this is the most important advance the European Union has made since the Treaties of Rome, and I am therefore convinced that the Intergovernmental Conference is not going to improve it. I believe that we should defend this text, which has been presented without options, as the European Parliament wanted, to the end. At the end of this process, moreover, Mr President, I believe we must put it to a referendum. Certain governments, such as the Spanish Government, have asked that such a referendum take place on the same day as the European Parliament elections; and I believe this would represent the culmination of this democratising element contained in the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much to everybody for your help. Without your help, without everybody's help, this would have been impossible.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hänsch (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">first vice-chairman of the European Parliament delegation to the European Convention.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the consensus on the draft Constitution which we reached in the Convention last Friday has been described as historic, and indeed it is – for look at what has been achieved. We have drafted a Constitution for over 25 sovereign states and peoples who, for centuries, were pitched head-to-head in plunder, war and devastation. That is without parallel in history. We have drafted a Constitution for a multitude of peoples and states who all have long histories of their own, who speak different languages, who maintain their own identity and yet who want to shape their destinies together. That is without precedent in the history of Europe and the world. What is new about it? I would like to mention just six points which I think are especially important.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Constitution sets forth the rights and duties of citizens. We have made the Charter of Fundamental Rights an integral and legally binding element of the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the famous ‘four freedoms’ of the Treaty of Rome were also promises for the future. Today, these promises have been fulfilled. The new Constitution contains a new pledge in Article 2 and Article 3, namely sustainable development, justice, security and solidarity for Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the most important contribution to democracy and to the ‘ownership’ of European policies is clarity. Citizens must be able to identify which areas can be regulated by the European Union and which cannot. They must also be able to identify who bears responsibility for political decisions and who does not. In this respect, the Constitution makes significant progress. We have created a division of competences which, for the first time, defines the competences between the Member States and the European Union more clearly than before, and I would remind the older Members of this House that Parliament has failed twice in the past to achieve this goal. We have greatly simplified and reduced the number of decision-making procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the European Parliament: codecision on matters of legislation will be the rule in future. Today it is the exception, but in future, it will be the rule, and that is a quantum leap compared with the current situation. After all, the President of the Commission will be elected by this Parliament. This enhances his political legitimacy and will increase the importance of the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we have tackled the issue of institutional balance. We have strengthened all three institutions: the European Parliament, of course, but also the Commission, especially the Commission President, whose role is considerably enhanced, and we have also strengthened the Council, in the person of the President of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, the European Union is not a global power, but it has a global power's responsibility. At present, it cannot do justice to this responsibility, but we have tried to ensure that it can do so in future. We have created the position of a European Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, we realise that simply creating this position certainly does not achieve commonality on foreign, security and defence policy issues. That cannot be regulated by a decision; it is a process, and the position of Foreign Minister will have to ensure that this process towards commonality is initiated and kept on track.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that there were no models for what we have drafted. This constitution cannot be a copy of any nation-state's constitution. The nation-state of the nineteenth century is not the blueprint for Europe's architecture in the twenty-first century. We had to reinvent ourselves in the Convention, not only in substantive terms: we also had to reinvent our working methods. We have not always achieved what we set out to achieve, but no Intergovernmental Conference since the Treaty of Rome has produced such significant changes, with such a far-reaching impact, as those now envisaged by the Constitution. With this Constitution, we can put the European Union, the 50-year-old organisation of European states, on a new footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Treaties are based on mistrust born of past experience. Constitutions are based on confidence in the future, and with this Constitution, the citizens of Europe are linking their destinies to create a better future. Let us, here in the European Parliament, clear the way for this process and make sure that the governments face up to their European responsibility.</p>

I would also like to say right away that our group can support the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all the dreams have come to fruition. If we consider the challenges facing us, especially the enlargement to twenty-five Member States, Europe's role in matters of war and peace, and worldwide developments, I would have liked to see something a little more courageous. I would have liked to see majority voting in foreign policy – but this is something which I hope we can still discuss during the negotiations on Part III. With twenty-five Member States, how can we make any progress on certain aspects of tax policy if we do not have majority voting, and if we fail to make further improvements here in Part III? In other words, measured against the challenges, we cannot be satisfied, but what has been achieved is better than what we had before, and that is the essential point.</p>
<p class="contents">It is better than what we have at present, for Europe has never been developed in a single step. Even with twenty-five countries, we still cannot enshrine ‘finality’, because no agreement can be reached on this. Walter Hallstein was right, as always, when he said that European union is a <span class="italic">creatio continua</span> – an ongoing process of creation. The progress which can be made at a specific moment in history is written down and enshrined in treaty form – and now in the form of a constitution – and is the basis for further development and progress within the European Union. This is the perspective from which we should view this outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch when they say that this is a truly magnificent achievement. If we look at our own nation-states and see how often it takes years of dispute to amend a tax law or perhaps revise a provision of the constitution, and how lengthy and difficult a process achieving a decision or an agreement can be, I think it is a miracle that so many nations, represented by their governments and parliamentarians, have been able to reach agreement on a common constitution. That is almost unprecedented in constitutional history. In all our countries, our constitutions were created as a result of new beginnings, crises, disasters and war, when there was social and political consensus in the country, but not in normal times. The fact that this has nonetheless been achieved has a great deal to do with the fact that the majority of this Convention was composed of parliamentarians, who – unlike the diplomats at the Intergovernmental Conferences – think in terms of solutions, not competences.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, on behalf of my group, I would like to send one message to Thessaloniki. What the parliamentarians have drafted must not be reopened by the diplomats, for nothing legitimates their doing so. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is why we must defend what has been achieved, especially through the parliamentarians’ work. Even if every one of us has an issue where he or she is not entirely satisfied, we must put it to one side and refrain, for the next six months, from making fresh demands. Instead, we must defend what has been achieved and postpone other desirable things for the time being. After that, we will have a chance of achieving them. I am also quite optimistic that every one of the governments that are now moaning wants a different thing changed. However, one would cancel out the other, and that is probably the safest guarantee that at the end of the day, the text will go through more or less as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a Europe of citizens has also been created. What has been founded is a Europe of states and of citizens, safeguarded by fundamental rights. At the elections, the citizens will vote on the head of the executive because linkage has been established between the elections to the European Parliament and the election of the executive.</p>
<p class="contents">We see that this has occurred on the basis of a value-oriented constitution. My group battled hard to include a reference to Christianity; we were not successful, but what has been achieved is a value-based constitution, with religious life being enshrined as an element of significance for the future, and values are, in any case, set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We have more scope for action. We have clarity between the institutions. We have found an equilibrium – despite the President of the European Council – which seems to me to be reasonably well-balanced. For this reason, we should vote for the draft Constitution and then have further discussions next week during the negotiations on Part III, if at all possible. In particular, we should ensure that we are more effective on the key foreign policy issue, but we should also remember that through closer cooperation, we have made much more progress than has been discussed in public so far, including the option of an obligation to provide support. I think that for this reason, it is good work and this House should endorse it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, almost 20 years after the European Parliament, elected by universal suffrage, produced a draft Constitution, the ‘Spinelli draft’, we are achieving a text for a Constitution for a European Union made up of 25 States and 480 million citizens. I believe we must welcome this historic success of the Convention, which has produced a democratic draft whose contents largely correspond to the hopes we had placed in this enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like to express my gratitude for the work done by the European Parliament’s Delegation led very competently by the two Members who have represented it in the Presidium: Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch, who have acted as a coherent team fighting from the front but also protecting their rear.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this has added coherence and seriousness to our representation and has helped our political families from throughout the enlarged Union to be able to work and mature in this House – which is the home of democracy in Europe – and to be able to create a common doctrine which has been specifically reflected in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Without making a very detailed analysis and assessment – this is a job we will have to do during the summer and which will have to be carried out by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – and in passing, Mr President, I would like to complain on behalf of my group because Mr Napolitano has not been given speaking time as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. He will speak within the speaking time allotted to the Socialist Group, but I do not believe that this is a correct way of proceeding.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say on behalf of my group that we must celebrate the fact that we have a single text without options, without red cards; a text which opens doors and does not close them, and also one which is of a manageable size. I believe these are important elements on the basis of which we must work and make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We must defend what we have fought for tooth and nail and we must continue working; our two representatives have given a brief summary of what has been achieved. I would like to point out, in relation to the evolutionary clauses and the new date of 2009, that we must continue to work, drawing conclusions, creating doctrine and strengthening the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention certain points which the Socialist Group sees as absolute priorities: to strengthen the social Europe and to defend Europe in terms of its economic governance, making progress in the field of taxation with regard to the internal market and majority decision-making in the field of foreign, security and defence policy; and we believe that this must also contribute to finding a better balance within the interinstitutional triangle.</p>
<p class="contents">Our job must therefore now be to try to consolidate this Constitution as a basis for subsequent work, but we must work on the basis of what we have agreed, what has been achieved, which is an indication that we are able to act, and this is tremendously important at a time when the European Union was being portrayed as moribund and incapable of taking action.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe we must welcome something which is also very positive, at a time when we have observers from the future member countries, and that is that they have participated fully in the work of the Convention before actually joining the Union. They are working shoulder to shoulder with us and playing a significant role, and this is being demonstrated in popular referendums.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last week we have had two significant successes in Poland and in the Czech Republic demonstrating that this is not just a market, but a shared project of coexistence, and we believe we should welcome it when so often distrust has been called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, please allow me to comment on an important aspect, because we always talk about architecture and we must also talk about personalities, we must also support – and I would ask that this be done in Thessaloniki – the Council’s Agreement returned this week on the Statute on European Political Parties. I believe that Parliament has done significant work. We must thank the rapporteur, Mr Jo Leinen, for the great work he has done. It is clear that having protagonists who genuinely demonstrate that we are capable of organising ourselves is a fundamental element of European construction.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, Mr President, I would like to ask you on behalf of my group, when you go to the Thessaloniki Summit, to express the clear will of the whole House that the text which has been produced openly and democratically be respected, and also to say, on our behalf, that we want to be properly represented in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference; not just making use of previous experiences but with a representation which is in line with our participation and our dignity.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too thank all those who have represented this House on the Convention. It is said that ‘success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan’. The draft Constitution agreed by the Convention last Friday is blessed with many proud parents. Of these, the European Parliament can claim more than its fair share of paternity, since we led the calls for the Convention method to be used to avoid a repeat of the failures of Nice. We owe much to the Belgian Presidency of the European Union, which gave us the visionary Laeken Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">While the birth was difficult and the baby is not as pretty as we hoped, the European Constitution born on Friday 13 June 2003 deserves a long and fruitful life. Liberals everywhere will rejoice that fundamental rights now lie at the heart of the Union's basic law. We welcome the establishment of a single legal personality for the Union, the unification of the pillars and the extension of democratic control by the European Parliament. Crucially, this shorter and simpler treaty should also be more accessible to Europe's citizens since it sets out more clearly who does what.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we would have liked to go further in some respects. We hope that the post of Chairman of the European Council will in time be merged with that of Commission President in an integrated Presidency. We want to see the legitimacy of the Commission strengthened by a real election of its President by the European Parliament. We seek a greater role for regions with constitutional powers. And we would like greater recourse to majority voting, even in a sensitive area like foreign policy, so that the Union can act more decisively abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still work to be done. The extension of qualified majority voting needs to be given concrete expression in the policies in part 3 of the constitution. We also urge the Convention to be ambitious in creating a lighter procedure for amending part 3, through voting by super-qualified majority and without recourse to national ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">At Thessaloniki, the Heads of State and Government will be granted custody of the new-born constitution and will bring it to maturity in the Intergovernmental Conference. Having been so central to its conception, our governments will not be able to disown the constitution lightly.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will have to decide the composition and the duration of the IGC. The parliamentary component of the Convention must be fairly represented at the talks – as you, Mr President, have said. Since members of the Liberal caucus under my colleague Andrew Duff have made such a great contribution to the work of the Convention, we insist that Parliament's representation should reflect this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the length of the IGC, if Member States seek to unpick one part of the deal, others will pull at it too and the whole fabric risks unravelling. For that reason, we urge that the IGC be kept short and stick to the essentials of the text agreed by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my final point. The most open and democratic institutional reform in our Union's history deserves to be brought to a fitting conclusion. It is no use making the EU simpler and more accountable if politicians do not then explain it and argue the case for active engagement in Europe</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking personally, I hope that my own government will at last shake off its reticence and take the case for Britain's membership of this refounded European Union to the people in a referendum. Whether they ratify by way of referendum or parliamentary debate, I hope that other countries too will seize the opportunity to have a great debate with their voters. That way, our people can again feel ownership of the European project.</p>

Despite some criticisms, which every Convention member could probably voice from their own standpoint, the result of the Convention's work is to be commended. What is significant, however, is that the Convention has presented the results of its work in a joint paper, which will be submitted to the summit without an alternative. The previous speakers, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch, have underlined the major progress achieved through the Convention's work, and I endorse their comments. From my perspective, we can indeed describe it as a milestone in the history of European integration, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank both of them particularly for their work in the delegation and their work in the Convention's Praesidium.</p>
<p class="contents">What is especially important, to my mind, is that democracy in Europe has been significantly enhanced, not only the rights of the European Parliament or the national parliaments, but above all, direct democracy and citizens' participation in the development of the European Union. The fact that we will have a citizens' initiative as a mechanism in future and that people can get directly involved in European politics is something I see as extremely important, especially in terms of developing a European public arena. I fully endorse this. I am in favour of holding a referendum on the Constitution in every Member State. I would like to point out to everyone that an initiative has been launched for this very purpose with more than 100 supporters in the Convention and I myself am a signatory to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in Part III, it will be possible to make further progress with European integration, especially in the social field and services of general interest, where we can link in with the work on Part I.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me follow on from Mr Hänsch's comment a moment ago. He said that the European Union is not a global power, but that it does have a global power's responsibility. I must say that I am very alarmed by what the EU Foreign Ministers have just agreed in Luxembourg: for the first time, the European Union is threatening the use of military force against countries which flout disarmament commitments and are involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Naturally, this is not targeted at the USA, which simply withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2001! It is not all that long since US Secretary of State Colin Powell painted a graphic picture to the Security Council of the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. That was followed by the war, and as you all know, weapons of mass destruction have still not been found. I am frightened by the fact that the EU Foreign Ministers are now following the same line of argument as Powell and apparently want to endorse the Bush doctrine. Admittedly, the declaration does state, by way of restriction, that the UN Security Council will play what is described as a key role in measures threatened by the EU, but this does not allay my fears. The declaration conflicts not only with international law but also with the Convention's draft Constitution!</p>
<p class="contents">Article 3 (4) commits the European Union to strict observance of international law and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter. We all know that threatening the use of military force to resolve conflicts is prohibited under international law. We cannot allow the Constitution to be undermined even before it enters into force!</p>

The Convention still has to meet and debate. I hoped to hear today from our representatives what they intend to do in this Convention, and I urge them strongly not to sit back and think that it is all over now, that nothing can be changed and that, what is more, we have won. We still have to do as much as we can now, before the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. Indeed, we know – as Mr Brok has said – that we will have to fight to avoid the governments, freed of the vociferous presence of the Members of Parliament and Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, being let loose on a Constitution which is currently uninspiring, not least in that it fails to live up to the expectations of the majority of the citizens or, I believe, the majority of the members of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with those who feel that the pseudo-Constitution we have today is the best we could have achieved, and I believe that it was a serious strategic error on the part of Mr Giscard-d’Estaing and the Praesidium to allow the Convention to be polluted from the outset by the intergovernmental method that it was trying to leave behind. Only during the final days of the Convention was it understood, at last, that submitting to the terms of the most sceptical governments could have caused the entire venture to fail, and the backing of national and European members of Parliament was sought, as well as the support of the much-maligned Commission, working together with the Presidents and the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Convention. Nevertheless, this measure was belated and ineffective, for it was not the fruit of months of work but improvised at the last minute. History is not made with ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’, but, given that it is not all over yet, we believe that these last few weeks must be used to further improve on the compromise reached, that we must learn from our errors and endeavour not to repeat them.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we will endeavour to exert as much pressure as possible as regards four issues which we consider to be extremely important. Firstly, it is absolutely essential to remove the unanimity obligation for the revision of the Constitution and give the European Parliament power of ratification. Mr Méndez de Vigo, my friend and fellow Member, we are not and will not be a constituent Parliament because, as things stand, not only will we not have the power to ratify the Constitution but we will not be consulted on<span class="bold"> </span>the convening of Intergovernmental Conferences either, as we are at the moment. Thus, we are in danger of losing powers in this area, not gaining them. Secondly, we must work hard to extend the role of the European Parliament in key sectors such as trade policy, cooperation in judicial and criminal matters and the drawing up of the Financial Perspective: the die is not yet irrevocably cast in this area. It is unthinkable that the European Union should continue to participate in major negotiations such as WTO negotiations without any supervision by the European and national parliaments. Thirdly, it is incomprehensible that, in the twenty-first century, after Chernobyl, after the majority of the current Members of the European Union have decided to stop using nuclear energy, there should be an explicit reference in the European Constitution to the promotion of nuclear energy. This is an error which could cost us dear in terms of public opinion, an error which we can still correct. Lastly, I do not believe that merely including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Part II of the Constitution has much significance for the citizens and legal residents of Europe without a corresponding, definite extension of the possibility of appeal to the Court of Justice, first and foremost in matters of judicial and criminal cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our programme for the period between now and the last Convention meeting, scheduled for 10 July. We are searching for support both within and outside the Convention, in the hope that the Chairman, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, and his Praesidium will be able to guide it towards a result which is still within their reach today. When the Intergovernmental Conference opens, it may well be too late.</p>

The hymn which was sung here would also have been sung in our countries. That, however, was not the case. The celebrations spread no further than the walls of this building; in other words, the current is still not flowing. That is a serious problem which, by all appearances, the Convention has not solved.</p>
<p class="contents">We want Europe to work better, but we do not think this is the way to go about it. Once again, the wrong method has been used, and we fear that this text may mark a return to the tensions and frustrations which prevailed in Amsterdam and Nice. We take issue with the desire to suppress all memory of the past, of history, of values intertwined with our roots. I am speaking specifically of the Christian <span class="italic">topos</span> inscribed and engraved all over our experience.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the Convention served to clarify our options and their consequences. It did not, however, serve as a pretext for hasty decision-making – far from it! Furthermore, a look at the Nice or Laeken agenda is instructive. Are the Treaties really going to be simplified? Can a Treaty containing more than 400 articles and at least five protocols represent a genuine attempt at simplification, or might there have been a failure there? What can one say, moreover, about the participation of the national parliaments, which have made few really significant advances in terms of their participation in European integration?</p>
<p class="contents">Laeken called for more democracy and transparency. Even the way the Convention works, however, is a bad example and a bad omen for the future: its functions are subordinate to the supreme whim of its President and to what I might dub consensocracy, a form of democracy without elections, where not a single vote has taken place. Laeken also asked the European Union to grow closer to its citizens. I am not sure this has happened. If the idea of doing away with the rotating presidency goes ahead, indeed, I am afraid that the Union will move much further away from its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What do I expect from governments, then? I expect them to take this responsibility to their citizens seriously as a basis for their work. I expect them to respect democracy and to listen, listen to their people. The people have a legitimate right to take decisions, since that right is bestowed on them democratically through the electoral process and legally through the Treaties.</p>

They limit politicians’ power between elections, referendums and constitutional changes. A constitution is the people’s protection against the politicians. The draft EU constitution has instead become the politicians’ protection against the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirteen out of 25 prime ministers, elected on a quite different basis, are at the centre of power. Six or seven of the 13 will be people who can no longer be elected in their own countries and who can share the power among themselves after each election to the European Parliament. They must have an eye to the election result, but they themselves decide if they have had enough of an eye to it. In that way, Mr Blair can become President, Mr Fischer Foreign Minister and Mr Aznar President or Vice-President of the Commission. It is five years’ consolation for all those who are finished in their own countries. EU leaders elect each other and are not accountable to the electorate. One of them must have a majority in the European Parliament, but Parliament cannot elect a second. If the Commission is elected, it can be overturned by a 2/3 majority, but Parliament still cannot elect a second one.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an historic paradox that you have to be a democracy in order to enter the EU, but that the EU is not itself a democracy. If the European Convention were to apply for EU membership on the basis of the present draft constitution, we should have to say that there were very fine objectives and values in Articles 2 and 3, but why have you forgotten democracy?

Yet it is difficult to see how the text proposed responds to the question in any way whatsoever. What is worse, it is clear to see that before long another treaty will be required to resolve the conflicts of power or clarify the obscure procedures the new text wishes to establish, for example in relation to the common foreign policy. However, above all, this text moves in completely the wrong direction. In order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, we need more real democracy. The Convention takes the approach of enhanced supranationality, in other words false democracy, by widely applying qualified majority voting and codecision, without any safety net for the national democracies as such, by establishing a European Constitution superior to the national Constitutions, and by transferring to the Union competences in the area of fundamental rights through the incorporation of the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">In these conclusions, I do not see anything that is going to bring Europe closer to its people, but I do see a great deal that is going to move it further away from them. In the wake of the new treaty, if it follows the Convention’s proposals, we will be in exactly the same situation as before, and the democracy, the understanding, the affection of the people as regards the Union will not have progressed one little bit. If we want to re-establish contact between Europe and its people, and I will say this once more, we must get rid of the feelings of remoteness and powerlessness the people feel in relation to Brussels. There is only one way to achieve this: we must once more allow the national democracies to play an active role in European decision-making, for instance by giving them the right to control subsidiarity or by counterbalancing the Community mechanisms through a right of veto or non-participation that should be granted to each national parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, all of the timid proposals in this direction have been systematically reduced to nothing by the Convention. One day they will have to be introduced once more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom, the UK Government representative, Peter Hain, has dismissed the document as a mere tidying-up exercise, and although the UK Government is wont to correct Mr Hain from time to time, on this occasion our Prime Minister has promoted him to Leader of the House of Commons, so we might imagine that he approves of that statement.</p>
<p class="contents">But we do not have to rely upon Mr Hain’s statement of some weeks ago: in the last 24 hours the British Foreign Secretary has given his judgment upon this Convention document. He has told people in the UK that there are no significant constitutional changes, that there is no significant change in the relationship between the EU and Member States, that the IGC will not be concluded until next year and that the UK will have a veto in relation to each and every decision. The document, he says, is a draft, and like any draft it is open to improvement and amendment. But now we are engaged in the hard bargaining, the last-minute agreements reached by democratically elected Heads of State, and the Treaty must ultimately have the unanimous support of all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall just refer to a few areas: on foreign and defence policy, he says that a guarantee has been won, and that even if such proposals are put forward in relation to common and defence policies, ‘we will oppose them and we will have a veto’. On the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Foreign Secretary said in the last 24 hours that ‘the net effect of our proposals will ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not in any way extend the Union’s competence or powers’. Finally, in relation to economic matters he says ‘we do not support the existing text of Article 13, we do not support tax harmonisation, we have a unanimity lock on these proposals through the use of a veto.’</p>
<p class="contents">That is the message that people are getting in the United Kingdom. It is not surprising in the context of this contrast that 88% of people in the United Kingdom in a massive recent poll indicated that they wanted to have a say in a referendum on these proposals. I am delighted to see that Mr Watson, somewhat late in the day, has started reading the Daily Mail and has now concluded that is a call that he personally should support as well. I look forward to seeing his press release, although I am bound to say I do not think his remarks today about qualified majority voting on foreign policy, and national parliaments having no say in relation to ratification, will be any part of what appears in the UK.</p>

The committee of which I am Chairman, and Parliament in general, were strongly in favour of the Convention and advocated the drawing up of a European Constitution. Work has begun on the Constitution. The Convention has succeeded in fulfilling its task, and this gives us great satisfaction. When we are called upon shortly to express our opinion on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference, as the current Treaty lays down, we will assess the draft adopted by the Convention as well. We will be in an even better position to do so when we have seen the text – which needs further improvement, as Mr Brok and other Members have said – of Parts III and IV of the draft.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as this deep satisfaction, we would like to express our appreciation of, and gratitude to, our representatives for their endeavours in the Convention and, in particular, in the Praesidium, to uphold the positions of the European Parliament. Of course, the draft adopted by consensus represents common ground between different positions: some of our representatives’ proposals met with substantial resistance, echoes of which were heard in this Chamber just now.</p>
<p class="contents">Our opinion must, therefore, be neither triumphalistic nor dogmatic, and it must not fail to express our concern, particularly on two points. Firstly, the risk of a change in the institutional balance of powers due to the creation of a new position at the top of the Union, the position of full-time President of the European Council. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs declared itself to be fully against this, proposing alternative or compromise solutions, but they were not accepted. Secondly, the possibility that the unanimity obligation would obstruct the decision-making process in key fields in a 25-Member State Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to go further: on this and other matters, we are determined to prevent regression in respect of the Convention’s conclusions. We must, however, look closely at the unknowns which will affect the future of the Union. Maintaining a critical attitude and ongoing vigilance does not mean being destructive or pessimistic but serves to give fresh impetus to the process of integration and European unity. Altiero Spinello taught us that: without his criticism of the Single Act, the progress made at Maastricht and Amsterdam would not have been achieved.</p>

That is true, but it does more than that. Mr Straw and Mr Hain are profoundly wrong. It is a settlement that entrenches what is truly important, it discards what is not, and strengthens the capacity of the Union to act effectively abroad and inside the Member States. It ensures that the citizen will not be abused from the greater power that is to be exercised at the federal level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council should accept the proposals, without qualification, as the basis for an agreement at the IGC. At Thessaloniki we should not see this pirouetting around a convoluted formula designed to deceive. Were the IGC to seek to open up the package, it is certain that the results will be inferior. What the 15 were unable to agree at Nice will certainly be impossible for 25 to agree at the future IGC. The leaders at Thessaloniki must listen to the voice of consensus as expressed through the Convention and through this Parliament, and build the future of Europe with courage.</p>

The Convention has produced one: it approved the draft version based on a federalist consensus in a way reminiscent of a Politburo-style dictatorship. Once again it is a matter of a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> on the part of the big countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Qualified majority decisions take away small countries’ right of veto, which, however, the three big countries still have when acting in concert. The Member States are to lose their permanent voting Commissioner, although the right of initiative with regard to all EU legislation will remain a Commission monopoly. The fact that there is to be a president and that foreign policy will not be in the hands of the Commission will make the EU a more decentralised federation than the federalist European Parliament’s delegation would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">With the constitution the EU will be militarised and NATO has been written into it. When the other pillars were toppled a new NATO pillar was erected. The non-aligned countries must not sign the declaration regarding collective security guarantees to be annexed to the constitution.

However, this should be seen as one step in the process, not the end of the process, because we must move on to an Intergovernmental Conference , we must get the approval of the 25 governments and there will be changes within that process.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important issues to come out of the Convention discussions has been the reiteration of the doctrine of conferral. In fact, for the first time, specific mention was made of that doctrine whereby the Union can only operate on the powers conferred upon it by the Member States. Those powers are clearly delineated between the institutions and the Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, some Members have referred to this as the 'constitution' of Europe. A constitution by its very nature requires and needs the endorsement of the people. Therefore I join with other colleagues in appealing to all Member States not only to comply with their own constitutional obligations, but actually to put this forward to a referendum of the people within the Member States to give it the kind of endorsement and approval that it requires.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the question regarding institutional balance is fair and maintains the equity and equality between the Member States. We should not forget that the European Union and its institutions were unique in building the foundations for a unique situation and we can continue that evolution of unique institutions for the future development of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it will also have fully justified the judgment of a French philosopher who spoke of a Europe obsessed with its powers but indifferent to the results it achieves.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the draft Treaty, the so-called constitutional Treaty, that the Convention has produced in no way responds to the Laeken mandate. It does not respond to it as regards democracy since the Convention has organised a Europe that has no contact with the outside world, where various elements have slightly changed place. Parliament cannot actually complain about the progress made, but it is very far from what we call democracy, in other words the direct participation of the people in the decisions that affect them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not talk about foreign policy, where we have very clearly been sold a lemon given that 18 out of 25 European countries have no desire for a European policy as such in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate what Mr Crowley said: if it is a Constitution, it must be put to a referendum, and if it is not put to a referendum by the people of Europe, it will not be a Constitution, because none of the citizens will feel committed to or protected by it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I understand that you are going to Thessaloniki tomorrow or the day after. Perhaps our Parliament should vote on a resolution that would, I believe, bring together a broad range of all of the viewpoints represented here in order to send a strong message to the Council and to the countries that this text should be put to a referendum of the people of Europe when the time comes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am afraid that that is the price of intense activity which was certainly difficult and, at times, even ineffective, tending moreover towards the lowest common denominator and, therefore, of necessity beset by continual negotiation. Every little change to the system is deferred until 2007 or 2009, and I really do wonder what our citizens will think when they are called upon to ratify its content. What we feel was missing, Mr President, and is likely to continue to be missing is a vision from a global perspective of the imperative need to make determined, innovative changes to the functioning and competences of a genuine United States of Europe.

For the first time in history, we have succeeded in reconciling sovereignty with the protection of rights, leaving behind the concept of <span class="italic">demos</span> we have known and launching Europe towards future horizons whose limits will be for us alone to decide. Of course, there may well be a few minor flaws but, seeing as the preamble contained an extensive discourse with reference, not least, to Thucydides, I would like to draw the House’s attention to the principle of the ancient Greek philosophers: history is never completely flawless because, if it were, it would not be perpetuated.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not comment on the text of the Treaty but limit myself to one warning and one regret. One point on which we as Parliament must take care is the requirement of unanimity in decision-making. We have achieved a text which, without a doubt, launches the Community method and spirit towards new horizons and, given that the Constitutional Treaty with its many facets is a key card for us to play if we are to achieve greater European competitiveness, the requirement of unanimous decision-making in a 15-Member State Europe – as we have seen – has already, at many sensitive times and in many sensitive cases, created difficult, not to say impossible situations. Well then, opting to preserve unanimity in a 25-Member State Union may have very serious consequences, especially if the decisions hinge on economic or tax proposals. I fear that if we were to take the option of establishing a right of veto, which is still on the cards, we would ultimately be shooting ourselves in the foot, for this would ultimately reduce the European area – which is, in fact, the largest or one of the largest common markets in the world – to a mere collection of national interests. We must take care to avoid this.</p>
<p class="contents">The regret is that I listened, with some surprise, to the debate held on the preamble to decide whether our religious, or rather Christian, heritage should be included among the factors making up our common identity. I would point out that the identity of Europe has been wrought from an experience of painful emancipation that has not, in our history, been free of tragic events, although they have, in any case, always led to liberation and growth. I feel that, from a spiritual point of view, this is one of the elements which contribute to the greatness of Christianity and make it a universal point of reference. I would like there to be further debate on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Success has been achieved in the main aim of broadening the EU debate and bringing the negotiations out from behind the closed doors of dusty meeting rooms. We who had hoped, however, that the EU would fully move on from the stage of being a technocratic union and become a genuine democracy based upon a common European debate have reason to be somewhat disappointed. There are too many ground rules and too many exceptions to the norms. I nonetheless hope that this outcome will lead to a strengthening of the EU’s competitiveness, something that is crucial. The next Convention must take up the loose threads that have been left dangling. Anyone who wants to see what this Convention really entails must read between the lines in analysing the outcome. Among the issues that will be on the table for the next Convention are foreign policy – a clear example of a loose thread – as well as merging the jobs of the two executive presidents into one and continuing to develop the Council into a second chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">This constitutional treaty is really not the EU’s last treaty change. The Charter of Fundamental Rights, devised at the time of the last treaty change, was not introduced then but has been incorporated now. That is the way the EU process operates. Exceptions to the normal decision-taking model in this Convention must be taken care of at the next Convention. The trend is nonetheless in the right direction, so the compromise must remain in place. Influence on the part of the people has, in spite of everything, been significantly strengthened. This may get to increase, but it may never ever decrease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, the text of the Convention, which was set up and operated utterly anti-democratically by muzzling every voice on the left, does not crystallise the democratic rights won by the people. On the contrary, it diminishes them.</p>
<p class="contents">The declaration of faith in an exceptionally competitive social (!) market economy also sets capitalism on a constitutional basis. The abolition of the revolving presidency, the composition of the Commission, the cutback in unanimous decision-making and the definition of the qualified majority show that this is about redistributing power for the benefit of the strong and handing over more national sovereignty to the imperialist, Euro-unifying centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Militarisation is being dangerously deepened within the framework of the common defence policy which, of course, respects the obligations which derive from the North Atlantic Treaty. Terrorism is being used as a pretext for creating preconditions for new military interventions against the peoples of the whole world (without forgetting the 'enemy within') and a special role is being reserved for Member States with high military capabilities. It is no coincidence that the only minister is for foreign affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that the peoples will not be deceived. Opposition to capitalism is growing, both inside and outside the ΕU. The grass-roots fight will strengthen as the anti-grass roots policy intensifies and will pull down the edifice being so carefully erected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is, however, that this is not quite the case in terms either of the Convention’s procedures or of its membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention did not include representatives of all political parties, only the larger ones. From the Assembly of the Republic (the Portuguese parliament), the Socialist Party (PS) and Social Democratic Party (PSD) participated in the Convention. The positions of these parties are identical to those which dominate Community policy, insofar as they defend federalism and neo-liberalism. Other political groupings, critical to a greater or lesser degree of such models and approaches, were excluded. That makes it clear what kind of democracy is being upheld here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Convention has no constituent powers and cannot alter the Treaties, although that is what extreme federalists would like. The latter believe that a few dozen people, far from their countries and the problems and rights of their peoples, may be more easily swayed by the interests of economic and financial elites in the powerful countries which dream of ruling Europe. Only the Intergovernmental Conference and the national parliaments, however, will be able to alter the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the results of the Convention do not exactly coincide with its stated aim of paving the way for ever-deeper integration. The plan – albeit a dangerous one – is to take shorter strides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
