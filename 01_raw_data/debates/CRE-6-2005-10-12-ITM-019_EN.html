<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguel Portas (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who helped to put together this report. Their amendments enabled the text to reach plenary with a clear majority in the Committee on Culture and Education.</p>
<p class="contents">A further comment before I start: education policies fall under the exclusive responsibility of the Member States. This was not my decision but is enshrined in the Treaties currently in force. In any event, it is possible within the current rules to do more and much better to aid the integration of immigrant communities through our education systems. This is the purpose of the report before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, migratory flows, from both within and outside the Community, cannot be stopped, even if politicians would like it that way. Migration has in recent decades created new challenges in terms of identity. The worse the living conditions of the new communities and the poorer their level of integration, the harder it will be for them to overcome those challenges. What is more, unemployment in Europe has given rise to a feeling of insecurity among Muslim communities. There is little need to explain that the number of immigrants does not affect unemployment rates and that it is the immigrants who carry out the building work in which our nations take pride.</p>
<p class="contents">In a context of spiralling war and terrorism, considered, rational debate loses its teeth. We are living in times of demagogy, populism and fundamentalism, and it is, accordingly, the job of Europe and the Member States to pursue policies aimed at integration. Such policies are the only valid alternative to ghettoisation, on the one hand, and to attempts, on the other, at the forced assimilation of communities whose behaviour and customs differ from those in the host country.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in this report are thus based on a simple idea: everyone who lives in our societies – irrespective of colour, sex, language, creed or legal status – has the right to an education, a policy recognised in the corpus of decisions taken by the European institutions. Schooling systems are required to ensure that immigrants and their children learn not only the language of the host country but also their mother tongues. In 1977, a directive established this right for immigrants from within the Community. The time has now come to extend that right to communities arriving from other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall now turn to good practice. The children of some Members of this House study in European schools created by the Union to facilitate the integration of its employees. The accent in these schools is placed on integrated learning of languages and content; the pupils think and study in both the language of the host country and their mother tongue. I believe that everyone is proud of this multilingual education, which prepares our children to approach the future without fear. This is the way it should be. Yet what we want for our children must not be a luxury for privileged immigrants, but, rather, the norm across the board for Europe’s education systems.</p>
<p class="contents">On a visit to Hamburg I was able to see how this system has been successfully applied to state schools. Nine primary schools have classes in which German children mix with children who have a different mother tongue. The teaching is conducted in both languages with two teachers per class. Five years on, immigrant parents make strenuous efforts to get their children into those classes, even if they live on the other side of the city. Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Polish and Turkish people have enjoyed the benefits of this pilot project, and it is bearing fruit. Although this teaching project cannot be implemented right across the board, and is not the last word in multilingual education, it does point the way forward. It is this view to the future that forms the basis of my report.</p>
<p class="contents">The third important proposal in this report is the creation of a European network of schools to which integrated language and content learning projects can apply to join. The problem is that bilateral agreements between Member States have to battle against swingeing budget cuts and even major shortages of political will. Providing for a budgetary appropriation in the ‘lifelong learning’ programme, specifically geared towards boosting the network, will stimulate interest and give added impetus to multilingual-based education. This is the least we can do! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in Europe has changed substantially since the adoption of the last directive on the education of children of migrant workers in 1977. Since then, the number of migrant workers and the range of languages spoken by migrants in the Union have increased considerably, and the Union itself has increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the assumption that migrants and their children would return to their countries of origin is no longer valid. Migrants stay in the host countries. The teaching needs of migrant children are different and more complex, now covering second and third generations. Europe has become a truly multilingual area and it is in this context that we must promote languages and language learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Portas’ report gives me the opportunity to provide you with some information on what we are already doing and what we intend to do in the future. Firstly, the work programme on the objectives of education and training systems in Europe sets concrete goals. In this context, the general objective of improving active citizenship, equal opportunities and social cohesion covers issues such as the access of immigrants and their children to education and training.</p>
<p class="contents">Three of the five EU benchmarks are particularly relevant in this context with regard to immigrant populations. The first is to reduce the number of early school leavers; the second is to increase education attainment levels, and the last benchmark in relation to migrants is to reduce the number of low achievers in reading literacy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also implementing the ‘Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity’ Action Plan, which was adopted in 2003. Let me recall its key underlining principles. First, language learning is a lifelong activity and should be extended to all citizens. Everybody should learn their mother tongue plus two other languages from an early age. Second, a range of languages should be available, including migrant languages. Third, parents and teaching staff need better information on the benefits of early foreign language learning. Fourth, content and language-integrated learning, in which pupils learn a subject in a foreign language, has a major contribution to make to the Union’s language learning goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community programme, in particular the Comenius, Grundtvig and Lingua actions of the Socrates programme, provide support to a wide range of projects, from class and teacher exchanges to the development and dissemination of teaching methodologies. The future integrated lifelong learning programme will bring new opportunities. Promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a specific objective of the future new programme. Transversal action will support networks in the field of language learning and linguistic diversity. The European network of schools, which is mentioned in Mr Portas’ report, could be very well supported by the programme. Funding could be made available on a multiannual basis, which would ensure stability and continuity of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Culture 2000 Programme encourages intercultural dialogue and exchanges between European and non-European cultures. This dimension will be further reinforced in the Culture 2007 Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two initiatives in the cultural field which are in line with the report. First, last week I proposed, and the Commission adopted, a proposal to declare 2008 the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. I hope to submit to the College before the end of the year a new approach for multilingualism, the first policy paper on multilingualism in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me thank Mr Portas again for his inspiring report and ideas, which I will look at carefully with my colleagues. I therefore look forward to our forthcoming discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Schools and language acquisition have an important part to play in successful integration, and it is, in this respect, important to recall the role played by schools and language-learning in the lives of people generally, and in the lives of children in particular. They have a significant effect on a person’s intellectual development, on their development of an understanding of themselves and others, and on their success in becoming members of the community. This applies particularly in the case of people of immigrant background, who have, so to speak, a dual social and cultural identity – that of their country of origin and mother tongue, and the culture and language – or languages, in the case of Belgium – of the new home to which they have come.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Portas’s report has struck a happy medium in that, on the one hand, it stresses the right of every person and every child to general education, which of course has to include the learning of the host country’s language. On the other hand, though, it also emphasises these children’s right to learn their own mother tongue, and in doing so it is in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which stipulates both the right to education and training and the right to one’s own cultural, religious and linguistic identity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must promote the various educational methods that guarantee language acquisition, and the Commissioner did indeed make reference to some of the things that have already, and laudably, been done. The EU can make this possible. It can deploy political and administrative resources and funding to foster such things as the evaluation of experience derived from language teaching, the exchange of experience and the formation of networks for schools in which the use of multilingualism as an aid to integration is a matter of day-to-day practice.</p>
<p class="contents">With those things in mind and also in my capacity as rapporteur for lifelong learning – to which reference has been made over and over again today – I give the report my backing. I, too, regard school education and language acquisition as my political priorities – and they are, indeed, given priority by the Comenius programme in particular. Our shared objective must be to overcome barriers and to foster the gaining of experience in the learning of languages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If both linguistic diversity and migration coincide, then the European Parliament has to have something to say about it, and for that reason I am grateful to Mr Portas for taking the initiative in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many ways to integrate, and language and the promotion of it are the gate that leads to all of them. Experts in languages tell us that the learning of both the mother tongue and the national language need to be promoted if people are to integrate and develop their own personalities, and I agree with them. Progress at school is an important element in integration, and that too is dependent not only on the acquisition of the country’s language, but also on developing knowledge of the mother tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">Action is needed, though, if this is to happen, and it will need to include such things as targeted teaching materials, staff with inter-cultural skills and, ideally, teaching staff who originate from the host country but have knowledge of the languages of the nations most represented among immigrants. Not least, the children’s legal guardians – by which I mean their parents above all – must play their part. I would observe that it is very important that women in general and mothers in particular should take part in these integration and education projects, for they are best able to communicate with their children and thereby help their own integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The absolute priority, though, both for the children and their parents, if their social and economic integration is to benefit, is the learning of the host country’s language. Something else that would play an important part would be a European Internet portal, a sort of ‘think tank’ or a network of experts, through which examples of best practice could be passed on, enabling many people to learn from one another over the Internet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States should therefore support any measure to safeguard linguistic diversity and limit the technical difficulties which prevent the achievement of the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The education systems should ensure that all pupils learn foreign languages because the objective of the European Union is and always has been a real multilingual European society.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the aim of action by the institutions within this framework is to guarantee equal education rights to children who speak a different language in their family environment. Any policy which helps wipe out all forms of discrimination is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Multilingualism, therefore, has two dimensions. On the one hand, it has a functional role as the tool in achieving communication between people of different origins. On the other hand, it is an important means for shaping a European identity. Moreover, learning and speaking other languages, in addition to our mother tongue, encourages us to be more open towards others, to their cultural values and to their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Multilingualism creates new prospects. It is, without doubt, an important factor in promoting social integration and encouraging sociability in the European Union. In addition, we must not forget that it helps to create a real unified European labour market, offering citizens the possibility to make full use of the right to live, work and study in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It should therefore be our objective to shape a society in which the percentage of multilingual citizens, as a factor for unifying society as a whole, increases steadily. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report achieved universal acceptance during the discussions in our committee and Mr Portas received our congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of immigrants' children of school age living in our countries must be extended from learning the host language to learning their mother tongue and to access to the culture of their country of origin. Learning a mother tongue should not, however, be at the expense of the language of the host country, which must remain the main teaching language.</p>
<p class="contents">The multilingualism safeguarded by the Union as a means of dialogue between cultures thus takes on a new integration dimension. It strengthens cross-culturalism as a new approach in education, it further safeguards multiculturalism as a particular identity of the European area and it highlights preferential development potential for our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent decades, most immigration in Europe has been internal, by which I mean people in Europe have been moving within its borders. These movements have changed the cultural map definitively in numerous countries. In Greece, for example, the permanent foreign population accounts for 10% of the total population. Greece has changed from a country from which people emigrate to a host country for immigrants, most of whom are of productive age. They have children of school age and have come to our country to stay.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we cannot overlook the fact that, when countries expand with different nationalities, xenophobia and racist reactions against people increase worryingly. All this reality transfers to schools, which act as the mirror of a society. Until very recently, our education systems functioned on the basis of an assimilating approach, under which the presence in school of immigrant children with a different linguistic and cultural expression from the official language and culture was approached as a problem which had to be sidelined.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Greece adopted a law back in 1996 introducing cross-cultural education as a basic element of its education system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I shall try to speak in French. I am not doing so in order to show off, but because the debate relates to the integration of immigrants through multilingual schools and education. ‘The integration of immigrants’ is normal, it is a good thing; ‘through multilingual schools and education’ is a very good thing. </p>
<p class="contents">Do we really learn foreign languages in our schools? Well, in England we certainly do not. Because the way we teach foreign languages in England is the way we learned Latin and Greek: we are very good at grammar, we are very good at literature: </p>

<p class="contents">That is Racine. I could say that aged 18. Could I buy a ticket on the metro? No!</p>
<p class="contents">So how do we integrate immigrants? There is a problem with the word ‘immigrant’. If you look at the history of my country, it was described as an English historian as a history of immigrants – rather shocking. This is not a history lesson, but only two Princesses of Wales were English women: Lady Diana Spencer and Anne Neville. Anne Neville married Edward of Lancaster, the only English king to be crowned King of France in France. I have no time to explain further.</p>

<p class="contents">Free movement and freedom of establishment in the European Union are one of the basic freedoms of its citizens. The redistribution and proper deployment of manpower in quality jobs is a strategic tactic in achieving the objectives for 2010. Together with adults, a large proportion of young people in Europe move and re-establish elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">A multilingual education and the provision of quality basic and lifelong education to these categories of European citizens, together with immigrants, are their basic right as well as an investment for every state and for the European Union as a whole. However, there is an urgent cultural need to maintain European diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations, therefore, to the Committee on Culture and Education and to Mr Portas on this own initiative report. I hope, as you said Commissioner, that the positive points of the report will help the Commission to reformulate and update Directive 77/486.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to highlight three additional points:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, respect for the jurisdiction of the Member States for the content of teaching and the organisation of their education systems in accordance with Article 149.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the promotion among immigrants of the learning of and maintenance of the ability to use their mother tongue, initially the European and then all the other languages, by their country of origin, in agreement of course with the host country.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the coordinated offer and controlled use by the Member States of the numerous programmes which you referred to and of funding mechanisms, under the supervision of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want also to thank you for the discussion confirming that multilingualism is important both from the aspect of migration and from the aspect of European integration, whether we consider it in its wider or its narrower meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say only that we have a sufficient number of good examples demonstrating how this issue can be developed positively. Let me mention just two of them. Fresh surveys were published this September in connection with European Language Day on 26 September. According to the surveys, half the population of the Union can speak one foreign language. This is a decent number, and one that continues to rise, although it needs to be said that there are countries where the percentage of the population capable of communicating in a foreign language is close to 90%. We also have a group of countries where only around 30% of the population can communicate in a foreign language. There is a 1 + 2 model (mother tongue + 2 foreign languages) – but on average, in today’s European education system, it is approximately 1.5, that is, 1 + 1.5. There are, however, also countries among the EU-25 where pupils learn more than two foreign languages, that is, 1 + more than 2, and other countries where they learn one foreign language or less. It is a challenge for the Member States to achieve much more in this area, because there are also implications for employment, mobility, personal and mental development and, naturally, for tolerance, as well as the ability to understand different cultures and live in a multicultural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that the European Commission is to facilitate a website on the European portal that should serve just the purpose mentioned by Christa Prets – for language teaching and linguistic diversity. Thank you very much for your support and your discussions; my special thanks go to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
