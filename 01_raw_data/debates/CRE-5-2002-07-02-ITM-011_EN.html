Priority is given to human and animal health. But the most important criterion must be that this framework legislation is practicable. More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe with excessive red tape. We need, first and foremost, a practicable regulation on the accidental and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in products which are not genetically modified. The threshold value of 1% in the Commission proposal is reasonable and realistic and a useful guide for manufacturers and consumers. The threshold value is important if various forms of cultivation are to exist side by side because cross-pollination, for example, is technically impossible to preclude in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point is that only products which are scientifically proven to contain GMOs should be labelled; it makes no sense to label ingredients extracted from genetically modified plants, such as oil, sugar or flavour enhancers, when there are no GMOs in the final product. Nor should we label meat, eggs or milk from animals fed with GM feed at any point, because this is misleading for consumers. I am in favour of product-based labelling and expressly opposed to process-based labelling because it is technically impossible to control. We should only label where we have proof and can therefore control labelling requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Most people in Europe are against the use of modern biotechnology outside the laboratory, but there are varying shades of opinion. Surveys have shown that most people feel they have too little information to make a clear judgment. Around 86% of those surveyed in the European Union said that they would like to know more before eating genetically modified food. Researchers concluded from their results that there is a market for genetically modified food in Europe, provided it offers clear advantages. However, consumer freedom of choice is paramount. Consumers want to be able to decide freely between GM products and conventional products.</p>
<p class="contents">We have debated the new labelling directives most intensively today. As far as I can see, we should only label products where we have proof and can control labelling requirements. If the presence of genetically engineered changes in the product itself cannot be proven, as in the case of meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on genetically modified feed, then I think there should be no labelling requirement. And another very important point for me: I do not like the idea of incalculable liability risks for companies, which is why practicable limit values are essential. I would therefore advocate a single limit value of 1%. The Commission points out in its working paper that zero tolerance is impossible in practice; several of my fellow Members have repeatedly addressed the imponderables of nature and I have nothing new to add to what they have already said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for the enormous amount of work they have done on an extremely difficult, complex subject, but I have to say that there are elements of the two reports which give some cause for concern, such as, for example, the arbitrary lowering of the tolerance threshold for the adventitious presence of genetically modified materials, previously set at 1%, to 0.5%. We feel that this complicates the authorisation procedure unnecessarily without providing greater security or other benefits for the consumer. Then another point which gives cause for concern is the lack of adequate measures in respect of the accidental presence of traces of genetically modified products.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about the concept of ‘adventitious presence’, a concept which is used to indicate the unintended presence of small quantities of a specific atypical material in another material. Well then, in the field of agriculture – and here, as always, agriculture is a sector requiring special consideration – the adventitious presence of traces of other varieties in crops, plants or propagation materials can occur at any stage of sowing, harvesting, transport or distribution. In some cases, this adventitious presence could even be the result of an exchange of pollen between crop varieties in adjoining fields.</p>

I think you have delivered a very ambitious paper and a good basis for discussion with Parliament. But just think: if all your proposals are accepted, 70-80% of all foods already on the market would have to be labelled. So we could say, in the words of our great pioneering Socialist thinker Mr Bowe, alright, perhaps it would have been a brighter idea to turn the whole thing on its head and only label positively? My congratulations to Mr Bowe on his superb and frank speech.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are giving consumers to believe, of course, is that, when they finally find something among the rows and rows of labelled products which does not have a GMO label, these remaining products are completely clean. But consumers do not know that and perhaps they should not know that. They will have a hard time of it in any case, because things are about to get worse. One per cent? It might still have something in it. We are already in a Dutch auction: 0.5%, 0.1% for Mrs Gebhardt. Why not 0.01%? Our resident scientist Mr Trakatellis says that, in a few years' time, we shall have proof for everything. In the end we shall reach a point where 99% of all food is labelled. And what is the poor consumer supposed to do? What is the consumer supposed to make of all this? It is a pretty poor show on our part to say to the consumer that this 1% does not need to be labelled, unless the company has acted maliciously and did not label intentionally or cannot submit the evidence. What does the consumer care about that? Does it make it healthier or less healthy for the consumer if the company can or cannot submit the evidence? The whole thing is a farce! It is such a comedy that I really do understand when consumers – and I too am a consumer – wonder what the politicians will dream up next.</p>
<p class="contents">My dear Commissioners, my confidence in you knows no bounds. The Commission proposed in the White Paper on food safety on 12 January 2000 that it would submit a regulation on labelling GM-free food and that would be a wonderful, rounded addition to your proposal. Luckily the Liberals have included it in a proposed amendment. We in Austria have taken this wonderful Austrian way forward. I am not suggesting that you proceed <span class="italic">à l'autrichienne</span>, Commissioner, although you are always more than welcome to come walking in the Austrian mountains with us. But there is still time between now and the second reading to take the proper way forward and include positive labelling. Then, my dear Commissioners, we will be very definitely satisfied with your proposal. I have every confidence in you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all agreed on that and we would do so at once. Today's debate is about labelling, about traceability; consumer information is the ultimate objective, together with freedom of choice, and we are all in favour of that. Consumers must be able to decide what they put on the table for themselves and for that we need labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">A whole series of genetically modified organisms has already been evaluated by scientific committees in the European Union. They found that these substances pose no threat to health or the environment. Nonetheless, information is important in the food sector and will, we think, help make the use of genetic engineering more widely accepted. Under the Commission proposal, GMOs will be labelled above a limit value of 1%. Following an amendment adopted in committee, which the European People's Party and the European Democrats voted against, this threshold will now be reduced to 0.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">All our demands must be made with one eye on the practicability and implementation of the regulations. This also raises the question of whether accidental contamination can be avoided completely. Experience has shown that zero tolerance can almost never be guaranteed. And there is a real problem, to repeat what the honourable Member just said, with the requirement to label all meat products, eggs and milk from animals fed on GMOs or feed containing GMOs. If the end product contains no DNA or genetically modified protein, there is no point in attaching a GMO label to it. At the end of the day, we can only label what is actually there. Is there a farmer who puts his animals out to pasture who can guarantee that they have not ingested wind-borne GMOs? This, together with the minuscule amounts in feed, would mean that, in the end, all meat would have to carry a GMO label. And that would be an untenable situation both for Europe's farmers and for consumers. For consumers because they would have to process meaningless information and for farmers because, technically, it is a non-starter. It is also unacceptable because, at the end of the day, we cannot hold farmers responsible for introducing and spreading GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commissioner.</span> <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Madam President, honourable Members, I would first like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele, but I would also like to extend my thanks for a lively and interesting debate. The proposals we are discussing today are linked to many important and general issues. The public is very concerned over the handling of genetically modified organisms. It is our responsibility as legislators to ensure that consumers’ health and safety are guaranteed and that the environment and biodiversity are protected. In addition, we must ensure that our citizens have the opportunity to choose for themselves what they want to consume on the basis of reliable information. Therefore, the marketing of genetically modified products must be regulated in a way which allows us to achieve a high level of safety, control and reliability.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 2001/18/EC, the EU Novel Food Regulation and the proposal on genetically modified food and feed have all been developed on the basis of these requirements. Authorisation to place genetically modified products on the market must therefore, in accordance with this legislation and in accordance with the precautionary principle, provide a high level of protection for public health and the environment. The EU system includes the requirement for a comprehensive risk assessment before placing on the market. Traceability makes it easier to implement measures after a product has been placed on the market, for example in terms of monitoring the product or recalling it. It also makes it easier to supply correct information to all the players in the whole production and distribution chain.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal states that genetically modified products are to be monitored at all the stages of placing on the market. It also dictates that products containing genetically modified organisms must be labelled at all the stages of placing on the market. The ultimate aim is for such information to provide consumers and the general public with the opportunity to make their own choices. We believe these measures are an important step on the road to re-establishing consumer and public confidence. The proposal lays down a number of unequivocal responsibilities for operators, without this leading to unnecessary or unreasonable burdens being placed on operators or supervisory authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of important issues have been addressed in the amendments put forward by the European Parliament, including the scope of the proposal. The issue of whether products manufactured from animals fed on genetically modified feed are to be covered by the proposal will be addressed in more detail by my colleague, Mr Byrne. However, I would like to state that the Commission considered this issue very carefully in conjunction with drawing up the proposal. After many discussions and consultations, we decided that it would be impossible to implement and would not be in keeping with current Community law. Therefore, the Commission cannot support amendments of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a number of amendments aimed at restricting the Commission’s proposal. These amendments restrict the traceability requirements to products demonstrably containing DNA and proteins. This would allow relevant labelling of products which have been produced from genetically modified organisms but which no longer contain modified DNA or protein. However, this approach involves a number of restrictions highlighted in the course of our preparatory work. The most important objection is that it would not ensure consumers’ ability to make an informed choice. As such, the Commission cannot accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the purpose, it is important to remember that although traceability makes it easier to implement any necessary safety measures, it cannot be considered a safety measure in itself. Therefore, the precautionary principle may be applied to legislation concerning authorisation based on risk assessment, but not to the implementation of a traceability system within the framework of this proposal. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 2 and 6 which link the precautionary principle to the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that traceability is not a tool for dealing with the issue of co-existence. In the communication on a European strategy for life sciences and biotechnology adopted in January of this year, the Commission undertook to address the issue of co-existence between organic, conventional and genetically modified crops. This proposal only deals with the issue of traceability and labelling for genetically modified organisms. Such traceability and labelling cannot function as an instrument for dealing with co-existence, as this issue requires decisions regarding agricultural production systems. Therefore, the Commission cannot accept the amendments concerning this issue – Amendment No 27 in its entirety and Amendment No 3 in part.</p>
<p class="contents">There are further amendments regarding the traceability requirements. With regard to the information to be forwarded to guarantee traceability, it is important to remember that the purpose of traceability for genetically modified organisms is different to that for products manufactured from genetically modified organisms. It is important to be able to identify genetically modified organisms which are to be deliberately planted out in the environment for cultivation, as such products contain viable genetically modified organisms which may multiply and spread. The proposal therefore requires operators to be able to state exactly which genetically modified organisms are present in the products, as well as to forward this information to the operator receiving the products. The potential risks to the environment from products containing genetically modified organisms intended for direct use in food, feed or processing are, however, limited, as these organisms will not be cultivated.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission believes it to be both appropriate and sufficient that products containing genetically modified organisms for food, feed or processing, including in bulk shipments, should be accompanied by documentation stating the fact, along with a list of the unique codes for the genetically modified organisms which may conceivably be included in the product or the shipment. These provisions on the supply of information agree with the provisions on transboundary movement in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Commission believes that we should not go further than the provisions in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in order to be able to guarantee harmonised and cohesive procedures in trade with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 16 and 41 which require operators to state exactly which genetically modified organisms are contained in a shipment by stating their unique codes. The Commission also believes that the period for which there should be a requirement to keep information and documentation for the purposes of traceability should be limited to five years. There are no practical reasons for extending this period from five to ten years. This would lead to unnecessary extra burdens on operators. The Commission cannot therefore accept the changes aimed at extending this time period to ten years, i.e. Amendments Nos 17 and 22.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the European Parliament that the provisions in this proposal are in line with those in Directive 2001/18/EC and do not limit them in any way. In this context, it is necessary to repeal Article 4.6 of the directive stating that the Member States shall take measures to ensure traceability at all stages of the placing on the market of GMOs. If Article 4.6 is not repealed, it is clear that national measures could run in parallel to the measures covered by the proposal, which would disturb the internal market and lead to legal uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 28 and 33, as they retain the traceability requirements in the directive. In the same way, the Commission rejects Amendment No 32, which entails new authorisations being forbidden until unique codes are allocated to genetically modified organisms in line with this proposal. The current Community framework for authorisation already includes a number of conditions for authorising genetically modified organisms and genetically modified food, such as the condition that they must not have damaging effects on public health or the environment. If the existing authorisation criteria are expanded to include the unique codes, as proposed, an element of uncertainty would arise regarding how Community law should be implemented, something which the Commission cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a few words on unintentional occurrence and threshold values. One important issue is the unintentional but technically unavoidable occurrence of genetically modified material in conventional products. Genetically modified crops are currently being grown on over 50 million hectares of land around the world. This means that genetically modified material unintentionally and unavoidably occurs in imported products, particularly bulk shipments of grain for food, feed and processing. This is now a practically unavoidable fact. A continued freeze on authorisation in the EU would simply exacerbate the situation, as we would see traces of an increased number of non-EU authorised genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Community law already contains regulations concerning the labelling of threshold values for unintentional occurrence. Consequently, it is logical for unintentional occurrence, under specific circumstances, to be exempt from the regulations on labelling and tracing in this proposal too. Setting threshold values is a multifaceted task, and the Commission believes that the most effective solution is to be achieved with a sector-based initiative. Therefore, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 45 and 56, which propose that the competence for establishing threshold values for food, feed or processing be transferred from the proposal concerning food and feed products.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that the Commission fully supports the principle of establishing threshold values for unintentional occurrence, as proposed in a number of amendments. However, the proposal to include an article establishing such threshold values is, however, more relevant to the proposal concerning genetically modified food and feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in order to make matters easier, I have collated the Commission’s detailed positions concerning all amendments. This summary will accompany the Verbatim Report of Proceedings.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that it is in the interests of all of us, including the citizens of Europe, that this proposal enter into force as soon as possible. Comprehensive systems for traceability and labelling are necessary for genetically modified organisms, not only to make it easier to take protective measures if need be, but also to re-establish consumer and public confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – May I first express my thanks for all the work that has taken place in the different committees in relation to this proposal for a regulation on GM food and feed and also to thank the rapporteurs for their hard work – also the Commission staff in both DGs, who have worked hard over the last couple of years to bring forward this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues raised under this banner are complex and sensitive, and often give rise to strong emotional reactions and divided opinions. The vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy frequently resulted in amendments being rejected or adopted by a very low margin. This highlights the difficulty of the subject – but also, in my opinion, serves to show that the Commission proposal strikes a good, sensible and balanced compromise between the differing views.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to address each and every amendment, but instead would like to focus on four major issues. The first is the scope of the proposal. Amendments propose to extend the scope of the proposal to processing aids and animal products from animals fed on GM feed and also to restrict the scope of the proposal to products derived from GMOs which contain detectable modified DNA or protein.</p>
<p class="contents">In drawing up the proposal, the Commission carefully considered which products should be included within its scope. We decided only to include products that are produced from a GMO. Processing aids are not covered by the Novel Food Regulation, as these are not considered to be food ingredients. That is also the reason why, in respect of Community law, processing aids do not have to be labelled on the final product. For consistency reasons the Commission believes it would be inappropriate to require authorisation and labelling of GM processing aids, without having the same requirements for conventional processing aids.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time the Commission proposal specifically covers GM feed. However, to extend its scope to products such as milk, eggs and meat from animals fed on GM feed would radically depart from existing food legislation concerning animal products. The Commission does not believe that including products from animals fed on GM feed in the scope of the regulation is either feasible or practicable. The Commission therefore firmly rejects amendments to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to address the amendments, tabled last week, that aim to restrict the scope of the proposal, both in respect of authorisation and in respect of labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes to expand the current labelling requirements, and to require the mandatory labelling of food, food ingredients and feed produced from a GMO, even when modified DNA or protein is not present – that is, not detectable in the food, feed, or in the ingredient. The classic example is table oil directly derived from GM maize, GM soya beans, or GM rapeseed. Through the refinement process, all transgenic material has been removed. The question therefore arises – should it be labelled as GM or not? Safety is not the issue here. This is dealt with in the authorisation process. Labelling serves the purpose of informing consumers and users and allowing them to exercise choice.</p>
<p class="contents">What is abundantly clear to me is that the GM origin of products is something that really matters to a large number of consumers. We also know that many of the Member States want the mandatory labelling of GM derivatives. A number of them have clearly indicated that they would not support the authorisation of new GMOs if labelling and traceability of GM derivatives was not required. Those who argue against mandatory labelling of all GM derivatives, irrespective of the presence of modified DNA or protein, take the view that control of this obligation is unworkable and that it would lead to massive fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me state very clearly that I cannot accept this argument. I cannot accept that legal requirements are not enforceable if compliance cannot be checked through analytical methods. The reality is that a great number of regulatory requirements and legal rights, from mandatory labelling of the geographic origin of products to intellectual property rights, are enforced without any recourse to physical checks. None of the practical difficulties predicted in connection with GM labelling has proven insurmountable in these contexts. Indeed, the very requirement that we are discussing today is already in effect in many parts of the Community, albeit imposed by companies within the food chain rather than through Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have yet to meet a business operator who would admit that he or she does not know the origin of the ingredients he or she is using. There is a good reason for this. Admitting that you do not know whether your input is GM or not is also admitting, by the same token, that you do not know whether or not you are perhaps using a non-authorised GM. It is probably for this very reason that those who oppose the mandatory labelling of products not containing modified DNA or protein also propose to exempt these products from authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This, I am afraid, would be totally unacceptable to the Commission. It would turn the clock back more than five years, before the adoption of the Novel Foods Regulation, at the very time that international consensus is emerging, particularly in Codex Alimentarius, that all foods produced from GMOs should be subject to a pre-marketing approval process. The message to our consumers would be unacceptable. Currently, the message is: “Sorry, we cannot tell you whether this table oil is GM or not”. If these amendments were adopted, we would have to add: “...and, sorry again, if it is GM, we cannot tell you whether the GM from which it is originating was authorised or not”.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address the issue of GMO-free labelling. You have already understood that the Commission cannot accept GMO-free or non-GM as an alternative to the mandatory labelling of GM-derivatives. However, I do not believe that the amendment that has been tabled to the proposed regulation in relation to a voluntary GM regime is appropriate. But let us look at this again at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take up the point that the public will be misled by the proposal that we are putting forward in suggesting that there should be a GMO-free regime. There is an overwhelming risk that the public would be misled by a GMO-free labelling regime because of the fact that such guarantees cannot be given to the public and to try to do so by a mandatory labelling regime, supported by the law of the Community, would, in my view, run the risk of bringing the law into disrepute. Therefore, having put this objective into the White Paper on food safety two years ago, we thought long and hard about this. I have to say to you, Mrs Flemming, that having considered this, we came to the conclusion that this was not the way forward, for the reasons I have identified. That is why we have come forward with this particular proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning environmental risk assessment, a series of amendments challenge the suggestion that the European Food Safety Authority should carry out the environmental risk assessment as part of the overall assessment of a GM food or feed.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, these amendments would effectively deny the proposed regulation the status of sectoral legislation within the meaning of Directive 2001/18. Mrs Doyle asked earlier why we bring forward two pieces of legislation and add to the confusion. The piece of legislation that Commissioner Wallström is in charge of is a horizontal piece of legislation as is Directive 2001/18. In Directive 2001/18 it was envisaged that there would be sectoral legislation, brought forward in due course. That is the piece of legislation that I am promoting – the food and feed legislation. It was a requirement that this House voted on in 2001/18, calling for sectoral legislation. That is what the Commission is doing. That has been the objective from the beginning. That is what Parliament has already voted for.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that these requirements are fully provided for by the proposed GM food and feed regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, it would also deny the application of the “one door, one key” principle. This would result in the need for companies to file more than one application for the same GMO even though the applications would contain much of the same information. In my view, the "one door, one key" proposal is fundamental and a huge advantage not only to the applicants but also to consumers. The Commission cannot therefore accept the amendments requiring the environmental risk assessment for GMOs covered by the food and feed proposal to be carried out only under Directive 2001/18.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments have been put forward with the intention of strengthening the information requirements of the proposal. The Commission would be prepared to accept some of the amendments to increase further the level of public availability of information, but I do not consider it appropriate or reasonable to try to amend general comitology rules through this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we do not forget the intellectual property rights of companies. In this regard I would draw attention to Article 31 of the proposal which, in my opinion, provides the right balance between protecting such legitimate rights and the interests of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments suggest that very small trace amounts of unauthorised GMOs and GM material should not be accepted in food or feed.</p>
<p class="contents">It would simply not be feasible or practicable if the proposals did not provide for any tolerance – under certain conditions – for small traces of food and feed of GMOs or GM material. Indeed, even when an operator makes an effort to avoid using GMOs or GM material, traces may be technically unavoidable during cultivation, harvest, transport and processing.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said it before and I will say it again. Whether we like it or not, this has become a reality. We have to live in the real world. This is not just a problem that is exclusive to GMOs. In the production of food, feed and seed, it is practically impossible to achieve end products that are 100% pure and totally free from foreign substances.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, the Scientific Committees have already assessed a number of GMOs and concluded that they do not pose a risk to the environment or to human health. However, some of these GMOs have been awaiting final approval for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider it sensible that the proposal allows for these GMOs and GM material, which have been found safe in terms of a complete positive risk assessment from the EU Scientific Committee, to be present in food or feed up to a maximum of 1%. This is provided that the GM presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable. It was suggested earlier by Mr Lannoye that we were allowing for the presence of up to 1% of unauthorised GM material. That is not correct. We must make a clear distinction between unauthorised GM material for which an application has never been made and GM material for which an application has been made, a scientific assessment has been made by the Scientific Committee, a risk assessment has been positive in favour of that application, but no authorisation has yet been granted because of the existence of the moratorium. They are two different situations. It is the latter type, for which we are allowing the presence of up to 1%, not the former. It is an important distinction that I would like Parliament to take note of.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments suggest that a maximum labelling threshold for adventitious presence of authorised GM material should be established at one half of one percent (0.5%). I believe that we should follow the principle established in Directive 2001/18, which provides for thresholds to be fixed in comitology procedure in order to take into account technological and scientific progress. I believe that is the right way to go about this because the response can be made more quickly in the comitology or secondary legislation procedure, rather than putting this into a piece of legislation as has been suggested in the amendment. If we ever need to amend, we will have to do so by the normal procedures that we are used to, which may very well take more than a year or two to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that the Commission considers that the two proposals together strike a good and balanced compromise between the differing views. Furthermore, I firmly believe that they also provide the right approach to foster public confidence and social acceptance of the application of biotechnology in agri-food production. I hope that Parliament understands the reasoning behind the decision to reject or to accept in part only some of the amendments put forward. A full list of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament. I do not propose to read them out one by one, but I trust that this will be included in the Minutes of this sitting<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
