I hope that the Commission’s action will be fully adequate to this tragedy which has left more than a million people homeless and has caused immeasurable damage. I believe that this is also an important issue since the European Union must strengthen its cooperation and work towards a strategic partnership with India. I hope that Commissioner Patten, in particular, will ensure that everything is done to deal with this tragedy as best we can.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only one other brief point to mention to my fellow Members. In paragraph 4 of our resolution, we point out that some buildings in this region were weakened by structural faults. I am not at all sure that we should labour this point, given the current problems faced by the people of India. I tabled an amendment to withdraw this paragraph.

It is not only India that has been stunned by events. The pictures of the devastation in the State of Gujarat are etched in all our minds: one hundred thousand killed and several hundred thousand forced to leave their homes which have been completely destroyed – these people are now homeless, destitute and without work. I have been struck by the scale of the rapid response from the international community and the donations from private individuals. What fine examples of humanity and solidarity in an increasingly unfeeling world. Special teams, including several from Europe, were on hand to pull survivors out of the rubble. Help is flooding in. Medical supplies, food by the tonne load, clothing, blankets, installations to help provide clean drinking water and also prevent the outbreak of typhoid, cholera and hepatitis. Row upon row of tents have been erected to provide essential, albeit makeshift, refuge against the bitterly cold nights. This is all a source of comfort to the earthquake victims and their family members, many of whom reside in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has generously released EUR 13 million in emergency aid and there is a good chance that this aid package, distributed via the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office to six international aid organisations, will directly reach the earthquake victims. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will also be involved in achieving the successful reconstruction of the region. The damage to property alone amounts to over EUR 3 billion. And what actions have the Indians themselves taken? They have set up a committee, supported by all parties, dedicated to active disaster management. The authorities have acted quickly despite a series of aftershocks. The electricity supply was restored within days and towns were able to get back on their feet as streets and squares were cleared. We should applaud the efforts of our Indian friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, as we all know, Portugal has one of the lowest levels of GDP per capita in the European Union and the forecast made by the Commission in its second report on economic and social cohesion estimates that last year, Portugal moved even further away from the real convergence that it had experienced since 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial that the European Union provides exceptional aid in order to address the damage that has been done and to make its contribution to the huge effort that is currently underway.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urge the Commission, together with the Portuguese Government and local authorities, to provide exceptional financial aid to complement the resources that have been made available by the Portuguese authorities in order to meet the urgent needs of the communities that have been most badly affected, and to facilitate the rebuilding of infrastructure that has been destroyed and the resumption of economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">A reallocation of appropriations that have already been earmarked is not enough. I repeat that what is needed is exceptional aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost every single river in Portugal burst its banks and there are towns in my country which have suffered four consecutive floods in the course of this winter with the rains that have fallen since November.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis was felt particularly acutely in the centre of the country, affecting the Mondego basin most tragically, but it affected communities to some extent throughout the country. The Portuguese authorities and the civil defence forces have made huge efforts to remedy the situation. Now, questions about reconstruction are being asked and I would add my voice to those of my fellow Portuguese Members in asking the Commission to work together with the Portuguese authorities at national and local level to aid reconstruction, to list the damage done and to support the reconstruction of the areas that have been affected with both financial and technical resources. I should also like to express my solidarity with the victims. Given the scale of the floods that have swept across our country this winter, and let us hope that they are over, because the bad weather is continuing, we must once again draw your attention to regional planning policies and to the need to ensure the balance of our ecosystems. In this matter, I would also ask for the assistance that would result from dialogue with other Member countries of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen enormous material damage, families made homeless, injured and even killed. Once again, an appeal to European solidarity is being made in this Parliament and it is the Commission’s duty to find ways of putting this into practice. The Commission must not hide behind a lack of funds – the people who have been affected do not want to hear administrative excuses. It is our duty to prove that Europe is not only a generous idea but also an efficient organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, two fundamental issues that are worth recalling. The first, broader issue is that of environmental protection and climate change. Only a few years ago, anyone who mentioned these matters was dismissed as being utopian, alarmist and even a little mad. Today, the evidence is clear for all to see and we have to act effectively to prevent the situation throughout the world from deteriorating. The second issue concerns my country, Portugal. Let no one be in any doubt; I do not intend to give in to demagogy: my country’s government and local authorities are not responsible for the rains that fell, but they do have a responsibility from which they cannot shy away. They must show greater rigour in regional planning and greater resistance to urban speculation, they must refuse permission to build in areas at risk from flooding and establish better management of river beds and dam outlets.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all work together, not only in order to help the people who need urgent assistance, but also in taking precautions with the measures and actions that predict and reduce the probability of similar disasters in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have caused a genuine disaster. In requesting the support and the solidarity of the European Union, we are not trying to solicit an emotional reaction; we do not want to give the impression that we are courting pity or that we are merely asking for help. The Portuguese Government has not failed to provide support for the areas that have been affected and there has been no lack of national solidarity. Financial support from the European Union, however, is just as important for Portugal as it is for the European Union itself. In fact, even more important than the material size of such a contribution is its symbolic, moral and emotional effect. Strengthening the sense of belonging to the European Union and the awareness of European citizenship also requires these small, symbolic gestures and brings Europe closer to the people. The communities that have been affected by the storms and the population will, in general, feel that the European Union is not indifferent to their tragedies and problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, this is the best way for the European Union to touch people’s hearts, regardless of how much it contributes. This is why we are asking the Commission to use its imagination and to provide an answer to our request and to our proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, regarding, first of all, the European Parliament’s resolution on the earthquake in India, I want to point out – and a number of you have already made this point – that the Commission approved its emergency first aid to the value of EUR 3 million on 30 January, just four days after the events. This decision, like all emergency decisions, enabled operations to be funded from the first day of the emergency. Its objective was to provide immediate aid not only through the distribution of blankets, clothes, medicines and health care and the provision of food and drinking water, but also through the creation of a field hospital in Bhuj.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Mann has pointed out, this operation involved our collaborating with six humanitarian organisations, including Oxfam UK, Care International, the German Red Cross and Save the Children in the United Kingdom. Each of these organisations concerned itself with a specific area of activity and, in our opinion, the results have been positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now announced its decision to provide a further EUR 10 million. We expect this decision to be finalised in the course of next week, as soon as the priorities have been established and assessments have been made of needs on the ground and of the NGOs’ proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to current, and any future, aid that we avoid duplication in the use of resources, as well as the problems which might be created by types of urgent need not covered by one or other financial aid provider. It is therefore vital to deal with all aid opportunities together and, in order to fill the gap between emergency and long-term aid, the Commission will lose no time at all in sending a study mission to assess reconstruction and renovation needs <span class="italic">in situ</span>. This mission will work in close conjunction with the Member States, and its results will enable us to decide better how to carry out future initiatives in cooperation with other international institutions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the specific problem of floods and natural disasters in Portugal, I can tell you that Portugal has certainly suffered a very hard winter. There have undoubtedly been problems in many regions of Europe, involving heavy rain and storms, together with floods which have caused considerable material damage and, in certain cases, the loss of human life as well. On 16 November 2000, I myself appeared before this House to comment on the extremely serious floods in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, France and Italy, and I should like once again to express the Commission’s concern about these matters. We wish to be associated with the demonstrations of support and solidarity addressed by this House to the victims of this new disaster, specifically in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as 31 January, my colleague Michel Barnier used the occasion of the part-session in Brussels to express his openness towards any request from the Portuguese authorities to re-adjust the programming of the Structural Funds. When we talk about re-adjusting the programming of the Structural Funds, we are not, as some of you may possibly have thought, talking about applying a different use to the same resources as previously existed for the country but, instead, of reconsidering the overall programming of the Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to remind you that, on Wednesday, 25 October 2000 before this House, Mrs Wallström, speaking on behalf of the Commission, specified the latter’s role in the field of civil protection and explained the opportunities offered to us by the current Budget in terms of how the EAGGF and ERDF Structural Funds might be deployed, together with the Interreg 3 Community initiative which, in its inter-regional chapter, includes cooperation in the field of natural or industrial disasters. There is no other room for manoeuvre within the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the ‘Community Action Programme – Civil Protection’, the Commission is therefore prepared to consider a project to be submitted by the Member State affected, aimed at identifying the areas at risk from flooding in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like once again to remind you of the Commission’s concern and of its willingness, within the framework of what is at present possible, to respond promptly and positively to the requests which Portugal might, under this general heading, submit as a consequence of these events. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
