<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korhola (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, we are currently debating a directive which concerns participation by the public in decisions which affect the environment. It is the second pillar in the legislative work whose purpose is to ratify, within the Community, the Aarhus Convention which was concluded in 1998. I wish to express my thanks for the fact that my draft report has received copious and unanimous support in many of the points which I have put forward. The report has, however, also stirred up some political passions. It must be possible to find a balance between, on the one hand, guaranteeing broad opportunities for participation by citizens, and, on the other hand, avoiding deliberate and vexatious delaying tactics. This task is not easy, especially as the structure of the Commission's basic proposal is very complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">The vote taken the week before last in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy led to an unfortunate and illogical conclusion, which must now be rectified in plenary session so that we can correct a situation which is embarrassing from the point of view of the Parliament's reputation. At the moment, the report version approved in Committee contains some mutually contradictory ingredients. I personally feel that not enough time was available to discuss and to understand the basic starting point which I put forward, and its practical consequences. I stated that information gathering and public hearing concern the entire public at large, but I limited the legal safeguards following the decision to a more restricted public, in other words those whose rights are infringed by the decision. It was only in this point that I failed to receive the support which I had hoped for from the major groups. I wished to open the consultation stage to the public at large, since there is a very peculiar logic in a situation whereby an authority ends up determining in advance which part of the public a matter concerns. How could the authority know who will be affected by it, and in what way, before the public has been heard on the issue? And if this is already known, then hearing the public is a pointless exercise. Such restriction is odd from the point of view of public participation, and also squanders the time and energy of the authority itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Since colleagues have feared that my approach means that anyone may take an authority to court, I wish to stress that just the opposite is the case. It is precisely the Commission's version which – in setting demanding obligations for the authority – would achieve this result. In my proposal, the right of appeal is restricted solely to those whose rights are infringed by a decision, so that appeal is not used with deliberately vexatious intent. The opportunity to express an opinion will not automatically imply the right of appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's proposal, the public's right of participation was restricted at all stages to that public which the matter concerns. I continue to hold that the Commission's proposal is misguided in this respect; its practical consequences will create needless difficulties in the work of the authorities. Authorities will face uncommon difficulties in establishing whom a matter concerns; this includes all civic organisations, which according to the Commission's proposal are always interested parties. Failure or negligence at this stage will always form grounds for taking the matter to court. Without a doubt, in the form proposed by the Commission these provisions are indeed open to abuse – and this abuse can also take the form of slowing down projects.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal was unusual in that it would have simultaneously benefited citizens who genuinely wish to participate, and also the authorities dealing with the matter and those players whose project was in question. Perhaps the matter may still be rectified when the Member States have to ponder the practical application of the matter in more detail. The explanation which I have given here is, in my opinion, important from the point of view of all parties who have anything to do with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately many other matters which are important from the point of view of the Aarhus convention have been received positively. I have, first and foremost, wished to streamline practice by standardising the regulations concerning processing with regard to the various directives. In this way, it will be easier for citizens to know how to proceed, and the obligation of authorities to advise citizens will be more straightforward. In the Commission's proposal the modes of procedure vary slightly, and as a result it is difficult to know what one should do in any particular case.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I have incorporated into the report some objectives which are pursuant to the Aarhus convention, which the Commission had either omitted from its proposal or simply forgotten. In this way the report complies better with the spirit and objectives of the convention. In particular, this applies to Item 5 of Article 6, and Article 8, of the Aarhus Convention. I would also like to thank the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Petitions for their opinions, which gave encouragement and support to my work in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Also, cooperation with the Commission and (in particular) the Council has been constructive, and bodes well for the second stage of processing of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Committee on Petitions we have a large number of petitions which relate to the particular directives concerned in this important report. It is very clear to us that the public want to be involved, they want to be informed and they want information in good time about particular proposals. We often hear complaints from the public about the lack of information, that it comes late, it is incomplete, it is difficult to understand. We have often found through those petitions that there are a number of Member States that have very poorly applied the directives which are mentioned here and we have seen court cases resulting from that.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee was extremely clear. We want the widest possible definition of "public". We have found in the issues raised with us that it is not just environmental NGOs, or people living in an area that is directly affected. We have come across small businesses, fishermen and others who have felt that particular schemes affect them and therefore they are interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">We also thought it was important that the area of policy should be looked at as well, because one of the questions we often get is "what is the context of a particular development going ahead?", particularly where that is linked at times to European Union policy, such as CAP spending and spending on the Structural Funds. We also find that people want access to resources in order to be able to understand the information they are given. Sometimes we find complaints come to our committee effectively to have those environmental impact assessments assessed, because those organisations lack the resources to fully participate within the planning process and it is vital that we look at that, certainly at Member State level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It allows the citizens to express opinions and fears that may have a bearing on the decisions to be taken and allows those responsible for taking the decisions to take them into account. This, in turn, increases accountability in the decision-making process and makes it more transparent, and helps to raise public awareness of environmental matters.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, the importance of providing greater incentives for public participation has already been recognised at international level, with the Aarhus Convention. The directive upon which we are going to vote tomorrow seeks to bring Community law into line with the provisions of this Convention and to smooth the way for its ratification by the Community. The citizens will be able to participate fully right from the initial stages of the decision-making process, especially as regards the development of plans and programmes, the environmental impact assessment process and the prevention and overall reduction of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I welcome the introduction by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of fresh provisions, which refer clearly to the dissemination of information through the Internet as well. A crucial element is that only the public concerned, citizens or groups, including NGOs, are entitled to express comments and opinions or even to appeal before a judicial body.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome other amendments made to the text by the rapporteur, I cannot support her proposal to extend this right to the participation of all citizens, without restriction. A wider, less clear definition of citizens could lead to ambiguous interpretations and inappropriately hamper a project’s implementation. However, I support the definitions included in the Commission’s proposal, which clearly define the concept of the public concerned, which alone is entitled to express comments and opinions to the competent authority before a decision is taken within the areas covered by the directive and, where appropriate, to appeal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time, we are debating public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">What these reports have in common is that the Commission’s proposals are based on what is known as the Aarhus Convention. According to Article 8 of this Convention, every country must endeavour to promote a situation in which, at a time when it is still possible to influence the decisions, the general public is given an effective opportunity to participate in the public authorities’ work on such rules.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 9 of the same Convention – and this is something I want to emphasise – each country undertakes, within the framework of its own national legislation, to give the public concerned the opportunity, through the courts, to have the validity of the authorities’ decisions tested.</p>
<p class="contents">For me as a liberal, it is obvious that the decisions made and the proposals drafted by the public authorities must, as far as possible, be made accessible to anyone interested and affected. Anything else would be unthinkable in a democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential that consultation is not restricted in a way that in practice would make it meaningless – in other words, that authorities themselves could define the people who would be affected and they would be the only ones consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a case in Swansea in my own constituency where a local authority is building an incinerator on the border of two counties and has consulted its own constituents, but not the people of the other county who live closer to it and who will be more affected and are now protesting vigorously against the plans. This legislation could prevent that kind of situation arising. Just as important it gives the public access to a review procedure, and so I ask for support for the amendments of my group which seek to strengthen the report in line with the Aarhus Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the report gives rise to some fundamental problems. First of all, the possible overlapping of texts prescribing public participation and, in particular, the directives on environmental impact studies and on the prevention or reduction of pollution. Secondly, the ratification of the Aarhus Convention. This convention has been signed by the Community and by all the Member States, but has only been ratified by Italy or Denmark: it is therefore not in force. This report must not be an opportunity for the Union to replace, by means of a directive, the desire of the Member States to be bound by an international convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, to add environmental policies to the plans and programmes seems to me premature at this stage, given that the Aarhus Convention is yet to be ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the concept of ‘public affected’, which we are in favour of so as not to widen the scope of the text in an unrestricted fashion. Nevertheless, the two concepts of ‘public’ and ‘public affected’ should be able to coexist, and it should be for the Member States to decide on the most appropriate level of consultation. In the case of cross-border projects, for example, it would be sensible to broaden the consultation to the public as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We will support Amendments Nos 30, 31 and 32.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, like the Commission, we believe that we should lay down the minimum conditions required in order to guarantee effective participation by the public and leave it to the Member States to regulate the practical details in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our citizens complain that they are given the right to vote every now and then, but that they do not enjoy full rights of participation in the day-to-day activities of the institutions for which they vote: at European level, at national level, and at regional and local level. It is precisely in the area of the environment that the dissatisfaction of communities has been most keenly felt. When they disagree, often rightly so, with a particular project, their only option is to express their anger on the streets or in the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">This indignation increases exponentially when many of these projects with unacceptable environmental impacts are funded under the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds. It is, therefore very important that, as a follow-up to the Aarhus Convention, the Commission has produced legislation on public access to environmental information, on public participation in certain plans, programmes and policies and on public access to justice<span class="italic">.</span> Greater public participation not only gives greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions; it can also improve their quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the work she has done on this proposal for a directive on public participation in drafting environmental plans and programmes, especially for having sought, by means of various amendments, to extend citizens’ rights and to eliminate some ambiguities. There is nevertheless one subject on which I disagree with Mrs Korhola. Public consultation will only be feasible if the definition of ‘the public’ is not too vague. I therefore prefer the Commission’s approach, which defines the public affected by a given project as the target of consultation and not the rapporteur’s choice of a broader and, therefore, vaguer definition of the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, the public is given the opportunity of expressing its opinion, along with any concerns it may have. The decision-makers are given the chance to take these into account when taking decisions. In short, public participation will contribute to the transparency of the decision-making process and the acceptance of the outcome, namely the plans and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, broadening participation to include policy-making, as proposed by the rapporteur, is taking matters a step too far, since policy-making is not specific enough for public participation. Also, ‘policy-making’ is not a category that falls within the scope of the present ‘environmental impact assessment’ directive. The objective of the present directive is to render basic procedures concerning public participation consistent in all Member States and to ensure that they are carried out in the same way within the Community. However, it is also a minimum obligation. It will thus become apparent upon implementation that discrepancies between the Member States exist after all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This point was discussed during the March plenary and it was already clear then that attitudes towards the methodologies and towards the influence of this participation too vary from North to South, so to speak. Indeed, the northern countries have a different attitude towards this type of involvement, towards the idea of this type of participation from the countries of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, clearly inspired by the way things work in her country, which is possibly democratically more developed, more advanced than others – proposes participation that is too peremptory, too authoritarian, participation that could ultimately slow down, if not block or paralyse certain decision-making processes, upon which there will never be total convergence between the direct democratic base and what is known as the authority, that is the administration appointed to deal with these issues. There you are: this authority must also take into clear consideration all the demands and comments of those who have to build, sell and create tourist, sporting and cultural concerns – in short, daily activities – in the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering that this second debate contains points and issues which involve legality and access to levels of justice, including in the event of appeals, the roles and responsibilities must be quite clearly, fairly and unambiguously defined in terms of who the actors should be and how much influence they should have. The Aarhus Convention has been cited: that is all very well – we support it – but it must not be taken as Gospel. It too must allow for a healthy subsidiarity, for customs, for habits, and for the level of directly democratic involvement possible in the various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I congratulate the rapporteur, who has put in an enormous amount of work, but I feel that there should be some adaptation, as I said at the beginning, to the different attitudes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to this proposal on access to environmental information, there are other pieces of Community legislation which already incorporate the principle of the Aarhus Convention. The Commission will ensure that the Aarhus elements are built into all future proposals. Public participation has to become a fully integrated part of environmental decision-taking. To reach that objective, our proposals have to be easy to put into practice, so that they may be smoothly implemented in the different administrative systems of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The question whether participation in decision-taking should aim at the public at large or the "public concerned" is a key point, and it has been addressed by a number of Members who have just spoken. In accordance with the Aarhus Convention, the Commission proposes to ensure that the public at large is fully informed about planned developments which might affect them, whilst giving the right to participate in the decision-taking process to those having an interest in or likely to be affected by the developments, that is, the "public concerned." Some of the proposed amendments, and indeed what has been said by some Members just now, seems to imply that by using the definition, "the public concerned", both the convention and the Commission are deliberately restricting the rights of citizens, but may I be permitted to point out that is certainly not the case. It is not correct. This proposal is aimed at extending the rights of citizens. There is no question of restricting those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">By defining the "public concerned", we are focusing the attention of the competent authorities on the need to take account of those citizens most directly affected. The definition will confirm both the right to express a view and the right to be heard. The definition of "public concerned" is sufficiently detailed to ensure that there is no doubt who should be involved. Therefore members of the public could argue that they had been unjustifiably excluded. That would be difficult with a more general definition of the public. The inclusion of NGOs within the definition of the "public concerned" will ensure that a more general public view may be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more practical level, the definition of "public concerned" has been used without major problems in existing legislation – for example the environmental impact assessment directive – for a number years. There have been no problems raised as a result of people having been excluded by the use of the definition – at least no major problems. In short, this approach will give those affected by new developments the right to influence decisions which will not just affect their environment but which may also affect their economic and social conditions. For those reasons, the Commission, regrettably, cannot support the amendments seeking to replace the concept of the "public concerned".</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 26 seeks to extend considerably the scope of Article 1, so as to cover plans and programmes not only in the environmental field but also in other sectors. The Commission's view is that this would make the scope of the proposal less well-defined and also that the measures proposed would lead to legal confusion. There would in effect be a duplication of measures in different pieces of legislation each seeking to do the same thing, but in an inconsistent manner. In particular, for plans and programmes in other sectors that may have significant environmental effects, Directive 2001/42 on strategic environmental assessment already incorporates measures of particular relevance. The directive provides for environmental assessment of relevant plans and programmes in many integration sectors and envisages public participation fully in line with the Aarhus requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6 and 12 aim to give effect to a best endeavour clause under the Aarhus Convention and are formulated in a non-binding way. Amendment No 9 introduces public participation concerning policies in its heading, but the text does not contain operational provisions in this respect. In formulating the proposal, the Commission's objective has been to incorporate the binding provisions of the Aarhus Convention. The Commission's view is that there would be no added value in taking up its soft-law provisions. Not only the Community but all Member States have signed the Aarhus Convention and so already have to take into account the soft-law provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, regrettably, cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 and 11 which provide for access to justice concerning public participation in plans and programmes. The Aarhus Convention does not explicitly require this, neither does the directive on strategic environmental assessment of plans and programmes provide for access to justice. The Commission is however considering possible further legislative proposals in relation to the third Aarhus pillar on access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I now confirm the Commission's position on the amendments. The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 15, 18, 25, 28 and 29. In addition, Amendments Nos 9, 13, 14, 23 and 27 can be accepted in part and Amendments Nos 4, 5, 10 and 17 in principle. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 16, 20, 21 and 22.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is in our common interest, which is the interest of the European citizen after all, to have this proposal enter into force swiftly. Only once the frameworks are established can public participation in decision-making become a fully integrated administrative practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
