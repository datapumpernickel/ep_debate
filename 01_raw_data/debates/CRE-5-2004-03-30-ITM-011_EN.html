Adoption of this package of proposals will mean that we have passed a milestone in strengthening environmental democracy: the Århus Convention’s requirements on access to environmental information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters will be set to apply throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have in place legislation concerning the Århus Convention’s first and second pillars – access to environmental information and public participation in environmental decision-making. The proposal for a directive on access to justice in environmental matters and for a regulation to apply the Århus Convention to the Community institutions and bodies will allow the Community to complete the package of legislative instruments aimed at effective implementation of the Århus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">You will remember that the proposal on access to justice also fulfils a commitment from the Commission to the European Parliament when negotiating the Public Participation Directive. In addition, the Commission’s proposal for a decision on the conclusion of the Århus Convention by the European Community provides the means to live up to our political commitment by becoming a party to the Convention, further to its signature in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive on access to justice aims to implement the third pillar of the Århus Convention by establishing minimum requirements for access to administrative or judicial proceedings in environmental matters. With its signature of the Århus Convention, the Community undertook to ensure that its requirements would be applied throughout EU territory. This can only be guaranteed by means of an EU-wide instrument with respect to access to justice in environmental matters setting the minimum conditions all Member States have to comply with. Furthermore, such an instrument will help to improve the implementation of Community law, and hence further the effectiveness of Community environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is important not only for the European Community to sign up to the Århus Convention, but also to cover its own institutions, alongside national authorities, so that they are also bound by its requirements. This is a point that we made clear, even at the negotiation stage. This commitment will fully materialise with the adoption of the proposal for a regulation on the application of the Århus Convention to the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hence not only another element for the implementation of the Århus Convention, but also crucial for our own credibility as regards Member States and internationally. We are, however, not starting from scratch. A number of instruments linked to the good governance process are already in place, and only need to be completed to fully live up to the requirements of the Århus Convention. I particularly refer to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and to the Commission’s communication of December 2002 establishing general principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the proposals to the House and look forward to hearing your comments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korhola (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, the package of three acts now before us forms part of the package of measures for acquiring practical rules with regard to the principles agreed by the United Nations in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. I myself was Parliament’s rapporteur for the first two pillars of the Århus Convention, and am now the rapporteur with regard to the regulation on the application of all three pillars to Community institutions and bodies. I am also rapporteur for the Council decision on the ratification of the Århus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first speak about the regulation. The European Parliament played a very active role in the first two implementing directives on the Århus Convention. The outcome as a result of conciliation represents Parliament’s position very clearly in both cases and meets the minimum requirements in the Århus Convention fully, even going beyond them. This is now satisfactorily reflected in the Commission proposal for the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee, upon my suggestion, tabled amendments to the regulation concerning exceptions regarding access to information and binding rules on public participation in particular. Furthermore, in order to harmonise the regulation with the Convention and the proposed Directive on access to justice, members of the public are given a legal standing where an issue directly concerns their interests or rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also proposing a clarification to the text concerning charging for the information supplied. Here a distinction should be made between, firstly, the three European institutions, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and secondly, between all the other Community bodies. The former three have already adopted a general rule for not making charges, and that must obviously not be altered where it concerns environmental information. The other bodies may make a reasonable charge where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the amendments that have now been tabled are aimed at ensuring that there is adequate harmonisation between the regulation and the proposed Directive on access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me then move on to the directive. The Directive on access to justice is problematic in many ways. First of all, the various fears associated with it in the Member States give rise to needless opposition to the whole Århus Convention and the Community legislation that relates to it. I would think that this is also precisely why Ireland, as the country holding the presidency, is unwilling to include the package under discussion in its agenda during its presidential term.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that this directive, which specifically relates to access to justice and the legal system, restricts the powers of the Union to a greater degree than the two earlier Århus directives. All this Parliament must take into consideration when taking its decision on the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome arrived at by the committee was reasonably good, and the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are an attempt to ensure that the directive will actually adhere precisely to the provisions of the Århus Convention: no more, but no less. Given that the Århus Convention does not provide any clear basis for the text, a degree of discretion has had to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise the matter of the definition of ‘qualified entity’. The general criteria agreed by the committee are too narrow in the view of many environmental organisations. I do not agree. What is required at the end of the day is simply normal procedures that accord with good practice on the part of organisations and recommending legal procedures that are in accordance with good practice, which is probably only reasonable considering the special role these organisations will now have in monitoring society’s conformity with the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we have to consider that there are very many kinds of NGOs, and we cannot be certain about the ultimate purpose of all of them. That is why simple criteria for defining a qualified entity will give protection to that special entitlement we are now bestowing on environmental organisations that have a serious purpose. I hope that the environmental organisations are able to see this. If on the other hand some organisations are too small on their own to meet even these simple criteria, that may in itself even justify, in terms of the objective, which is the protection of the environment, combining skills and resources and not working as needlessly scattered units, at least as far as using the opportunity of access to justice is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also bear in mind the nature of the minimum directive: Member States may if they so wish exclude some of the proposed criteria, but may not add to them. This gives credence to the notion that the directive will function within very different legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I have furthermore made the provisions clearer, allowing foreign organisations a non-discriminatory right to access to justice when it is a genuine matter of cross-border environmental impact. The Commission proposal was not absolutely clear on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I will turn to the issue of ratification. The two Århus directives already adopted represent Parliament’s position very clearly. Parliament itself was able to make the provisions contained in them tougher compared to the Århus Convention. This is partly due to the at times intentionally vague and obscure wording of the Convention, which was simply meant to ensure the Convention would come into being in 1998. This tradition of international diplomacy cannot, however, be tolerated within the context of the precise formulation of Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I hope Parliament will show more ambition where the Community has authority, as the incorporation of an environmental convention in Community legislation is different from drafting directives based on conventions in other areas, such as banning landmines. While the latter is a static decision, the former should be thought of as a dynamic process. With environmental policy, the aim is to reverse, step by step, adverse global developments, and benefit from the experience gained.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the implementation of an environmental convention should take shape in a way that can lead to improvements in a future revision of the convention. The EU cannot confine itself to the faithful duplication of internationally agreed minimum standards, but should rather use the entire margin realistically and aspire to lead the way. This succeeded with the two first pillars of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The final sections of the Århus package under discussion seem to be going in the right direction and showing a sense of balance. As a result, ratification of the entire Århus Convention may finally start in the Community with no needless delay, provided the necessary Community legislation is adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this debate, and also the Commission proposal for a directive. In signing the Århus Convention, the<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>Community demonstrated its will to improve environmental law and also involve the public in environmental decisions in an entirely different way. The forthcoming ratification means that the<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>Community is actually duty bound to ensure that citizens and NGOs are able to enjoy this right in accordance with Community law, which is a very good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>Community and the Member States signed the Convention back in 1998 and it entered into force in 2001, it has only been ratified by a few of the EU Member States. It is now high time that the public and the NGOs were given access to justice in environmental matters, and also to information, of course, and participation in decision-making, which is discussed in the report by Mrs Korhola. This will play an important part in rendering environmental policy much more effective in the EU. It will improve management of, and compliance with, environmental regulations, speed up implementation, and improve environmental management. How can we say that so confidently? Indeed, there are actually studies showing that, in countries offering the opportunity of bringing environmental proceedings and reviewing the application of environmental law, environmental law has become much stricter: there is a direct link.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the intentions of Agenda 21, which are also a guiding thread for the Commission, it is individuals, not the authorities, who own their environment. For the first time, environmental law and human rights are being linked up, and I think that this is a positive development. It is also true that we have a responsibility towards future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has voted in favour of the Directive constituting a minimum framework and Member States being free to go further and provide broader access to justice. I think that that is an excellent proposal. Environmental proceedings must apply to both public authority handling and the criminal dimension, since the Århus Convention does not make a distinction between civil and criminal proceedings, and I do not really understand why the Commission wishes to make this distinction here.</p>
<p class="contents">We disagree on a number of points; this is clear from the amendments to this Directive. For example, I do not think that EU law should introduce new, unnecessary restrictions such as those on qualified entities<span class="italic">.</span> That would force countries that currently take a very liberal view to introduce restrictions. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to which Mrs Korhola referred. These concern Articles 8 and 9, among others, and set out new criteria and procedures that are not at all present in the Århus Convention. In my opinion, this would create new obstacles, and I do not understand the need for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I understand why we should adopt geographical and time limitations or restrictions, which are also specified in Articles 8 and 5, regarding legal standing. For example, both the Commission proposal and Amendment No 32 by the PPE-DE Group require an entity to be active in an area in order to have access to documents or the judicial authorities there. I think that this is absolutely wrong, as the nature of environmental proceedings is completely different today. For example, a small, local environmental organisation might need expert help from an international organisation so, in my opinion, that entails restrictions. In my view, being an independent and non-profit-making legal person should be sufficient to qualify for permission to bring legal proceedings for the protection of the environment and health.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important that the definition of ‘environmental law’ apply to all policy areas and not just Article 175, to which this proposal refers. All environmental law based on Article 95 would also be covered, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should just like to say something about costs. I have proposed that costs must on no account be an obstacle to the ability of an entity to bring legal proceedings. We must ensure that the public is granted the help and support it needs. When legal proceedings are brought for reasons of public interest, the cost must not constitute an obstacle. We must be very generous in this regard. I hope, therefore, that my fellow Members vote in favour of the proposals that I have outlined, so that we can establish effective legislation that does not create new obstacles, but instead fulfils our aim of improving environmental law in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Århus merely requires open access to administrative or, alternatively, judicial review proceedings; Commissioner Wallström seeks to lay down binding provisions on access to the courts in all the Member States, with all environmental organisations to be empowered to object to administrative decisions and to appeal against them, with provision also for interim legal protection. This is to apply to the whole body of environmental law, in other words, to the whole <span class="italic">acquis </span>defined in the Community as having to do with the protection or improvement of the environment, including human health and the protection or rational use of natural resources. The examples listed are, among others, water protection, noise protection, soil protection, atmospheric pollution, town and country planning, and biotechnologies. Environmental organisations are thus given a general right to contest and monitor the application of the law. That amounts to nothing more and nothing less than a system change in the implementation and control of the law as it stands in most of Europe’s Member States, with private bodies, in their guise as representatives of the public, being given the right to supervise the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our legal system knows nothing of the monitoring of law by any such body separate from the courts and from the competent authorities, and with good reason. Environmental associations are, at the end of the day, interest groups like any others, lacking democratic legitimacy and not bound by law and statute. Introducing and making binding such a dramatic extension of class action will have a massive effect on the economy and cannot under any circumstances be reconciled with the Lisbon objectives. It is for that reason that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has limited itself to saying that Århus must be implemented, but to a minimum standard, and if Member States want to go beyond that, then that is their decision. That is where the matter should rest, and so I can only hope, Commissioner Wallström, that the Council will firmly put a stop to your initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Cashman welcomed, in his opinion, the proposal for a regulation on the application of the Århus Convention to EC bodies and institutions as a concrete step to align the EC legislation with the requirements of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the committee's opinion approves most parts of the Commission text, there was some need to improve it. As the rapporteur on the proposal for a regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, Mr Cashman insisted that this regulation must be in line with the letter and spirit of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents, where, after negotiations, a sensible balance was agreed between, on the one hand, the citizen's right to openness and transparency and, on the other, the need to protect certain interests and to preserve the effectiveness of the institutions' working methods. The opinion suggests, for example, a deletion – in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 – on exceptions where public authorities would not be covered when acting in a legislative capacity. The opinion suggests that the operative text of the Commission proposal should clarify that all exceptions under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 shall apply to requests for information.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a general concern of the committee's opinion is about the deadlines proposed by the Commission. Particularly when it comes to access to justice, Community institutions and bodies should be obliged to act within reasonable deadlines and to increase the duty of public awareness-raising in order to achieve meaningful consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, Mr Cashman would have wanted to add his own opinion but could not be here today. I hope I have set out the main points that he would have proposed in the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Community signed this text in 1998, it is now our responsibility to act so that each of our governments can implement this agreement. By signing the Århus Convention, the Community has committed itself to adopting legally binding instruments, namely a directive and a regulation, in order to bring Community legislation in line with the provisions of the Århus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with this requirement to comply with the Convention in mind that the committee carried out its work. It is also along these lines that the amendments tabled in plenary, which are widely supported, were drawn up. Our work initially consisted in uniting the various concepts taken up in the texts and in adapting them to the definitions in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have respected the Commission's decision to give non-governmental organisations working in the environmental sector access to justice, while further opening up this route to qualified entities with legal personality. In the same vein, we have turned the objective of promoting sustainable development into an essential condition, included in their statues, of exercising the right of access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, only the provisions contained in the Århus Convention and in the directive granted access to justice to members of the public who bring to light an infringement of a right or who have an interest in acting. As we were anxious that the Community institutions should be bound by the same rules as the Member States, we chose to incorporate this provision into the present regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we constantly ensured that we respected the need to apply the principle of subsidiarity to the Member States with regard to legal procedures. Indeed, insofar as these matters relate to procedural law in the Member States, they are based on the Member States' procedural autonomy and must not result in a restrictive legal instrument from the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also inconceivable that we could establish a specific provision, a sort of privileged right to easier and cheaper access to justice on environmental matters: it is essential for questions of access to justice to be dealt with consistently and on an overall basis in all sectors, not just specifically in the environmental sector. Finally, some of the proposals in the working document go beyond the obligations arising from the Århus Convention. We must retain the room for manoeuvre that the Convention gives the Member States in the implementation of these obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I think we have reached a fair compromise which aims to promote, in accordance with the provisions of the Århus Convention, effective implementation of Community legislation on the environment. I could, perhaps, summarise it by saying ‘the whole Århus Convention, and nothing but the Århus Convention’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question of whether or not to comply with the provisions of the Århus Convention is not on the agenda. What we have to look at is how to act so that our governments and the Community institutions can implement this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Århus Convention is undoubtedly a real advance, as it plays a part in establishing what has become essential transparency, and we are called upon here to present methods of providing the public with access to justice. If this Convention is to be effective, however, it must bear the stamp of modernity and set in motion greater participation among all those who contribute to improving the environment in Europe. That is why we should include a precise reference to the concept of sustainable development. It would be inconsistent to try to make do with an overly restrictive definition of environmental law, and thus to exclude whole sectors of activity that, nevertheless, play an active part in achieving our environmental objectives. I am thinking in particular here of professional groups.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard, more particularly, to the proposal for a directive, insofar as the Århus Convention will <span class="italic">de facto</span> be implemented, the first question is whether the directive is really necessary. This is a valid question and, if there is a directive, it must correspond to the spirit of the Convention. In this case, it must also respect the principle of subsidiarity: this, I may add, is also the basis of our amendments. This is because it is the Member States which will have to implement the requirements of the Århus Convention, and this must occur in accordance with the law in force in each of our countries and with the legal traditions applicable there. I would under no circumstances support amendments aiming to impose one Member State's legal practices on all the others. On the other hand, we must anticipate possible cross-border cases, and we must specify the conceivable procedures for appeals. If these points are not taken on board, then, for reasons of legal consistency, we will probably choose to do without this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Socialists, we believe that access to justice must be as universal as possible, but must always take an organised form. So, on the most controversial issue, which is the way in which this access to justice is made as universal as possible, the Commission proposes that it be done by means of qualified entities, something which is still a restriction of the universality laid down in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain amendments presented to plenary replace ‘qualified entities’ with ‘NGOs’, but I do not believe that this resolves the issue; I therefore propose that we follow the line approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and which I proposed myself, on a broader notion of qualified entity, according to which any person or collective affected by an environmental issue could have the right to justice. This, together with the modification of the definition of ‘public’, which we have also approved in the Committee on the Environment, would allow us to guarantee the universality of the right recognised in Aarhus and at the same time organise the system of access to justice in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, our institutions must set an example in the application of these rights. I therefore believe that we have the moral obligation to ensure that the regulation is more ambitious than the directive intended for the Member States, and I would call on the Commission to accept the modification of the definitions which this Parliament proposes and which I hope we will approve tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been said quite rightly today, the Directive impinges deeply on the administrative and legal systems of many countries. There is also reason to wonder whether the legal basis is correct. It has been interesting to note that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy approved this Directive, and suppressed a proposal to reject it, by only 17 votes to 16.</p>
<p class="contents">For many of us, it is an ideological question why environmental organisations should enjoy a privileged position compared to other organisations. Through our request for a split vote on Amendment No 40, you can correct that.</p>
<p class="contents">Only last week, Commissioner, events in the North Sea showed that fishermen’s organisations have the same need for, and should have at least the same right to, access to justice as BirdLife or other powerful international organisations. Many of us share the deep ideological conviction that other environmental organisations, too, should have this right. We must not have some organisations that are more equal than others.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this whole debate has raised the following question. What is the added value of the Directive other than to give us a deadline for the implementation of the Århus Convention? This deadline could be obtained by means of a considerably simpler regulatory framework than the rather complicated situation we have at present.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the application of the Århus Convention to the Community and also the correction that we want to make to the Directive, we have every opportunity of achieving these objectives by means of good governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In practice, it reinforces the transparency of decisions in environmental matters directly affecting citizens and the latter’s chances of actually even influencing these decisions. I shall begin by commenting on the aspect of its implementation that concerns Mrs Schörling’s report on justice in environmental matters.</p>
<p class="contents">A proposal to reject the report in its present form has been presented; Mrs Thors, among others, spoke of this just now. I myself have some difficulty in understanding the reason for rejecting this report. The fact is that the European Union has signed this Convention. It is reasonable, therefore, for it to have a duty to use its regulatory framework to ensure that this Convention is also implemented. Surely this is a reasonable consequence of signing it. I believe that this will gain particular importance when the Union is enlarged by ten new members. The aim is to involve the new Member States so that, together with us, they meet the stipulations of this Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Reading the report, it is also perfectly clear that it does not prevent any country from having more progressive legislation. Each country is free to go further, to increase the rights in other areas. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy makes this clear in Amendments Nos 4 and 5.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a reason for the report applying in the field of the environment, in particular. This is the part of EU law with perhaps the poorest levels of compliance, judging by the number of Court cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the draft adopted by the Committee on the Environment could be improved in a couple of respects. Firstly, it should be extended to cover all decisions with an environmental impact, not just those decisions that are taken on the basis of Article 175 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important not to stipulate a detailed definition of the term ‘environmental organisation’. It can hardly be the EU’s job to do this. It is also important not to prescribe a restriction on who is granted the opportunity of bringing legal proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall devote the last seconds of my speaking time to Mrs Korhola’s report. It is important that this report cover as large a part of the legislation as possible. It is important that its scope also cover institutions such as the European Investment Bank, a major financial player, so that they have to comply with the obligations laid down in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that it is very important that the public be given a partisan interest, so that it is covered by this regulatory framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view, it is sufficient on its own, which is why we have tabled a motion to reject the directive on access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">More seriously, this draft introduces some unacceptable measures. First of all, there is the internal review procedure for acts adopted by the European institutions. What is the point of having Members of the European Parliament if their decisions are constantly challenged by NGOs selected by the European Commission, which is also the guardian of the EU Treaties? Then there is the Commission's attempt to interfere in the organisation of national legal systems; this provision is illegal, as it is contrary to Article 175 of the Treaty. Finally, there are the dispensations from both civil and criminal procedure, allowing NGOs to receive aid to take legal action and to avoid the costs, damages and interest payable if they fail: this measure is morally unjust and legally shocking.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain sustainable development, I also suggest not restricting the ability to take action just to NGOs, but including those who manage rural areas – landowners, farmers, foresters, enterprises etc. According to Article 9 of the Århus Convention, it is up to the Member States to organise access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">If this draft is adopted, it will inevitably cause implementation difficulties and legal uncertainty, which seems to me to go against the desired aim. To successfully implement this Convention, we must respect the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are not discussing the extension of rights to information, which we all, clearly, support. We are not discussing the Convention because, as has been said, this is not what it is about as it has been signed. What we are discussing is a rather more general issue, which we have interpreted, Commissioner, as the Commission trying to impose its will in order to make the Convention workable. This has also been well documented in the speeches by various Members and in the tabled amendments: that is to say what some Members have portrayed as an attempt to fast-track environmental legislation. From a legal point of view and given the legal background of the Union and the Member States, the reason for this is not understood.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I am convinced that this reason originates in a healthy concern, in good intentions on the part of the Commissioner and Members, but we must be very vigilant about this aspect, because there is the risk that we will be starting a process that will delegitimise our democratic institutions, made up of elected members, governing bodies, assemblies at municipal and local level; in short, the system of democratic guarantees that are the only supreme guarantees able to fully represent citizens’ interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, it is only right and proper to want to pay particular attention to the environment, and it is altogether desirable to want to involve all citizens. We must be careful, however, not to go beyond the limit of the so-called special legislation. When I hear Mrs Schörling talk about no limitations, neither time limits nor geographical ones, then the risk of creating counter powers becomes serious. If this risk were to arise in tomorrow’s final text, then I think that we would do well, as some Members have said, to vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, and with me a large number of fellow MEPs, find that the proposal now being discussed – and I am talking about access to justice, the Schörling report – should suffer this fate.</p>
<p class="contents">This is because it is extremely unusual for the European Commission to submit a proposal to implement the Aarhus Convention in European Community law by way of a directive when all Member States and nine of the ten accession countries have signed this Convention, and some have even ratified it. The instrument of a directive to force Member States to include the Aarhus Convention in their national legislation is therefore disproportionate. Furthermore, this proposal is based on Article 175, although it is in actual fact about the harmonisation of the Member States’ legal systems. This definitely cannot be done on the basis of Article 175. The wording of the proposal is also different from the wording of the Aarhus Convention, and this will naturally cause major interpretation problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I am naturally in favour of the Aarhus Convention, but I cannot but conclude that the Member States should introduce it themselves. They have undertaken to do so. The Commission’s present proposal is therefore both technically incorrect and superfluous. In conclusion, I would like to say that my group has very serious objections to this proposal. We have therefore submitted an amendment to reject the proposal, and I call on fellow MEPs to support this. An amendment of this kind in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was rejected with a majority of one vote, and that was not surprising, since just before the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy it was still being assumed that I would not declare this amendment acceptable. Nobody had therefore prepared for the vote properly. I think that we should be given the opportunity to do this again tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I cannot help thinking that this is also a matter of the status of environmental issues. Just imagine replacing the words 'environmental legislation' with 'economic legislation' or anything else, and you would consider it absolutely natural that you have access to justice; that you allow these groups access to justice or a say on these issues. Most of what we think would come naturally will also have to be introduced for the environmental issues. That is just one reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin by commenting firstly on the proposed directive on access to justice. Without a common framework with harmonised requirements, there is no means of guaranteeing that the requirements of the Århus Convention are met throughout the Union. We have signed the Århus Convention and that is the starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes to give legal standing to recognised environmental organisations. That follows from how environmental issues are defined here: what the Århus Convention is all about and what access to justice is all about in this field. It is restricted to environmental issues and it is clearly defined. This is fully in line with a Convention that gives a prominent position to environmental NGOs as advocating the interests of the environment, because on the environment we do not have a vested interest. We will have to heed those voices that take on the concerns of the environment. It is also done with respect for the principle of subsidiarity, as Member States are free to provide for access to justice for a larger public. Furthermore, it is left largely to Member States to develop the details of the framework. Much as I respect Mrs Thors, it is not always the fishermen who represent the environmental concerns when it comes to protecting the Baltic Sea, so perhaps that is not the best of examples.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments put forward, the Commission can accept those that reinforce the principles of the proposal, in particular where reference is made to national legislation granting wider access to justice. A considerable number of amendments, however, are not acceptable to the Commission. Even though I understand and sympathise with your desire to maximise the benefits to the public of this proposal, I consider that amendments which propose expanding legal standing to organisations which are not primarily or regularly working in the field of the environment add requirements which are arbitrary or imprecise. It is also important to provide as much legal clarity as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments weaken the scope of the proposal as they modify procedural aspects, such as the request for internal review which, in the Commission’s view, is important in order to enable the administration to reassess its action before transferring the case to the courts. In our view, the proposal is well balanced. It takes on board the obligations arising from the Århus Convention, whilst leaving to the Member States the necessary degree of flexibility which will enable them to implement the legislation effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the proposal for a regulation implementing Århus within the institutions. I would like to emphasise that our aim is the full application of the three pillars of the Århus Convention at Community level. These requirements proposed under the regulation cover not only Community institutions but all bodies that exercise public functions under the Treaties, also comprising the agencies, offices or bodies such as the European Investment Bank, to the extent that their activities are relevant to environmental matters as dealt with by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Here again, the Commission’s proposal has made use of the flexibility parties are allowed under the Århus Convention, notably in terms of organising the public participation processes and establishing criteria for access to justice in case of impairments of environmental law. While keeping in line with the Århus Convention, it strived to interfere as little as possible with rules and procedures already established and operating. In particular, interference with the Treaty provisions as regards access to the European Court of Justice for individuals needs to be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">In this vein, the Commission considers as problematic those amendments that would aim to deviate from the regime of exceptions set up under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on access to documents. Neither can the Commission accept amendments that result in being overly prescriptive on the arrangements for public participation and in enlarging the access to justice provisions to complaints by individual members of the public. Those amendments risk interfering with the provisions of the EC Treaty in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I will hand over to the secretariat the Commission’s position on specific amendments<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Once again, I thank you for the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
