<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this debate I would like to make three acknowledgements: I would like firstly to acknowledge the Commission’s excellent communication. The truth is that it has been many years since we had a communication with as much strategic vision and as forward-looking as the one that has been presented to us by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, and which is in line with what this Parliament had been calling for since November 2001 on the eve of the Madrid Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to acknowledge the generosity shown by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and, in particular, Mr Winkler — who is not listening to me, since he is having a lively chat with Mr Voggenhuber — at the Bregenz meeting yesterday and the day before yesterday, in allowing the European Parliament to address the Heads of State or Government, thereby acknowledging the role that the European Parliament has been playing in terms of promoting the enhancement of relations between the European Union and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the members of the Committees on Foreign Affairs and on Development, because they have approved this report unanimously by means of a very unusual vote ― 51 votes in favour, 0 votes against and 0 abstentions, and with no amendment to plenary on behalf of the political groups ― which demonstrates clearly the will of the whole of Parliament to back the report that will be put to the vote tomorrow. And not because this is an unambitious report, Commissioner: everybody knows that, as I said before, this Parliament has distinguished itself by being one of the great motors for this relationship and by saying that the decisive factor in moving these relations forward over the coming years is first and foremost political will and giving it clear support. We have therefore made some very clear proposals: we are calling for the creation of a Euro-Latin American Assembly which can give parliaments democratic legitimacy as the promoters and legitimisers of this relationship, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we would like the conclusions of the Vienna Summit not just to take account of the will of the parliaments, but also to recommend the creation of that Euro-Latin American Assembly, as happened in the case of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also calling for a renewal and updating of the ministerial political dialogue and we recommend the adoption of a renewed bi-regional political agenda, to include new issues: the threats to governability, the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the preservation of the environment and natural resources, bringing together the positions of the Member States of the European Union with those of Latin America in the United Nations, and many other issues which must be enshrined in initiatives such as the signature of a Euro-Latin American charter for peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, political dialogue and political will will eventually run out and come to nothing unless they are accompanied by actions that move us beyond words, and it is in this regard that summits – and there are too many of them – fail and are much criticised. One area in which we can clearly move on from words to actions is that of the commercial element of the association agreements. It is clear that we must make progress on the Agreement with Mercosur, since none has unfortunately been made before, though not through lack of will on the part of the European Union: in Vienna we must set a realistic timetable for the conclusion of that Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to speak most frankly: in the European Parliament’s view, the time for cooperation and political dialogue agreements with the Andean and Central American Communities has long since passed, and we recommend that the decision be taken in Vienna to move on to the association agreement stage. I am aware that there may be a degree of uncertainty at the moment given Venezuela’s decision to leave the Andean Community, but now more than ever the European Union must send a clear and well-defined message in this direction, in order not to strengthen the position of those people who are against the integration processes.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by mentioning two initiatives very quickly, so as not to take up too much time: the Facility of the European Investment Bank, which we would like to take the name of the Commissioner, because of her tenacity, of her having promoted a social cohesion fund that is a complete innovation within the European Union’s history; and an initiative that we do not want to come to nothing: that of the Bi-regional Solidarity Fund, a Fund which is not going to cost the Union any money, because we are not asking for any additional aid, a Fund that is supported by the European Parliament and by our Latin American partners. Though we are not asking for a complete commitment to this Fund, we are asking that it at least be studied and that it can be taken into account in the Summit’s conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union cannot indulge in navel gazing, with a policy of self-contemplation as in the legend of Narcissus: at the Vienna Summit, it must send a clear and well-defined sign of our commitment to a region which expects a lot from us. We also hope that the Commissioner and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will demonstrate their commitment to ensuring that, through everybody’s efforts, this Vienna Summit is a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much regret the fact that my knowledge of the language is insufficient to permit me to deliver a speech in Spanish, but working alongside the present Commission has been a tough educational experience to which I owe the ability to understand enough Spanish to understand what he said to me, for which I am grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">My participation in the recent meeting at Dornbirn in Austria was in fact, among other things, an indication of the Council Presidency’s great interest in enhanced cooperation at parliamentary level, and it goes without saying that the European Parliament will be represented at the fourth Summit in Vienna on 12 May, as will the regional and sub-regional parliaments of Latin America. That is a very important dimension of cooperation between the regions, and it is something that we in the Council do of course welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not lose sight of the fact that this Summit offers a unique opportunity to enhance cooperation, and I can say with a degree of pride that the holding of it was a matter of voluntary choice by the Austrian Federal Government, not least since it would serve as a sign of how important it is to us that this Summit meeting between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean should, for the first time, be held outside an Iberian or American context. I myself, working alongside the present Commissioner, took part in the first Summit in Rio de Janeiro 1999, and, if we want to draw comparisons between now and then, we have covered a great deal of ground, and that is something we can take pride in. I also particularly want to thank your House and, of course, the Commission too, for the ways in which you and they have helped make this journey a successful one.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is entirely of one mind with the European Parliament and the Commission as regards the EU/Latin American partnership’s most important goals and degrees of action, something that is made quite clear in the conclusions adopted by the Council at the end of February, in which the Council reiterated its determination to further strengthen this alliance in the interests of both regions. It is in our interest to enhance this cooperation if we are to promote our common values and interests and to make a joint contribution to peace and security, to the protection of human right and to greater public participation and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Social cohesion, sustainable development, the protection and enhancement of the global environment within the framework of the United Nations are topics on which we have established a tradition of good cooperation with our Latin American partners. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the good cooperation between most of the Latin American countries and the European Union where the reform of the United Nations is concerned, particularly over recent months. We are also very grateful to those Latin American states that have given remarkable support in reaching the decision on the establishment of a Human Rights Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The third EU/Latin America Summit in 2004 was held in Guadalajara and saw us making some very ambitious commitments, which, in particular, involve both partners in striving to adopt fiscal and economic measures that will facilitate the improved distribution of wealth and appropriate social policies. The European Union will continue to support these efforts at reinforcing democratic institutions, responsible governance and the rule of law and combating drugs and organised crime, including the trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The activities engaged in since Guadalajara amount to a very impressive list, of which we, the Presidency of the Council, have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy to your House, for circulation among its Members, and of course to the Commission, since we believe it to be a very important demonstration of what we have achieved in these two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is striving for a purposeful political dialogue not only with the region as a whole and with the various integration fora, but also with the individual countries, and Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra has made reference to the various negotiations that have started, are due to start, and which we are of course keen to continue. It is to be hoped that one substantial outcome from the Summit will be the beginning of negotiations with Central America. We are in fact somewhat concerned about the future evolution of the Andean Community, in that Venezuela’s recent announcement of its secession from it raises questions that need to be elucidated and answered on both the political and legal level. Only a few weeks ago, I met with the foreign minister of Peru, and we had the opportunity to discuss this issue. I can assure all Members of your House, and you, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, that we are very much interested in carrying this process forward, although the conditions for that must, of course, be right.</p>
<p class="contents">Thinking back to the debates we had in Dornbirn a few days ago, I would like to shed light on a few areas in which further cooperation strikes me as necessary, without wishing to go into detail at the present time. The areas in question are education, training, migration and the protection of the environment, and I believe them to be areas in which further enhanced cooperation will be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for the Summit to be held in Vienna on 12 May are in hand, and good progress is being made with them. It has been possible for senior officials to conduct and indeed conclude very important negotiations, and so we can, overall – and not least thanks to the help given by the European Parliament and by this report – be optimistic that the Vienna Summit will be a good one, with real substance and, in political terms, a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like in particular to welcome this excellent initiative and to congratulate Mr Salafranca especially on the great work he has done on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this report represents Parliament’s response to the proposals made by the Commission in its Communication of 8 December. I would like to express my most sincere gratitude for the political support that you have given us and for the way that cooperation between our two institutions has been strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as far as Europe is concerned, the current context is an extremely good one in terms of creating partnership with Latin America. On the one hand, the Council has been most receptive to our Communication and adopted conclusions in this regard at the end of February. On the other hand, the current Presidency sees the success of the 4th European Union-Latin America/Caribbean Summit, which will take place in Vienna on 12 May, as one of the priorities of its working programme. Thanks to the three institutions, therefore, the Commission has the necessary political support to continue moving forward. And I hope that this represents great progress.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not enough to make this Summit a success, however. As the English say, 'it takes two to tango’<span class="italic">.</span> While Europe is prepared to commit itself more to Latin America, I also hope that there will be a firm commitment on the part of Latin America. I therefore believe that the Vienna Summit also offers an opportunity to test the will and determination of the Latin American countries and I hope that this is translated into concrete progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to you that I very much appreciate the fact that our two institutions are taking the same line, because we are all convinced that creating a stronger partnership is timely, important and necessary for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Latin America is one of the few regions in the world that can be seen as a natural ally to the European Union, particularly given our shared values.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are many challenges that can be tackled more effectively by means of a reformed partnership and one of them is the lack of social cohesion, which affects both Europe and Latin America. I believe that it is very important that we make more progress in this field and I hope that there are genuine concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I hope that today’s debate on Latin America sends a positive signal to our partners, assuring them that Europe maintains a strong interest in its region. We need strong, solid and reliable partners in Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to deal with the next issue facing us, which is the Vienna Summit. This Summit is taking place within a context of significant challenges and exchanges, and also changes, in Latin America and the Caribbean. The majority of countries in the region have adopted democratic systems, they have embarked on ambitious economic and social reforms and they have a great potential for development, but unfortunately there are still great social shortcomings, mainly due to the fact that the economic progress has not reached the majority of the population and this is leading, or has led, to a degree of disillusionment with certain democratic governments, as a result of their inability to comply with the terms of the social pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Great attention has been focussed on the emergence of the new political movements in Latin America, which some see as a direct threat to the traditional political, economic and social structures. These phenomena do not have to be seen in negative terms, but rather we should see them within the context of an evolution aimed at achieving a fairer society. I do not believe that there is any need to stress how important it is for this transition to take place by means of existing and reliable democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Vienna Summit offers an excellent opportunity to achieve this visibility and to hold that dialogue on social cohesion, but also on regional integration and multilateralism. The Bregenz meeting took place within that context and I am very pleased that it has been a real success.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to move forward with the establishment of a network of association agreements between the European Union and the countries and regions of Latin America. To this end, I would like to recommend that the Member States firstly negotiate with Central America. This decision still depends upon the Central American countries clearly demonstrating that they are moving forward with their own integration strategy, but I am very optimistic, and I believe that these decisions will be formalised at the meeting of the Central American Heads of State or Government that will take place from 5 to 7 May.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Andean Community, the situation has unfortunately become more complicated since Venezuela left the Community a few days ago, as we know. I have spoken personally to President Morales and we still hope that the internal meetings within the Andean Community can open up a way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mercosur, I know that the situation is much more difficult, unfortunately, but I still hope that Vienna will at least provide strong political impetus in order to make progress with the negotiations that are running in parallel with the Doha negotiations. We intend to consolidate all of your cooperation in economic and development activities by means of aid programmes and we would like significant support from the European Investment Bank, to the tune of EUR 4 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we hope that Vienna will also be an opportunity to announce the creation of a transatlantic parliamentary assembly between the European Union and Latin America. I believe that this will be very important and will also bring the peoples closer together in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that the alliance between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean is stronger and more effective and that it has a long-term future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We wished to stress that, although these relations certainly have an important political dimension – well expressed by Mr Salafranca – they must also be seen and developed from the point of view of development cooperation and the strategic objectives and commitments that Parliament, the Council and the Commission set a few months ago in the tripartite declaration which we know as the European Strategy for Development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased that the Resolution that we are to vote on takes up our proposal that the eradication of poverty in Latin America and contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals there within the timescale set should be priorities within Euro-Latin American relations.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that it is important to acknowledge the efforts that certain Latin American countries, such as Cuba, Venezuela or Chile, are making to realise these objectives amongst their people and, even more admirably, their efforts to help other countries of their region so that these objectives can be achieved in their societies as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is very pleased with your Communication on a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America. For the first time in years, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the Commission and Parliament are using the same language when talking about Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Salafranca has presented an ambitious report which I am not going to reiterate. Commissioner, you should know that, when you defend your proposal in Vienna at the 4th EU-Latin America/Caribbean Summit, you will have the majority, if not the unanimous, support of the whole of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not good times for a proposal such as this, but many of us are convinced that we have a special opportunity to move in the right direction. The rapporteur has said that for many years we have been stating our good intentions towards Latin America, which is experiencing complex times both internally and in its relations with the rest of the world. It must resolve many of its problems itself, such as the current crisis with the Andean Community, but we must send an extremely clear message of support.</p>
<p class="contents">The Summit must produce a mandate to begin and, where necessary, to enhance, the negotiation towards an Association Agreement with the Andean Community, with Central America and with Mercosur. This is a minimal requirement below which there is nothing. If the Union does not take certain clear and unequivocal steps to strengthen our relations with Latin America and with its sub-regional integration institutions, we may not have another opportunity like this for many years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome his report because it is timely, because it is practical and because it has a precious quality: political realism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra reminds us that we must eventually adopt a strategic approach to Latin America, a broad outlook that aims to place side by side all the points that matter to us: the social aspect, the economic aspect and the cultural aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that many things have changed in that continent. Major new players have emerged strongly in the social and political spheres; we must take account of these new players, including, of course, the indigenous and mestizo part of society, which until recently was sidelined from the political process.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realistically consider the fact, too, that regional integration processes often mark time and, from that point of view, our experience can support and help the work being done by Latin American countries. Finally, we must bear in mind, as Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra points out, that poverty remains endemic in that continent: 45% of the population live below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">However, notwithstanding a few inconsistencies, the income produced by the Latin American continent, in terms of GDP, is equivalent to USD 2 800, or three times as much as that produced in China. That tells us that Latin America remains a continent with significant economic and income-related disparities, in other words a continent of inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">From that point of view, the Vienna Summit represents a great opportunity; firstly, in terms of making up for the scant attention that our institution, the European Parliament, has historically paid to Latin America and, secondly, in terms of investing in a cooperation measure that can genuinely overcome poverty and of preventing the political measures from being reduced to a sum of separate measures. We need the strategic outlook that the Commission is proposing to us and that the rapporteur has been able to take up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is only natural that the new Member States and those states bordering the Union have been, and will continue to be, of the highest priority to us. However, it is important not to forget the rest of the world. Unfortunately, it still sometimes feels as though Latin America has ended up being somewhat neglected, and that is sad. The course of development in Latin America is immensely exciting – if highly contradictory – involving economic growth, democratic stabilisation, reconciliation commissions and progress in terms of welfare. Chile has its first woman president. At the same time, a very large sector of the population continues to live below the poverty line. There is great inequality, human rights are violated in many countries, and populists have taken over in Venezuela and Bolivia. In Cuba, Fidel Castro has now been imprisoning opponents, persecuting dissidents and preventing his people from exercising fundamental rights such as free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and free elections for 47 years. Parliament has debated Cuba on many occasions. My group is very critical of the fact that the Council has adopted a softer line on the Castro regime and that not enough support is being given to the democratic opposition, the representatives of which have twice been awarded Parliament’s Sakharov prize.</p>
<p class="contents">A summit is to take place in Vienna in May between the EU and Latin America. We hope, of course, that it will be a great success. It is important to actually enter into the strategic partnership about which we in this Chamber have talked so many times and for which we have been calling for so long. Such a partnership must be a broad one. We have many areas in which to cooperate including not only politics, the economy, social and cultural issues and so on, but also environmental, research and security policies and, in particular, conflict resolution. We also need to reform our trade policy in order to increase mutual exchange in this area. Cooperation must take place on a long-term and regular basis. Individual summits are important, but they are not enough. As Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra wrote in his report, the parliamentary dimension could be strengthened by a joint assembly. Contact with civil society, for example with students, is also important in order to strengthen cooperation and the sense of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on his report. It was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and contains many positive and intelligent suggestions that we support. The unanimity with which the report was adopted shows how important it is for the whole of Parliament, irrespective of political groups and despite the slightly differing views on individual development processes, to recognise that we really must deepen this cooperation. The fact that we are so united on this issue is a strength. We wish to see cooperation that is long-term and of high quality and to which priority is given. Madam President, I believe that you will see the proof of this unity if you scan down the list of speakers a little, for it is not merely Spanish speakers who are taking part in this debate and engaging with this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very good time do so because, as has been said, Latin America is undergoing certain changes that I believe to be genuinely hopeful. These changes demonstrate that, in some cases, certain groups that have had no voice and practically no rights, are now democratically reclaiming that voice and those rights, and I believe that that is something that we must welcome in any possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is aware that we are not in full agreement on the strategy and objectives proposed in the report: there are certain disagreements, which I believe is to be expected in a situation such as this, but certain elements allow us to be optimistic and positive. I therefore believe that we must take a generally positive view of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like at least to comment on three aspects, however. Firstly, for us, the great problem – and we must continue to insist on this – stems from the definition of a free-trade area, and that is something we must consider. We would be much more comfortable talking about a global inter-regional partnership. This is above all because there is no consensus or unanimous view in the region that this free-trade area is as positive an idea as it appears to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, since two Austrians are here – an Austrian Commissioner and naturally an Austrian representing the Presidency—in-Office of the Council – I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the issue of feminicides, which has been discussed in this House on several occasions, must be given a prominent place at the Vienna Summit. I believe that the fight against the murder of women is essential, and should not be ignored under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is also important to remember the fight against impunity, above all because the many things that are being done in Latin America will only yield positive results if impunity is also combated in parallel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would ask Mr Salafranca to make one more effort, because, since this report, we have held the meeting in Bregenz – the third very important parliamentary meeting involving more than 90 parliamentarians from Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This concept appears in a very much altered form in the Bregenz declaration. The notion of the Euro-Latin American area hardly appears in it, essentially at the request of the parliamentarians from Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like my group to be able to remain part of the consensus tomorrow, but with an altered wording, because the Bregenz meeting has taken place and what we must do is listen to what our partners have said, since it is to them that this fundamental, important and strategic proposal is addressed. And I believe that we Members of the European Parliament should therefore treat the Bregenz declaration as a meeting point.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that there is a high degree of agreement, on the importance of this bi-regional strategic relationship, on establishing a European Union-Latin American parliamentary assembly, on regional integration and on the Bi-regional Solidarity Fund, which, incidentally, in the Bregenz declaration and as far as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is concerned, was also altered, because there was no mention of Latin America and the Caribbean being able to participate by means of proposals. If they are not able to do so, then we are not talking about a bi-regional fund, but about a European fund which grants aid to Latin America and the Caribbean at Europe’s discretion.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, therefore, I would ask – and I know that we have very little time left – for a final effort from Mr Salafranca so that paragraphs 6, 21 and 66, which mention a Euro-Latin American free-trade area, can be worded in accordance with the Bregenz declaration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also appreciate the way the President of the European Parliament Mr Borrell conducted these discussions in Bregenz, which concluded with the adoption of a final joint declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a key partner for the countries of Latin America, not only in commerce, industry, science and technology, but also from the viewpoint of assistance with the democratisation of society. Cooperation between the two regions has already reached the stage at which it needs to be institutionalised, which is why I welcome the proposal to set up a Euro-Latin American transatlantic parliamentary assembly to promote and extend information exchange and to provide a proper framework for legislative moves in mutual relations. Globalisation has levelled out information inequalities, and has hastened the transfer of information, which is why the human aspect of economic relations needs to be intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you for including my remarks on the situation for women and their position in these countries. The white slave trade, with the abuse of women and children as prostitutes and the inadequate representation of women in society, is an issue that needs to be resolved not just in Europe, but also in the countries of Latin America. Commissioner, I support the establishment of a bi-regional solidarity fund earmarked primarily for education, eradicating illiteracy and supporting social cohesion. However, I ask that the money should go where it is meant to go, that is to citizens, students, and the younger generation, and not to regimes that have problems with democracy. I wish you success at the summit in Vienna. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us hope, however, that the 12 May Summit will change all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">As ENP rapporteur I have had to recalibrate and accept that clearly our strategic EU interests have by necessity refocused on our Eastern European and Caucasus neighbours and our Euromed partners, as well as our strategic interests further afield in China and India. Nevertheless, to neglect Latin America would be at our peril. Not only do we share a common cultural heritage and fundamental Western values on democracy, human rights and the rule of law – as well as having a small piece of EU territory there in the form of French Guiana. However, in the scramble for natural resources we must not for instance allow China to collar the Venezuelan oil supplies, for instance, or cease to support the efforts of President Uribe and his fight in Colombia against the FARC drug-dealing Marxist terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">We face in the region a degree of potential instability now, with the rise of demi-gods such as Presidents Morales and Chavez in Bolivia and Venezuela respectively, who cosy up to the Castro Communist dictatorship of Cuba and reject Western concepts of freedom and democracy. Haiti is also a country which also remains lawless and unstable at present. Fortunately, the huge recent rise in oil and commodity prices has benefited much of the region, but we should celebrate the success of the Mexican and Chilean EU free trade agreements and look to extend these to a deal with Mercosur, because regional economic integration and multilateralism has to be the way ahead to prevent a breakdown in the fragile stability of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I sincerely hope that we can eventually have a Euro-Latin American free trade area by 2010 as suggested, as the United States of America now seems to have lost all interest in the concept of a free trade area of the Americas and instead is doing bilateral deals with individual Latin American countries which I think in the longer term will undermine the regional integration which is so important for our Latin American friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the key to Europe and Latin America’s relations — and we must not lose this overall picture — is the complementary nature of the two regions, which share values, ideals, history, culture and traditions and which represent more than 50 countries and more than a thousand million inhabitants. Together they can be worth much more than the sum of their parts and they can tackle the problems and challenges of globalisation much more successfully. If this is taken into account, the Vienna Summit can succeed. That is the direction we must take.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, let us not abandon the Andean countries just because one of them has cast the Andean Community aside: we cannot reward the country that has boycotted the Community, but rather we must reward those countries such as Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and – who knows? – Bolivia, that want to maintain an agreement with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rest is just pretty words. Some of us are more honest.</p>
<p class="contents">The terms laid down by the motion for a resolution and the Commission have nothing to do with equal and mutually beneficial relations. In reality they are calling on the countries of Latin America to adopt and apply the policy of the European Union in the economic and political sector and even to accept its foreign policy. An attempt is being made through this relationship, in the name of development, to plunder these countries still further and, at the same time, to intervene in their internal affairs in order to prevent progressive developments. No reference whatsoever is made to the lifting of the illegal and unacceptable embargo of Cuba by the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the grass roots and social movements of Latin America and the governments of a series of countries have already denounced and are fighting against the policy being proposed through the reports of the European Union and the USA and are looking for different ways of achieving equal, mutually beneficial relations for their countries for the benefit of the peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">We are with them and the Council is right to worry about the departure of Venezuela from the Andean Community; it is an alternative and progressive method of cooperation for these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Strengthening cooperation between the European Union and Latin America, by prioritising a two-way strategic partnership in political and institutional terms, with the aim of steering economic cooperation and socio-cultural integration between the two continents more effectively, are objectives that the party that I represent and also the common sense of the citizens and governments generally can only share.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions and the Member States, foremost among which are Italy and Spain, together with European businesses, have strong interests in that area, which appears to be one of the growth poles of the world economy. Italy, for example, has more than half of the businesses in Latin America with offices in Mercosur countries. We therefore support the Commission’s intention to broaden the dialogue and the subjects of mutual interest to incorporate the excellent recommendations in Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra’s report, while taking care to ensure, however, that the alleged need for greater promotion of trade does not lead to excessive liberalisation, resulting in unfair competition for European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the objectives of the Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra report are calls to fight poverty. In that regard, I agree with the need to support agricultural reform in South America; just as in Europe in centuries gone by, the dividing up of large landed estates gave a major boost to land cultivation and, in addition to solving the problem of poverty in our continent, it paved the way for its subsequent industrial development. I would therefore be grateful to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra if he were to expand his report along those lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is how it was and that is how it is now. It is a continent of great creative, artistic, musical and literary inspiration; it is a continent of lively and exuberant faith. It is a continent to which Christians from other continents look with hope. As European politicians, we also look to the region in the hope of close cooperation, and in the hope that we will be able to take advantage of centuries of cultural ties to promote the dynamic development of both Latin America and Europe in all fields.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to turn now to the Salafranca report. In his report, Mr Salafranca has laid the foundations for practical cooperation and has outlined a global policy and a comprehensive vision of a policy of closer economic, security and social ties. The aim of the report is to provide Latin America with European experience in the area of integration, by which I mean common structures, common practices, organs and institutions that function efficiently, programmes that open the way to cooperation with Europe and a willingness to take on the challenges of the modern world together with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Latin America is also wrestling with huge problems, however, which include poverty, social inequality, inequality of opportunity, social backwardness, the suffering of the continent’s Indian population, the lack of infrastructure, the power of the drug cartels, gangs of demoralised young people and apathy. In solving all these problems, Latin America should be able to count on the European Union’s help. This does not mean, however, an unnecessary proliferation of EU administrative structures in Latin America. Forms of cooperation should be found that will not result in a multitude of costly new posts in EU representations that are constantly being expanded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention one more thing: cooperation should include a clause for the protection of civil liberties and human rights. Latin America is a very sensitive continent in this regard, a fact to which its history testifies. Yet we are currently witnessing dangerous anti-democratic experiments in Venezuela, Bolivia and Communist Cuba. A clause for the protection of civil liberties and human rights must be applied unconditionally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hope the Commissioner will tonight confirm her agreement with the UN Commissioner for Human Rights that her office in Colombia retain the double mandate, including monitoring, not restricting its duties to simply technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Latin America is Europe’s strategic partner. I pay tribute to Brazil in contributing to nuclear non-proliferation and to several Latin American countries for contributing to peace-keeping operations in Haiti, but I also hope that the Vienna Summit secures support from our Latin American partners for a WTO round which genuinely targets development, not least because countries from Bolivia to Honduras to Nicaragua are themselves highly indebted poor countries and have most to gain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These grass-roots groups are fighting, in particular, against any association between Latin America and the Member States of the EU founded on the neoliberal idea of unhindered free trade, and it is an unfortunate fact that much thinking of this no-holds-barred, neo-liberal, free-trade kind is to be found in the Salafranca report, which also articulates the idea of Latin America being brought into line with what the EU thinks of as concepts of security. There is at present a great deal of change in Latin America, much of it positive and deserving of our support, and it is fairly clear to me, on the basis of this debate, that human rights are all-embracing, so that all of them – individual and social human rights and the human right to independent development – belong together. It is this all-embracing approach to human rights that we should make our own, and ideological speeches such as Mr Tannock’s get us nowhere.

I think that those of the 92 points presented that are in our common interest should be selected for rapid implementation. European businesses are investing in the region’s economy, and the European Union provides financial assistance with a view to solving social and economic problems. The Latin American countries achieved GDP growth of 3-4% last year, and are an increasingly large export market not for the European Union, but for Asia. The ‘economic tigers’ are fighting aggressively for the rich reserves of raw materials that are found in the region, in so doing restricting the chances for cooperation in this field between the EU and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to resolutions, we should take advantage of our cultural legacy and existing economic links with Latin America to draw up an efficient economic programme, based on common actions and benefits, in order to avoid losing out on the economic benefits of cooperation. As well as reports setting out a vision of future measures, it would appear that a review of the working procedures of EU bodies is necessary, in order to react quickly to changes resulting from the functioning of the global market that work to the disadvantage of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It strikes me as particularly important that I should point out – as I did, indeed, in Dornbirn too – that there will be, in the margins of the summit, a meeting of the most important business leaders from both regions, for it is the entrepreneurs who can help enable Latin America to enjoy greater prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to observe, for Mr Pflüger’s benefit, that there will also be a large meeting of civil society representatives from both regions, and to that we very much look forward. That, too, is important, for the promotion of civil society in Latin America is one of the European Union’s concerns, and the alternative summit to which you referred will doubtless be a very interesting event, and I hope that it will be well-conducted and peaceful.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Belohorská raised a topic that is in fact also of particular importance to the Austrian President-in-Office of the Council Mrs Ursula Plassnik, that being the issue of violence against women and of trafficking in human beings, particularly of women and girls. This matter is one of great importance to the Austrian Presidency generally and will of course be discussed at the Vienna Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García appealed to the European Union not to abandon the Andean Community, and that is something it will certainly not do. While we are monitoring developments very closely, we do of course have an interest in the sub-regional associations and organisations in Latin America remaining strong, since they are our potential partners, and we hope that the secession of Venezuela, which currently holds the presidency, which has not yet officially been accomplished and has as yet not been confirmed by any council of ministers, will perhaps eventually prove not to be necessary, so that we in the European Union may be enabled to commence negotiations with the Andean Community.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said, there are undertakings to be given by both sides; we in the European Union are prepared to give them, and our Latin American partners must of course be willing to do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have all worked very hard to achieve this, with some excellent preparatory meetings, such as the ministerial meeting on social cohesion in Brussels, meetings on immigration issues and drugs in Cartagena, a civil society meeting in Vienna, a meeting for business that has yet to take place, and, of course, the parliamentary meeting in Dornbirn. All of that means that we now have a broader basis than we have really ever had, and that is very important. Nevertheless, we still have a great deal of crucial work to do over the next two weeks, which, above all, will hopefully take us in a direction that will allow us to launch this association agreement with the Andean Community. I know, in any case, that the Austrian Presidency is putting a great deal of effort into this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, summits are always judged according to who attends them. To my knowledge, we have so far received acceptances from 18 Latin American Heads of State or Government. I think it is very important that this considerable display of interest must now be translated into concrete action. We will continue to build on it, because it needs to be the basis of cooperation for the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of substance, I should also like to say that, in addition to the topics we have dealt with today, the issue of human rights and the strengthening of the institutions will, of course, also be discussed, including the violence against women in Ciudad Juárez. I myself raised this issue with the Mexican Attorney-General in person on a recent visit to that country, and I know that he is taking a close interest. With regard to Colombia, too, I would say to you that we obviously support those responsible for human rights there, and also the victims among the population. The official responsible for these women's issues has recently visited both your House and the Commission, and we held very intensive talks on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I think, we have covered a really broad range of issues, but we now need to work together to actually achieve all of it, which will make the summit a real success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wished to make a very brief comment and make two procedural points which I believe may facilitate the vote on this report during tomorrow’s plenary sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">My comment is that the President-in-Office of the Council has no need to apologise for his Spanish, which I believe to be excellent, as is his will to contribute to the harmonious partnership between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. His presence in Bregenz demonstrated this.</p>
<p class="contents">My other two observations, Madam President, relate to Mr Romagnoli’s initiative to present an amendment on the agricultural reform. I regret that Mr Romagnoli has not presented this amendment within the time limit allowed for such presentation according to the Rules of Procedure, but if the other Members support it, I have no objection to accepting an oral amendment tomorrow in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Meyer’s comment, I would like to say to Mr Meyer that the Bregenz Declaration is inspired by this Parliament’s report, rather than this Parliament's report being inspired by the Bregenz Declaration. You are perfectly aware that, if I was prepared to make a concession in the negotiation of the final document, it was out of a spirit of consensus and not because I did not have a large majority in support of the positions we have adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say to you, however, Mr Meyer, most affectionately and frankly, is that when I vote or speak on my own behalf or on behalf of my political group, I do so in full acceptance of any significance it may have, and, although I have never asked you for this, I would nevertheless be willing to change the reference to the Euro-Latin American free-trade area for the reference requested by Mr Romeva, who is not currently in the Chamber, and replace it with an area of global inter-regional partnership, in the three paragraphs in question, which are paragraphs 6, 21 and 66.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the comment I wished to make, Madam President, for the sake of consensus, and I believe that tomorrow this Parliament will be able to respond in a united fashion, in order to ensure, amongst all of us, that this Summit is a success, above all thanks to the efforts of the Commission and of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
