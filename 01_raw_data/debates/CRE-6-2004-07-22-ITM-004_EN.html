Our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, welcomes the unanimous proposal by the Council that José Manuel Durão Barroso be appointed President of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our group also welcomes the Council’s decision, also unanimous, to re-appoint Javier Solana to the position of High Representative, in which position he has done good work, and, in two and a half years, by which time it is to be hoped that the Constitution will have entered into force, to make him the European Union’s Minister for Foreign Affairs. He will then need our support and our trust, and we welcome this decision too.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who have had the privilege of working with José Manuel Durão Barroso in the past – and I am one of them – can say unequivocally that he possesses the qualifications for the task of President of the European Commission. Even if you have not yet come to this conclusion, I have to tell you for my own part that that way he presented himself to the groups – all of them – yesterday and this morning here in the European Parliament, very definitely convinced me that Mr Barroso is the right person and suited to the office of President of the European Commission. Nor have I ever heard anyone in this Chamber question his suitability as a person. He knows what he is talking about, he is competent, and he can also communicate his convictions, something that is important to the European Union. I have also been impressed by his desire for close cooperation with Parliament, and what our expression of confidence in him today signifies is that, once he has taken up office we will follow him critically – but, of course, in a positive way – but we in this House will exercise control over the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate has presented himself as a bridge-builder and as an honest broker, thus demonstrating his desire to help achieve consensus. This European continent is so complex that neither one side nor the other can take decisions alone, rule alone, or cause its will to prevail. Europe has a future only if we, together, take the road of consensus and compromise. That is what José Manuel Durão Barroso is willing to do, and that is another reason why we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are of one mind in believing that we should entrust him with the task and the responsibility that go with the office of President of the European Commission.</p>

<p class="contents">I am here to present a decision, and it is one with which we have had difficulty. Our group has listened to you; yesterday and this morning we have put to you further questions in which we have set out our thinking about Europe’s future and the President of the Commission’s role in it. We listened to your answers and have discussed them, and the answers you gave today, in our group meeting this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hearings, in my speech yesterday, and this morning too, we have put four crucial questions, to which we expect answers. Now we have to provide our own answers to them. Is José Durão Barroso the candidate who will strengthen the Commission, as an institution, in its relations with the Council, with the Heads of State or Government, with the other institutions? Secondly, is he the candidate to pursue a sustainable environmental policy, a sustainable economic policy, on the basis of fairness in world trade? Is he – and this was the third question – the candidate for whom we Social Democrats will be able to vote, because he, as President of the Commission, will contend for social cohesion as primary need for our society, something that is a crucial element in Socialist policy in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">We have asked ourselves these three questions, and I will say something about the fourth at the end of my speech. To these three questions, our group has answered, ‘No’.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question was...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... whether José Manuel Durão Barroso is a candidate who can cause Europe’s values, first of all the values of multilateralism, in the face of a unilateralism motivated by self-interest. Mr Barroso, what I want to say to you on a personal level is this: if I had heard from your lips, even if only as an indication: ‘If the information I possess today had been available to me a year ago, I would perhaps have taken a different decision with regard to the war in Iraq.’ Even if you had only alluded to this ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and only once, my decision would have been easier, but on this point you have been intransigent. So, we return to the question of whether you are the man to, for example, make the EU the equal of other great powers, whether they be economic or political, and you have yet to provide us with evidence that you are. For most of us, you are still one of those who organised the Azores summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, a number of Members belonging to my group will, for the most diverse reasons, express their confidence in you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it quite clear, Mr Barroso, that the way in which these people have politicised your election has done you more harm than good.</p>
<p class="contents">Those members of our group who will express their confidence in you enjoy the group’s solidarity and respect, but the Socialist Group in the European Parliament cannot, today, give you a vote of confidence. I am sorry to have to say that but, should you win, you may well gain our confidence in the future.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President-designate of the Commission, in today's vote for your nomination as next President of the Commission you will receive the support of the overwhelming majority of Liberals and Democrats in this House. Your performance in yesterday's debate was assured. You heard this House out. You stood there. You answered our questions. I believe that you understand that, as President of the Commission, your most important partner will be the European Parliament and I cannot understate the importance of your continued respect for our prerogatives, your candour in the face of our questions, and your presence on the floor of this House. You have started, I trust, as you intend to go on.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats asked for clear assurances in three areas: super-Commissioners, gender balance and transparency. Yesterday you delivered these. Should you be given the opportunity today to assemble a Commission, we will be standing ready to hold you to those commitments in November and throughout your term. I say that not as a threat, but as a challenge. You have chosen an ambitious path and the right path. Hold to it and you will have our backing.</p>
<p class="contents">Having earned our support you can now expect a critical friend in the alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. You have won our backing with your vision for an ambitious and independent European executive. You understand that the Union is not a club of nation states with a few curious federal habits, but a genuine political union and that the Commission's role is to speak for that Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A strong and independent Commission needs a strong mandate and a strong and productive relationship with the European Parliament. By giving you our support constructively and clearly today, Liberals and Democrats are sending a clear signal that this is the Europe we want.</p>

The past we share, the time – thirty years ago – that we sang <span class="italic">Grândola vila morena</span> together, oblige me to be frank and perfectly straightforward with you.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Parliament, the Left has a problem: it is characterised by ideological decay, a problem as acute among the Greens as it is among the rest. The Right has a problem: it is characterised by authoritarianism, a moralistic approach, and neo-liberalism.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, life is complicated and love means telling the truth. I love you.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you declare yourself to be a man of the centre and a reformist. Now the problem with the centre is that they are opportunists. That, Mr Barroso, is why my group cannot have any confidence in your appointment. The fact is that, when you are with some, you are in favour of sustainable development, with others, you are in favour of the market, with others still, you favour the social dimension; when you meet God, you are in favour of God, and when you meet with secularists, you are against God being mentioned in the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I am sure you are capable of being a good President of the Commission. The problem is precisely as described by Mr Schulz, who was, for once, speaking with great clarity. If, for one moment during all your speeches, you had found it in you to show us some small change of heart; if you had said: ‘Yes, it is true that I took that decision, but it was a difficult one. In view of what is going on in Iraq, I feel rather ashamed, two years further on, of having been in the Azores, arm in arm with George Bush’; if, at any time, you had told us that, in view of what is currently going on in your own country’s society following your reforms, you were questioning the way in which you had carried out those reforms; and if, at any time, we had been able to feel that you could see what our problems were, we would have been able to say: ‘He knows how to communicate and how to change; we have to give him a chance’.</p>
<p class="contents">As, however, you have at no time been capable of such doubt, which is itself the most intelligent form of European philosophy, Mr Barroso, the Group of the Greens, acting in a frank, honest and clear manner, will not be voting for you today.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are elected, I will cheer you, and if you are not, I will advise you to make Socrates your holiday reading.</p>

We are not opposing any one person, but political tendencies, not only Mr Barroso’s and the Council’s, but also those of the Commission and of the majority in this House. This is a protest vote by the Left, aimed at the liberal model and also, in our present situation, at what I shall describe as the ‘Azores model’.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes us as healthy, and indeed vital, that such objections should be openly expressed, which does not exclude the possibility of mutual respect or even, if need be, the expression of convergent views over and above political divisions. In any case, this is what we will be doing during this Parliament, as we did during that which preceded it.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us remember what we are talking about here. We are talking about a European Commission and a President of the European Commission. I would suggest that the super-bureaucrat, Jean Monnet, is resting very easily in his grave because the Commission model that he wanted is here. If we have the Constitution, it is here to stay. You see, Mr Monnet hated parliamentary democracy; he found it inconvenient; it got in the way of an administrator's plan for the next five, ten or fifteen years and he wanted to have a strong European Commission. What we have today is a European Union that is effectively ruled by unelected bureaucrats based in Brussels, issuing directives and regulations with which this House can do nothing other than tamper.</p>
<p class="contents">Just look at the Commission! It has become a rest home for failed domestic politicians. When people have to resign from cabinet or if, like Chris Patten, they lose their seat in an election, they are packed off for five or ten years at the European Commission – a Commission that has proved itself to be unreformable. Do you remember that they all resigned in disgrace in 1999? We were told that it was all going to change, it was all going to be made better. Mr Prodi took over for five years, with Mr Kinnock at his side, and what did we see? We saw the Eurostat scandal. Have we really seen an increase in transparency? The answer is 'no', and so bureaucratic and bad is it that now we have over 3 000 working groups and committees within this bureaucratic monster.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso came to meet our group – which was quite brave of him in many ways. He is politically skilled, he is a good operator and a good communicator. He is certainly much better at all of those things than Mr Prodi was. Mark you, that would not be very difficult, would it? But he believes in a political Europe. He supports the European Constitution: a constitution that is bad for democracy; a constitution that establishes this place as a new legal entity; a constitution whose withdrawal terms are so unacceptable as to make the EU a prison of nations.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will overwhelmingly vote against Mr Barroso and we urge anybody in this House that wants to stop the European Constitution to use this opportunity today to send a message.</p>

When I listen to the speeches in this House I am always amazed at the differences in ideologies and backgrounds. However, it is at critical times like these that I recognise how hung up we all are with ideology and sentiments more suited to the 19th and early 20th centuries, rather than the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the great privilege in this House to be the representatives of the people of Europe. We have a duty to take real decisions on their behalf, not on the altar of any ideology but according to what we believe is in the best interests of the people of Europe. We have a duty to ensure that we cooperate and coordinate with other representatives of the peoples of Europe. The closest we can get to that are governments. The 25 sovereign governments in their wisdom have given their support to Mr Barroso and, if for no other reason, that is enough for me to give him my support.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, there is the fact that Mr Barroso came to us as the directly elected representatives of the people of Europe to put his case in each of our groups. Whilst Members may criticise his political skills or his unwillingness to give them the answers to the questions they wanted, at least give him recognition for the courtesy of coming to us. He set out a political stall where he could; he did not answer questions he was unable to answer. I know that Members in my own group asked questions such as: will this person get this Commission post? He replied that he could not discuss that because he was not yet the President and he did not know who the other nominees were going to be. I admire a man who is willing to say that he may have made mistakes in the past but now we are moving forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In his submissions and hearings with our group he spoke about his role as an honest broker. We need an honest broker to operate within the European Union because, despite what the ideologists may think, the European Union is not the model of something else. Its institutions are not imitations: they are unique institutions reflecting unique arrangements of Member States, intergovernmentalism, cooperation, coordination and – despite what some colleagues may say – democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would love to have somebody at the head of that Union who is and was a politician, who was part of different ideologies, who recognised the errors of his ways in his youth, who came forward and changed those ways to reflect what was most needed. It is not a left or right divide, it is not that the left is wrong and the right is correct or vice versa, it is about taking what is best from all ideologies to ensure we can deliver for all the people. It is not Boston versus Berlin, it is ensuring that we do what is right for all the people in Europe in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">We stand today at a new frontier, the dawn of a new era, when the old visions of Europe have been broken down, when countries that were denied the opportunities to have democracy and representation are being given that opportunity now. It does not bode well that we take the opportunity to play politics at this juncture. My group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, and I will be giving our full support to Mr Barroso's nomination and we hope other Members will do so well.</p>

I will limit myself to considering whether you are the right person, in the right place, at the right moment.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European system gives it considerable power to initiate legislation and implement policies, the Commission in Brussels has acquired, by means of the Treaties, the right to govern an ever greater part of the lives of 400 million Europeans, and it is to this development that we object. The problem we have is that of knowing whether you should be a means by which we express that objection.</p>
<p class="contents">Your actions as Prime Minister, and hence also as a member of the EU’s Council, have also shown us that, in economic and monetary matters, you have been so convinced a European that you kept very strictly to the Stability Pact and its principles. I might add that you also praised it at a time when Mr Prodi himself – and that is saying something – admitted that it was stupid.</p>
<p class="contents">In the answers you gave just now, you were very evasive on the question of whether we should have a position independent of the United States of America, and we well recall the disastrous initiative you took in organising the notorious Azores summit on the eve of the war of aggression against Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although you have been very careful and diplomatic in taking the precaution of not saying anything on the subject, you are a forthright advocate of the early commencement of negotiations on the accession of Turkey, which is an honourable country, but not a European one, whether in a geographical, cultural or historical sense.</p>
<p class="contents">All this ought to prompt us to vote against you as a candidate. Being aware, though, of what a courteous and highly cultured man you are and of the well-known presumption of innocence, which is applicable even to the worst of criminals – and you are not one of those yet – some of us prefer to abstain.
