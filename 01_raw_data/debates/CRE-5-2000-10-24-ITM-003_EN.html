My thanks go to everyone from Jo and Giorgio to Iñigo, from Dany to Frassoni, from Richard to Elmar, from Bayrou to Andrew. Thanks to you all, a new idea is gaining ground on the continent of Europe: the idea of a European Constitution. The concept of a constitution is a new idea for Europe, while at the same time a very old idea, dating back to the origins of the modern age and connecting us with the most profound debates on democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">To the right of us, we have Joseph de Maistre, the counter-revolutionary thinker, who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of a constitution, because a constitution is made – shock, horror! – by man and – surprise, surprise – for man. “But man does not exist”, he said, specifying that he had met many a Spaniard or a Frenchman and even perhaps a Persian, but “I have never met man. If he does exist, it has escaped my notice”. To the left of us, we have Karl Marx, the revolutionary thinker, who condemned and even scoffed at the idea of human rights, because, in his view, the human does not exist in the abstract, and humanity could not constitute anything at all.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of the twenty-first century, criticisms of these two kinds are still being levelled and, sometimes, there is nothing to separate the two. Nor, sometimes, is there any difference between the crimes and acts of inhumanity committed by men in denial of other persons’ dignity. The lessons we have learnt from the twentieth century, however, is if we see people everywhere only as French, Germans, Danish, Irish, Arabs, Hutus, Tutsis, Serbs, Bosnians and Persians, we end up forgetting our common humanity. Without this fundamental point of reference, at best there is mutual lack of understanding and at worst there is mutual killing.</p>
<p class="contents">The British and the Irish, the Serbs and the Croats, the Israelis and the Palestinians, the peoples on both sides can only exist if, as a precondition, human beings exist. Taking away their humanity to leave only their nationality is to take away the person. Then they are lost. They cannot accept the other as being the same. All they see is the enemy, and they destroy each other.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the European Community was born out of rejection of this destruction. We have managed to avoid war for fifty-five years! Strasbourg is a place that appreciates the importance of this record. This achievement within the Western half of Europe is something we wish to extend to the whole continent. Enlargement will guarantee this. With peace guaranteed, Western Europe has started to attend to business in search of prosperity. Let us not criticise commercial Europe too much, I speak as a Socialist: it provides greater wealth to all of us. Yet the European Union should not be described as just one large marketplace, it has other purposes as declared in the Treaties: European integration, freedom, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, fundamental social rights. Peace, prosperity, democracy and justice are values which, each in their own way, virtually all the Members and the groups in Parliament, and the majority of elected representatives and political groups wish to see achieved by Europe and for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy in Europe is in better health. Thirty years ago, great countries in the South of Europe lived under dictatorship, and Eastern Europe was subsisting under the yoke of the Soviet Union. Today, we have just experienced one of the last democratic revolutions in Europe, that of October 2000 in Serbia. We feel sure that, very soon, we will be joined by a democratic Serbia. What better evidence of the European Union than this association between the victory of democracy and entry into the great family of the Community!</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy in Europe is in good health, but European democracy is in a bad way. One in two European citizens did not vote in the elections of June 1999. It is not something that we are about to forget. One in two of my students does not know who Romano Prodi is, although they are almost all quite clear on Michael Schumacher or Monica Lewinsky. That tells us something about how far politics in general have decayed, and just how distant the European institutions are from the citizens of Europe. Some resign themselves to this state of affairs, and others are delighted at it, but not us. That is why we want to see European democracy being strengthened by a European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we actually have right now? We seem to have almost everything, yet in the finally analysis we have nothing. Seven Treaties, hundreds of articles, an impossible tangle of standards, preferences, regulations, procedures, core legislation and secondary legislation. The European Constitution does exist but no one has ever found it. It remains undiscovered, invisible, illegible and unintelligible. We want a proper constitution. Let us at least agree on this objective, and if we do agree, then let us state how to achieve it. Parliament is proposing one route involving two phases, two stops: reorganisation of the Treaties, the fast track, and adoption of a constitution, the gradual track. The report proposes these two phases as commitments that should be entered into at Nice, because it is possible. It also states that before being completed, there should be a European referendum, because it is a dream which we need. At all events, do not kill it off today. If we want to achieve it, then we can, all together, citizens, Members of Parliament, and governments of the European Union. Today, the 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament is stating one simple message loudly and clearly: the European Constitution is something you can achieve and something that we indeed want.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the issue I wish to discuss is far more specific, even though it must be said that some of us consider reinforced cooperation to be the panacea to combat the hypothetical freezing of the European integration process, supposedly inevitable due to the increase in the number of Member States following the next round of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Some would consider this to be the equivalent of throwing a lifebelt to enable certain states to survive the shipwreck of Community construction, and to others it involves creating a hard core of supposedly elite countries, or <span class="italic">patanegra </span>states, as we would say in Spanish, states that would, by virtue of their power, cohesion and weight, act as a veritable cabinet.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also, Mr President, those who see reinforced cooperation as the ideal instrument with which to create an “<span class="italic">à la carte</span> Europe” or a “variable geometry Europe”, in which Community solidarity and cohesion would be diluted in a range of various intergovernmental cooperation schemes. This would be a Europe that is neither democratic, nor efficient, nor transparent, but simply a self-service organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">None of these approaches seems acceptable or realistic to me. My report therefore simply suggests making the existing provisions more flexible by following clear and coherent criteria:</p>
<p class="contents">First, we must establish cooperation within the Community framework and not in parallel intergovernmental operations. Europe cannot be brought closer to the citizens by making its structure more and more complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we must maintain the unity of Parliament and the Commission and increase their participation in both establishing and developing reinforced cooperation. The experience of the Maastricht Social Protocol and of Economic and Monetary Union show that the participation of all the members of these Institutions is technically feasible and politically advisable, and preserves the coherence of the system and the participation of all European citizens in decisions that affect them all the time. Dividing up legislative and executive powers or replacing them with a greater number of bodies, secretariats, parallel chambers and the like does not lead to democracy but to inefficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, we must increase the scope of reinforced cooperation to include the common foreign and security policy and the common defence policy, which in the last few years have been crying out for a Community channel to avoid the dispersion, slowness and inefficiency that end up transferring decisions and the task of solving specifically European problems to the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, we must eliminate the veto and reduce the minimum number of Member States required to set in motion Community reinforced cooperation. I say “Community”, ladies and gentlemen, because this is what we are talking about, making Community instruments more powerful instead of replacing them. The dividing line between those who want a political Europe and those who want to reduce it to a market lies in strengthening the Community rather than intergovernmental operations, and not the opposite, as the President of the Commission explained quite recently in this Assembly. We do not need a Europe with divergent objectives, but a Europe with a common objective, albeit with various speeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need reinforced cooperation that is open, not closed, and which includes rather than excludes those current or future members that do not sign up immediately – a form of reinforced cooperation that acts as an impetus instead of creating further obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have had the satisfaction of noting that the proposals presented recently at the Intergovernmental Conference coincide in the main with all or some of the criteria I have set out. I hope that the spirit of Biarritz that we have talked about so much today will materialise, as spirits that do not materialise become ghosts and the attic of European construction is full of such ghosts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must thank the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its chairman for the kindness with which they received my report, the contributions which enabled me to improve it and the tremendous support that was given in the final vote. With this support, Mr President, and in the hope that our resolution will be useful in this final, decisive stage of the Intergovernmental Conference, I ask the House to vote for this report.</p>

<p class="contents">This resolution draws the attention of the Community organs and the forthcoming Nice Intergovernmental Conference to the issue of the islands, of island status, or rather the principle that island status as such should be recognised as one of the criteria for Community intervention because of the actual conditions which any form of island status involves for the regions concerned. Anyone who has studied the issue is aware of the mystery of the translations: while the Italian version adopts the principle that island status is one of the valid criteria for Community intervention, the French and other translations express a different concept and the English translation is ambiguous and could be interpreted in either way.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not focus on the linguistic issue but I will restrict myself to pointing out – because it is an important, historic fact – that the official version drawn up by the Intergovernmental Conference of Amsterdam, which was, moreover, in French, is identical to the current Italian text. It expresses the idea, that is, that island status is in itself an adequate criterion. In effect, the text which was officially issued by the Intergovernmental Conference – which I will pass on to Commissioner Barnier and to the Minister, should your legal offices not have already done so – clearly shows that this was the opinion actually issued by the Intergovernmental Conference but that it was mistranslated into other languages. I will not continue for there are more powerful arguments than the linguistic argument.</p>
<p class="contents">There are sections of the Treaties which establish the principle of cohesion and there is Declaration 30<span class="bold"> </span>which, in affirming and applying the principle of cohesion in this context, reads, and I quote the exact wording: “The Conference recognises that island regions suffer from structural handicaps linked to their island status, the permanence of which impairs their social and economic development”. It is not, therefore, on the basis of a number of languages or a number of translations, but on the basis of a fundamental principle of the Charters, of the Treaties, that is, the principle of cohesion, that we call for the islands to be recognised as such, as the possible beneficiaries of specific interventions and specific attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President, we are not begging: we are simply asking the Community to allow us to be citizens on an equal footing with the other citizens, not privileged citizens. If, for example, you look at the development chart, you will see that, in Italy, over the past few decades, it has followed the limit of communicability exactly: it has expanded and been extended to areas and regions which were easily linked with those which are more developed and has remained distant from those which, like the islands or other areas, had and continue to have appalling connection problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I come from a land, an island, which has always had this problem, a never-ending problem – like other Italian islands and, I believe, tens and hundreds of islands of other countries – an island which has always made a major contribution, which has always been firmly in favour of national development and which, today, values European development in addition to and alongside national development. The effects of development, progress, news and communications, however, have always reached that island, as they have reached other islands, years later than elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to be something more than merely the scene of the globalisation battle, if it wants to be a complete Community, moving, united in all its components and expressions, towards new progress and new civilisation, we call upon you, not to give us more than the others but to allow us to be citizens on an equal footing with the others. We are not asking for anything specific or tangible; we are not asking for funding: we are simply calling for this principle of island status to be universally accepted, so that the citizens of the European Union can all start the race on an equal footing, with equal chances of reaching the finish line.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moscovici,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen of the House, you wanted us to have a debate, this morning, on those issues regarding which this House thought it necessary to add to the opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference that was issued in April.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, you planned three reports: constitutionalisation of the Treaties, reinforced cooperation, and the ceiling on the number of Members of the European Parliament. I note, at any rate, that for today, the last matter has not been referred to us, and I am in complete agreement with Commissioner Barnier. The Presidency takes note of this, but the situation must be noted. It is one we regret. Who better than this House to give an informed opinion on this issue of major importance in view of the imminent enlargement? Finally, one last point of a quite different sort, which Mr Segni, backed by Chairman Napolitano, wished to bring up, and which I noted, the question of islands.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now return to each of these points, but only briefly in order to leave time for the debate. With your permission, I shall begin – and I would ask Olivier Duhamel not to hold it against me, I am not overlooking him – with the issue of reinforced cooperation which is actually on the agenda for the IGC, unlike the issue of constitutionalisation, which will come afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me go to the heart of the matter, focussing on the salient points of Mr Gil-Robles’ report, which I shall simply describe as excellent in my view. This is a point I already made in presenting the results of the informal Council meeting in Biarritz. I think it is safe to say that the conclusions of your rapporteur – as indeed he noted – for the most part echo the concerns expressed by the Member States in Biarritz.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Mr Chairman, I note your agreement as to the reasons justifying making this mechanism more flexible so than it can be properly implemented within an enlarged Europe. I note your concern that the institutional framework of the Union be respected and the need to design an accessible instrument, as well as your wish to eliminate the veto within the Council. All these are principles which met with general approval in Biarritz. I also understand your determination to prevent any interference with what you term the ‘institutional indivisibility’ of the European Parliament or the Commission. We are, once again, all agreed that the institutional framework of the European Union should be respected. There is no case for going beyond the Treaties or challenging the existing framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we have here a special instrument of an exceptional nature which is, of necessity, somewhat specific in relation to the civil law. Let me stress that there is absolutely no question of using this instrument in order to compensate for failing to introduce qualified majority voting in some areas. Qualified majority voting is indeed the prime objective at the Intergovernmental Conference. Nor is there any question of creating an <span class="italic">à la carte</span> Europe. However, in spite of the clear guarantees which must surround reinforced cooperation, such cooperation is nonetheless exceptional in nature, and shows that it was not possible, at a given time, for the fifteen Member States to come to an agreement on stepping up cooperation in a specific sector. Hence, it will not be easy to say that everything is going ahead just as if the fifteen Member States were involved, if you will forgive me belabouring such an obvious point.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, while respecting the existing constitutional framework, I must say I think it would be difficult to envisage more than a procedure for an advisory opinion from Parliament when such measures are adopted. As for the arrangements for implementing reinforced cooperation, these present another, more complex problem. I do realise the value that Parliament places on its own indivisibility, and indeed I understand it perfectly, but then, for that very reason, how is it possible to justify Parliament’s issuing a legitimate opinion as if it were a conventional codecision or consultation situation when in fact probably half, or perhaps two thirds of all the Member States might not be involved in this reinforced cooperation? In such circumstances, what legitimacy would Parliament’s vote have, if expressed by a majority of Members of Parliament representing States that were not involved in such reinforced cooperation? Would this not be another way of reintroducing, by the back door, the veto which you yourselves wanted us to get rid of?</p>
<p class="contents">Objectively speaking, this is a real matter of principle which makes it impossible, in my view, to adopt exactly the same rules within each area of reinforced cooperation as within the European Union, and this is all the more true in the very specific and delicate area of foreign security and defence policy. I think we must clearly keep in mind what specific situations this arrangement is intended to deal with. It must not become the norm, and it must be given a degree of flexibility, within the limits of a number of principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the constitutionalisation of the Treaties. I could confine myself to thanking Mr Duhamel, and to simply pointing out that his text contains a quite unwarranted attack on President Prodi – his were, of course, humorous comments – or even observing that he has not said exactly how he wants this constitution to be arrived at. Fortunately, his report is available, and the term ‘constitution’ unites, or covers, a number of requirements. Firstly, simplification and clarification of the Treaties. Next, the creation of a proper reference text clearly establishing the principles and objectives of the European Union and, finally, the distribution of competences between the various decision-making levels within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a question which Parliament, to give credit where it is due, asked very early in the day, as soon as it took office, in fact, in July 1999. It is a response to the real requirements which I have just listed. It is also true, however, that we must as a Presidency take account of the fact that the Member States have so far indicated that they are not yet ready to discuss a constitution, even if an illustrious list of political representatives has raised the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, it is easy to see why Member States are not yet at that point. While a constitution can provide a response, at least in part, to the questions I listed, it is a project which in real terms goes a lot farther than that. A constitution, by definition, is a fundamental act of immense political scope, in the best sense of the term. It cannot be seen as simply an exercise in tidying up the wording or even in assigning competences. In my opinion, a constitution goes a lot farther than that, and this future development, the precise shape of our future in Europe, is something that we have not yet clearly decided between ourselves. I feel we cannot talk properly about a constitution and plan ways to draw it up until we know what we want to put in it. As you know full well, that presupposes our taking certain political decisions, with a scope that goes much farther than meeting the three requirements which I have just mentioned. I note, moreover, that among the Heads of State and Government who did declare an opinion on this, not all were equally as approving of the idea, far from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me come back to the three matters I mentioned. Firstly, simplification of the Treaties. Yes, it is a laudable objective, and some brilliant legal minds have tried their hand at it. In particular the European Institute in Florence, at the Commission’s request – and I expect Michel Barnier will mention this – did so with a result which I would describe as extremely honourable, despite the particularly arid aspect of the exercise, but I do not have the impression that the authors of the report, to which Mr Duhamel refers, indeed – managed to avoid a certain contradiction between the objective of clarity and the objective of legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Treaties are not rewritten without affecting existing legislation. That is understandable. It is extremely difficult to rewrite treaties which have been negotiated, sometimes down to the last comma, and the next item in our debate provides an eloquent example of this. Next, there is – and once again it is inevitable, yet questionable – an element of randomness, which is understandable, in the decisions made by the European Institute of Florence. I am thinking, for instance, of the way in which the authors of the report attach equal importance to each of the common policies, even though their respective importance is obviously very different, and this is expressed by provisions which are also very different in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not continue, as we are not here, or I, at least, am not here, to discuss the Institute’s report. In any case, I noted that your rapporteur was actually proposing an alternative solution which would involve, if I understand correctly, making a distinction between, firstly, the provisions that would be part of a framework treaty and, secondly, the other provisions, particularly the common policies, which would form part of a protocol to be appended. What I wish to suggest is that, whatever the option selected, being personally not only open but also favourable to the idea of a constitution, this approach raises fundamental questions. This is neither a technical nor an innocuous exercise and we must ask fundamental questions before doing anything.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter is the distribution of competences. It is a question often raised, but less often debated. There has not, to date, been any conclusive outcome to this debate, but that should certainly not deter us from making some improvements. It is a complex exercise. We must take care not to destroy the aspect which has made the Community so special since the very beginning, this blend, which varies according to sector, but always very subtle, of shared competences. An exercise of this type must not upset the balance or cause us to regress, in the name of the principle of subsidiarity, as some parties seem to wish.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wanted to express at this stage. Speaking on behalf of the Presidency-in-Office, it would be inappropriate for me to say more, for as you know we have taken a decision to focus until December on the four key questions on the agenda. We are not unaware that other questions are being raised. A number of honourable Members have raised these questions, as have the Commission and Parliament. Theses issues, or at least some of them, will no doubt come up for discussion very shortly. The Nice meeting is going to be held, the conclusions of that gathering will be made public, and then we will have the situation after Nice. This will not necessarily be in the form desired by your rapporteur because, as I said earlier, not all Member States will necessarily be ready, but an extremely useful contribution will have been made. I think we will see matters more clearly in Nice, and I think it is the results of the IGC – for we must not underestimate the impact that the outcome of the IGC will have on our ability to go further – which will determine whether we shall be able to look into the opportuneness of opening up new working areas and, if appropriate, of defining working methods and a work schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">One last brief word on the way in which a text of this type would be drawn up, when the time comes. You rapporteur proposes adopting the method of the Convention. Why not, indeed? This method has, it is true, demonstrated its worth in drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Several Members of this House, but also representatives of Member States have already pointed out that the traditional method of the Intergovernmental Conference was certainly not the best method. I myself stressed that the method adopted for the Charter was an avenue worth exploring. Do we need a Convention or do we need some other method? That remains to be seen, including, moreover, the process of adopting, ultimately, the future European constitution which, I am convinced, will one day come to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">And now, one very quick word about the island regions. As usual, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with its chairman, and yourself, Mr Segni, brought up questions that were both extremely pertinent but also extremely complex. I shall attempt to respond as precisely as possible to one question. To tell the truth, I do not know the answer at the present time. I understand that our Italian friends, for the most part, have found some discrepancies between the different language versions of Article 158(2) of the Treaty, some shades of meaning and outright differences, which may give rise to differing interpretations. This question was raised as early as 1997, I believe, after the new Treaty was adopted but before it was signed.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information available to the Presidency, forgive me if I have to be technical at this point, it appears that the clear majority of the language versions, unlike the Italian version, as far as the implementation of cohesion policy is concerned, refer only to the less favoured islands and not to islands in general. It is clear, however, as you have stated so clearly, that this question is not just a matter of linguistic or semantic debate, but instead concerns an extremely important and sensitive issue, which is the handling of island issues within the European Union and the policies which may be set up and implemented within these territories. As I said, given the lack of information available to us, I am not in a position to deliver a definitive opinion on this matter today, but the Presidency is, of course, willing to help clarify the matter by, for instance, referring the matter to the Council’s legal department within the Council and even within the Intergovernmental Conference. I think we might then have more relevant information so as to be able to clarify the matter and, at that time, to give you a comprehensive answer.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all the information I wished to give you. I shall now end in order to leave the floor open for the debate.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, before I in turn discuss the two excellent reports presented by Mr Gil–Robles and Mr Duhamel on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which both have an institutional or constitutional dimension, allow me to begin this speech by responding to Mr Segni who brought up the status of the islands.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Segni, as I myself returned only two days ago from an official working visit with Mr Hatzidakis to one of the larger islands of Europe, Crete, I was able to assess the sensitivity associated with the dual handicap of underdevelopment and remoteness, even without a handicap that I personally know better than most, due to my previous posts, i.e. the handicap of mountainous regions that often goes hand in hand with remoteness.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to assure Mr Segni that, like him, the Commission itself has noted certain discrepancies between the various language versions of Article 158 of the Treaty. Clearly, these linguistic differences are prejudicial to a clear interpretation of the text as, depending on which version you consult, either all or some of the islands could be concerned. However, Mr Segni, I personally do not think that there can be any ambiguity as to the content, as the text of Declaration No 30 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam specifies that Community legislation must take account of the structural handicaps relating to islands and that specific measures in favour of such regions may be undertaken where justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Island status as such is not a criterion for eligibility. And that, I understand, is what you are lamenting. Disadvantaged islands are, of course, covered by cohesion policy. This is the case of many islands that I visit within the scope of Objective 1 or the cohesion appropriations, due to the very fact of their socio-economic situation and in accordance with the criteria laid down by the Structural Fund general regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Segni, I have decided to instigate a study on the socio-economic situation of the islands, in order to assess the situation and get as precise a diagnosis as possible of these island regions and I myself will present the results of this study, which I hope will be available during the second half of 2001. I will say in passing that these results will complement the debate that I also intend to instigate in 2001 on the cohesion report, an important public debate in which the European Parliament will take part and which will enable me to prepare the guidelines for the future regional policy for the period 2006-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the idea you suggested of introducing this debate into the IGC, frankly, Mr Segni, it seems to me that, taking account of the scope and difficulty of the other subjects on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference, it would be more appropriate to rectify the text according to the procedures laid down by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, as in previous cases of clerical errors in the articles of treaties, in order to standardise the different language versions of this article quite precisely. But I understand that, behind the linguistic aspect, your question expresses another concern. With regard to this, I have told you of my intention, at least before being able to respond and if the governments agree when the time comes, to get a clearer and more objective view on the basis of the study that I am going to commission on the situation of all the islands of the various Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to discuss, in turn, the two reports presented by José María Gil–Robles and Olivier Duhamel. On the report on reinforced cooperation, I must remind you that it is not a simple matter, and Mr Gil–Robles is well aware of this as he had to fight for it. At the very beginning of the negotiations, this issue was not on the agenda. We all fought, and I thank the Portuguese and French Presidencies for coming to realise that we had to add this issue of reinforced cooperation to the notorious three leftovers from Amsterdam. Thus, on content and form, I am pleased to see, that the positions of the European Commission and the European Parliament are very close.</p>
<p class="contents">After this IGC, Mr Gil–Robles, I think the instrument of reinforced cooperation will be more clearly defined and, if I may use this expression, more ‘workable’ in relation to the current content of the Treaty of Amsterdam. For the Commission, there are five essential components of reinforced cooperation. It must take place, as you said yourself, within the institutional framework, with a suitable role for each institution: that is the first point. It must remain open to all and, as I said earlier, it must be an instrument of association, integration, and definitely not an instrument of exclusion: that is the second point. It requires strict conditions, but also practicable conditions: that is the third point. Guarantees are needed for those not, or not yet, participating in reinforced cooperation: that is the fourth point. Finally, the fifth point: reinforced cooperation must not be seen, as is sometimes the case, as a way of concealing or hiding a lack of agreement on qualified majority. As far as I can see, these two issues, although they are sometimes related, basically have nothing to do with each other. I think that the report presented to you today, ladies and gentlemen, echoes these five features.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to ensure that this reinforced cooperation remains within the framework of the European Union and respects the roles of the institutions, in particular the Commission and the European Parliament. Furthermore, Mr Gil–Robles, most of the delegations to the negotiations in which I am participating agree that the future treaty should recognise an enhanced role for the Commission and the Parliament in implementing reinforced cooperation. We now need to work together to ensure that this intention or direction actually becomes reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore prepared to support the request in José Maria Gil­Robles’ report aiming to enhance Parliament’s role and I support the idea, at least, of replacing the consultation of the European Parliament in the first pillar with its assent. However, in our opinion, the roles currently envisaged by the presidency in its very latest proposals regarding the procedure for i.e. the CFSP, are still inadequate as they stand. That is why, yesterday, when we were discussing various points, I put forward a number of amendments which will usefully serve to specify or enhance the role of our institutions and the place allotted to them according to the pillars, in the context of implementation of reinforced cooperation. We must ensure that the required coherence between actions under the three pillars is also strengthened, a task that will fall primarily to the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, reinforced cooperation cannot, and must never allow the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> to be unravelled in any way. I would remind you that the procedure can be simple, with a qualified majority and the withdrawal of the veto, because we want to maintain strict conditions. Strict conditions, moreover, such as those laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, which we think must be maintained, may justify or allow for simple procedures. I completely share Parliament’s wish for the fundamental principles to remain unchanged, but I have noticed, Mr Gil–Robles, a willingness on your part to make some of these conditions more flexible, as in point 11 of your resolution, and I would like to exercise a certain amount of caution in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we all agree that reinforced cooperation should not – I have said this before and I will say it again – become a characteristic feature of the European Union. It must remain a mechanism that the Member States may use only when all the other possibilities for progress on the road to integration involving all Members have been ruled out or are not feasible. Reinforced cooperation must not, therefore, become the universal cure-all in order to conceal our weaknesses. To be more specific, I think that reinforced cooperation cannot be designed as an alternative to qualified majority voting, which remains and will always remain, in the view of the Commission, the main subject under negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">That concludes my comments on the report presented by Mr Gil–Robles. As a final comment, and this refers to the report presented with great passion by Olivier Duhamel too, I should like to say that the report on reinforced cooperation and Mr Duhamel’s report are both equal to the reputation of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I would therefore like to congratulate the members and the chair of the committee, Mr Napolitano.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the second report, which we welcome most warmly, Mr Duhamel. We think your report provides an excellent starting point for the discussion of the constitutional work that we are to begin immediately after Nice. Despite this remark, let me say from the outset that our duty, here and now, for the Intergovernmental Conference to succeed, is to concentrate all our energy and all our efforts on the IGC agenda as it stands, in particular when extended to reinforced cooperation. We needs must do this because we are a long way short of the target.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duhamel, you will undoubtedly agree with me that if Nice is not successful, there will be no room, or at least no credibility, for consideration of the future of European integration, at least within the current framework. We must therefore succeed in Nice, and open the doors to enlargement and to new and future reforms. First of all, however, the objective of these negotiations is to get the door open. Yet, inevitably, certain questions are now being asked, so forcefully by yourself, for instance, and must be asked in Nice, even if they are not the subject under debate at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Nice could be the beginning of the next stages of discussions on several related topics. First, the reorganisation of the Treaties. I thank you for the positive reference you made to the study by the European Institute in Florence that we commissioned, and I also noted Mr Moscovici’s constructive approach in this respect. I must, however, remind you that we had commissioned a report on the basis of the existing legislation and this is what we were given, but naturally, as soon as the contents of several hundred articles and several Treaties are assembled into 93 articles, since it is possible to work on the basis of the existing law – as, I think, the Florence Institute did – the legal interpretation of this new text is bound to be different. This is a good piece of work that constitutes a basis available for the future exercise of reorganising the treaties. That is the first point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the legal nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a matter which, as the Presidency said, may well not be answered in Nice. But, like many of you, we think that this work cannot be left at that and we must, perhaps in Article 6, give this Charter legal force. In any case, I will fight for that. My third point, finally, is the possible clarification of the definition of competences within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Olivier Duhamel’s report essentially slots into a wider perspective: that of a constitutionalisation that would go way beyond the current institutional framework and which would only be completed in the long term. It seems to me, however, that we need to clarify the current legal and institutional situation first of all, which is what your report also proposes as a first stage: “a reorganised Treaty”, as you say in point 9 of your resolution. Like you, Mr Duhamel, I think the European Union should be equipped with a clear, simpler fundamental text. It is a necessary and feasible task. We are not talking about changing the institutional framework established by the Treaties, and certainly not about increasing the competence of the European Union, but about making European construction more user-friendly. It is essential for European democracy, our primary reason for uniting, as you reminded us, that the citizens have access to a constitutional treaty, a text which, according to the wish of Vaclav Havel, all the children of Europe can learn at school without difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">The important work carried out at our request by the European Institute in Florence, to which I have referred, shows that it is legally possible to assemble all these essential elements in a single text comprising a small number of articles.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentlemen, the drafting of this fundamental text could be the opportunity to provide answers to other questions of a constitutional nature which will be asked in Nice and which I mentioned just now: the legal nature of the Charter and the clarification of competences.</p>
<p class="contents">Is a reorganised treaty, enriched with other elements of a constitutional nature, already a constitution or must this expression be reserved, as you yourself recommend, Mr Duhamel, for a new fundamental text which would be drafted according to new methods? The word “Constitution” does not scare me, I even think I have used it in your presence, ladies and gentlemen, at the very beginning, when I was not yet an official member of the European Commission. I raised the issue of the constitutionalisation of the Treaties during my hearing before the European Parliament, prior to the investiture of the Commission. I would like to assure you of my personal availability and even my passion, Mr Duhamel, which will be at least equal to yours, in order to participate in this work. I also agree that we should move as far away as possible from the references that you yourself rejected, in the context of our work on this subject: on the left, those of Karl Marx and, on the right, as you said, those of Joseph de Maistre, even if the latter, I would like to say, while stating my disagreement with a number of his writings, at least had the merit of being from Savoy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to indicate my availability and that of the Commission to work in the direction you wish, working through the process of constitutionalisation stage by stage. In any case, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear and must remain so: none of the questions we are discussing can constitute a condition to be achieved prior to the enlargement of the European Union towards the Mediterranean, Baltic, Eastern and Central European countries that are currently candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not in favour of calling another Intergovernmental Conference before the first round of enlargement. The reform of the institutions needed to enable this enlargement to take place must be carried out now and there must be no Nice leftovers, in any case definitely not the Amsterdam leftovers. Then there would no longer be any preliminary work at all on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the European Council in Nice could announce, in the way you recommend, a mandate and timetable for the work on matters of a constitutional nature. Again, I think that any discussions after Nice should be open to all, to the Member States and the candidate States, in a suitable form that we shall have to define. Finally, I think that the Commission, which has participated actively in the work of the Charter and which is participating actively, as is proper, in the work of institutional negotiation, will, after Nice, also have to play its part in the collective brainstorming that is related, quite clearly, moreover, to another exercise which we have undertaken on governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentlemen, my wish is that the Commission, in accordance with the other institutions, should mark out the route to be followed. It is ready to do so by means of a report to be drawn up following Nice on these matters of clarifying competences and simplifying the Treaties, which could be available before the end of the Treaty of Nice ratification period.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the continuation of the work, I will also say that the report you presented, Mr Duhamel, contains many very interesting ideas. Like you, the Commission was impressed by the quality and form of the work of the Convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights and I think that this method is one worth continuing and from which lessons can be learnt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You mentioned the idea of a referendum to be held simultaneously in all the Member States. This too, I feel, is an idea of great symbolic and democratic significance, and I think it is worth looking into.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duhamel, you spoke with great passion, and that is what this subject requires, given the resistance and reluctance shown by some. In fact, a great deal of passion is needed here, and that is what we need now, too, in order to make a success of the institutional reform. We need a great deal of passion, both on your part and on ours, in order to make a breakthrough. By way of a thank you for the response, and the amount of attention you are giving this constitutional debate, let me remind you of the additional dimension it has in relation to all the complex matters we are working on in the context of negotiations for institutional reform, such as qualified majority voting and the weighting of votes, which are subjects that are not easy to understand and which must be explained to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues of a possible constitution, a fundamental treaty, the clear definition of competences and the Charter all have one common feature: the fact that they have a political and a democratic dimension, I was about to say a citizens’ dimension. These will give the Nice talks, even if they have to be gone into in further detail after Nice, that citizens’ dimension which the European Union needs. It has been my opinion for a long time that the main failing of the construction of Europe is that it is a matter for the elite. Admittedly it is sometimes handled with courage and tenacity, but it remains in the hands of the elite, behind closed doors, to some extent, as far as the general public is concerned. The worst scenario for the construction of Europe in the days to come is that this silence will be maintained, as silence is what fuels fears. This silence encourages all sorts of demagoguery and all sorts of anti-European campaigns. We must break this silence and initiate debate involving the public, and it is by means of initiatives such as yours, Mr Duhamel, initiatives which can speak to the hearts and minds of our citizens that we shall be able to contribute towards redressing this democratic deficit. So that is also why I wished to thank you, as well as to thank you for the form and the content of the initiative you have taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Barnier, you made this point a moment ago, and rightly so. The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats will therefore use its large majority to vote in favour of Olivier Duhamel’s outstanding report, which focuses on the essential aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">During the first phase, we will need a constitutional treaty that will amalgamate the existing foundations of the Treaties of the European Union currently in force, in a clear and comprehensible manner. At the same time, however, this constitutional treaty should be elaborated in such a way that it renders the common values of the European Union comprehensible, incorporates the fundamental rights of the European citizens laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and improves the composition, role, and <span class="italic">modus operandi </span>of the European Union’s bodies, looking beyond the Nice Summit, thereby improving their efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">What this European constitution will also need to do is clearly establish the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union, inject the dynamism of European integration into those areas where it is badly needed, and provide for joint action to be taken, for example in the sphere of foreign and security policy. It is also important, in this context, to respect and safeguard the lowest layer of democracy and local self-administration in the EU Member States. We must not, as has already happened with a number of directives, end up with an interplay of European and national bureaucracies which restricts and overrides the citizen’s ability to shape policy at a local level. We therefore propose that local self-administration should form an integral part of a future European constitution and would urge you to endorse this proposed amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It outlines the framework within which reinforced cooperation is to be developed and sets out the conditions that govern it.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework must be enforceable both on the countries that want to participate in closer cooperation and on those that are not participating in it or at least not from the start. Reinforced cooperation must therefore respect the principles set out in the Treaties and be conducted within the single institutional framework of the Union. On the other hand, it must not constitute a barrier to trade or precipitate splits in the common market, breaks in the links of solidarity and cohesion between the Member States or, as Commissioner Barnier has said, an unravelling of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of reinforced cooperation must not result in new bodies being set up to swell the ranks of the European institutions. In stressing this point, the joint memorandum from the Benelux countries, as well as Mr Gil-Robles’ report, rejects the idea of having a specific secretariat or directorate for each and every closer cooperation initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Openness and transparency must be ensured under all circumstances. No Member State should ever be refused the chance to participate, at any time, in an existing area of reinforced cooperation, and this guarantee must be extended to include future Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is quite correct in firmly stressing the need for the Commission’s powers of initiative and the participation of Parliament, at least on a consultation procedure basis, to be the norm whenever there is reinforced cooperation. Moreover, reinforced cooperation within the three pillars will initially have the objective of moving further towards European integration. It may also prove essential if we are to overcome persistent obstacles. On the other hand, should the effect of this reinforced cooperation be to destroy institutional balances, to exclude the Commission and to throw off the democratic control of the European Parliament, it would not be achieving its aims and it would be better to dispense with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If by chance she should nonetheless do so, it is doubtful if she would be any the wiser. Not even very committed EU cognoscenti could easily plough through those Treaties which in fact regulate a whole range of our common activities here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaties are difficult to understand, at times contradictory, difficult to read and uninspiring. Beautiful and important European values are jumbled together with technical clauses in an unholy mess. This is really quite unacceptable. If we want to increase knowledge about the European project, as well as commitment to it, there is a minimum requirement that it must be simple to find out how the Union is run and why it is run in that way. That is not the case today, a fact which Mr Duhamel’s report does an excellent job of bringing out.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Nice Summit, which we all hope will be successful, it is important to take this next step in order to create a more democratic Union. It is time to review the Treaties. For my group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, it is important that, to begin with, the European Treaties should be made more citizen-friendly. This means simplifying, rearranging and pruning them. The proposal from the Florence institute suggests a place to start, but the next step is to create a proper European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe need, deserve and, according to opinion polls, want a common constitution clearly expressing the EU’s values and objectives and clarifying the division of power and responsibility both between the institutions and between the institutions and the Member States. People’s rights ought to be regulated by incorporating the conclusions from the Convention. This is an exciting process. It is certainly not simple, but it is incredibly important. Naturally, people must be enabled to participate in this work, especially citizens of the candidate countries which will hopefully be members in a few years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The work must under no circumstances be used as an excuse to delay enlargement. A constitution is a matter for the <span class="italic">whole</span> of Europe. Work on the constitution ought to be informed by an ambition both to simplify matters and to remove some of the tasks carried out by the EU. This is necessary if the EU is to be able to function in the future. A clearer distribution of powers is required, as well as a clearer definition of the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We learned a very great deal from the work of the Convention. It is a working method which, with certain changes, ought to be used to give people a still more important place in the process. A future European constitution must not be a product off the Brussels drawing board.</p>
<p class="contents">Vaclav Havel said in this Chamber, and Commissioner Barnier quoted him recently, that he wanted to see a European constitution which could be handed out to, and understood by, every eleven year-old in Europe. I think that is a very commendable objective. The decision to embark upon the work must be taken today. It is a hopeful sign that the French Presidency is favourably disposed to this. I shall now do what I can to convince my fellow countrymen to run with the ball during Sweden’s Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This knowledge is intrinsic to modern democracy and is at the heart of the constitution of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council is violating this fundamental consensus within Europe, by refusing to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties, make it legally binding and denying the citizens, whose rights are being infringed, access to the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamental rights constitute an essential defence against the state. It is therefore ironic that the Heads of State and Government should be the ones making the decisions about the fundamental rights of the citizens of Europe. Is it any wonder that these heads of governments refuse to submit to the regime prescribed by the Charter, and make it legally binding? The Council’s claim to power is the main stumbling block in the current constitutional process and it is the root cause of the Union’s democratic deficit. Not only do the Heads of State and Government want to be the <span class="italic">de facto </span>and sole legislators of the Union; they also want to be its government. Who can still doubt that they regard themselves as the sole providers of the Union’s constitution? To a large extent excluding Parliament, the citizens and – where possible – excluding the Commission too. It has always been the task of democracy to curb the power of princes. The question we must ask ourselves today is whether we want a Europe ruled by princes or a European democracy. If we want a European democracy then we must initiate a constitutional process and make the Charter of Fundamental Rights its cornerstone.</p>

After all, it concerns the all-important question of how the process of European unification is to be further developed. It is about the future of the European Union. As is well known, opinion on this differs widely in the various Member States and amongst the various forces of society. This is also replicated in my own group. As I see it, this diversity of opinion is indispensable, and also enriches the process, because if we want to build a common European house, we must keep a close eye on whether everyone is keen to live there and also accepts it as their own.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous round of European elections showed us just how far the Union still has to go to achieve this goal: low election turn-out, prejudice, justifiable frustration at the lack of democracy and transparency, over-regulation, bureaucracy and opaque decision-making processes. Unfortunately, none of this has changed yet. But there is an extremely urgent need for radical change. Our Parliament, as the only institution of the Union to have democratic legitimacy, has a big responsibility to lead the way in this respect. Which is precisely why I welcome this report. We need to simplify and reorganise the Treaties as a matter of urgency. The text of the Treaties must be comprehensible, above all from the point of view of the citizens. We need to instigate a constitutional process. The Nice Summit must pave the way for this by granting the necessary mandate, initiating a procedure and setting a timetable. Having said that, Mr President, I am more than sceptical about one particular aspect. Firstly, I do not think we will be able, realistically speaking, to adopt the constitution called for in the report in time for next elections in 2004, and secondly, nor should we in my opinion. After all, it is unacceptable for the fifteen Member States alone to discuss and decide on a constitution, when we all know full well that by the end of this decade the European Union will have 27 members.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, there are three key points: firstly, we need a truly wide-ranging public debate in all the Member States. Secondly, the candidate countries must be directly, and fully, involved. Thirdly, I am absolutely convinced that a constitution could only have democratic legitimacy if it were to be made the subject of a Union-wide referendum, because what this in fact amounts to is something akin to the re-establishment of the Union by its citizens. Should we do otherwise, then I do not think a Europe of the citizens will be within our reach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main aim behind this, which is not clearly stated in the resolution, would be to lay down for Europe, even for the fundamental texts, majority-style collective decision-making procedures, completely different, therefore, to the unanimous Council votes or the votes on ratification by Member States used today to amend the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">These collective procedures would for once and all establish a supranational power in Europe. We should nevertheless first ask ourselves what exactly our citizens want for the Europe of tomorrow. Their desire is quite clear and was restated with great clarity by the Danish people in their referendum. Our citizens see the national authorities as the most legitimate, and want the main decisions to be taken at national level. We must therefore conclude that if European cooperation is to remain democratic and close to the people, it must be based on the prevailing situation in each nation. Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we appended a minority opinion to the European Parliament report and tabled several amendments, which are, in fact, more than amendments, because if they were adopted, the whole meaning of the resolution would be overturned. Europe needs a Charter that acknowledges the pre-eminence of its national democracies, not a constitution that would turn it into a superstate.</p>

A constitution! That is strange enough in itself, but what will this constitution bring? In its form, so much hot air! In its content, nothing but jiggery-pokery! As to the results it will achieve, a disappearing trick!</p>
<p class="contents">The hot air as regards the form is to be found, for example in paragraph 11 of the French version of the Duhamel report, a constitution against, I quote, “a backward step” going backwards. But a backward step is always backwards! Paragraph 20 speaks of a constitution to discuss, and I quote, “their shared future together”. But if this future is shared, then obviously they are together. Paragraph 8 states that the constitution will deal with, and I quote, the “issues not settled”. Well, outstanding accounts may be described as ‘not settled’, and there may be answers outstanding, but not issues. According to paragraph 4, we need a constitution because the Treaties are “unreadable and invisible”. If it is unreadable, people must have attempted to read it, so it cannot be invisible, and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">What is so serious about Mr Tautology’s report is the fact that he is proposing a constitution based on jiggery-pokery. First our nations are abused by this sort of constitutional rapist fiddling with their equality. In the enhanced European house, some nations will be sitting at the military, monetary, and possibly tax, tables, and others will be left out. In an <span class="italic">à la carte</span> Europe, we will then have some nations eating from the set menu. That is why reinforced cooperation means reinforced exclusion. As nations cannot withstand this attack on their equality, democracy is being abused.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 8 of the constitutional resolution states that Europe’s constitution must be adopted, and I quote, “with no risk of the process being blocked” and, as paragraph 7 of the Duhamel report says, “without a referendum” there can be no democracy. And that is where the jiggery-pokery becomes abuse. The rule of unanimity with the sanction of a veto, if required, is the last bastion protecting the smaller nations and sovereignty. Because it proved impossible to simply do away with the rule of unanimity, it is being sidestepped by means of reinforced cooperation, which is nothing more than the abuse of sovereignty. Who stands to benefit from this? The unemployed? Pensioners on EUR 700 a month? Street children? The Palestinian children of European society? No, it will be the elite that profits from this, the caste which goes by the name of Olivier, Pierre, Dany, all their fathers’ sons, the oligarchy. That is why men and women prefer Zidane and Schumacher, because at least with Zidane, they have the dream of breaking out of the social Palestine in which you imprison them, whereas, with Prodi, the prospect every morning, every evening and every day is gloomy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not the name though, but the practical form it takes, that will decide whether it will serve the interests of the European Union. The report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs argues that differentiation can only be deemed to serve any purpose if it is conceived as a process which allows for exceptions to the rule. However, it seems to me that the report inclines in the opposite direction. I have always rejected any form of differentiated integration for reasons pertaining to legal theory, but also for pragmatic reasons, believing that it would allow a majority of Member States to determine the direction of policy, and deny countries joining at a later stage any codecision rights in these matters. I still clearly recall how, in the time before Amsterdam, in what was still the institutional committee, discussions on flexibility went on for weeks. The arguments against and the warnings about a multi-speed Europe, are still ringing in my ears. No one has been able to explain to me yet why things are any different now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the intergovernmental conference in Amsterdam inserted a special reference to islands into Article 158 on economic and social cohesion, adding the word “islands” as a special category under the regions which deserve particular attention within the context of cohesion policies, we here in the European Parliament who had first fought for this development thought that it marked the start of a new era for island regions. This conviction was strengthened when declaration No 30 to the new Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted, stating that the intergovernmental conference recognised that island regions faced different problems due to their island status which, because they were permanent problems, hampered their economic and social development, adding that the intergovernmental conference also recognised that Community law should take account of these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, our hopes were dashed because, in addition to all their other problems, islands are paying the price for the different translations of the point in question. According to the first version, the text covers all islands, whereas according to the second version, it only applies to islands with problems. Obviously the second version is incorrect, first because regions lagging behind economically are, in any case, covered by the Structural Funds and, secondly, because if this interpretation were correct, there would have been no point in adopting declaration No 30.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, I should like to reiterate that the European Parliament has always highlighted the fact that island regions are at a permanent disadvantage by reason of their isolation. Commissioner Barnier, who was in Crete last weekend and whose position I welcome, saw the ships tied up in the harbours in Crete. They have been tied up for five days now and their cargo is not being moved. The cost of transportation from an island to the mainland is three times the cost of transportation by road. Farmers are often forced to cultivate a product and, if the product does not do well, it is destroyed. A kilo of oil, which is a staple product of the Greek islands, costs less than a packet of cigarettes. And let us not forget that these people sometimes die on small islands when the weather prevents them from being moved to the mainland. We must therefore move in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the method, which is a tired, lifeless procedure according to public opinion, which in fact marginalises the other institutions of the European Union and in which governments are victims of their own labyrinth.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, with regard to an inadequate agenda, which has left out issues that are particularly relevant to the future of the European Union and its citizens’ interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of everything, however, at least the agenda has included one very important point, reinforced cooperation, which must be seen as an incentive for progress and not for dispersal or creating cabinets. We must ask for maximum progress to be made in this field in a coherent manner – as indicated in Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado’s excellent report – seeing reinforced cooperation as a last resort that would make it possible in all areas in which decisions are not taken by a qualified majority and also with regard to the CFSP and defence, for the permanence of the single institutional framework to be guaranteed, for a sufficient critical mass of countries to take part in it and, of course, for it to be open at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">This will help to stimulate European construction beyond this IGC and possibly in spite of this IGC. In order to achieve this objective we must ask the Nice Council to open up the important reformist approach that can bring together political consensus and public support. I am referring to a constituent process of the European Union that would form a new stage – as proposed in the Duhamel report – first by simplifying the treaties and then through a new political instrument creating a system to put an end to the democratic deficit within the European Union. This would be a system of government in keeping with those we use to run our national affairs, beginning with the separation of powers and other principles of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a constitution for the European Union, and this constitution must start right now by including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the new Treaty in Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yes, the intergovernmental method, in which one blockage appears after another, is close to collapse and this is not going to be belied by the Treaty being presented on the cheap at Nice. Yes, it is in the greater interest of the democracy of our continent to have a new founding text and a clear and effective constitution. And yes, the drafting of this fundamental law must be steered by the most direct representatives of our citizens, the European Parliament, and must be ultimately validated by the citizens themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">What would happen, however, if the work of the Convention described in the Duhamel report were to become bogged down indefinitely and this constitution which so many people, from Fischer to Chirac, wish to see, were not to be declared until 2004? In this case, as stated in my Group’s Amendment No 37, we should have to go back, in order to reach a decision, to the sovereign people and give the European Parliament that will be elected in 2004 a clear mandate for a constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue is a political one and must be tackled and resolved once and for all as such. I find it difficult to understand how it is that the Treaty can call for social and economic cohesion to be achieved if, years on, we have still not succeeded in eliminating the ambiguity of the treatment reserved for the islands, which is due to the contradiction between Article 158 of the Treaty and Declaration 30 on the island regions, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Can we not, at last, put an end to this ridiculous line of reasoning which decrees that some islands shall be disadvantaged and others privileged solely on the basis of how far they are from land? I represent the constituency which contains the two largest islands in the Mediterranean – Sicily and Sardinia – and I can say in all honesty that both islands are severely disadvantaged in structural terms precisely because they are islands.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by calling upon Parliament to make every effort to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference restores to the islands their right to grow and develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, the unity of Europe cannot but be political. A simple single economic area, even with a single currency, is no replacement for political Union. We cannot put this sort of limitation on our ambitions because that would presage the break-up of the Union, even of economic Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, it would be best if we had or if, in Nice, we could set up institutions to take single common decisions by a suitable majority, possibly a double majority of populations and Member States, which are binding on us all. No such institutions exist, or at least not to the required extent. Even if all the demands of the French Presidency for qualified majority voting are accepted, large areas of political cooperation will remain uncovered. Reinforced cooperation is therefore a de facto requirement, not as an ideal solution, it is certainly not that, but as a practical solution in a time of need, of vital need. We must accommodate the Member States which are willing and have the power to move forward and block the Member States which are not willing to move forward. The danger, however, is that reinforced cooperation will break up the unity of Europe through the back door, resulting in a patchwork of intergovernmental cooperation. Cooperation must therefore offer all the guarantees proposed by the rapporteur, be open to all the Member States, respect the spirit of the Treaties and not undermine the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">We need Parliament to control these issues, but I share the view of the President-in-Office that control must not turn into a new veto. If, therefore, we insist that Parliament must be able to exercise preventive control, we will have to confine ourselves to controlling questions of legality, not political expediency. In addition, the initiative of the Member States ought to be non-binding; more importantly it cannot be subject to a Commission proposal for an initiative because that would do away with the initiative of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the Gil-Robles report, I can simply say that it is an example of sound work carried out by our Committee and that the vast majority of our Group will support the report. The Duhamel report took a long time to prepare and its content is substantial and interesting. I would like to highlight two amendments tabled by our Group.</p>
<p class="contents">The first amendment concerns the duration of the Convention’s work. In our opinion, the new Constitution should even be ready to enter into force by the next European elections. Two years of work should be more than sufficient and we hope that the majority of Parliament will support Amendment No 37.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the difference between the first and second stages. We feel that it is essential not so much to simplify and consolidate the Treaty as to turn it into a succinct Constitution which all the European citizens will find readable. I therefore feel that it is not really feasible to divide the work into two stages.</p>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to concentrate on the Duhamel report, to emphasise how much progress the idea of a constitution has made, including in this House. Everyone, or almost everyone, who has spoken has done so in support of this idea and we feel that this is already a huge victory. Why are all these people fighting and militating for the idea of a constitution?</p>
<p class="contents">They are doing so in order to ensure that Europe becomes a democracy. In other words, all the decisions that are now trapped within the so-called intergovernmental debate, discussions in the corridors of power and behind-the-scenes diplomacy, all these decisions that are taken behind closed doors and shrouded in obscurity will become the business of the citizens, the general public, European public opinion. We, of course, take the view that this is the purpose of the constitution, over and above the already positive purpose of clarifying the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the Duhamel report, we finally have a credible script. Even if this two-stage process is not ideal, at least we can see where we are going.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that, when it comes to drafting the Constitution for real, the key point will be to determine wherein the legitimacy of the European authority lies, and, in our opinion, it must come from the peoples, from our citizens and their representatives, the European Parliament and perhaps the national parliaments. Democracy is the power of the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I wish it went even further and explicitly discussed a constitution and not merely a framework treaty, a type of treaty, a single treaty or a treaty of treaties, which nevertheless incorporates the Declaration of Fundamental Rights. I concede, however, that the political situation has not been conducive to going that far and I therefore give my unreserved support to the Duhamel report currently before us.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is one point I would like to highlight. I do not think it is right that we should call for or move towards the requirement for a compulsory referendum in every Member State to approve the specific amendments that have been proposed. In Portugal, for example, we did not hold a referendum to approve our membership of the European Community or to approve the Maastricht Treaty. These issues were approved by Parliament, in the context of effective representative democracy. I fail to see why we should force all Member States to hold referendums, regardless of whether these form part of their traditions or not. That is my only reservation. In any case, I warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Duhamel, on his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debates we are having now will add something to this key issue, which is to be addressed in the decades to come. Do we in fact need a constitution for Europe? To what extent should certain important competences, which hitherto have been the preserve of individual Member States, now be the subject of Community policy? The excellent reports by Mr Duhamel and Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado expertly point the way on both issues: improved intelligibility of the Treaties, a constitutional framework, fundamental rights, delimitation of competences, constitutional state, democracy and separation of powers; no superstate in Europe, a new method of developing the Treaties. The Duhamel report contains important pointers on all these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado. Reinforced cooperation, so as to escape the stranglehold exerted by national vetos. At the same time, we must be sure to retain a European approach, even in areas of reinforced cooperation, and ensure that reinforced cooperation does not exclude countries, but brings them closer together in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">Both reports leave some questions open, i.e. the answers given are only of a provisional nature. Do we really want to hold direct referendums on key European issues? We venture a tentative ‘yes’. However, this issue still needs to be discussed in greater depth Do we really want to let a third of the Member States press on ahead? Do we not need at least half of them? We would prefer it if as many Member States as possible could tread the common European path in unison. Our task for the future is to make this a reality. Reinforced cooperation between a few countries cannot be in the interests of Europe as a whole.</p>

That is, there is an error in the Italian version of the text resulting from an incorrect translation. Consequently, the description “less developed” is applied to the island regions as well as to the other regions and, according to Mr Barnier’s proposal, what is required here is the amendment of the Italian text of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I believe that we should welcome the information that Mr Barnier has just given us; he has proposed a study of the specific problems of the island regions, in accordance with Article 158 and Declaration No 30, appended to the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this would actually be enough to solve the problem raised by the question by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No-one would hold up the existing structure of the Treaties as a model of their kind and it must be in the interests of the politician, administrator, businessman and citizen to simplify their structure. The proposals in the Duhamel report which do that must be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of his report is more ambitious and hence contentious, questioning the mechanics of the way in which the Treaties – and hence the quasi-constitution – is changed. It is true that to an English common lawyer this is unknown territory. But to those in the United States, Canada or Australia this is much more familiar ground. It is an important topic which requires serious attention. I say to my own countrymen that it should not be dismissed out of hand. Rather, while I am far from convinced by a number of the detailed proposals in the report, I welcome the debate it opens because it raises important questions which require thought-through, considered and dispassionate answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had an in-depth debate on two issues which, although different, converge at one point. And both reports basically deal with the manner in which the European process is to continue; the manner in which the framework and the vision of Europe are to be shaped still further.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gil-Robles’ proposals on reinforced cooperation are, on balance, positive. At the same time, Mr Duhamel’s proposals for a constitutional charter for the European Constitution, a constitution of which we are in dire need, are also fundamental. And now a word to the President-in-Office, Minister Moscovici. The European Parliament has tabled important proposals. Now what we need is for the summit in Nice to demonstrate the political will to ensure that the Nice Treaty combines these proposals, and other proposals formulated on other occasions, into an integrated institutional framework which allows the European process to advance properly and the European Union to welcome the new Member States in a positive and sound manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
