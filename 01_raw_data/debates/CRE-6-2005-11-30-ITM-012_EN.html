<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nikolaos Sifunakis (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Parliament Committee on Culture and Education, the committee responsible for young people and sport, I particularly welcome today's debate in plenary on the recent motion for a resolution by the Committee on Culture on the Olympic Truce, in the run-up to the winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Turin next February.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on Culture and Education, as during the previous Olympic and Paralympic Games in Athens, is expressing its support today for the idea of the Olympic Truce and is calling on the Council to take specific measures so that it will be adhered to during the games in Turin.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the idea of the Olympic Truce dates back to the Olympic Games in ancient Greece. In ancient times, the Greek city states which took part in the games ceased all hostilities from the seventh day before the start of the games until the seventh day after they had ended, so that the athletes, artists and spectators could travel without fear to Olympia in order to take part in the games and return home in safety.</p>
<p class="contents">From the ninth century B.C., when the institution of the Olympic Truce was born with the signature of a peace treaty between the kings of Sparta, Elis and Pisa, until 393 A.D., the year in which the Olympic Games were abolished, the Olympic Truce was observed for 12 successive centuries to the degree which it deserves and contributed to respect for the institution of the Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, on the threshold of the 21st century, the idea of the Olympic Truce is reviving, forming – we might say – the bridge between the ancient tradition and the modern world because, beyond the noble ideal which the Olympic Games profess, it is extremely important that we give this major sporting and cultural event additional momentum with the objective of establishing global peace. In this way, not only are we reviving the overall idea of the Olympic Games, of which the Olympic Truce forms an integral part, but we are also giving new impetus and prospects to the Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to reiterate, briefly, the steps which we have made over recent years in order to establish the idea of the Olympic Truce throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1992, the International Olympic Committee called on the international community to cease all hostilities during the 1992 Olympic Games. </p>
<p class="contents">In 1994, during the Olympic Games in Lillehammer, weapons were quiet in Sarajevo and, four years later, in February 1998 during the Olympic Games in Nagano, the conflict in the Gulf was averted thanks to the intervention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Annan.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Assembly of the United Nations has adopted a series of resolutions since 1993, calling on the states to respect the Olympic Truce. These resolutions have been accepted by all the Member States, which is a rare occurrence at the United Nations and proves that the idea of the Olympic Truce is an objective for the entire global community.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2000, following the proposal of the Greek Government through the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, Georgios Papandreou, who was also the inspiration behind it, we safeguarded the Olympic Truce institutionally with the foundation by the International Olympic Committee and the Greek Government of an International Olympic Truce Centre and an International Olympic Truce Foundation, as a platform for debate with the objective of resolving conflicts and establishing the culture of peace through sport and the Olympic ideal and galvanising people, especially young people, into action. It is worth pointing out that our honourable friend, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis, was the first director of the International Olympic Truce Centre and coordinator of this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of the Olympic Truce comes from a deep conviction that sport and the sporting ideal can help to create a peaceful and better world. It is the longest lasting condition for peace in the history of mankind and it is an exceptionally valuable tool for diplomacy, offering a vitally important opportunity for the peaceful settlement of crises through dialogue and education. This achievement will constitute a small revolution in today's world. I therefore believe that we too should contribute both with our words and our actions to making this a reality.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The year is also intended as an incentive to create conditions for more and better sports projects in developing countries. Countries and NGOs are encouraged to do more in the framework of development cooperation and sport. The UN is convinced that sport can make a significant contribution to achieving the Millennium Objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first time that development cooperation and sport have appeared together on our agenda, and it is something that I welcome. Sport brings people of different races, classes, levels of education and cultures together. Sport can make a positive contribution to social cohesion, teamwork, health, intercultural dialogue, and many other things.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the perfect tool to reach the more vulnerable groups in society, such as people with a disability and children, and appears to be a marvellous tool whereby traumatised children – child soldiers spring to mind –may come to terms with their traumas and be reintegrated into society. That is why sport can play a vital role in terms of development. It benefits those who like to indulge in healthy activities, both as individuals and as communities, because it can help create better relations between different groups of people.</p>
<p class="contents">Large organisations, such as UNICEF or Olympic committees in various countries, but also national governments, such as those of Norway, Canada, Great Britain and the Netherlands, international sports umbrella organisations, such as FIFA, are all carrying out projects in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, not just the government is active, but also NGOs, such as the NKS, the Dutch Catholic Sports Federation, have been working on sports projects in developing countries for years. These projects have turned out to be low cost high impact projects. Interesting examples can also be found, for example, in the area of education and health care and also in the prevention of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Where development and sport are concerned, the position of women deserves a special mention. In many cases, women are hindered in practising sports, for example, because of dress code or because they cannot simply leave the home.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone should be entitled to practise a sport. I am therefore pleased with the oral amendment that is being prepared to this effect in order to stress this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The question to the Commission and the Council is intended to raise awareness in Europe about the opportunities that sport can offer in the area of development cooperation. I would like to hear from the Commission about the experience the Commission has of programmes of this kind, and also whether the Commission can, and indeed wants to, make a contribution to broadening the knowledge of the possibilities and to encouraging Member States to promote projects in this area, for example organised by sports organisation NGOs in their own country. The Commission might even consider freeing up some funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I sincerely hope that this UN year of development cooperation and sport will be seized to take advantage of opportunities to do more in terms of development cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Madam President, in reply to Mr Sifunakis, the Council confirms its continuing commitment to the promotion of the ideals of peace and human understanding through sport. Heads of State and Government at the Brussels European Council of 12 December 2003 supported the idea of an Olympic truce and welcomed the United Nations' resolution on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Troika of Education and Sports Ministers stressed, during the launch of the European Year of Education through Sport on 29 January 2004, the importance of the Olympic truce and its message of peace, tolerance and friendship, its unique place in the lives of citizens and its positive role in the promotion of friendship and the breaking down of social and cultural barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Martens, the Council would initially like to point out to the Honourable Member that activities relating purely to sport do not fall within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Community and that the Community has no specific competence in the field of sport. The Council considers, however, that measures and events related to sports can be a great help in promoting education, health, social cohesion, and in combating discrimination and ensuring an inclusive society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would also like to note that the educational values of sport were acknowledged by the Nice European Council of December 2000. This acknowledgement confirmed previous declarations – in particular that attached to the Amsterdam Treaty – which emphasised the social significance of sport and its role in forging identity and bringing people together, and the Council's resolution of 17 December 1999, in which sporting activities were shown to have educational value, which can help strengthen civil society. On 5 May 2003, the Council subsequently adopted a resolution on the social value of sport for young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council firmly believes in the valuable role that sport has to play in developing countries in promoting education, health and community cohesion. It therefore supports the designation of 2005 as the UN International Year of Sport and Physical Education and welcomes the efforts made to promote the use of sport as a tool for development.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty eradication and sustainable development are the overarching objectives of both the 2000 EC development policy statement and the revised European Consensus on Development, agreed by Development Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 22 November 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Although education and health did not feature in the 2000 DPS, the revised European Consensus on Development Policy highlighted human development as an area for Community action. We recognise the value of sport in promoting a healthy lifestyle and in preventing many lifestyle-associated diseases. We support country efforts that use sport as an entry point to Community education on better health and HIV prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Cotonou ACP-EU Partnership Agreement foresees cooperation and self-support policies, measures and operations aimed at helping community-based institutions to give children the opportunity to develop their physical potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport and physical education should mainly be considered in the context of Millennium Development Goal Two to achieve universal primary education by 2015 and Millennium Development Goal Three to eliminate gender disparity in all levels of education, no later than 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">For the second Millennium Development Goal, the first priority for the EU in education for development is basic education, in particular primary education. The EU is firmly committed towards achieving universal primary education and gender equality in education by 2015. This is implemented at three levels. Firstly, through international institutions, the EU supports actively the UN initiatives 'Education for All' and the 'Fast-Track Initiative', in partnership with other donors – UNESCO and the World Bank – as well as UNICEF in this field. Secondly, through interventions at country level, increasingly linked to national education programmes and based on funding and policy dialogue with national authorities. Thirdly, through supporting NGOs for projects oriented towards basic education. The EU also supports non-formal education of young people in the framework of the Youth Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Millennium Development Goal Three, the EU is also very active in international fora, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Conference on Population and Development. One of the key priorities in policy terms in promoting gender equality is granting access for girls and women to education, including physical education.

Minister Pearson described many reasons why sport, education and social development are so important in our policies in the Union, but also vis-à-vis third countries and with regard to our developing goals, especially the Millennium Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mrs Martens. Sport and physical education can contribute to attaining the Millennium Development Goals. We welcome the work done by the United Nations in this field, in particular the creation of a special international platform on sport and development. We also welcome the proclamation of 2005 as the International Year of Sport and Physical Education. The Commission is, and will be, further involved in these activities. In particular, we will now participate in the closing conference of this initiative, which will focus precisely on the issue of sport and development.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have mentioned already, this year was preceded by the European Year of Education through Sport 2004, which was a very important year for our area of cooperation. I will officially report to the Parliament by the end of this year on these activities and on subsequent recommendations or conclusions. I therefore believe there will be more time and space to deal with the results of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we are working on the basis of the Nice Treaty and the Declaration annexed thereto. This limits the possibilities for the Commission but, in close cooperation with Member States, a lot has been done and a lot is on the rolling agenda of our Sport Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, when it comes to funding projects in the field of sport and development, the European Union’s support for such initiatives could only be channelled through the existing programmes in the field of development cooperation. This is already the case. Projects using sport as a means for development have been co-financed, for example, in the field of non-formal education, social integration or to encourage women from disadvantaged communities to participate in sport.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm to honourable Members, and especially to Mr Sifunakis, our unconditional support for the Olympic truce. On several occasions sport has been shown to achieve results where other means have failed. The joint parade of the North and South Korean delegations under the flag of the Korean peninsula during the opening ceremony of the games in Sydney was an outstanding and very strong example.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I welcome the initiative of the European Parliament in view of the Winter Olympics in Turin in 2006, which is very near. This follows a similar initiative on the occasion of the Summer Olympics in Athens in 2004. The European Union should indeed take the lead in lending support to initiatives promoting peace around the world. Let me nevertheless stress that it is for Member States to take the final decision. I would like to assure you, however, that within my portfolio I will do my best to promote the Olympic truce.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that there is a strong and growing engagement in Parliament and the Committee on Culture and Education in the sports area. I congratulate you for this, because it is important for the overall development not only of sport, but also of our European spirit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under this slogan, the United Nations is promoting sport as a means of avoiding conflict, as a factor for reducing poverty and as a means for broader development.</p>
<p class="contents">As we approach the end of 2005, of the international year of sport and physical education, it is important that we take stock in order to evaluate what we have achieved at European and international level. The Committee on Development chose to carry out this review from the point of view of the contribution of sport to the promotion of education, health, development and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the same framework, on Thursday 3 November 2005, 190 of the 191 Members States went to the headquarters of the United Nations and signed, in the presence of Kofi Annan, the text of the truce which would apply for the duration of the winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Turin in February 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The defence of democracy and freedom and the safeguarding of peace between peoples, the defence of human dignity and the protection of young athletes is the responsibility of all of us. The Olympic Games, therefore, are a huge opportunity for the European Union to promote these ideals in its turn too, by calling on all nations on earth to respect the truce for the duration of the winter games in Turin.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in the sector of development, support through continuing training programmes of physical education instructors and sports journalists may have positive results on combating racism and xenophobia and in safeguarding equal opportunities for both sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Famous sports personalities such as Pele, Ronaldo, Zidane and many others are using their names, as goodwill ambassadors of the United Nations, to highlight the importance of the fight against racism and poverty. Sport could also have an economic impact, in that a country that invests in the good physical condition of its citizens, starting with young people in school, may over the long term reduce health expenditure, given that, according to a United Nations report, 40% of illnesses on a global scale are linked to a lack of exercise and poor physical condition.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, the twentieth winter Olympic Games in Turin are a huge opportunity for the whole of mankind to respect the truce and, at the same time, to defend, in the name of sport, health and development within the framework of healthy competition. In addition, the European Union will be the main winner with the efforts it is making to establish peace and progress in the world.</p>

North and South Korea, united in one Olympic team, spring to mind. Sport can help societies heal their wounds; one thinks of the Rwandan football teams made up of Hutus and Tutsis, for example. Sport can be a positive way of expressing rivalry between peoples without this ending up in bad behaviour or use of violence – just think of the Netherlands and Germany, but is also a tough business. Children are taken out of developing countries and tried out on the pitch as child slaves in big European clubs and if they are deemed not to be up to scratch, we find them lost in Belgian forests, bemused, without a visa or money.</p>
<p class="contents">2005 is the Year of Sport and that is why I urge the Council and the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, to seize the UN Year of Sport and Development as an opportunity to make much firmer agreements on banning the recruitment and abuse of very young footballers. That is only possible by means of long-term training and a visa requirement, with the club not only taking on responsibility for these children, but also, refraining from treating them later on as their property, but instead paying them fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could mount the same campaign against racism on European pitches. Here too, a European level playing field with European agreements between European clubs is imminent. Commissioner, you are undoubtedly familiar with the Fair Network and all the good work they do and the support that you give them.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find objectionable, particularly since – as the Council spelled out clearly a moment ago – we have only just set up the frameworks for the European development policy with priorities for the Millennium Objectives and good governance, is that yet another – in this case UN – Christmas bauble will be added to the aid tree. It is the wrong reflex at the wrong level.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud the fact that games and sport in education will be linked up to developing countries. I also applaud the fact that a number of Member States are actively throwing their weight behind this sports project. I respect subsidiarity, but let the EU focus, via the Commissioner for Sport, on a number of agreements with European sports clubs, such as UEFA, on a ban on young football slaves and a clampdown on racism on European pitches. It is better that we have cohesive policy such as this one than that development policy should become fragmented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that the Olympic Games have a long tradition going back to Ancient Greece, just as Mr Sifunakis described so well in his speech. It has also been part of that tradition that, during the Olympics, during those 16 days, there is an attempt to suspend all hostilities and allow nations to come together. Then nations have also showed, and I hope they will continue to do so, that they can live in peaceful coexistence. Sport is an excellent tool for this.</p>
<p class="contents">We would do well to remember that, unfortunately, we have not always been able to keep the peace during the Olympics. Europe is well aware of that black day in September 1972 when Palestinian terrorists struck in the Olympic village in Munich. In all, 16 people were killed, mainly Israelis. Let this serve as a warning that never again should such an incident occur in international sport and when sports events are taking place. On the contrary, sport, whose purpose it is to bring people together to compete in a spirit of fair play, should unite nations: this could be that source of wealth, that source of growth, which in the future we act to support.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that sport is an excellent way of building a better world. Now, as we speak of an Olympic truce, the word truce would appear to mean some sort of temporary peace. Let it be our goal to achieve permanent peace between nations and countries, and let sport be instrumental in building this peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I consider the most important of these to be the Olympic Games. Greece started them in 776 B.C., when we all know what the framework of organised life was in Europe. Greece therefore imposed the truce at that time. It said, 'There will be no Olympic Games while there is war'.</p>
<p class="contents">In the sixth century, when Alexander I, King of Macedonia, came to compete in person at ancient Olympia, two things were asked of him: first, the judges wanted to establish that he was Greek, which they did immediately, and secondly, they called on him to stop certain skirmishes in the north of his country, which term was respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Olympic Games stopped in 393 for purely political reasons which we all know. The Olympic Games started in 1896 and we saw war stop. They were not held in 1940 or in 1944, due to the war with the Nazis. In 1972, we had the tragic events in Munich. The other two Olympic Games, in Los Angeles and Moscow, were sullied because the teams of the two big countries did not take part for political reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore protect the Olympic Truce. It is a proposal which comes from the depths of time. Let us therefore call on the IOC for certain Olympic sports to be held in the country of origin of the Olympic Games, in ancient Olympia; for the marathon to be held there, on the classic route run for the first time by Philippides. Only then will we give meaning again to the Olympic Games. The Olympic Truce must come today into our lives, we must convince the big not to wage war on the small.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sport can play a vital role in encouraging development and sports projects can contribute to reaching the Millennium Development Goals, especially under themes such as health, education, gender, environment, peace and human rights.</p>

Accordingly, a few European constitutions – such as the Greek, Portuguese or Swiss – directly grant the right to physical education and sport. If the right to sport is granted by constitution, then the responsibility of the state in respect of sport, as well as its participation in and support of physical education and sport are unquestionable. The Draft Constitution of the European Union, too, contains direct regulations concerning sport, declaring the importance of sport and acknowledging its significance in European societies. However, as the ratification process has slowed down and is stalling, the inclusion of sport in the European Constitution – which would define the future of European sport – may be jeopardised. Europe is the centre of international sport. No other continent has such a significant participation in sports. Public opinion polls indicate that 70% of European citizens come into daily contact with sport in some form. There is not one family in Europe without at least one family member being affected. Sport has a tremendous potential for bringing together and integrating cultures, nations and ethnic groups, as demonstrated by peaceful world competitions, Olympic games and world championships. This is reflected in the fact that the UN and the European Union dedicated last year and this year to sport and education through sport. It is unfortunate that in spite of the above, the importance of sport is not widely acknowledged within the European Union. Sport is seldom mentioned in budgetary debates, if mentioned at all, as an individual budget item or heading. Appropriate financial support has not been provided to enable the European Union to treat sport in the deserved manner. I believe it is erroneous to take into account only the commercial aspects of sport. The social role of sport far outweighs its commercial nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Much has been said about the economic and tourism benefits that the Olympics will bring to Turin, but not as much – or at any rate too little –about the social dimension and the role sport can play in promoting development, health, education and peace, as has been mentioned in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport is a means of educating people and of setting up low-cost, high-impact projects, which should be vigorously supported and promoted. We must, however, remain vigilant that sport is not used as a vehicle for propaganda – I refer, for example, to Cuba and to totalitarian regimes in general – or for spreading hatred or racism – I refer to the recent unpleasant incidents we have seen in certain Italian stadiums or the instances when the fundamental values of sport and competition are betrayed by athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During that period, athletes, artists and their families, as well as pilgrims, could travel safely to participate in the Games and return to their homes unharmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the proliferation of armed conflicts is a reality; the International Olympic Committee decided, quite rightly, to restore this notion from the Ancient World in order to protect the interests of the athletes and of sport in general, thereby contributing to the creation of a window of opportunity for dialogue, reconciliation and peace through sport.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Catalan, I must tell you that I am very proud that it was in 1992, on the occasion of the Barcelona Olympics, that the then Mayor of Barcelona, Pascual Maragall, called upon the United Nations to restore the tradition of the Olympic truce and to negotiate a ceasefire in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was not possible to stop the war in the Balkans, but it did ensure that its athletes could take part in those Games.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remind the international community of the importance of complying with this truce and appeal to the conscience and commitment of the governments to peace, mobilising young people in favour of Olympic ideals and taking advantage of the Games to make it possible to establish contacts between communities in conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I support the present resolution in the hope that the 20th Winter Olympics will promote respect for and the continuity of the Olympic truce, which is beneficial to peace, sport and human and cultural exchanges at world level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed an ideal tool to achieve a great deal in education and in a social context. Obviously, arguments included in the draft resolution are just as valid for sport in Europe. Sport promotes common values and should therefore not be treated in any way as a purely economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, as you know, that a great deal of money is involved in sport and that football clubs are often powerful businesses that are also run as such. That should surely not be an argument for remaining blind to the enormous social role sports organisations play.</p>
<p class="contents">Many large and small clubs in the European football competition are socially active in community projects. They involve young people from socially disadvantaged families, often with migrant backgrounds and with learning difficulties, in their clubs and they thus prevent the young people from slipping away and losing their way in society. We must nurture and encourage this function of sport. Projects in which local governments and football clubs work closely together for more social cohesion – as it is known – deserve support.</p>
<p class="contents">At the very moment that this debate is going on, a hearing is being held elsewhere in this building on football as an instrument against racism. There you go. I sincerely hope, Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you will be on our side when we come to develop European sports policy – one that will, over the next few months and years, focus first and foremost on this undeniable social role both within the European Union – with or without a constitution – and outside it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Six years ago, in view of the forthcoming Olympic Games in Athens, Greece and the International Olympic Committee, represented at the time by Samarand and Papandreou, reinstituted this institution. Today, this romantic idea now has weight. The United Nations have approved it unanimously. No other resolution in the history of the United Nations has ever had unanimous support. Leaders from all over the world have signed it. In 1994, ten thousand children in Bosnia were vaccinated because there was a day's truce. Was this a romantic move? Surely not for the children.

I believe that sport has the power to transform lives. It can give people life chances that they may never have imagined they could have in their lives. It can improve people’s lifestyles, their health and wellbeing; it can lift up the spirits and it can be just great fun. For somebody who played rugby for the best part of 30 years, I know just how much fun playing sport actively can be. I just want to make it very clear that the Presidency very much supports the Olympic truce initiative. We believe it is a very important and significant initiative. All the UN countries agreed a resolution on the Olympic truce at their general assembly on 3 November, so this truce is supported by all EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree, of course, with Mr Takkula that our long-term aim should be for permanent peace, rather than just during the Olympic Games. However, to see peace during the period of the Turin Games will be a step forward. If that can continue to Beijing in the Summer Olympics in 2008 and to London in 2012, nobody would be more delighted than myself, the Council and I am sure everybody listening to this debate here today.</p>

In fact, this was one of the issues that sports ministers discussed when they looked at how to promote diversity and equal opportunities at a meeting in Liverpool in the UK in September. As part of that discussion, ministers heard from UEFA about the work that it is doing to tackle racism in football.</p>
<p class="contents">The motions for resolutions on this subject that will be put to the vote here tomorrow are very important.

It may certainly be the case that they give rise to these qualities, but why should the EU make efforts in this area?</p>
<p class="contents">There is no reason for the EU to create a budget heading for sports-based development programmes and projects. Nor is there any cause for it to set up programmes aimed at increasing physical education teachers’ knowledge and experience of development and sport. These are national, or even regional, issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution advocates that sports journalists be trained using EU funds so that they might learn to avoid stereotyping, discriminatory phraseology and racist expressions. It is important to combat racism and discrimination, but it is not necessary to take action at EU level in connection with this kind of programme. These are issues on which each country should decide for itself and on which the EU should have absolutely no say.
