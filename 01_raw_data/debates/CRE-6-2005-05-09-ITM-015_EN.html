These are among the questions raised by this directive, not only in the form originally proposed by the Commission but also, of course, in the Council’s common position, which is before us now. The Bathing Water Directive dates back to 1976 and since then, a great deal has changed, not only in terms of how we think about the environment, but also about what exactly must be regulated at what level and how.</p>
<p class="contents">You can, of course – as indeed I did – question how useful it is to determine at European level the standards with which bathing water and coastal and inland waters in the European Union must comply, whether we should lay this down at European level and whether European action in this area represents any added value. This House decided, at first reading, that it did, but – and actually more importantly – so did the Member States. Even the Member States that one would be inclined to regard as perfectly capable of determining this for themselves considered a new bathing water directive to be necessary. Who are we then to claim the opposite? Why do governments opt in favour of the new bathing water directive? The main reason why they do so is that the old directive is unworkable and, in environmental terms, pre-historic.</p>
<p class="contents">The old directive was based on monitoring and measuring rather than the pro-active and sensible management of bathing water. With its proposal, the Commission decided to change this, and I think it was right to do so. The new directive must be implementable, flexible and geared towards the management of bathing water and towards deregulation, and must certainly cut down on red tape. It should, for example, be possible to be more flexible when measurements are taken: if bathing water in a certain location has been clean for years, it should be possible to reduce its measuring frequency. That is what the Commission proposed and what this House and subsequently the Council adopted, which is definitely progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is also popular among the public at large, something that is not unimportant during this time of referendums. It is one of the most well-known directives among the European public who each year, anxiously await the new figures. It has also been a successful one; about ten years ago, only some 60% of bathing water was acceptable, compared to 95% these days, which is excellent. This House does believe, though, and this is how the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted, that the information which should be available to the public should mainly pertain to current water quality. I have put this to the test and picked a random location in Europe which is the base of a prominent Member of the Commission, namely Athens, to examine the bathing water quality there.</p>
<p class="contents">We did some research on the Internet this afternoon, but the most recent data, regrettably, was that for water quality in 2003, which is, of course, no indication as to whether or not it is still safe to swim near Athens. It could well be that this information is available from the site of the Greek Ministry of Health and Welfare, but I would not be able to read it because that information is in Greek. That is also the reason why, according to this House, current information should be made available and symbols should be used which can be developed by the Commission and are recognisable around the European Union by all citizens. At present, information is trailing behind and can be traced via the Internet only with difficulty, quite apart from the fact that most tourists do not – or so I hope – take their laptops with them on holiday or, at any rate, not to the beach.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the standards of the old directive, there is a one in eight health risk. One in eight bathers, according to current standards, runs the risk of becoming ill. We should not underestimate those health risks, which include stomach and abdominal disorders, skin, eye and respiratory tract complaints and outer ear infections. With the standards proposed by the Commission and this House’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, one in twenty bathers become ill. This may still be too many, but is at least a step forward, while the Council’s common position is satisfied with one in nine. I can understand the position of the governments who want the system to be affordable. Parliament should, in my view, take this into consideration and that is why I regret that there was no far-reaching agreement between the Council and Parliament at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of very interesting amendments have been tabled. As far as deleting or adjusting the category ‘sufficient’ is concerned, I think that if amendments of that kind were adopted, then that would at least stand us as Parliament in good stead at conciliation stage, enabling us, together with the Council, to arrive at a solution which is beneficial to bathers and consumers, and on the basis of which we can conclude that the quality of bathing water is really significantly improving, which is what the Commission wanted in its original proposal. We should, however, also find a solution that benefits the governments and that is more workable, leads to deregulation and is also affordable, because that is, of course, an important factor. It is also for that reason that I think that we should not include recreational waters in this directive, but should do so at some point in the future. I have no problems talking about it, but now is not the right time to bring this up in this manner.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I have noticed that the Commission was rather reluctant to add a statement to the Council position. In any case, it wants continued scrutiny of the values in the future. I find this very useful, because it goes without saying that we need to continue to make adjustments in the future. This will, hopefully, be done according to the usual procedure in consultation with this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the European Commission's report on the 2004 bathing season, I wish to inform you that it will be published by the end of the month, and not just in Greek but in other languages also.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's initial proposal was designed to update the existing directive, which dates back to 1976. It proposed adopting stricter water quality standards, updating bathing water management measures, rationalising monitoring requirements and improving public information channels. The Commission accepted in full or in part 22 of the 37 amendments approved by Parliament at first reading<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording of the proposal was improved; however, its basic structure and, more importantly, the water quality standards remained in keeping with the Commission's initial proposal. Discussions in the Council were held during the Greek, Italian and Irish Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">It soon became evident that a significant majority of the Member States considered that the Commission's proposals on quality standards were over-ambitious and that they would be overly expensive. Similarly, it was clear from discussions in the Council that there was a desire to distinguish between quality standards for coastal waters and quality standards for inland waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Other changes which emerged from discussions in the Council concerned the choice of the right time for adopting the new standards and an alternative approach to combating short-term pollution and emergencies. The Commission considers that many of the changes made to the common position improve the Commission's initial proposal. However, with regard to the question of whether or not the water quality standards and the classification categories adopted are strict enough, the Commission would prefer the original proposal to stay as it is. Nonetheless, after long and arduous negotiations with the Council, it was concluded that the Commission proposal would never muster the necessary support.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore decided to support the common position which, even if far from ideal, does nonetheless represent a significant improvement over present arrangements under the current directive. The current legislation, which is nearly 30 years old, urgently needs updating. When the common position was approved, the Commission made a statement for the record, emphasising its intention to fund an epidemiological research programme to examine in depth the possible repercussions on bathing and, more importantly, the health repercussions associated with bathing in fresh water. The results of this programme are expected to be ready in 2008 and will perhaps allow certain issues on which the Council and Parliament today take different stands to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask Parliament to try, with the Commission's help, to find common ground with the Council on this dossier as quickly as possible. We urgently need a new directive with targeted management practices, more rational monitoring schemes and more effective communication with the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While the 1976 Directive specified 19 physical, chemical and microbiological parameters for the assessment of water quality, the present Common Position from the Council reduces the test criteria to a mere two microbiological pathogens, to which it adds the visual checking and measurement of the pH value of fresh water.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, the Commission proposal for a new bathing water directive forms part of the European Union’s comprehensive policy on water, being based on more recent scientific discoveries, and on WHO studies in particular. Whereas, in 1976, values described as ‘adequate’, still put between 7% and 9% of bathers at risk, the WHO now stipulates values permitting a maximum risk of 5% incidences of illness among bathers. In its Common Position, the Council has introduced a new parameter of ‘sufficient’, which does not, however constitute an improvement over the 1976 standard.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where opinions differ. You said, Commissioner, that the main argument is that the costs would be too high, yet many of the alleged additional costs arise from compliance with the standards of the Water Framework Directive, the Nitrates Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. The minimal costs that actually are incurred by reason of compliance with higher quality standards are now, though, covered by the reduction in social costs, quite simply because, at the end of the day, fewer people become ill.</p>
<p class="contents">I, personally, would argue in favour of the introduction, with immediate effect, of the higher quality standards proposed by the WHO and the Commission. Although preventive healthcare is not something that can be put off to another day, Mr Seeber has joined with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and Mrs Ayuso González in tabling a compromise amendment on behalf of the group. It provides for a transitional period of eight years, which will be sufficient to achieve the quality standards. There are those countries that believe that the new quality standards impose particularly heavy burdens on them, and the amendment is intended to allow them more time to prepare themselves for their greater rigour and to deal with any problems they may have.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the House to support this compromise amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry to tell you that is my opinion of the recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council common position is a realistic approach to the issue, understanding the problems of the different Member States and their regions. The Maaten report seeks to destroy this compromise, for instance deleting the ‘sufficient’ category. Ordinary people understand that although some water may not be perfect for bathing, it is not dangerous either: it is just sufficient. This is what we call common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The self-cleaning capacity of a lake and that of a sea are clearly different. That is why the Council has wisely set up different quality standards for coastal and inland waters; the rapporteur opposes this. The Maaten report would tell Member States in which language they should provide information on water quality. That is not a good idea. If some people decide to vote against the European Constitution, it will be because of the kind of over-regulation proposed in this report and other things like that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Montesquieu said a few centuries ago, ‘If it is not necessary to make a law, then it is necessary to refrain from making a law’. I regard the Bathing Water Directive as a good example of the sort of directive that Europe can well do without. Europe’s constant urge to harmonise results in an excess of regulation, which means that the European Union becomes more and more distant from the public. The other side of that coin is that more and more members of the public become disenchanted with a European Union the most visible aspect of which is the way it decks itself in an array of bureaucratic rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me come to the point with which we are concerned in this instance. Every region possessing stretches of water for bathing or leisure activities has an intrinsic interest in maintaining them to a high standard; if it does not, the penalty it pays is that visitors and tourists stay away. The creation of a legal framework in this area should remain a matter for the Member States, for I certainly cannot see it having any effect on the internal market. Again, I do not think I need to discuss how badly many environmental regulations are transposed in the EU, as there are enough infringement proceedings in progress – a plethora of them, in fact – to demonstrate that.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to become more transparent to its citizens, then, where the protection of the environment and of health is concerned, we have to concentrate on what must – and can – be done at European level. What this means is that, if we have doubts as to whether or not a function should be performed at the European level, we should leave the responsibility for it with the Member States. I do not regard the Bathing Water Directive as a vitally necessary component of European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally speaking, I would go even further than this directive: we believe, in actual fact, that if the draft directive on the quality of bathing water remains as it is, it will exclude <span class="italic">de facto</span> recreational activities, which will discriminate between bathers and other users of coastal waters and continental waters, and we cannot accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">The version proposed by the Commission is decidedly unsatisfactory in our eyes and we are, today, within our rights to ask the Commission and the Council why they persist in refusing to consider other recreational activities as coming under this bathing-water directive. What will be the value of this directive, therefore, if it does not offer the same guarantees of safety and quality of water for new types of nautical activity such as surfing, windsurfing and kayaking, which have become – as we all know – common currency in many bathing waters throughout the European Union? These activities and recreational and competitive sports carry as much of a risk of swallowing water as simple bathing, and we are all aware of that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not listen to the expectations of a younger, older and increasingly numerous public, and if we remain deaf to the requests of new users of coastal and continental waters, we will truly fail in our work as the legislators and representatives of our fellow citizens. Whilst in France, the debate on the competence and role of the Union is particularly animated, we have here, with this draft directive, the opportunity to demonstrate that the Union is in touch with a society on the move, and that it can listen and respond to its citizens’ desires. The organisations that campaign, for instance, to practice sports in good-quality water have rallied themselves by gathering in excess of 10 000 signatures, precisely to persuade us to integrate recreational sports.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to the Commissioner, I believe that everyone is in agreement that we should invest in the quality of water when this costs nothing. It must be recognised, however, that investing in good-quality water means investing in our future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The revenue of my country, with its outstanding beaches, depends to a large extent on tourism, and European tourism in particular, which is demanding when it comes to clean waters, as are Cypriots. A contaminated beach in Cyprus is a serious subject of conversation and concern, and citizens demand that their government maintain and improve the state of the seas on the basis of very strict criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why I agree that the new directive should be both strict and feasible is not only so that tourism in Cyprus can be safeguarded. All European citizens have the right to enjoy the waters of Europe, both coastal and inland, to exercise various types of activities without danger of microbiological contamination and, most importantly, they have the right to information as quickly as possible on the state of the waters in which they and their children will be bathing. I see no reason to delay the application of the directive. I believe that the 2011 deadline gives local authorities enough time to make arrangements for the sort of tests they will need to carry out and to develop an appropriate infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I absolutely agree with the rapporteur that public information is one of the most important elements of the directive. If the objective is to improve and maintain the quality of European bathing waters and protect citizens, I find it hard to understand why the Council does not wish to develop a public information system. I therefore call on you to support the relevant amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The first time this directive came into my hands, I wondered why the Commission should content itself with merely good quality waters on the basis of the parameters which it sets. Now the Council wishes to add a parameter of sufficient quality. It appears unacceptable to me that we should end up with even lower microbiological specifications than those set by the Commission. I therefore call on you to vote for the relevant amendments, which delete the new parameter, and for the amendments which make no distinction between inland and coastal waters. Given that no scientific study supporting this view has been presented to Parliament and until such time as substantiated data are presented, I propose that we vote against the distinction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree with the rapporteur that Parliament should stand by its views, especially after the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and I call on you to demonstrate with your vote that European citizens deserve the best possible bathing water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had hoped that the revision of the Bathing Water Directive would have brought us closer to cleaner bathing water, as indeed, the Commission’s original proposal gave us ample opportunity of bringing this about. That is why this House decided to make relatively few changes at first reading. The Council cannot, though, be said to have taken a positive line when drawing up the common position, which cannot, I think be regarded as entirely ‘common’. There is little evidence of Parliament’s position at first reading. In particular, I cannot commend the Council for the way it has lowered its sights. All kinds of cosmetic changes have been made in order to jazz up the proposal, including the introduction of a new category of ‘sufficient’ bathing water, but that cannot take away the impression that there was little enthusiasm in the Council for tightening up standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the distinction drawn by the Council between salt and fresh water is dictated by the wish to reach a compromise within the Council. However, the arguments raised have not convinced me of the scientific basis which is reported to exist. I will therefore support the amendments that intend to reverse this. Similarly, I can endorse the deletion of the category ‘sufficient’. I could, perhaps, accept as a compromise Amendment 36, tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I also welcome the re-inclusion of the table with parameters – Amendment 29 – which is worth supporting.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject, I would like to ask the Council how it feels about the way in which the old 1976 Bathing Water Directive has been implemented. Looking at the situation in the EU in 2003 – which is the last available year – then we see that some 95% of the bathing waters meet the compulsory standards and approximately 80% meet the guiding values. So without the need for any additional work, 80% of the bathing water already meets the new standards proposed by the Commission. So why is the Council so opposed to better protection for bathers? We all know that the present directive no longer meets present-day requirements, but I do think that the new directive should raise the bar a little higher. That is, in the interest of the bathers, the only right course. Finally, I should like to wish the rapporteur much strength. He has to my mind done an excellent job so far. Let us hope that the Council realises this and that conciliation can be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should remember that it does mean real improvements in water quality within the ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ categories now proposed. It will enable the bathing water directive to be better focused, with clearer and more demanding rules, and I underline that it is ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the 1976 Directive has taken 30 years at least and cost a lot of money. I represent the South-West of England, where we have spent more than GBP 1 billion – I am sorry I am not speaking in euros – in clearing up the bathing beaches around the coast of that region of England alone. That has meant a 15% year-on-year increase in water rates and I do not think people will be prepared to pay a lot more for a much more demanding directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There are obviously two problems. Unlike Mr Blokland, I am in favour of keeping the category of ‘sufficient’. I know that some want to delete it, but it seems to me that given that the new ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ standards are much tougher, and that even with investment some beaches may fail, especially after rain, we need the ‘sufficient’ category as a sort of probationary category. I would like to hear what the Commissioner thinks of Amendment 36. Does he think it is an efficient way of dealing with this issue and can he forecast the Council’s likely attitude to it?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of recreational waters: I think that all the recreational water amendments are rather silly, because the definition is too wide to be meaningful. If you set out from Cornwall and try to get to Florida in a canoe, you are turning the entire Atlantic into recreational water and I do not think that is worth it. I have seen no estimates of cost from any of the Greens who tabled these amendments: I do not think any exist.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of practicality. I highlight the fact that the British Canoe Union is begging us not to support the extension of this directive to recreational waters. I note that the British organisation Surfers Against Sewage says: ‘The impact of the directive will be felt particularly at the Canoe Union’s national watersports centre, where poor water quality is routinely thought to put young people at risk’. The British Canoe Union says: ‘Significantly, the health risk to canoeists in the water in the UK is very low and on this basis we query the justification to include recreational waters and activities in the directive’.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish this directive well. I remember the 1976 one when it first came forward. This is a great improvement and we should remember that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appeal to all Members, and to the Commission, to maintain the core of the proposal as it was tabled, that core being a high level of protection by means of high standards for good and even excellent bathing water. The Commission has based its work on research by the World Health Organisation, but the Council, in its common position, is showing that it has a very cynical side. The standards are high and bathing water locations facing the prospect of being closed down, but, because standards are being fiddled, they do not need to be. We should bear in mind that this is about health standards, and that we cannot afford to fiddle those. The European bathers simply want to know whether the water is safe for themselves and, above all, for their children. Bathers are entitled to clarity, and what are they to make of a lake that contains bathing water of ‘sufficient’ quality? Is it safe or not? That is why we will be voting against lowering the standards. In any case, the Dutch Labour Party puts the bather first; we cannot see the point of extending the directive’s scope to include other forms of recreation. The WHO standards are based on bathers and not on canoeists or sailing crew who accidentally go overboard. We are in favour of practical and implementable legislation which is not unnecessarily complex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are well used to it. It is both an ambitious and a balanced text that tackles the major issues: being practicable and also giving precise and up-to-date information to bathers.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I should like to make two observations on reading the European legislation on bathing waters that, today, spans nearly 30 years. Firstly, we must above all congratulate ourselves on the very encouraging results already obtained. I would point out that, according to the last report made public by the Commission in 2003, nearly 96% of coastal sites and over 91% of freshwater sites were in compliance with the quality standards laid down by the directive. Secondly, it is nevertheless advisable to place a caveat on this observation and this success and to criticise the lack of scope given to the Member States in applying this European law.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will excuse me, I shall give a concrete example that affects me: it appears to me to be particularly zealous that, for certain rivers in Wallonia, the Commission, with the support of European judges, has considered that a river of 10 centimetres deep, where two bathers occasionally go to take a dip, warrants the classification of bathing water and therefore requires drainage investment amounting to EUR 700 000 per zone. It is no coincidence that this legislation in force has been the subject of no less than 15 judgments of the Court of Justice. If we want this new directive to bring about the improvements desired by one and all, and in particular, if we want it to be applied in practice, we must get rid of this slightly restricted legalism at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a practicable law – we have said it, the rapporteur has said it – a directive that also provides us with the means to inform and to fight effectively against all forms of pollution, the majority of which is, moreover, less and less accidental, since in the case of bathing waters as well, we must address the causes of environmental pollution and their impact on the health of citizens from Europe and elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore have at our disposal standardised information on harmonised measures. Each citizen benefits from the same information, be they in Belgium, Spain, Greece or Slovenia.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore have five remarks to make on this directive. Firstly, it is important to implement appropriate measures in order to provide the public with good information. Secondly, with numerous <span class="italic">communes </span>having made considerable efforts to improve the quality of their waters, our legislation must certainly not discourage local initiatives. This directive must therefore be applicable and flexible, as has already been pointed out. Unexpected pollution can occur and, in such an event, temporary banning orders must be implemented, which do not, however, irrevocably lead to the downgrading of the <span class="italic">commune.</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to classifications, it is indeed necessary to be demanding and not to be mistaken on the quality of bathing waters; I deplore, however, the disappearance of the intermediate category, classified as sufficient. A measure of this type can have grave consequences for the development of certain of our tourist resorts. It is not a good thing to worry citizens for nothing. The right balance must be found between the quality of bathing waters and support for tourism, which is an essential sector of our economy. I also consider it significant that recreational activities are excluded from this directive, the absence of which will lead to the disappearance of surfers, and kayak, windsurfing and waterskiing enthusiasts, etc. from our holiday resorts. This does not strike me, in actual fact, as being very realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is indeed necessary to distinguish between coastal waters and inland waters, which are by nature different; we therefore look forward to the European epidemiological study conducted to evaluate these differences. It is above all our duty to do all we can to avoid marine pollution as a result of accidents or the emptying of petrol tankers, which all too often inflict our coastal resorts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For example, from the point of view of recreational activity, if we are talking about a seaside area where hundreds of people go boating, for example, that is quite a different matter from a 50 kilometre-long river in Lapland where canoes are used. These do not have very much to do with one another. Matters such as these should be taken into account, but at the same time we must ensure that all Europeans are afforded the best possible protection with regard to bathing waters.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must therefore react to it in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself come from a country where there are 187 888 lakes. Obviously, we would be frustrated if the measures applied were the same as in Luxembourg, for example. Consequently, it is important, both as far as common sense is concerned and from the point of view of the environment, that we focus on the objectives, but leave the means for achieving them to the Member States. Fortunately, the proposal also offers the Member States more latitude in determining for themselves which beaches are to be ‘EU beaches’. In this respect, the definition of bathing waters in the common position is fine. In my country, that will mean reducing the administrative burden on the authorities without quality control suffering as a result. We need this bathing water directive: the current directive is obsolete, and the reformed version will reflect the state of the water, in terms of hygiene, more effectively than the present one does.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, much in the amendments made by Parliament that I cannot agree with. Tightening the deadline from 2015 to 2011 will be problematic because of the timetables for the implementation of the water framework directive. What is most irksome about the amendments made by Parliament, however, is the plan to delete the satisfactory/sufficient classification for bathing water. We should remember that that was an unconditional requirement for achieving the common position of the Council. The same problem applies to the standardisation of values for coastal waters and fresh waters. There are scientific criteria for the different values, and they do not increase the risk to bathers.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise proposal drafted in Parliament is more of a step in the right direction. If the ‘sufficient’ category is not adopted, there is a danger that the entire project will fail in the Council. This would be very regrettable as far as the environment is concerned. Some Member States, of course, would certainly prefer to let the project fail rather than agree to more stringent values.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have two brief considerations to make; the first relates to the quality of bathing water. The Commission proposal defines three standards for grading these waters. Each category is based on precise microbiological parameters obtained from research carried out by the World Health Organisation, which correspond to a high level of protection of human health.</p>
<p class="contents">Adopting the ‘sufficient’ category would extend the legal validity of the 1976 bathing-water directive without meeting the minimum requirements of the values set by the World Health Organisation.

Unfortunately, I sometimes have the feeling that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety then sees its task as that of turning mediocre proposals into bad ones. We now have another example like that before us in the shape of the Bathing Water Directive. Actually, the name of this directive says it all. What it means is that the EU is to regulate water quality on our bathing beaches. I have to say that, in my view, that is extremely stupid.</p>
<p class="contents">One wonders if there is any issue so small that the Member States themselves are to be allowed control over it. In the Council’s defence, it has to be said, however, that this is no new form of stupidity, for the current directive is far worse than the compromise arrived at by the Council. According to the current directive, a small country such as Sweden ought regularly to measure the water quality at getting on for 5 000 bathing spots. The fact that Sweden does not measure the water quality at more than 800 such places is not a sign that we are some sort of European Wild West. It is an example of the way in which, as luck would have it, common sense has prevailed over absurd legislation. In the Council’s defence, I must say, however, that an attempt has now at least been made to get rid of some of the silliest aspects of the legislation. However, the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on which we are to vote is, as I say, unfortunately an example of the committee wanting to turn mediocre legislation into bad legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">One of many examples of this is the fact that the committee now requires that information concerning the quality of bathing water in, for instance, Härjarö outside Enköping, where I spent many sunny summer days, also be distributed in French. Unfortunately, there is now a desire further to increase the burden in many quarters.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, a number of people want the requirements also to extend to the quality of water used in recreational activities and want the quality of such water regularly to be monitored. This includes water wherever people go windsurfing or canoeing or such like, with the result that, before you know it, water throughout the Swedish archipelago will, in theory, need regularly to be monitored. If the European Parliament is now to compel all the Swedish local authorities to measure water quality at every location bar none, I actually have a good mind to vote against the whole proposal. Unfortunately, we should then be in danger of losing the simplifications proposed by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the problem does not reside in all the details I mentioned but in the fact that the EU is regulating issues in a sphere in which Europe is so manifestly diverse. The fact is that the EU should not be regulating the way in which the quality of bathing water in lakes in northern Värmland is measured. Too many Members of this House appear to take a pride in the new regulations that they can claim, back home in their constituencies, to have introduced. I feel at least as much pride in having helped put a stop to some of the nonsense, and I hope that more Members of this House, following tomorrow’s ... <span class="italic">(The President cut off the speaker)</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They must also allow the public to practise recreational activities. Although this is all very important to us, we would, at the same time, say that a number of requirements covered by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety actually went way too far and did not really add anything, or would not have added anything, by way of extra public health protection. We therefore shared the rapporteur’s concerns but at the moment, I am very confident – well, slightly worried, but mainly confident – that things will work out tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We, along with the majority, are glad that the initially planned extension of bathing water to include recreational water has been abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the issue of bathing water being of ‘sufficient’ quality. There are people in this House who want bathing water to be of excellent quality straight away, but what about national parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty? I happen to know that in nature reserves, only on account of the faeces of birds, for example, the source of pollution is so diffuse that bathing water will never be of a good quality, that it can never remain ‘sufficient’. I therefore take the view that we must reject a second batch of amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow, in which the category of ‘sufficient’ has been deleted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am also concerned about Amendment 42 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, who claim that once bathing water has been selected, it should not be struck off the list, even if you know that it will never meet the quality requirements again. That is too crazy for words and I hope that no one in this House will back this notion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main problem for us is agriculture and the run-off because of high rainfall, especially on the west coast. Rainfall in these parts, which face the Atlantic and the prevailing weather, can be anything from 80 to over 100 inches – i.e. 250 cm – a year. The land use on the west coast is predominantly livestock: sheep and cattle and wild deer. So, every time there is a heavy rainfall, some faecal material will be washed down from the moors and onto the beaches. This is not unnatural, it has happened for centuries, and the next tide will quickly clean things up.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, the Scottish Executive, the local authorities and Scottish Water have spent huge sums of money trying to minimise these occurrences, keeping livestock out of the water courses and installing simple treatment systems that are designed to stem the natural flow. However, it is impossible to stop it completely. Scotland has miles and miles of splendid beaches. Scotland has much of Europe’s finest and wildest landscapes. Scotland has several of the world’s best-known breeds of cattle and sheep. Scotland sometimes even has beautiful weather, when tourists and local people flock to our beaches. It would be perverse and severely damaging if Parliament, led by the Green brigade <span class="bold">–</span> who, sadly, know so little of the real world <span class="bold">–</span> were to remove the ‘sufficient’ classification in this new directive and condemn Scotland’s beaches to the loss of their coveted and deserved status among the best and most beautiful in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Well, this is exactly what the EP will do, if it accepts Jules Maaten’s report in its present form. Lake Balaton is one of the largest freshwater lakes in Hungary and Europe, and it is the most valuable resource for Hungarian tourism. Millions of people use it for swimming or recreational activities every year, and accepting the recommendation would put an end to this, just as it would eliminate the workplaces of hundreds of thousands of people who work and make a living of tourism there.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly agree that our goal is to ensure excellent bathing water quality in Europe. The health of those who visit the waters for sporting or recreational purposes as well as other environmental conditions make this necessary. This is why we cannot accept that this report conflates qualitative provisions for coastal and inland waters. Nor can I agree with Parliament’s report that suggests, without professional justification, a stricter threshold than the Council’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I am also anxious about the recommended management measures in the event that their water quality becomes poorer. If parameters exceed the limits, indicating that the water is detrimental to health, bathing should simply be prohibited. This has been the practice so far and there is no reason to alter it. It is simply unreasonable that complete information should only be provided in English and French in all the twenty-five Member States. Bathers should rather be informed in the languages most commonly spoken in the given area. Lake Balaton and Lake Fertő in Hungary are excellent examples for this, as they are mostly frequented by German, Austrian and Dutch tourists.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past days and hours, there have been a few proposals to amend the present Parliamentary report that provide positive contribution to the new legislation, and therefore, I do not recommend accepting the report unless these amendments are adopted. Thus, we can avoid passing legislation that ignores environmental conditions and may make it impossible for the tourist industry to flourish in many regions and also deprive millions of people from the joy of safe bathing and the pursuit of recreational activities. We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is also very happy to accept the idea of developing common symbols and signs to be displayed at bathing sites. However, it is necessary to be clear as to what exactly the signs and symbols are supposed to indicate.</p>
<p class="contents">Several amendments seek to reintroduce provisions concerning emergency plans. The Commission considers that, in this respect, the common position is an improvement on its original proposal. As the text already deals with pollution resulting from unusual or exceptional events, it is not appropriate to introduce detailed provisions on emergency planning in relation to bathing.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the issue of classification, the Commission wishes to maintain the ‘sufficient’ category with the aim of reaching an agreement that would allow the European Union to adopt a better framework for bathing waters than the present one. The Commission cannot accept the deletion of this category. However, the Commission welcomes the spirit of compromise behind Amendments 36 and 55. Amendment 36 provides that this classification category would exist only for eight years after the entry into force of this directive. As this would only take us to 2013, which is before the date on which the common position proposes that the quality standards would come into effect, the Commission does not regard this amendment as realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment 55, the Commission considers that increasing the severity of the quality standards associated with the ‘sufficient’ classification category would represent a potentially fruitful option in which to pursue a compromise. Therefore, while the quality standards for the sufficient category are far too stringent, the Commission could accept the principle of the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the distinction between coastal waters and fresh waters, the Commission cannot accept the amendments that remove this distinction, nor those amendments directed at bringing forward the dates when the new quality standards become effective. Finally, the Commission notes the attention Parliament attaches to the issue of dealing with other recreational uses of waters such as surfing and sailing. The Commission does not believe that it is feasible to extend the scope of the directive to include these issues today. However, the direction suggested by Amendment 35, whereby the Commission commits to conducting a study on this issue and reporting by 2018, is acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission can accept ten amendments in their entirety, and three amendments in part or in principle. However, 21 amendments are unacceptable to the Commission. I shall give a complete list of the Commission’s position on the amendments to Parliament’s secretariat<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The European Union ensures minimum standards. Member States can go further and faster, and competition between tourist locations will push things in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remark: the Member States are responsible for designating bathing sites. The Walloon case to which Mrs Ries referred involved a site identified by Belgium as a bathing site. That is why we and the Court insisted on the site respecting the 1976 Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
