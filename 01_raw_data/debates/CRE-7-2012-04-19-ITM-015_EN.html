<p class="contents">In the Council we have repeatedly discussed the implementation of Greece’s national action plan in the area of asylum and migration and in the area of border control, most recently at the Council meeting (Justice and Home Affairs) on 8 March this year. At this meeting, the Commission and Greece reported that a certain amount of progress is being made, for example in relation to the practical processing of asylum applications. However, it is also clear that enormous challenges still remain when it comes to implementation. These include ensuring that there is an adequate complement of staff to handle the cases and the establishment of the required number of reception centres. It is vital that all resources are utilised to improve the implementation of Greece’s action plan. This will involve a huge effort on the part of Greece itself and, in particular, a well-coordinated effort from the EU to assist Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be necessary to involve EU agencies, such as our joint European Asylum Support Office and Frontex, and those Member States that are able to help. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will also play an important part here in terms of providing financial resources, expertise and other practical assistance. In this connection, it is good that, according to information received, there are plans to set up new reception centres in the Evros region. In a moment I will hand the floor to the Commissioner, who will be able to tell you more about the subject of migration in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that, in the Council, we have discussed how we can show solidarity with Member States whose asylum systems are under particular pressure. On 8 March, therefore, the Council adopted a set of Council conclusions on a common framework for genuine and practical solidarity towards Member States facing particular pressures on their asylum systems, including through mixed migration flows. The central element of this solidarity framework is the idea of an early warning, preparedness and crisis management mechanism within the Dublin Regulation. This mechanism has now been included in the amendment to the Dublin Regulation, which we have just sent to Parliament with a view to initiating trialogue negotiations. This mechanism provides us with a starting point to enable us to anticipate situations like the one we are seeing in Greece. At the same time, we will have the tools to assist the country in question should the situation arise.</p>
<p class="contents">There is agreement in the Council concerning the value of strengthening the Schengen cooperation and control of the external borders. The Council is also in agreement about strengthening the role of the EU agencies and cooperation with third countries, as well as promoting effective and proper expulsions. The agencies in particular are vital for strengthening solidarity by increasing their practical cooperation. The Presidency firmly believes that solidarity is an important principle, which must be implemented in the form of genuine and practical cooperation. With this general starting point of solidarity, we will, of course, maintain our focus on the situation in Greece and the implementation of the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council supports the implementation of the action plan and is in favour of a well-coordinated effort, and I am pleased that Parliament has taken up this subject here today, as, in this area too, Greece’s challenges are the EU’s challenges. A reform of Greece’s asylum and migration system and well-managed border control are not only important for the EU and Greece, but also for migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cecilia Malmström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for the opportunity once again to discuss this very important issue concerning migration management shortcomings in Greece, which is linked with the ongoing discussions on the Common European Asylum System and also concerns the fundamental rights of individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been continuously supporting Greece’s efforts to reform its asylum and migration policies. As was mentioned by the Minister, Greece developed an Action Plan on Migration Management and Asylum Reform, and progress has been achieved in a number of areas there. Two new services have been established – one for the examination of applications and one for initial reception. These are important steps.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) deployed asylum support teams in Greece. These teams provide advice on reception conditions in the Evros area, which is the one that is the most problematic. These activities will continue this year and will be further intensified. We have also conducted technical missions in Greece, including the Task Force for Greece, where the UNHCR, the IOM, Frontex and the EASO are all involved, in order to ensure a holistic approach. We continue to make great efforts to promote stronger engagement by the Turkish authorities in preventing the irregular migratory flows from transiting through Turkish territory towards the EU’s borders.</p>
<p class="contents">So there has been progress, but much more needs to be done. The humanitarian situation in Evros is not acceptable. The conditions in which migrant and asylum seekers are kept are particularly worrying. Progress needs to be immediate and sustainable. More efforts are needed from the Greek authorities in this respect. Greece should trigger emergency mechanisms to provide immediate humanitarian relief to the migrants crossing the border area. They can use EU funding to do this and to renovate existing facilities and temporarily increase capacity by renting hostels for vulnerable groups, as well as deploying habitable containers within the security perimeters in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has on many occasions reminded the Greek authorities that failing to take urgent measures could lead to significant legal consequences, but of course, on a daily basis, there are also very serious humanitarian consequences. We are there to help, as are the Member States’ numerous organisations and institutions, but Greece itself has the responsibility to act in accordance with international and Union law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to provide strategic and targeted support for Greece’s efforts to reform its system. This involves the provision of additional financial assistance and emergency support but also expertise on the ground, in close collaboration with the national authorities, the agencies, the UNHCR and the IOM.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece is among the main beneficiaries of the Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows Programme, with a total amount of EUR 309 million allocated so far. However, there is a problem of absorption from the Greek side, so very little of this money has been used so far. For immediate needs, we recently granted an additional amount of EUR 3.75 million under the European Refugee Fund to implement emergency measures, and we are concerned about the possibilities for using that money as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to streamline the delivery mechanism at national level, removing constraints and reinforcing management of the funds. Support will also be provided by the EU Task Force on Greece established by the Commission to assist and maximise the absorption of EU financial assistance and the implementation of the reform package. A dedicated expert was deployed to Athens in December 2011 to advise the Greek authorities directly involved in the implementation of these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to recall the Commission’s recast proposal for the Dublin Regulation which, like the rest of the asylum package, aims to increase the efficiency of the system and to improve protection of the applicants. We are very grateful to Parliament for its strong support for the Commission’s proposal and to the Presidency for ensuring that they are now ready to enter into a trilogue on these issues and other related issues in the asylum package.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent court rulings again prove that the EU needs a solid and efficient Common European Asylum System to support the Member States and guarantee a fair and effective system of providing international protection to people in need. This is a common goal for the European Union and has been so for quite some time. The need for common rules and greater solidarity is now even more pressing. We need high standards and stronger cooperation to make sure asylum seekers are treated equally wherever they apply and that people in need of protection can have access to this protection. With a fair system throughout the European Union it is possible for all Member States to share the responsibility for this.</p>

I absolutely agree with what the Commissioner said about the individual rights that should be enjoyed by asylum seekers. What he did not highlight and clarify to the House is the huge number of people who enter Greece as illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will understand, when Turkey liberalised visas for all countries in the area and in the Mediterranean, so that a person from Tripoli in Libya can enter Istanbul for EUR 50 and then travel by road to the Greek border, things changed. Those who enter at that point – brought there by various human traffickers – are people about whom we know nothing; we do not know their origin or what language they speak, they have no papers and, of course, they all apply for asylum. So when 300 or 500 people cross the border every day, it is extremely difficult to manage such a large number of people.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I agree with Commissioner Malmström that we need distinctions in Dublin II and I particularly welcome that you too have realised this and want to strengthen it. As you will understand, with Greece bearing 90% of the burden of illegal immigration, things are becoming difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the decision has been taken to have a large number of centres in which immigrants will be kept under humane conditions and efforts will be made to return them. However, there is only one solution to the problem, Commissioner: Turkey must be forced to apply its refoulement agreement with the European Union and must be forced to apply the agreement it signed with Greece in 1999. I do not think that we can have candidate countries opting to recognise or not to recognise their agreements with Europe by their own yardsticks. Turkey must be forced to prevent this massive pressure. For the rest, no one in Greece wants to deprive these people of their human rights. We participate fully in the Union and in the perceptions and values that we defend and we shall continue, Commissioner, to support and defend them, but we need real support from the Union, the Council, Parliament and from you, who are going about this in the right way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, however, this issue is all the more pertinent given that Greece has just adopted an amendment to the Presidential Decree of 2010 aiming to round up and arrest irregular migrants and asylum seekers, including people suspected of being carriers of infectious diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, these measures are and will be extremely worrying in many regards. Firstly, they specifically target the most vulnerable people on the basis of discriminatory criteria. Secondly, they merely exacerbate prejudices against migrants and asylum seekers in Greece. Lastly, they are contrary to Greece’s obligations with regard to the detention of irregular migrants and persons who are entitled to international protection. I would therefore like to hear what you have to say, if that is indeed the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to a situation that has lasted for a very long time, I would like to address some other issues because we must contribute to pursuing a calm and objective debate and ensuring greater visibility of the action taken.</p>
<p class="contents">You touched upon the issue of funding. My first question relates therefore to the action that has been taken so far and the action that will be taken in the future. I would then like you to tell us how, for example, those persons who need international protection, who need access to asylum procedures, who need their applications and reception conditions examined are identified. As mentioned just now – perhaps in a different way – Greece is being compelled to fulfil the role of policeman of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, of course, continue our efforts to help this Member State cope with migratory pressures that are difficult to manage, but the approach adopted must be that of international and European law, in a spirit of mutual trust between the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While it is true that Greece is facing an enormous challenge, we need, above all, to respond to a challenge facing the European Union: its image in the world, and how the citizens see it. One would have thought that the end of the 20th century, culminating in the fall of the Berlin wall, would lead us to believe that we would never again see the construction of other walls anywhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this is not at all the case. There is an enormous project, devised by Greece, to try to resolve to its huge problems caused by the arrival – as our Greek colleague said – of more than 300 people a day at its borders through a transit country, Turkey, and these are citizens who do not come from Turkey but from many other countries around the world. One would have thought that such a thing would never be seen again. What is more, this phenomenon is accompanied by an utterly disgraceful humanitarian situation, which violates the human rights we are constantly developing, protecting, defending and safeguarding as the most precious gift that the European Union has given to its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The solutions to the problems are, needless to say, difficult, and the messages are complex. Without getting into the technical side of things, it is of course quite clear that solidarity – as Cecilia Malmström has just explained, through the idea of shared responsibility, through technical mechanisms, the funding that must be used, the earmarking of EU funds – should make it possible to provide effective aid and to address the situation in which these people find themselves with dignity and in a manner that is consistent with human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message, which has often been heard in recent weeks in Europe, is to up the stakes in the construction of texts and a rule of law system conveying the solidarity of the Member States towards Greece, which is coming under pressure along its borders. To ‘up the stakes’ means to construct a veritable arsenal of texts applicable by all and not to miss the point either, like when in my country, France, we talk about re-erecting internal borders when what we should be doing is protecting external borders – in a spirit of humanism, it should be remembered.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, the third reply, or the third message underlying our proposals, is to have the possibility and the political will to achieve a balance between the north and the south and to use development aid and partnerships with southern countries so that migrants have no desire to come to an El Dorado that does not exist.</p>

I believe that all the bodies – the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights, the Agency for Fundamental Rights, civil society organisations – have, at some time or other, sounded the alarm. What is more, this alarm has been heard by the Commission. Greece has since launched a national asylum and immigration plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, there is no escaping the fact that the situation in the detention centres – and I have visited some in Greece – remains an insult to human dignity, that, since the start of the year, dozens of people have been killed at the Greek-Turkish border trying to cross the River Evros, and that NGOs are now seeing, within the context of the economic and social crisis in Greece, a sudden increase in racist attacks; they have recorded 63 cases in Athens and Patras, 18 of which involved police officers, during the last six months of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, in the period leading up to the elections in Greece, we hear preposterous proposals and a surfeit of extremely xenophobic policies – which can only be described as anti-immigrant – like the proposal to build detention centres, but, in particular, the proposal to herd together migrants and asylum seekers suspected of being ill. We also hear political leaders characterise the issue of migrants as a time bomb for society and for the security of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Confronted with this, of course, the European Union must respond with its values, its instruments and its principle of cooperation and solidarity. In this regard, it should nonetheless be said to the Member States that threatening Greece with expulsion from the Schengen area is an absolutely scandalous proposal, when, at the same time, the Member States openly regret that the Court prevents them from sending the asylum seekers back to Greece under the Dublin Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, this cowardice and this hypocrisy on the part of the Member States of the European Union cannot be tolerated, and the Commission has a great responsibility in this regard to guarantee our fundamental principles.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey is concerned, I believe we should try to look at the situation as it is.

Policies of economic and social inequality, repression, blatant discrimination, exploitation and terror are just some aspects of the picture. Immigrants are being detained <span class="italic">en masse </span>in terrible conditions, deprived of even the basic requirements, and occasionally fall victim to police violence and humiliating treatment. Of those who are not detained, most live in conditions of social exclusion, with no potential for social integration. They fall victim to violence and racism and to exploitation by gangs and employers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the run-up to the elections, injustice and misconceptions are on the increase. The State is using immigrants as scapegoats for the crisis, making them the target of general despair and anger about plummeting living standards. They are being painted as a public health hazard and as common criminals. Xenophobic rhetoric is being stepped up and arrests and ‘clean-up’ operations are being carried out, as if we were talking about rubbish. In the last quarter of 2011 alone, 60 violent racist incidents were reported in Athens and they are spreading and have increased recently, with even minors taking part.</p>
<p class="contents">The State bears serious responsibility, as does the European Union. We hope that the solidarity to which the minister referred earlier will stop being a mere slogan and will be put into practice, with an instrument that Europe can use to offer assistance to countries which, either due to their geography or for other reasons, are unable to cope with the waves of immigrants that the current global situation is forcing to seek a better future in Europe, a solidarity that should be global, that should use economic resources and supportive technical assistance to examine applications and create better screening centres. The European Union must decide on and prove which is its real face: is it fanatic and fearful or is it an area of equality and peaceful coexistence. The second path may be the more difficult, but it is what we want and what we must seek. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few days ago the Greek Parliament decided that additional accommodation which meets European standards should be built. The European Union will or should give support for this, with the help of the European Asylum Support Office.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important that we in this Chamber do not constantly talk only about the dreadful things that have happened or the difficulties. Instead we should make it quite clear what we want to do and explain that we are not demanding that Greece comes up with a perfect solution overnight, given its disastrous internal situation. We will be applying realistic standards to the country and to what it is able to achieve. I also think it is sensible that many countries have stopped returning refugees and will continue to do so in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it seems to me to be important for us to extend our cooperation with Turkey. Ms Malmström has said that we are making an effort to do this. I think that amalgamating visa policy and return policy will cause significant problems. However, one possibility might be not to opt for the larger framework for visa policy, but instead to focus only on students and those in similar situations, including business people. This could be a solution for the countries which may currently still have difficulties in this area. Thirdly, we should agree on cooperation between police forces with regard to returning refugees, because this is about combating criminal people traffickers who are making money at the expense of poor refugees. It is not about disagreements with Turkey over questions of content. I hope and believe that Turkey is ready to start cooperating with our police forces on these issues.</p>

I do not want to beat about the bush. We face a problem that has taken on explosive proportions. Social peace in Greece is at risk, the public health issue has now been raised and, in addition, it is very difficult to explain to a nation that has seen its wages and pensions slashed that you need to spend money, money that is not to spare, helping ‘foreigners’.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, it is Greece’s problem and clearly things were not done in the past that should have been done and, believe me, Greeks are not proud of the images coming out of Evros; but it is a serious problem for the whole of the European Union and, fortunately, we are all agreed on that today. Allow me to say, even though I am immensely grateful for the help being given to my country, that the European Union is not doing enough to bring about the real, global European immigration policy that we need. We need to be bold and I call on the Commission and the Council to initiate at once the procedure to change Dublin II and create an effective system of solidarity between the Member States to manage refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot avoid this, simply because the current situation serves the interests of certain Member States, at a disproportionate cost to certain other Member States, such as Greece. One thing is clear: however well Greece manages European funds, it is impossible to provide the high level of international protection that we have rightly established in the European Union, when 90% of immigrants arriving in Europe do so via Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to close with the following comment: As we all know, Greece is about to hold elections. Whether we like it or not, that is the fact of the matter. The issue of illegal immigration is already being exploited by politicians, mainly from extreme parties, there is populism to spare, unfortunately, and some people are finding it easy to play on people’s concerns and justified fears. Therefore, I call on everyone to handle this issue with the necessary care and sensitivity, especially at this time.</p>

However, a humanitarian and organised immigration policy may benefit both nationals and immigrants, as the experience in Germany, Belgium, the US and Australia has proven. Would these countries be strong without immigrants? We need to ask the question. Many Greeks have helped to make these countries strong.</p>
<p class="contents">We need therefore to put an end to the passive stand that has resulted in xenophobia and to isolate the extreme ministers, politicians and parties that are obstructing rather than solving the problem, with proposals for mass deportations, barriers at borders, detention barracks etc.; proposals that are both dangerous and unfounded. They blatantly infringe human rights, would require a massive operation on the part of the security corps and would involve huge deportation costs for 400 000 people, which is what some people are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">There are realistic and viable solutions that Greece should promote, with solidarity from Europe, because this really is a European problem. The country needs to assume its responsibilities. The legal immigration routes and effective use of existing funds, for which the Commissioner quoted the sum of EUR 309 million, the creation of reception and screening centres and the creation of preconditions to voluntary return will relieve the pressure on Greece and topple illegal immigration gangs.

I think that, as Mr Triantaphyllides stated, Greece is a country that is symptomatic of all of Europe with regard to the issue of immigration. We have to admit that Greece, like other countries in Southern Europe, is a transit country, not a destination country. This is an important point, and I will repeat it: Greece is a transit country and immigrants who arrive in Greece do not usually want to remain in Greece, but plan to cross over to other countries of the European Union, usually those in the North of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the external borders of Greece, as well as the number of immigrants arriving in Greece are not Greece's problem, but the problem of all of the European Union. There are other countries that are in the same situation as Greece: Malta, my home country, is one of them, as is the island of Lampedusa – if anyone here thinks that the sixty thousand people who landed in Lampedusa last year wanted to remain in Lampedusa, it is definitely a mistaken impression. </p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to find concrete ways of solving this collective European problem by giving it a collective European solution. I believe that the Council’s proposals regarding the revision of the Dublin Regulation are not enough, and that we are still far from reaching an agreement. I also believe that the Council’s conclusions regarding solidarity are also inadequate, although they are a step in the right direction. Until everyone understands that this truly is a European problem we definitely are not going to find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I must emphasise, in response to the comments and criticism made by my fellow members, that the family of the man who was murdered by illegal immigrants at six in the morning a few months ago, as he was taking his pregnant wife to the maternity clinic to give birth, also has rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I read the letter sent yesterday by the French and German Ministers for the Interior asking for the facility to introduce emergency border controls and the heads of state have frequently referred in the past to reductions in the numbers of immigrants they wish to receive in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to emphasise the following in response to these comments: when you do not want people to break into your house, you do not lock the sitting room door or the kitchen door. You lock the front door, you secure the main entrance. That is the solution. On the question of illegal immigration in Europe, we must apply the simple logic that we apply in our own homes. In this case, Europe is our home and the main entrance is the external borders of Europe. If you ask Frontex or any other competent authority, they will tell you that the main gateway for illegal immigration into Europe is, as we have already heard, the Greek-Turkish border.</p>
<p class="contents">Again as we have already heard, we need solidarity in Europe, we need funds, know-how and the human resources to strengthen and guard our borders more effectively. At the same time, however, we urgently need to demand that Turkey put a stop at long last to its insulting tolerance of gangs and traffickers taking advantage of the fact that no visa is required in order to enter Turkey from numerous neighbouring countries and, of course, take back the illegal immigrants who arrive in Europe via its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that the refoulement agreement was completed and, as regards people seeking international protection, we need – as we have already heard – a fairer distribution of responsibilities for examining their applications; I am referring, obviously, to changes to Dublin II. If you tell me that other Member States have similar problems, I will tell you that you are mistaken. Around 400 illegal immigrants a day do not enter your countries; and that is based solely on Frontex data, solely on the number of arrests. In reality, the number is even higher. In your countries, you do not have a far right party standing on the hustings every day, because we are in the midst of an electoral campaign, proposing that mines – I repeat mines – should be placed along our land borders with Turkey and I wonder if you often hear proposals in your country that everyone should be entitled to carry a gun. Europe delayed drastically in taking decisions and measures on the debt crisis in Greece. Let it not repeat its error on illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any Member State would experience major problems coping with such a situation. This proves once again that a coherent approach is required at EU level for dealing with these cases. All neighbouring countries must cooperate to control the migration flows and make the borders secure. Frontex has a vital role to play in this process. This is why the agency must be even more involved in the efforts made by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the issue of speeding up the administration involved in granting immigrants legal status. I should mention the voluntary repatriation plan announced just yesterday by the Greek Government.

Over 150 000 illegal immigrants enter my country every year; this is close to 15% of the country’s population per annum. These people are trying to escape persecution, war and hunger and they are, without doubt, entitled to humane and dignified treatment. However, Greece is in crisis and is unable to manage such large immigration flows on its own, because, as numerous speakers have pointed out, nearly 90% of immigrants wanting to get into the European Union arrive in Greece and Dublin II traps them there. Of course, the problems relating to the screening and detention of illegal immigrants are huge and, of course, the procedure for examining asylum applications is not as short as it should be, despite the improvements made.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is hypocritical to compare Greece with other EU Member States in terms of arrivals and the asylum procedure, because the problem is incomparable. The only way to resolve the immigration issue in Greece is to address the real problem, which is a European issue that needs a European solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then again, the money can only be spent at the Greek level, and there we see a lot of shortcomings which are also manifested in the implementation report on the Greek National Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that only 11 people have been recruited for the new asylum service out of 700 planned vacancies. In addition, it is only open on Saturday mornings. That does not really help a lot. And the conditions in detention centres have only improved because there are now fewer people. But why should people who are looking for asylum be detained in any case?</p>
<p class="contents">Overall there are still lots of problems, and indeed it does not help if now in the election campaign migrants are being used as bait in elections and unhelpful remarks are being made. We should really try to help migrants together, to give them a decent chance for a life here in the European Union, and not leave it up to the Greeks alone. Everybody has to do their share in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, the Commission wants to put the EU under the supervision of the European Court of Human Rights, a court which has annulled the Dublin II regulation and which therefore prevents asylum seekers from being returned to the country of first asylum. On the other hand, I am constantly hearing people say that the Dublin II regulation is an important means of resolving this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the problem is concerned, we are repeatedly given the same status reports: the green border is wide open, Turkey is being negligent and there is a lack of willingness to cooperate, with the exception of occasional proposals for financial packages. I would like to know why we do not honestly admit that a fence may not be the best solution, but it is an initial means of solving this problem, Ms Malmström. We must not forget that the people in these regions of Greece have a right to be heard and a right to protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One year ago Lampedusa was overrun, as was the case in Greece this year and in previous years. Mr Busuttil made the point not long ago: 60 000 people came to Lampedusa, but certainly had no intention of staying there. These migrants – economic migrants – arrive in Italy, Greece and Malta, not by any means to stay there but rather to move on to other EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to this is more Europe, more responsibility, more solidarity and enterprise. Negotiations have been opened on the funds for this area of action over the 2014-2020 planning period and might I suggest that Ms Malmström steps in there, just as the Council is pushing for a more enterprising approach.</p>

This is extremely important and I have no doubt we will come back to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece needs to do a few urgent things. It needs to continue to work on the action plan to establish proper reception conditions where people can be screened, registered and have their cases tried as quickly as possible. There needs to be humanitarian assistance to those people who are now in the Evros region and who are in a very difficult situation, especially children and other vulnerable groups.</p>
<p class="contents">There needs to be better protection of the border and a system where people can be returned after a proper procedure if they have been found not to be in need of international protection, and they need to reform the administrative systems so that all the money available is put to proper use. There are huge amounts of money available – hundreds of millions of euros – but they need to be used by the Greek authorities. I am convinced that a lot of things can be done in order to speed up the procedures and the bureaucracy here.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these issues there has been progress, but there needs to be more, and in all these issues we will continue to assist Greece. We are assisting with money, as I said. The EASO is there, willing to help and work hand in hand with the Greek authorities and also on further implementation of the action plan. Some of you mentioned the staffing, which is also really acute.</p>
<p class="contents">Frontex is there, Europol is there to help fight the trafficking some of you mentioned. Experts from Member States and from the Commission are available and imported organisations are there to help: the IOM, UNHCR, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also trying to support Greece in its efforts to negotiate with Turkey so that Turkey can take more responsibility. We are trying to assist Turkey on administrative reforms and with money so that they can take some responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">So progress is being made. We are willing to assist. Nobody denies the enormous difficulties that Greece is facing today. The economic situation is very difficult. Lots of people in Greece are suffering today, we are aware of that. We also know that Greece, because of its geographical situation – and nothing can change this – is very much open to migratory flows that will then seek to come further into Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is a European problem, and we in the Commission and the Council will continue to help and will work hand in hand. Nobody expects changes to come over a weekend. It will take time, but there needs to be steady progress, and this can only happen in partnership. But the main responsibility to make sure that everything is in place is in the hands of the Greek authorities. That has to be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">So thank you very much for this debate. Thank you for your support and understanding on this, and I am sure we will come back to this issue very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incredibly important for us to discuss the situation in Greece with regard to migration so that we can maintain focus on the challenges that Greece is facing in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Malmström has just quite rightly said, Greece has a great deal of work ahead of it, and it is important to always consider how we can show genuine and practical solidarity with Greece and other Member States that experience considerable migration pressure. That is, of course, why we need to assist each other in the EU and ensure that there is a national preparedness system, so that every Member State is immediately able to handle unexpected migration pressure, and it goes without saying that this should, of course, be done with full respect for any obligations under EU and international law. In addition, there is a need to work to prevent crises in a Member State’s asylum system – that is self-evident – and to provide support and a helping hand when a crisis does occur.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we are doing and will continue to do in Greece, and on the strength of this support, we can help to ensure that, as soon as possible, Greece will have an asylum system in which the asylum processing is both fair and efficient and the reception facilities function well. This will help us to ensure normalisation of the Dublin cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to thank you for an excellent debate. It has been interesting to hear your views. This is a subject that deserves thorough debate, because, as I said, it is an enormous challenge for Greece and, in truth, it is also an enormous challenge for our European cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
