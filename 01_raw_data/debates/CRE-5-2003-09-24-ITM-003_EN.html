<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonione,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East and about the most recent events that have shaken the region. The campaign of targeted killings which Israel has decided upon to eliminate the leaders of Hamas, the repeated appalling and bloody terrorist attacks in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the resignation of the Palestinian Prime Minister, Abu Mazen, and the obstacles put in the way of his government by the President of the Palestinian National Authority, the decision in principle taken by Israel's Security Cabinet – the ‘kitchen cabinet’ – to expel President Arafat from the Palestinian Territories, and even the idea mooted that he should be killed, are all elements in a circle of violence which is in danger of spiralling completely out of control, putting an end to any hope of restoring peace to the Holy Land. The escalation of violence therefore needs to be halted as soon as possible. A ceasefire needs to be called without delay so that the negotiating process can be re-relaunched. We are committed to achieving this as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we remain convinced that the only means of achieving a fair and lasting peace based on the United Nations' resolutions and principles is a process based on negotiation and on implementing the process laid out in the road map in good faith. Only in this way will it be possible to realise the vision shared by the international community of two states peacefully coexisting and respecting both the Palestinians' right to self-determination and the Israelis' right to live in peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the day-to-day measures needed to respond to short-term imperatives, we also need other, more extensive measures based on a long-term vision of an area of peace, understanding, dialogue, prosperity and security, uniting the two shores of the Mediterranean. This will be the vision before us at the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Naples, which we hope will give the Barcelona process fresh impetus and enable it to play its part in stabilising and bringing peace to the Middle East and to a wider Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is of the utmost importance that the European Union should maintain a coherent approach on this issue, an approach fully supported by the Member States, the product of ongoing, thorough dialogue between the different viewpoints and perspectives. Only by demonstrating cohesion and unity will the Union actually be able to strengthen its role and its influence in the Quartet and within the region, something we very much hope for. In this connection, the unanimous, united vote by the 25 nations in the UN General Assembly in New York on the resolution exhorting the Israeli Government not to implement its decision to expel Yasser Arafat must be stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">What should our strategy be? In the first place, as I have already said, we believe that the only way to achieve a peaceful solution of the conflict is for the Israelis and the Palestinians to implement the road map promptly in good faith. We are therefore, once again, taking a firm line, calling for the terrorist structures to be dismantled and for both parties to refrain from acts likely to feed the spiral of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe that only broad-based international action can create the conditions necessary for the road map to succeed. This is why we have been consistently committed, from the very beginning of our Presidency, to making the role played by the Quartet (including its role on the ground) more effective as the driving force behind negotiations between the two parties and, at the same time, to reinforcing the credibility and authority of the European Union’s action within the Quartet. Although the United States is the undoubted leader of the whole process, we must, to my mind, avoid a situation where it is left to act alone, unilaterally, on the ground: the European Union’s role must be recognised. Indeed, let us not forget that the European Union's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict are one of its international priorities. Not only is this crisis taking place at the Union's southern borders and destabilising the whole of the Middle East and the Mediterranean region, but it also has wider adverse repercussions affecting the dialogue between civilisations and religions and the fight against international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the practical implementation of the clear strategy I have just outlined, in line with our longstanding strong European commitment, we have consistently devoted special attention to the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to return now to the present, I would like to report on the initiatives that the Italian Presidency has taken in response to the latest tragic events which led to the breakdown of the truce and a return to the appalling spiral of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as supporting the action taken by Mr Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who has made several visits to the region, we have stayed closely in touch with our fellow Quartet members – the United States, Russia and the United Nations – monitoring and assessing all the implications of the situation on the ground, in order to be able to take the most timely and appropriate steps to relaunch the negotiating process. We have also acted to ensure that the Quartet will resume meeting at regular intervals at Special Envoy level without delay and that its ministers will meet on the occasion of the ministerial week at the United Nations General Assembly. The members of the Quartet are unanimous in thinking that its role should be further reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">We have told the two sides via various channels that they must, without fail, take concrete measures straight away to halt the violence and to avoid any action which could prevent a return to the negotiating table. The progress made in the weeks following acceptance of the road map demonstrated that this is the path to take. Despite everything that has happened, we have a duty not to lose heart. There is still an opening, an opportunity to achieve the goals we have set, and violence must not prevent us from seizing it. This was also the thrust of the public declaration issued by the Italian Presidency on behalf of its partners and with their approval on 11 September 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have enormous responsibilities towards their citizens and towards the international community. We accordingly expect them to show firm commitment, greater determination and, above all, great courage, sparing no effort in their pursuit of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the power vacuum created by the resignation of Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas should be filled without delay. Abu Ala, the Prime Minister designate, should quickly form a new Government of respected Palestinian politicians enjoying both his and his people's trust. The new government should continue along the path laid out for it by Prime Minister Abu Mazen, putting an end to violence and opting resolutely for negotiation. Abu Ala should also, as soon as possible and without further ado, deliver clear, tangible results on the security front by taking resolute action against terrorist violence. To that end, it should be the new government – regardless of the membership of the national security council that President Arafat is preparing to appoint – which should have full control over the security forces. If they take this path, Abu Ala and his government can count on the European Union's wholehearted support.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish here to reiterate our conviction that there can and must be no tolerance for terrorism. As the holders of the European Union Presidency, reflecting very widespread public opinion in the Union, we firmly condemned the terrorist attacks for which Palestinian extremist organisations claimed responsibility. At their informal meeting in Riva del Garda at the beginning of September, the EU Foreign Ministers decided to add the political wing of <span class="italic">Hamas</span> to Europe's list of terrorist organisations. This had to be done: the EU had issued clear warnings to <span class="italic">Hamas</span> at the Thessaloniki European Council; not to have followed them up would have undermined the Union's credibility as a force to be reckoned with in the region. I am very happy that the Council was able to reach a consensus that overcame the doubts harboured by some partners and enabled us to agree convincingly on a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">We also consider that the reforms being introduced by the Palestinian National Authority, to make it more democratic, transparent and efficient, are another necessary condition for a peaceful, stable and democratic Palestinian state. Those reforms must continue and be nurtured by support from the European Union and the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to set out clearly the Presidency's position with regard to President Arafat. We cannot deny the essentially negative role that he has played in recent months, contributing to the splits in the PNA's leadership, undermining the efforts of Prime Minister Abu Mazen and causing his resignation. His historical role and his responsibilities towards the Palestinian people should entitle us to expect from President Arafat a change of heart, full backing for the Prime Minister designate, Abu Ala, and a clear condemnation of terrorist violence. Nonetheless, as the Presidency has publicly made clear to the Israeli Government, Yasser Arafat is the Palestinians' legitimately elected President; to send him into exile would be unacceptable and a very serious mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union – confirmed in this stance by the similar positions of the United States, Russia and many other members of the international community – has, accordingly, asked Israel to rescind its decision and to guarantee the physical safety of the President of the Palestinian National Authority: death threats are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We also reminded the Israeli Government of the need to show moderation and put an end, once and for all, to the targeted killings, which, apart from any considerations of international law, all too frequently also strike the innocent, thereby doing much to stoke the fires of rage, frustration and violence. We also urged Israel to work harder to ease the conditions of the Palestinian people in the territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we reminded Israel – whose need for security we do not underestimate – that the European Union expects it to proceed with other specific steps identified by the road map without delay, in particular to suspend all settlement activity in the Palestinian territories, to dismantle the settlements built since March 2001 and to stop erecting the ‘security wall’ along its current route, which is sited beyond the ‘green line’ and therefore jeopardises any prospect of a negotiated solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has an important part to play in the Quartet to reinvigorate the negotiating process in the direction I have described. However, those diplomatic efforts must go hand in hand with action on the ground. We are convinced that the European Union can, alongside the United States, take on a larger role in the international monitoring arrangements provided for in the road map right from phase 1. The possibility of greater European involvement will also be discussed at the Quartet's forthcoming ministerial meeting in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid that, yet again, we have reached a critical point in the Middle East crisis; it is all the more painful because hopes were objectively raised by what seemed to be shared determination to forge ahead regardless of difficulties, with no effort spared. History, especially the history of the Middle East crisis, teaches us that it is precisely when the negotiating process is yielding its first fruits that the forces of radical extremism, which are opposed to any form of peace, unleash greater violence. At precisely these times, however, the onus is on the international community to press the parties involved to opt clearly for the negotiating table and to reject the use of violence. The European Union will ensure that the region and the parties involved feel the weight of its efforts to bring about a negotiated peace. In taking this road, we very much hope that we can rely on the support of Parliament, with its long tradition of closely following the Middle East crisis and responding to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the future of the road map depends on a solid and unambiguous commitment by both sides and by the international community. What is lacking is the political will, which is a crucial factor for peace and completely non-existent today. We had hoped that the road map would create the political will to implement the vision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace. Is this still possible? It is, but only if Israel regains a certain feeling of security, is once again accepted in the region and can have confidence in the Palestinian structures and if at the same time the Palestinians see that Israel accepts their aspiration to build a nation on the territory seized by Israel in 1967, as well as their desire to improve their economic and humanitarian situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What needs to be done today to give new impetus to this road map, which is coming apart at the seams?</p>
<p class="contents">Israel would have to adopt a sufficient number of measures designed to establish a climate of trust, in particular by stopping the extrajudicial executions and the punitive house demolitions, it would have to prove that all illegal settlements built since September 2000 will be dismantled and impose a freeze on new settlements and resolve the problems caused by the building of the ‘security wall’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinians for their part must adopt visible and effective measures to combat the planning or perpetration of terrorist attacks against Israelis by individuals or groups, rein in seditious acts, publicly declaim Israel’s right to exist and speed up preparations for elections, for drafting a constitution and for the participation of civil society in reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the international community must exert its influence in order to resolve the security problem and offer rapid and effective support as sponsors. Tomorrow, in New York, the quartet will meet and the European Union will take the opportunity to attempt to persuade all parties to accept genuine coordination of the quartet as regards the support and follow-up that should be given to this road map.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Council Presidency stated, Hamas still appears on the list of terrorist organisations, but banning this movement in the United States and in Europe is not enough. We must go further. Radical forces exert their influence through the social and educational services and we must not content ourselves with helping to cut off their sources of funding. We must also increase the Palestinian authority’s power to provide local services. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) can also provide support in this area. We believe that what improving security and the fight against extremism requires is above all Community-level action. The Commission has announced a programme of support for the reforms to be undertaken by the Palestinian Authority and also various measures aimed at alleviating the economic and humanitarian problems. We estimate that our commitment this year will total around EUR 245 million. We feel encouraged in this course of action by the aid recently donated to the Palestinian Authority by the United States and by the restoration of Israeli tax receipts to the Palestinian Authority. This will not by any means suffice, however, to get the Palestinian Authority up and running again. The economic situation will not improve if the border closures remain in place and Israel, for its part, must help to kick-start the Palestinian Authority. We must also continue to reiterate to all Arab States to put an end to all public and private funding of groups bent on violence and terrorism and to close down the offices of their representations.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe have much more to offer the people of the Middle East: ever-closer relations thanks to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the network of association agreements that is currently being set up. I want you all to know that we are making progress on this matter with Syria, the last country with which negotiations have not been concluded. We have presented the new initiative on the policy of neighbourhood relations in an enlarged Europe, which sets out all the opportunities for closer cooperation to achieve the economic and social integration of the Euro-Mediterranean region. Only progress in the context of the peace process, however, can help our partners in the region to take full advantage of the opportunities with which the European Union will continue to provide them in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East appears to be hopeless. After the removal of the Iraqi dictator, we had all hoped for a new and peaceful order in the Middle East. This hope proved to be false, and it appears as if all efforts for peace, and the roadmap, have come to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mahmud Abbas has been replaced by Ahmed Kurei after only four months in power. Personalities are of course important, and we also know that the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat are the decision-makers, but, in essence, this is about the people of these countries. Prime Minister Sharon is democratically elected; so is President Arafat. I do not know whether his election meets all the democratic criteria, but he is elected. He is also a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, something that should perhaps spur the Israeli Government and the Palestinians to get back to the common ground that President Arafat once shared with the Israeli Prime Minister Rabin.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all familiar with the enormous problems that we face. In our group, we are perfectly clear in our own minds that we can in no way justify the suicide attacks, which hold human life in contempt. They constitute an abuse of the young people to whom promises of paradise are made, and they involve the murder of other innocent people. They bring about a vicious circle of violence; another result of them is Israel’s death lists, which we can in no way approve of, since – as Commissioner Lamy and Mr Antonione have said – it is not only the hunted criminals, or those assumed to be such, but also a very large number of innocent people who end up being killed. A policy of ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’ will bring no resolution. Just as we hear Hamas and Islamic Jihad speaking the language of hatred, we also see the deeds of hatred, and all this leads to further escalations. There are also Israel’s illegal settlements in Western Jordan, which are a constant provocation for the people in Palestine. Let me quote this from the 8 September issue of the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span>: ‘The symbolic removal of a few containers in illegal settlements west of the Jordan was too little for it to have been capable of becoming an encouraging experience of success for the Palestinians.’ The building of a wall rams home the deep sense of constant humiliation felt in Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">We must seek to enable both Israel and Palestine to live within secure borders, and we declare that all the people of that region – Israelis and Palestinians alike – are endowed with the same dignity. That is why, despite the apparent hopelessness, there is no alternative to pressing on with the efforts towards peace. I am speaking personally rather than on behalf of my group when I say that I do not believe that a peaceful solution will be possible without an international military peacekeeping force. Unless an international military peacekeeping force is used to keep the two sides off each other, I do not believe that a solution will be possible. Nor can we expect the Americans to do everything – their elections mean, in any case, that they are less capable of acting in this area. I rejoice at the common purpose that is apparent here, and it is as the European Union that we should persist in our efforts together with the USA, with the UN, and with Russia. We must persist in our efforts, for it is the people of the Middle East who are at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Menéndez del Valle (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the Israeli threats to assassinate Yasser Arafat are not just morally reprehensible, but also politically unacceptable and absurd, unless, of course, the intention is to cause chaos in the region. It is as if we were not all aware that Hamas and Islamic Jihad consider Arafat to be the barrier preventing them from attempting an assault on Israel. How are the Palestinians going to negotiate with people who intend, in this way, to assassinate their President, democratically elected in 1996 in fair and democratic elections, in the presence of observers, including ours? Frankly, the only legitimate and morally acceptable way to get rid of Arafat is by means of the elections laid down in the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">George Bush has just said, although it sounds like sarcasm, that ‘in the United States we free people by means of a peaceful and ordered process’ but, nevertheless, has vetoed a resolution in the Security Council which advocated just that and expressed opposition to political assassination. I would like to highlight here and now the political realism of President Chirac, who said in New York, and I quote verbatim, Mr President: ‘you may think what you like about Arafat, but the truth is that he is the authority, the elected and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. I do not believe that anyone else can impose an agreement on the Palestinians’. End of quote.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, and in relation to the settlements, it offers little hope that Colin Powell should have said on Monday, and I quote, that: ‘it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the Israeli Prime Minister to say to his people that he is giving in to American pressure’. End of quote. I would ask myself: have the Palestinians not given in, by reforming the Ministry of Finance and creating the post of Prime Minister against the initial will of Arafat although, at the end of the day, with his assent?</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, however, if you wish to listen to an Israeli voice on the subject of Yasser Arafat, then please listen to Simon Peres, who – on reaching 80 years old – has said: firstly, that Arafat has accepted the theory of two states, abandoning that of the destruction of the state of Israel; secondly, that he has accepted the 1967 borders, abandoning those of 1948, and, thirdly, that he has agreed to negotiate. Simon Peres says – and it is true – that Yasser Arafat only has one significant fault, which is that he is not combating the fundamentalist militias of Hamas and Jihad. I, however, would say that until the Israeli Government adopts specific measures, which are credible to the Palestinian population, on selective assassinations, the settlements or the wall of shame, for example, no Palestinian will enjoy the popularity and political support necessary to combat the Islamic extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, not until the non-terrorists have a consolidated political space, which so far Israel has not provided, will the terrorists have lost the war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A number of participants, from both sides, expressed the belief that theirs was, in effect, a 'twenty-second century conflict': a war that would last a hundred years, blighting the lives of their grandchildren's children. A conflict that has the capacity to exhaust the optimism of the best of us once again demands deeper reserves of patience and commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">But grim as the situation is, we cannot afford to despair. If the two sides have strayed from the roadmap's path of peace and reconciliation, we must coax them back.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must continue to play a crucial role in the search for peace in the Middle East. Greater engagement with Israel might help in this. Making peace also requires a strong, functioning and accountable Palestinian Authority. That is why the Union has spent more than EUR 300 million since 2000 to keep the Palestinian Authority in business. An effective and legitimate Palestinian Authority is essential to dismantle the terrorist organisations. The Palestinians also need a strong voice to negotiate with Israel. The European Union must step up its support for financial reform of the Authority to help it distance itself from terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also provided more than EUR 30 million for the vital work of Palestinian municipalities in providing basic public services, because that is how you fight despair – with clean water and classrooms; with the promise of normality and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We may regret Yasser Arafat's intransigence, but we should remember that if the Palestinians voted tomorrow in the fair and transparent elections we would like to see, they would probably choose him again as their leader. The surest way to ensure that outcome would be for Israel to make a martyr out of him. Arafat's place in the peace process is not for us to determine, any more than it is for Israel or for the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we can have no truck with terrorism. That is why my Group welcomes the inclusion of Hamas in the European list of terrorist organisations. Suicide bombings have taken an unbearable toll in Israeli lives, and the political apologists for terror cannot receive support while the killing continues.</p>
<p class="contents">Both sides have to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict. Israel's extra-judicial killings must end, as they will only breed more terrorists, not force the Palestinians to negotiate. Israel must withdraw its forces from the Occupied Territories, and the settlement building must stop.</p>
<p class="contents">Two states, living side by side in peace – that is the only viable solution. Israel's existence as a Jewish state and as a democracy demands a Palestinian state. The alternatives are Palestinian apartheid or the inexorable demographic eclipse of Israel's character as a Jewish homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">The roadmap, of which the European Union was the chief cartographer, recognises this, and my Group remains firmly committed to its implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe’s assistance will be more important than ever in salvaging the situation. This is the message given to us on Saturday, in Ramallah, by President Arafat, who was visibly relieved to have the impassioned support of his people in the face of Ariel Sharon’s relentless hounding of him. At the same time, however, he was extremely concerned at the increasingly intolerable situation facing his fellow countrymen.</p>
<p class="contents">After the staggering decision of principle taken by the Israeli cabinet to expel an elected president from his country, and even, if comments made by the number 2 in the Sharon government are to be believed, to physically eliminate him, my group wished, through the intermediary of its chairman and of our colleague Mrs Morgantini, the chairman of the Parliamentary delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, to express on the spot what the vast majority of European citizens, including many who are actually critical of the Palestinian Authority, think about this extremely serious precedent. This decision is completely unacceptable and I think that it must give food for thought to anyone who thinks that accommodating Ariel Sharon will encourage him to relax his approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The main lesson that we can learn from our meetings in Ramallah, and also in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, is that there has never been a greater need for external political intervention in order to create a momentum for negotiations that offers a population on its knees some hope of a worthy and equitable peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I still remember the ominous words of Commissioner Patten on the eve of the war with Iraq: he basically said, to a barrage of applause from our House, that the one thing he was sure about, was that if this war takes place without a political solution being found for the conflict in the Middle East, we will see an upsurge in terrorism. This is, unfortunately, the situation now facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘road map’ was supposed to take up this challenge and is in a doubly strong position to do so. Firstly, this is a general political plan, not one concerned solely with security. Because it makes sense, the Palestinian people will be all the more willing to rally forces to prevent terrorist acts as their daily lives become liveable once again and as their fundamental rights are recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the route map has four official godparents, not just one, whose credibility as peacemaker is at its lowest ebb. And yet, four months after launching this initiative, what remains of it? What has become of the ‘road map’, what has happened to the ‘quartet’ and, for that matter, what is Europe<span class="italic"> </span>doing? At this crucial time, the European Union is unavailable to its subscribers. I would like to believe that the unanimous vote given by the 25 in New York last week is a sign of a new awareness as regards the collective responsibility that must be shouldered in the region, and Mr Solana, due to speak to Parliament on 9 October, will then explain the political strategy, the practical goals to attain and the timetable of the initiatives decided on in Council to prevent the worst case scenario from arising and to give fresh hope to the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">My own conviction is that, of the priorities for launching such an initiative, three warrant particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must refuse to give in to Ariel Sharon’s blackmail where President Arafat is concerned. It is one thing to support the idea that reforms are needed in the Palestinian Authority. This debate is already taking place in Palestinian society, and is legitimate and healthy. It is another matter altogether unquestioningly to accept the <span class="italic">de facto</span> imprisonment of an elected president in the ruins of his headquarters. What is even worse is the fact that we are bowing down to the veto imposed by the occupying force whilst failing to meet the man seen by his entire people as the living embodiment of Palestine. Significant action is required, in my opinion, to put an end to this terrible ambiguity.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we must strongly oppose the wall that is being built. This is not simply a border that is questionable only in its appropriateness. This constitutes a blatant incursion into internationally recognised Palestinian territory. The wall cuts through the University of Aboudis, near Jerusalem. It cuts through the very heart of Bethlehem. It is depriving Palestinian farmers of crucial irrigated land to the north of the West Bank. The wall’s construction has entailed further land confiscations, further expulsions, and to further check points and foreshadows a Palestine in pieces. This is a scandal of such proportions that even President Bush has taken umbrage at the action of his <span class="italic">protégé</span>. If the White House itself is threatening to remove US credit guarantees for Israel if Israel continues to forge ahead in this opportunistic way, the European Union must finally be bold enough to state clearly that the association agreements with Israel will only remain in place if there is a change of direction in Ariel Sharon’s policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must attach priority to all Israeli and Palestinian initiatives to halt the violence and to reopen political dialogue. I am thinking in particular of the coalition for peace, whose prime movers are Yossi Beilin, former Israeli Minister and negotiator of the Oslo agreements and Yasser Abed Rabbo, outgoing Palestinian government Minister, also a steadfast proponent of Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. These two remarkable personalities have furthermore just accepted the invitation I sent them, on behalf of my group, jointly to visit the European Parliament in mid-November and speak to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also thinking of one of the most symbolic of all Palestinian prisoners, Marwan Barghouti, a member of parliament and also someone who is highly committed to the Oslo negotiations and whose prestige, particularly amongst Palestinian youths, could help to persuade the most recent recruits to engage in dialogue rather than in violence. Lastly, Mr President, I am thinking of Yasser Arafat himself, who has just reiterated his determination to work on achieving a ceasefire and not just a truce, if his efforts and those of the prime minister, Abu Mazen, are not blown out of the water by targeted assassinations and house demolitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the State of Israel, unlike Ariel Sharon, has called for this prospect to be taken extremely seriously. I believe that high-profile initiatives by the European Union in this direction are highly pertinent.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the express request of my group, but this is above all the dearest wish of supporters of peace on the ground who would like to be able to say as soon as possible, full of hope ‘<span class="italic">Europe is back’</span>.</p>

He went on to write, ‘We must remove all the settlements, all of them and draw an international recognized border between a Jewish National Home and a Palestinian National Home’. The European Union can protest as much as it wants against Sharon’s adopted policy; the real change has to happen in Israel itself, where gradually, people are realising that they are heading the wrong way. The separation wall will not solve the problem. We know in Europe that walls are not permanent and that borders do not last for ever. Israel is a friend on the wrong track. Who can help this friend at this stage? Who can bring pressure to bear on the government in Israel? The United States can, because it can turn off the money tap. Apparently, we should not expect much from Washington in the short term either. Is it still serious about the roadmap?</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not time to win respect in the Arab world, now that the situation in Iraq is continually deteriorating? International law should not lose out in the fight against terrorism. We believe that both camps must disarm. Arafat’s status as the elected leader is a matter of unalterable fact. The time is ripe, I believe, for a major conference on the Middle East, at which the European Union can speak with one voice. Only by means of a global solution can peace and stability be established. The United States is asking for support for Iraq. The European Union is asking for support for Israel and Palestine. Indeed, It is indeed possible, Mr Poettering, to moot the idea of an international military force in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Prospects for progress are bleaker now than at any time this year. There has been almost a complete breakdown in the implementation of the roadmap for peace in the region. The cease-fire announced by Islamic Jihad and Hamas has been called off and their leaderships have called for attacks on Israel. Planned Israeli withdrawals from some towns in the West Bank have been cancelled and the Israeli army has been active against Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli security cabinet has also decided, in principle, to remove President Arafat from the Occupied Territories. This decision has been widely criticised, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Israeli side there has been a failure to meet commitments, to dismantle settlement outposts and to freeze settlement activity. The Palestinian side has also been unable to fulfil many of its commitments on the issue of future security.</p>
<p class="contents">New buildings continue to be erected on the settlements in and around Jerusalem and the prospects for the roadmap appear dim unless action is taken in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that imaginative gestures must be the order of the day if the roadmap is to have any chance of survival. Neither side has met its commitment under the roadmap for peace. That is one issue that we can all agree on. The new Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Alaa has international credibility as he is one of the Palestinian negotiators of the 1993 Oslo Accord. We cannot disguise the fact that the decision of the Israel security cabinet to remove President Arafat from the Occupied Territories has led to a deteriorating situation in the Middle East. At the moment the Israelis are insisting that their ban on contacts with those who meet Yasser Arafat also applies to people from within the European Union. This is an issue that will have to be resolved if the European Union is to have any effective role in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly believe that efforts to isolate President Arafat will only exasperate tensions within the Palestinian leadership. Any attempt by Israel to expel him from the Occupied Territories will only undermine the Palestinian Authority and will further inflame the security situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian leadership has been presented with a list of security messages by the United States Government that will have to be implemented. I would also urge the government of the United States to remain fully engaged in the peace process and to press Israel on its commitment to the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the continued efforts of Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten to renew a cease-fire in the region. This has been a particularly bad year for the Middle East. Not only is the political situation becoming more unstable now in Iraq, but if we are not all collectively careful, the situation between Israel and Palestine could also deteriorate further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He did so behind closed doors. What has since been made known of this closed meeting makes a mockery of any Palestinian implementation of the so-called roadmap. It is abundantly clear from Mr Abbas’ indictment that the person responsible for this is the President of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mahmud Abbas was, along with his Cabinet, committed to the reform of elementary policy areas such as the coordination of the Palestinian security services and the purely financial management of public funds, but to no avail. All these praiseworthy attempts eventually foundered on one person’s thirst for power, that person being ‘raïs’ Yasser Arafat. Hence Abbas’ lament: ‘A Palestinian minister does not even have anywhere near as much power as a deputy secretary elsewhere.’</p>
<p class="contents">How do we go on from here? Officially, the President of the Palestinian Authority is very much the relevant political interlocutor for the European institutions. Given the seriousness of Mahmud Abbas’ accusations, I am asking both the Council and Commission what they think the implications of this are. After all, ignoring this courageous, honest Palestinian self-criticism renders the roadmap to peace in the Middle East politically implausible – certainly when a new Palestinian Prime Minister has to operate from the same position of relative weakness as Mahmud Abbas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This blast was sustained, of course, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, by the radical extremists but above all by the negotiators themselves, as a result of the total lack of trust they demonstrated in their partners and due to the fear that if they stopped acting like an adversary, the latter would take advantage of the agreement to consolidate their positions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this disease of fear that I have fought relentlessly since the renewal of the Intifada re-injected the virus of it into an area where, as Mr Poettering has just said, those who secured peace are today in despair. I am very aware that speaking here, in these comfortable and safe conditions, might appear to be laughable or even blasphemous to those who are suffering physically or whose nearest and dearest are.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, however, to set an example and offer our assurance that we are willing to help them.</p>
<p class="contents">The example we can set involves the reconciliation, here in Strasbourg itself, of nations that have continued, for generations, to live paralysed by the fear of one another.</p>
<p class="contents">Our assurance means providing the certainty that when Israelis and Palestinians finally agree on the terms of an agreement, with the assistance of the quartet and as a conclusion to your endeavours, Mr President-in-Office the European Union will do everything it can to ensure the political, material and, if need be, military implementation, by deploying peacekeeping forces to replace a wall whose effectiveness will always be in doubt and – yes, Mr Wurtz – which it is impossible to justify. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution, interpreted politically, does not only have the narrow sense of what Arafat means and what the problem means today; it also expresses the demand of the international community for a solution at long last to this impasse of a crisis which has lasted 40, 50, 60 years, with thousands dead and thousands murdered.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are or are not debating today is immaterial in relation to what must be done there. We here are a political body. We are not judging intentions. In this sense, we must only speak about what needs to be done politically. We are talking about one roadmap in relation to what is happening in the area and we fail to see the other roadmap, the map of violence, of blood, of suicides, of innocent people murdered and so on, of the wall, of anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent days, there has been a new representative of the European Union in the region, Mr Otte. Unfortunately, however, he has been ill-received by the Sharon side, which has refused to receive him, as it refused our other representatives, because they also wanted to see Arafat. This is not a positive development. We must send out certain positive messages. The Quartet is not enough, it is not enough as a body of observers. It needs to be converted into a task force which will impose terms and conditions and procedures. Otherwise, every time we come here, we shall list our complaints, some of us from a position of security, others in line with their sympathies, but without any final result.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore agree with the proposal made by my honourable friend Mr Poettering for international blue-helmeted observers to be installed at long last on the border between the two states, as has happened elsewhere in the world. I agree with all the proposals which do not have us as neutral observers, which do not lead us into inaction. I agree with all the proposals which, at long last, call for us to take action on our own responsibility and not for us to simply wait and follow others' instructions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The road map is a plan in three phases. The whole thing is summed up in the title of Phase I – <span class="italic">Ending terror and violence, normalising Palestinian life, building Palestinian institutions</span> – and its aim is to bring about an immediate and unconditional end to violence on the Palestinian side. This is the vital point, and if it cannot be achieved everything else will become ambiguous, uncertain and vaguely sermonising in tone. Frankly, it does not make sense to call on Israel to take further or different initiatives in addition to those it has adopted thus far, if acts of terrorism on the part of the Palestinians are not halted. No European state confronted with a series of terrorist attacks, especially against unarmed civilians, would agree not to react using force and legal means of suppressing violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor am I convinced by the exhortations to keep Mr Arafat in place on the grounds that he is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, given that everyone recognises that there are still no democratic institutions within the Palestinian community.</p>
<p class="contents">Yasser Arafat is responsible for the failure of the Camp David agreement and for Abu Mazen’s failure. I believe that we in Europe should adopt a more severe approach towards his behaviour if we are to secure a change in attitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I concur with what Mr Wurtz has said, but I should like to add something in relation to our own mandate. When we are confronted with endless violence that always generates more violence, then we are facing a situation that condemns Europeans, Americans and Russians to powerlessness, insofar as their opinions are expressed in a joint phased plan to peace. There is no phased plan to peace. I have read it and do not want to read it again. For what is left of it? It has been shot to tatters from all corners. What I am asking you is how we can take a new direction. With this roadmap, have we not been led to believe in an all too optimistic scenario, the premises of which have not been accepted by the actual state of Israel itself? Has Israel accepted that it will, from now on, live with a Palestinian state beside it? Has Israel really abandoned the idea that the occupied territories should be governed by Israelis? I am coming to the conclusion that it has not and that, instead, it hopes to achieve military dominance in the region with military backing from the United States. In that case, there will be no peace. Every nation is entitled to its own home. I see it as Europe's responsibility to sit down with both parties to find out their real intentions and to stop collaborating with a regime that is using military means to eradicate part of a powerless nation and is trying to kill its elected president. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Remember what happened the day after he had got the Palestinian leaders to enter into a unilateral ceasefire. Israel liquidated Hamas leaders in the street, an act that was of course no better than a terrorist attack, for, when Hamas leaders are liquidated, their wives and children and casual passers-by are also killed. Nor, of course, is an occupying power entitled to kill in the street those who are engaged in resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that until the West makes it fully clear that we condemn the liquidations perpetrated by Israel just as strongly as we condemn suicide bombers; until we make it abundantly clear to Israel that it must call a halt to the settlements; and until we make it crystal clear that, as long as it holds Palestine in an iron grip of oppression and violence, there can be no peace, we make it completely impossible for any Palestinian Prime Minister to put a stop to the violence.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was last in Palestine with the delegation, there were three deaths in just the few days that I was there. A little boy died when an olive stone went down his throat the wrong way. There was a curfew, so no doctor went out to him, and he therefore died. An old man died at the checkpoint. He said that he had a bad heart, but the soldiers refused to allow him to pass the checkpoint, and they looked on as he died there of a heart attack. A patient died in an ambulance on the way to hospital because it too was not allowed to pass the checkpoint.</p>
