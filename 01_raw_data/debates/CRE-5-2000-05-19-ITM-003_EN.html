They will be called upon to play an even more important role in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the European Union must strengthen its presence in such regional organisations, in those that already exist and in those that may be created in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in terms of human and technical resources, the European Commission is, in our opinion, currently unable to be present in each and every one of these regional fisheries organisations with the commitment they deserve, or in a way that reflects the important interests the different Community fleets have in the various oceans on this planet. NAFO is an exception and has perhaps become the best attended, most regulated and most monitored organisation of them all.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that the Commission is paying greater attention to some of these organisations, as in the case of the ICCAT. This is certainly an organisation that is no stranger to pressure from this House and, more specifically, from our Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are a number of other organisations – to mention only those that relate to the tuna species – and, alongside the aforementioned Atlantic tuna organisation, there is a pressing need for our presence in, and commitment to, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the IOTC, the Inter-American Commission for Tropical Tuna, the IATTC, or the MHLC, the Multilateral High Level Conference, which is negotiating the convention that will govern the Western Pacific Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission needs to have an effective presence, both in terms of human and technical resources, in all these organisations and, as I said, in those that may be created in the future. Parliament will help, and we shall spare no effort in ensuring that, in such organisations, the European Union has a level of influence that corresponds to our fisheries sectors. These sectors are calling for such an influence in view of third countries which, incidentally, sometimes defend their interests more vigorously than we defend ours.</p>
<p class="contents">NAFO has served as a model in many cases. The regulation we are now considering represents an attempt to incorporate decisions adopted by the organisation in 1997, 1998 and 1999 into Community legislation to make our internal measures more effective. In this case, we are dealing with the thorny issue of trying to ensure that vessels which are not part of the organisation respect the rules laid down by regional fisheries organisations. Such vessels, whether operating under flags of convenience or not, simply act freely whilst others respect provisions on the conservation of resources and, of course, contribute to these respective laws.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the measures drawn up, measures which are still scarce and difficult to apply, but which will continue to increase the world’s awareness of responsible fishing and trade and make such awareness more effective. The measures suggested by this House’s Committee on Fisheries are along these lines. They are measures which clarify some concepts to ensure greater accuracy and improve, as far as possible, upon the already significant control measures in NAFO waters.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, a Community vessel that was operating in NAFO waters, the Santa Mafalda, has been ordered into the Portuguese port of Aveiro with Canadian NAFO inspectors on board. Whilst we await the findings of the port inspection, we ask everyone to comply with the NAFO fisheries’ regulatory measures. These measures on the conservation of resources are essential if such resources are to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Canadian authorities to behave in accordance with NAFO control measures and not to exceed their authority. During the plenary sitting on this matter, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President of the Commission, acknowledged that they had exceeded their duties in appropriating the ship’s documentation without the authorisation of the captain of the vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">Attitudes such as these remind us of a time we thought we had left behind, a time when Canada created a crisis, which we do not wish to see repeated under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we ask for a forceful response from the European Commission to Canada over their behaviour and – I should like to stress this and then conclude – we ask everyone to behave appropriately in order to conserve resources and we ask them to comply strictly with the rules laid down by NAFO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be quite frank, the owners of these vessels are stealing fish. They deliberately refuse to join NAFO, of which the European Union is a member. They think they can shirk all their responsibilities by doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">We have known for a long time what kind of problems the fishing industry as a whole has to contend with. Overfishing certainly plays an important part in this regard. What we therefore need, at the end of the day, is a coherent fishing policy, not just in our waters, but worldwide, where all parties act in concert and cannot play their own game. This concerns everyone: the international community, individual countries and the European Union. NAFO is therefore more important than you would think for everyone, and not just for the European Union. The consequences of uncontrolled fishing have already been disastrous, particularly for cod and redfish, two highly valued sources of food. Regulations – that is, either a total ban on fishing or at least clear restrictions on fishing – have been in force for both types of fish on the part of NAFO ever since the 1990s. In spite of all the efforts even simply to make these often stateless vessels comply with the protective and conservation measures, fishing continues to proceed unabated.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem for the European Union was previously the lack of a unified system of control when checking vessels of non-contracting parties in EU ports because they are obviously not subject to Community law. By transferring the NAFO regulations as international law directly into Community law which is in force in all EU Member States, the regulation presently under discussion thus gains importance. The NAFO regulations – and their assimilation in a unified system – which control and, if necessary, sanction the non-contracting parties and their frequently stateless vessels and fishing, are therefore the most important matter dealt with in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who took part in a psychological study which exists in Germany, and which is appropriately named the ‘Fishing Game’, always headed for a resources catastrophe when they acted in isolation. In the final analysis, every one of them always took whatever was still left and this could no longer be replaced at the end. If we do not want to just have the choice between unreliable sources of food or unreliable fishing, then a functional form of cooperation between all the parties involved would be in our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of NAFO, and with a large number of Member States of its own, the EU fulfils the requirements for this. We therefore welcome this initiative, but would like a few minor points to be clarified in our motions in order to achieve greater coherency between NAFO and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word on this interesting term ‘international law‘. EU law also has its origins in international law. Certainly, we must now realise that EU Community law has become a term in its own right, and that this must be analogous to the evolving definition of the term ‘European Union’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, in his speech, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has already mentioned the forceful response from the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Kinnock, to my question on the boarding by Canadian inspectors of a Portuguese fishing vessel in NAFO waters.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to maintain the balance in this important organisation – and in what is an extremely important fishing ground for the Community fleet – then the only way to do so is for everyone to behave responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation under discussion today, on control measures for vessels from countries which are non- Contracting Parties to NAFO, is very much linked to this sense of responsibility that is so necessary in the fisheries sector. I am referring to the responsibility we all share for managing marine resources, in accordance with rules accepted by all parties to guarantee that such resources are preserved and that ours will not be the last generation to see cod, redfish or American plaice.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional fishing organisations have played an increasingly important role over recent years in the management of resources. In this respect, we, the Socialists, would like to continue developing the idea that encourages this sense of responsibility. Legal philosophies dating from times gone by have been left behind, times when man felt how small he was in relation to the immensity of the Earth, which appeared to be a planet with infinite resources. The lack of ownership of the seas and the principle that the sea belongs to no one sprang from such ideas. However, nowadays, in a world that is becoming ever smaller, a world dominated by new technologies that make the world even smaller and with resources we know are becoming more and more scarce, we, the Socialists would like to move forward on the principle that the sea belongs to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we would like NAFO to be – and indeed it is – an organisation open to countries that have vessels operating in this area. In this way, such countries would play a part in creating regulatory measures and would share responsibility for managing resources.</p>
<p class="contents">If this does not happen, flags of convenience, euphemistically known as ‘non-Contracting Parties’, will benefit, not to mention the piracy which lies behind the euphemism, ‘stateless vessels’. Such vessels – which we are often keen to believe have nothing to do with us – do not come from remote southern seas, but rather almost always originate from European ports, from Community ports. They fly strange flags and their aim is to practise social dumping. In so doing, they avoid regulations on the rational management of resources and pay no attention to workers’ social rights. People who idolise the market should note from this that neither fish nor people gain anything from their hypotheses.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is extremely important that countries with vessels operating in NAFO waters are Contracting Parties, just as it is important that the European Community is also a Contracting Party to regional organisations being set up in the South Atlantic and beyond the area the Community fleet currently operates in. Our fleet, the Community fleet, does not wish to be seen as a pirate fleet, as a fleet without nationality, nor as an intruding fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to state that it wholeheartedly agrees with the content of this report although it regrets, as does the rapporteur himself, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, that there is a lack of proposed measures from the Commission on combating the main enemy of our fleet and of the conservation of fishery resources today. This enemy is none other than those vessels flying flags of convenience.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – I would very much like to support this report. It is extremely important and it is very important to support the attempts of NAFO to halt this very problematic activity of non-contracting parties. The reality of the situation is that "vessels from non-contracting parties" usually means vessels flying flags of convenience or flags obtained from countries which have open registers. These are countries which will allow shipowners the right to fly their flag if they pay the country a fee. Under international law, it is the responsibility of the state whose flag vessels fly to ensure that they abide by the relevant rules and regulations; for example, conservation measures, safety and labour standards, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The big problem is that these countries selling flags of convenience have no intention of enforcing these rules, and that is the main reason why they appeal to these unscrupulous shipowners who can do what they like. They can flout the law and no one is going to try and enforce it. All the shipowner has to do is pay a bit of money to the country to get the flag which will allow him to fish with impunity. This really has to stop.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of these countries is very long, but the traditional ones are Belize, Panama, Honduras and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Many of these vessels have been active in the NAFO area, but that is not the only place where they operate. Very large numbers have also been fishing for tuna in the Atlantic where the regional organisation is ICAT. ICAT has done more than any other regional organisation to try and combat fishing by flags of convenience. Most dramatically – and this is something that other people should take their lead from – is that it has now imposed import bans on bluefish tuna from one of its own members, Equatorial Guinea. ICAT really does mean business and other people should follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Organisations like ICAT and NAFO cannot solve the problem on their own. The responsibility lies in many other quarters and this responsibility needs to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Many shipowners like to use flags of convenience for it lets them get away with just about anything. There is no way of enforcing the law. The countries that sell allow them to fly their flags; they turn a blind eye and do not care. This is why it is so popular. The EU is among the worst in this sense.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Lloyd's Maritime Services, in December 1999 there were 1,323 vessels over 24 metres flying flags of convenience. Of these, 168 were owned by companies based in EU Member States. By far the worst, of course, and not surprising, is Spain with 116 vessels, but of course they are not alone. Each country tends to have their preferred flag use. For instance, the French vessels tend to use flags of Réunion, St Vincent and the Seychelles. For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama. The Dutch use Belize and St Vincent and 4 vessels, of course, from my own country are flagged in Belize as well. The preferred British countries are Panama and Belize. It is not surprising that Belize is there, considering last year’s revelations about Michael Ashcroft, the Tory Party treasurer’s business connections there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish fleet is distributed across a very long list including Belize, Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, Panama and many others. The only place which has more of these flags of convenience is Taiwan, with 117, which just beats Spain into first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, the Commission was actually trying to do something; it proposed refusing to grant subsidies for transferring ship ownership to countries with open registers. The Council refused. It wants to use public money to fund ways of breaking the rules, and that is not acceptable. At least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public's attention. For the past two weeks, Greenpeace has had a ship in the middle of the South Atlantic where they have found plenty of vessels catching tuna, flying these flags of convenience. They have also found a transport vessel, flagged in Panama and owned in Japan, both contracting parties to ICAT by the way, which was receiving fish from non-contracting vessels from Belize. This is very much against ICAT rules and I really think we have to address it. The European Union has to take responsibility on this issue.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have often voiced my opinion that NAFO fishing grounds are undoubtedly among the most regulated in the world. Such vigilance is sometimes the result of excessive mistrust, on the part of some Contracting Parties – who have almost unlimited power in NAFO - towards other parties who operate completely legitimately.</p>
<p class="contents">We all remember the unjust and regrettable incidents that took place a few years ago, regarding a Community vessel. These incidents were the product of suspicion bordering on persecution which has often concealed a desire to throw a smoke screen around management errors in some coastal states.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I must applaud the fact that this proposal aims at incorporating into Community legislation three NAFO recommendations on controlling activities of vessels of non-Contracting Parties, and in particular non-Contracting Parties whose activities are, without a shadow of a doubt, much more suspect than those of any Community fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">As is usual procedure when discussing the transposition of measures into Community law, I must once again express my disappointment over the Commission’s delay in starting to work on adapting legislation. If it is indeed true that the proposal covers NAFO’s latest recommendations on sightings and transhipments from its annual meetings in 1998 and 1999, it is also true to say that this represents nothing more than a reworking of the 1997 recommendation, which is only now being taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides this now traditional complaint, this proposal for a regulation represents an opportunity to debate the real problem of flags of convenience and discuss what the European Union is doing to deal with them. Given the current state of marine resources, and at a time when there is growing awareness of the need for real protection of marine ecosystems, the fight against illegal fishing must become a priority and vessels flying flags of convenience should be first on the list.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is responsible for taking the lead in the fight against such harmful forms of fishing and must be capable of putting forward its own alternatives. The first step must be to propose unified and clear measures in the fight against such activity to Member States. The aim of such common rules is to ban the flying of such flags and stop Member States allowing these fleets to dock in their ports. Currently, not all Community ports are aware that, directly or indirectly, they are often providing cover for illegal activity. We can only develop their awareness through an information campaign and by introducing rigorous measures to accompany it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The whole question of what we do to protect marine life outside our waters is not a very popular issue. It does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the European Union. There is a growing understanding of the efforts that the European Union is making, and I would say that for the many years during which the Common Fisheries Policy has existed, the Union has failed, to a large extent, to convince the European public of the importance of the role it has been playing in trying to establish the facts of marine life, to provide the public with the scientific information and to take the necessary action.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often we do not get the sort of support from Member States and from national governments that is needed to convince the public that determined and substantial efforts have to be made to enforce all the laws and regulations. In spite of these efforts, something like 80% of all the major stocks are still over-exploited and continue to diminish.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures before us may be the best that we can manage, but they seem rather weak and hardly sufficient to achieve what we want. We are the biggest market and the most lucrative market in the world for fish products. We should be prepared to use our muscle and impose every necessary trade sanction on all the states and all the products that are associated with this illegal trade. It is not just a matter of protecting our interests, because stocks outside our 200-mile limit can be affected by our activities. Stocks within our limit can be affected by activities outside it. There is also the whole question of our obligation to protect this resource that belongs to mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that for some people who have the money to buy large ships and equip them in today's world there is no limit to the capacity that can be applied to extracting resources from the sea. I do not think that individuals should have the right, just because they have the money and capacity and because they happen to live in a certain region, to go out and exploit those resources and become very rich as has happened in some instances. We may be reaching the point where this resource is tendered and paid for and the public can get some compensation from those who get rich very quickly – they are already doing this in New Zealand. The European Union in its review of the Common Fisheries Policy should take into account the fact that this is a public resource and that a small number of people think they have the right to go out and get rich from it. There would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the old days people went out and took risks with their lives and bad equipment; today they have the capacity to know where the fish are, to get them, and to exploit them and they should have to pay a fee for that.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, the aim of the regulation is to implement at Community level a very important NAFO scheme intended to counteract non-contracting party activities which risk undermining the effectiveness of NAFO conservation measures. In this context, I should stress that the Community, as a contracting party to NAFO, has every interest in measures that help to resolve problems caused by states which do not discharge their cooperation and conservation obligations under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of the proposed amendments, I should stress the following. Amendment No 1 does not seem to be necessary. In fact, recital 3 of the version proposed by the Commission is correct because we are actually dealing with the practice of using non-contracting party vessels. What is more, this wording is drawn from the language used in other legal texts, for instance the Council decision concerning the approval by the Community of the FAO compliance agreement and the Council regulation laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of non-contracting parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 is relevant and will be taken on board. Amendment No 3 is not acceptable to the Commission. There is no need to impose an obligation on individual vessels. If it merely involves spelling out a faculty for individual vessels, there is no need to regulate. Furthermore, the terms "proceed to a formal sighting" can be construed as an obligation for the Community inspection vessel to direct itself towards non-contracting party vessels in order to make a sighting formal. Such an obligation would divert the inspection vessel from the performance of its existing tasks, which is certainly not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that what I have had to say has contributed to a better understanding and thank you again for the time and effort you have put into this proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Ms McKenna rightly said, the use of flags of convenience makes it possible to flout all the regulations. My father had a bar in Genoa next to the Panama consulate – and I am not criticising the Panama consulate or any other consulate, for that matter – and I am therefore very aware that laws are violated. For example, people who did not know how to swim or row were allowed to set sail, for only a passport was required, not a seaman’s book. We will be staffing ships with sailors who do not know how to swim, next. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
