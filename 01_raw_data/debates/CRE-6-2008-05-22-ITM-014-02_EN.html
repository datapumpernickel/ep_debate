As usual in such cases, we note what it is that dictators do. Obviously dictators always battle with organised religion, because, very often, this is the biggest voice that the population has. They also always battle with the trade unions. As it happens the trade unions in Belarus are rather weak, so, from this point of view, Lukashenko could seem quite a positive figure, as he does not have anyone to fight against, since they have not yet managed to create trades unions there. In addition, dictators always fight against the opposition that wants to have democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one thing we should also bear in mind: we should remember that Belarus is an important neighbour for the European Union in the East and should be treated as such. We have a certain tendency to treat Russia as the only neighbour to the East and forget about the fact that Belarus should also be a partner for the EU in the East, as it is a large country with great promise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to that, the refusal to grant entry visas prevents Members of the European Parliament and of national parliaments from seeing the situation for themselves. All this is highlighted in my Group’s motion. However, I think that our criticism of breaches of human rights must be measured by absolute criteria, rather than following a political scale of who in the world plays first fiddle at the moment. That is not right. We keep running around in circles; we have not been able to take a step towards objectivity for millennia. The Romans were always right and their chroniclers painted it as a wrongdoing when an attacked opponent was bold enough to defend himself.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me get back to Belarus, however. Lukashenko’s regime is first and foremost an attempt to disrespect the direction in which the Euro-Atlantic initiatives are going. Mr Lukashenko plays in his own narrow field, ignoring the fact that moderate-sized countries cannot behave like that since supranational capital will not allow it. If you do not obey, you will be isolated and the international community will support the opposition within the country. That is how it works and we all know it. Sooner or later Mr Lukashenko and his party machine will pay dearly for acting in this manner. Belarus is located in an area that is strategically important for the Unites States and for NATO. The present US Administration and the governments of some other countries would very much like Belarus to join NATO, together with Ukraine and Georgia, thereby causing damage to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Our worries about human rights in Belarus would not be so intense if, in fact, the real issue was not Russia. The question is, however, whether attempts to weaken Russia help the issue of world security. I am rather afraid that such attempts may unleash powers that no one will be able to control. Russia has been suppressing them for several millennia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand there is the desire that has been publicly and officially declared to normalise relations with the European Union. The opening of the representative office of the European Commission in Minsk is a symbol of this desire.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, in the same month, the police brutally attacked demonstrators who wanted to celebrate the nineteenth anniversary of the country’s independence. The following day the authorities sent KGB special forces to independent journalists. A month later the activists were handed down long sentences and this is not even the opposition, just people who dared to demonstrate in defence of citizens’ rights and the rights of small businesses, such as Andrei Kim or Sergei Parsukiewicz. We have also recently heard that Alexander Milinkiewicz was arrested and fined just for meeting Belarus citizens and for discussing public issues with them. Alexander Kazulin, the most important political prisoner, a prisoner of conscience in contemporary Europe, is still in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as the chairman of the Belarus delegation I would like to see the day when we can put forward a Resolution to the European Parliament that notes with satisfaction that changes have taken place in Belarus to make that country part of the civilised European Community.</p>

<p class="contents">The only German political foundation that had been allowed to function in Minsk has had to close. Newspaper offices are raided to intimidate critical voices in the press. Free elections and freedom of assembly and expression are being severely restricted. Opposition politicians are being systematically prosecuted and given lengthy prison sentences. The authorities are taking repressive measures against movements within civil society, either by invoking obscure laws on NGOs or anti-extremist legislation or by using force to break up peaceful gatherings.</p>
<p class="contents">We, too, must move to promote the culture of political pluralism in Belarus. Encounters with democratic structures, especially for young people, are particularly important for the future of the country. The reopening of the European Humanities University in Vilnius, a Belarusian university-in-exile that offers a place of refuge for students who are victims of political persecution, was a wise move.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step must be visa facilitation, for which this House has called on several occasions. It is not right that the EU should further restrict people's freedom of movement by charging a fee of EUR 60 to issue a visa. That is almost a third of a monthly income in Belarus and is therefore unaffordable for many people. What we have managed with Ukraine, Moldova and Russia we should also be able to do with Belarus.</p>

The channel, which broadcasts mainly in Belarusian, now reaches some 10% of Belarusians via satellite.</p>
<p class="contents">The station is working under constant pressure. At the end of March KGB and police in Belarus carried out a raid to apprehend Belsat’s local reporters.

The situation in Belarus, an immediate neighbour of the European Union, is as harsh as it was behind the iron curtain.

This is a reference to the Yamal-Europe natural gas pipeline and the ‘Friendship’ oil pipeline.

<p class="contents">We urgently need three crucial advances. Firstly, we strongly urge the Government of Belarus to release its political prisoners at long last – not only the political prisoners who have already being detained for some time, like Mr Kazulin, but also the many new ones who have recently been jailed for exercising elementary fundamental rights such as freedom to practise their profession as journalists, freedom of expression or the right to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we call for amendment of the Religion Act and for absolute freedom of religion. There are European Christians who are being repressed here in the heart of Europe, and we in the European Parliament cannot tolerate that. We must therefore resist this with all our might.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is an urgent need for us to ensure that Belarus finally opens up to us as Members of the European Parliament and European citizens, that the wall of isolation is breached with which the Belarusian regime has systematically enclosed its people, that we can be present there and discuss matters and that we can help to foster something like a Belarusian Spring, 40 years after the Prague Spring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regime in Minsk has indicated recently that it would like to improve relations with the European Union.

It is shameful that, at the beginning of the 21st century, there is a totalitarian state in Europe.

<p class="contents">I have the impression that, up to 1989, western democracies did everything they could to liberate many oppressed countries from Soviet occupation. Today, Belarus remains as it was. I have the impression that, although there are no longer many countries, but just one, we are doing less. We are certainly not doing enough.

Regrettably, renewed pressure on civil society and a number of particularly harsh and disproportionate sentences have ruined this positive atmosphere. We continue to condemn the political arrests and the way in which civil society and the independent media are being treated.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must make Belarus understand that we mean what we say when we propose a partnership subject to progress being made with regard to respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. However, in order to make such progress, Belarus needs to take a number of measures that, for us, are essential. These include the unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Alexander Kazulin.</p>
<p class="contents">They also include the holding of parliamentary elections, scheduled for September, which must comply with democratic principles. In this regard, we ask that the international OSCE/ODIHR observers be granted unhampered access. The Belarusian authorities have informed us of their intention to admit both short-term and long-term observers; we will be sure to hold them to their word. Naturally, the presence of observers from the European Parliament would be an additional source of valuable expertise. It is also vital that opposition parties participate fairly in these elections. We will take into account any suggestions made by Parliament in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">However, irrefutable evidence that progress has been made would be the presence of opposition in this Parliament, which is not currently the case. In that event, the European Union would be ready to respond positively, as it confirmed only last month in a statement relating to sanctions and to the progress that would encourage us to ease these sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now address an issue that we feel most strongly about: contacts with the people of Belarus. However regrettable the situation in Belarus may be, we must expand our contacts. Naturally, restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with the Belarusian authorities are still being maintained. Nevertheless, I think that it is necessary to draw a distinction between political and technical levels. Accordingly, the Commission is holding meetings to discuss technical issues such as energy, transport and the environment with experts from the Belarusian administration. These contacts are obviously a means of getting across various messages on matters about which we feel very strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we currently have a delegation in Minsk will also enable us to forge closer links both with the Belarusian administration and with civil society, local NGOs, independent media and students, all of whom we have a duty to assist, as you have rightly pointed out in your report and as several speakers have said. In addition, aid is being provided to the European Humanities University, which is currently in exile in Vilnius and will continue its activities there for as long as the University is unable to return to Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to broach a subject that comes up time and time again: visas. As you and I are aware, we are unable, as things stand, to open negotiations on the easing of visa restrictions with Belarus – this has been determined by the Council – but this does not prevent us from taking advantage of the discretion enjoyed by the Member States under the Schengen rules as part of their consular prerogatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
