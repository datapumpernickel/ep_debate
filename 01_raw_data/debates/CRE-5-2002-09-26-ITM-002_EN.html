<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boudjenah (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the main objective of any agreement between the ACP countries and the European Union should consist of promoting sustainable forms of development which help to reduce poverty and constitute a basis for the integration of the ACP countries into the world economy. This excerpt from the Cape Town Declaration sums up fairly well the spirit in which the Committee on Development and Cooperation drew up the report that I shall present to you today.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to thank all my fellow Members who contributed by tabling numerous amendments or by participating actively in the hearings we organised, one with Commissioner Lamy, another with the Secretariat of the ACP group and two representatives of African and European NGOs. I would also like to thank the many interlocutors, key figures, NGOs and trade unionists with whom I have tried to take account of all the problems raised.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations for economic partnership agreements will therefore take place tomorrow in Brussels. This is an important event that marks the end of one stage, but also the beginning of another, in which each individual must make themselves heard. With the Cotonou Agreement promising a new participative approach, the time has come to innovate. Broad public debate together with open, transparent negotiations would be a good starting point. The purpose of these negotiations coincides directly with the current debate on the correlation between trade and development. The development dimension is increasingly important in our commercial policy, as stated by Commissioner Lamy and duly noted. We are still concerned, however, that development is thus being progressively reduced to a mere dimension, an accessory to the liberalisation of trade, whereas it is specific policies that are needed here. We should certainly ask ourselves what the merits are of opening up markets in itself. It will not, for example, curb the deterioration of trade terms for poor countries, even though this is one of the main obstacles to their development and, more importantly, to their survival.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the world really need an extra dose of free trade or a new approach to development? Can the eradication of poverty in the ACP countries be reduced to trade? Should trade not be, first and foremost, a tool for development, for satisfying the people’s needs? Should we not first address the structural causes of poverty? We believe these lie mainly in the shortcomings of production and marketing structures centring on the immediate export of raw materials instead of processing them locally and promoting South-South trade. Non-tariff barriers also constitute major obstacles to accessing the European Union market. As for guaranteed-price schemes, have they not lacked the necessary means to prevent the efforts of developing countries from being ruined by unfavourable circumstances? Lastly, the introduction of conditional criteria for structural adjustments under the aegis of the IMF and the World Bank, and the weight of reimbursing the debt certainly fall into the category of EU-ACP failures. We should nevertheless listen to the ACP countries when they campaign to retain the best aspects of Lomé, which relies heavily on the principle of non-reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for new trade relations could therefore turn out to be counterproductive were it to consist of proposing benefits which are in themselves obstacles that must be overcome. An African expert gave this example by way of illustration: we can export computers, sports cars and equipment for nuclear power stations without paying customs duties; the only trouble is that we do not make any. It is touching to know that sorghum and manioc can be exported to Europe, but sadly European consumers do not want any. Under these circumstances, do we need to establish new free trade agreements, or rather invest in production tools and make the conditions for granting manufacturing licences more flexible? These are the subjects of parallel negotiations taking place within the WTO. The European Union and the ACP countries together form a considerable proportion of WTO members, in other words a majority, a force which can and must influence negotiations until 2005, ensuring that the rights of developing countries are recognised. These countries suffer from weak economic structures which justify special treatment in order to address the causes of inequality in the world. What is needed is special and differential treatment to tackle new challenges and simultaneously encompass long-term technological, financial and trade measures designed to build sustainable capacity in each area in which there is inequality between countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, allow me to raise a few specific questions. What is the probable impact of free trade areas on the social, economic and environmental situation of the ACP countries? Mr Lamy announced a detailed study over four years to accompany the process. Fine. But how can a relevant opinion be formulated on the proposed guidelines without using this essential information as soon as possible? Furthermore, can the Commission tell us which criteria were used for this study and what means will be available to the ACP countries to carry out their own assessment? What coherence is there between all the free trade agreements that the European Union is currently signing with various partners? What is the point, therefore, of the ACP countries signing these agreements?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now consider the organisation of the negotiations. Are the Commission and the Council prepared to accept the ACP group’s proposal to allow a sufficiently long first stage to clarify, as emphasised by Mr Goulongana, Secretary-General of the group, the objective of the EPAs, the principles, the ground rules, etc.? We are convinced of the need to do all we can to preserve the cohesion of the ACP group. This is also true with regard to the integration and unity process currently underway in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to services, we shall consider any liberalisation proposals, with the exception of education, health, water, energy and transport. That is why I am prepared to accept Amendment No 2 tabled by the PPE-DE, but as a supplement. Public services are essential factors in the social model …</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, the Commission appreciates and welcomes the strong interest the European Parliament takes in EU-ACP negotiations of economic partnership agreements, as witnessed by the report of the development committee by Mrs Boudjenah and the opinion of the industry and trade committee by Mr Titley. I would like to thank the honourable Members for their work. The European Parliament has also shown an impeccable sense of timing by tabling this report just before the launch of the EU-ACP negotiations on the economic partnership agreements tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission's point of view, the main strength of the report is that it puts ACP development at the centre of the EPA negotiations. This is exactly where the Commission wants it to be. EPAs shall be a tool for the smooth and gradual integration of ACP countries into the world economy, thereby promoting sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the ACP and the EU have decided to negotiate in a spirit of partnership the progressive removal of barriers to trade between them. The resulting agreements will extend to all areas relevant to trade, notably non-direct measures. The EPAs shall also be WTO-compatible and build on ACP regional integration initiatives as key instruments for ACP integration into the world economy. This is in a nutshell what was laid down in the ACP-EU agreement signed in Cotonou in June 2000, an agreement endorsed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In Cotonou the ACP and the EU agreed to enter into EPA negotiations and laid down objectives, principles and modalities for these agreements. Some of the questions raised in the report had thus already been settled at the time of the Cotonou Agreement. The Commission refers, for instance, to those parts of the report which call for the continuation of non-reciprocal trade preferences for the ACP. Non-reciprocal preferences have not achieved, and cannot achieve, the closer integration of ACP countries into the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">A more comprehensive approach is needed aimed at enhancing ACP supply and trading capacities and the capacity to attract investment. This was the joint conclusion of the ACP states and the EU when negotiating the Cotonou Agreement, and that is why they agreed to conclude WTO-compatible trading arrangements to progressively remove all barriers to trade between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade liberalisation on both sides is an indispensable element of this undertaking, provided it is not pursued blindly but flexibly. In short, our common objective is to use trade for development. Likewise, retention, consolidation and possible extension of the commodity protocols is not in line with the Cotonou Agreement, which says we will review these protocols. The Commission is of the opinion that we should not prejudge this review. Lastly, any decisions on alternatives to the EPAs under the Cotonou Agreement are only to be taken in 2004 should the EPA negotiations show that EPAs do not offer the appropriate solutions for specific cases in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the need, highlighted in the report, for analysis and assessment of the impact of the EPAs on sustainable development. This will require a thorough and sustained effort throughout the negotiations. The sustainability impact assessment foreseen in parallel with the negotiations is designed to achieve this goal. It will enable systematic analysis of the impact of the different policy options considered in the course of the EPA negotiations as they evolve, and will thus inform negotiators' choice. Its ongoing results should keep the negotiations on track towards genuine sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also supports ACP countries and regions that want to undertake their own studies. We have ensured that considerable amounts of money are available under national, regional, and all other ACP programmes not only for studies but for trade-related assistance and capacity-building more widely. Meanwhile the Commission is going ahead with the sustainability impact assessment and we will do so in full transparency with regard to the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we particularly welcome the Commission's proposal that treatment granted to the EU be extended to all ACP-EPA partners before trade liberalisation with the EU. This is particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not going to be easy, and some of the reasons for that have been outlined. We have to proceed with caution and with flexibility. We must not put pressure on ACP countries to enter into negotiations they do not feel to be appropriate, and we must safeguard and respect the rights of LDCs to non-reciprocal trade preferences. We need, however, in particular, to encourage technical assistance to achieve institution building, which will allow balanced results. We need to ensure that we take into account the capacity constraints of the ACP countries and seek to build those as part of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to bear in mind that the abolition of tariffs could well cause a loss of public resources and, therefore, create budgetary problems. We must not lose sight of our objective in relation to the Cotonou Agreement of poverty eradication and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the Committee on Industry's position is very much to support the Commission's point of view and welcomes the fact that negotiations are going to start tomorrow but to ask that we proceed with sensitivity and caution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The intention is that greater economic exchange should combat poverty in the long term and eventually contribute to improving the earnings potential of people who live in the ACP States.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of regional cooperation on their part, the ACP States are to be put in a position to develop their own functioning markets, which are necessary if there is to be greater trade with us in both goods and services. The mutual market opening, especially the opening of the great European internal market, is intended to enable them to achieve better sales in this market of their existing<span class="italic"> </span>products, and perhaps also of those of higher quality yet to be developed, and thereby lay the foundations for the development of their national economies.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of this, the EU is holding out the prospect of generous technical aid to equip the economic and administrative actors with better qualifications. The negotiations that are now getting underway should therefore focus on turning the ACP States into more effective economic partners, enabling social and cultural development, too, to be further accelerated. Mrs Boudjenah's own-initiative report would, I regret to say, need to be further substantially improved by the incorporation of various amendments if the European Union is to negotiate from a stronger position, rather than for that position to be weakened as it is at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, we have to attempt to reach a realistic accommodation with the interests of the ACP States. There is little point in this if it involves what gleams through at various points in this report – attempts at levelling accusations at the Commission, which has, in recent months, stepped up dialogue with the ACP States and made proposals to them concerning their sustainable development, which have included technical aid. What matters is that the Commission, with our help, is pressing on with the creation of the new ACP economic area. Some better system must replace the outdated and inefficient system of preferences for certain imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules both of the WTO and also the Cotonou Agreement should be applied, but with flexibility, and without their objectives being turned on their heads. In that respect, the position of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy – the Titley Report – is substantially in line with our way of thinking, but we demand that the opening of markets should – as provided for in the WTO rules and in the Cotonou Agreement – concentrate on goods and services. For example, there is no internal market common to both Europe and Africa, which is why there can be no generally free movement of workers either.</p>
<p class="contents">Our demand is that liberalisation be handled flexibly, with transitional periods, but that liberalisation in important economic sectors should not be ruled out. It is also our view that investment must be well protected in order to prevent this leading to the economic standstill and retrogression now evident in policies in Zimbabwe and other countries. We have nothing against the EU providing technical assistance with assessing the impact of the establishment of free trade and economic regions in Africa, but we vigorously oppose the opening of negotiations being made dependent on this, which could lead to reform of relations between the EU and the ACP States being blocked for a long time. We do not want to develop alternative rules for our relations with the ACP States; we should abide by the WTO's rules and the rules of our own Cotonou Agreement, which should be applied flexibly and with transitional periods.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore proposing amendments that, if accepted, will make it possible for us to support the report, failing which we will vote against it or abstain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the PSE Group strongly align ourselves with her sentiments in relation to trade being a means to an end, not an end in itself. The end is development of the ACP economies and poverty reduction for the poorest people in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">One test of the Commission – I think Mr Liikanen was disingenuous in what he said this morning – is whether there is a genuine openness to alternatives. It was never part of the Cotonou Agreement that the proposal for alternatives to EPAs would be delayed to 2004 and I hope he will withdraw that point when the debate is closed.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to record strong agreement for what Mrs Boudjenah puts forward in terms of the need to advance the impact assessments so that we can genuinely see the impact of these negotiations. The Commission again, in relation to the sugar industry, and the 'Everything but arms' proposals of a year and two years ago has not got a particularly strong track record in relation to impartial impact assessments and trade matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been selected as the nominee to chair the trade committee in the Joint Parliament Assembly between the EU and the ACP. We are very much looking forward to playing an active role in overseeing these trade negotiations and promoting their transparency. The Commissioner will agree that the Cape Town Declaration agreed by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly earlier this year gives us a strong opportunity for parliamentarians and civil society more generally to play a far greater role in the discussions that these crucial negotiations entail.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see CAP reform being discussed. The Commission is wrong there. There are difficult issues for the ACP that the Commission forced on to the agenda. There are difficult issues for the European side as well and what right do we have to prevent that being discussed?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in relation to ACP-wide issues, the ACP want to establish some principles as a complete block. They do not want to be subject to divide and rule and only to discuss issues with their regional groups. If we believe in partnership in development then we should respect their wishes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Incidentally, the content of this report – and I wish to emphasise that it was given unanimous approval in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, in contrast to what Mr Schwaiger appears to be saying – and the introductory words of the rapporteur herself make my intervention easier.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall, therefore, restrict myself to discussing a few aspects of this complex issue. First, I wish to state the need not to play down, in order to fall in line with the WTO, a partnership that has already been around for decades and which I believe must be continued and focused particularly on one key objective: the development of our more than 70 partner countries and meeting the fundamental needs of their populations. This highlights another issue: the Economic Partnership Agreements laid down in the Cotonou Agreement and the trade dimension of this agreement as a whole cannot prevail and even less replace a form of cooperation that must encompass various other fields and which, as I understand it, must be extended and seek to achieve better results than in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to emphasise that I consider it crucial to ensure that total respect is given to the forms, timing and means of regional integration undertaken by these countries which, as we know, are not always easy or even obvious: and that it is necessary to pay special attention to the new development that is the recently constituted African Union. And, fundamentally, I think it is crucial to ensure that there is no deterioration in the positive situation represented by the current ACP group.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and taking account of the disparity in levels of development between the two parties in the negotiations and, in particular, the well-known limitations in terms of the ACP countries’ capacities, I wish to state that we must have studies on the predictable impacts of the new agreements on their various options and at various levels drafted and, if they are already drafted, presented as rapidly as possible, in addition to the fact that those limitations themselves reveal how crucial it is to ensure these countries special and differentiated treatment, which guarantees levels of protection able to ensure their development.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, a more specific issue, however, that I feel is important and which Mr Titley has already mentioned: I am referring to the fact that customs revenues represent a substantial, if not almost exclusive contribution to the ACP countries’ budgets, which means that the measures we adopt on trade liberalisation must take account of this extremely important fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore important for Parliament to send a loud, clear message to the Commission with regard to these negotiations by means of the recommendations we formulate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank our rapporteur warmly and congratulate her. Mrs Boudjenah’s report was unanimously adopted in committee, which is very good. We fully share her point of view on the matter and we support her.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I was sorry to hear Mr Schwaiger’s statements, which could divide Parliament on the matter at a completely inappropriate time. Perhaps, however, the PPE-DE does not fully share Mr Schwaiger’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments tabled by the PPE-DE, I do not believe they improve the report, but rather that they aim to weaken it or sugar the pill. From a political perspective, there is no real point in presenting a weak or sugared position to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, when we talk about partnership agreements, the word “partnership” has an eminently pleasant connotation, we all agree on that, as it concerns a relationship between equals, or partners, with the ACP countries. This, however, must not make us forget that we are not equal to the ACP countries. These countries have weak and vulnerable economies. Committing to the concept of absolute free trade, without first assessing the consequences for the social, environmental or economic situation of these countries, is rather like going down a dark tunnel. We therefore think an impact assessment should be carried out first. Two years after Cotonou, this would be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remove the structural and commercial barriers which prevent these countries from being able to benefit fully from the current non-reciprocal preferences. Maintaining them would be suicidal. What are these barriers? Although the matter has already been raised by the rapporteur, I would like to emphasise a factor that we have repeatedly criticised, namely the problem of grants from the European Union for exports, in particular in the agriculture sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the lack of opportunity for local product processing is one great weakness of these economies. I shall end there, as I see I have exceeded my speaking time and you are being uncompromising today, Mr President. The problem of local processing, which creates added value at local level, is clearly fundamental and the rapporteur has quite rightly emphasised this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to commend the rapporteur on her excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that these economic partnership agreements contribute towards placing the ACP countries in a position where they can be progressively integrated into the world economy. Building capacity both in the public and private sectors, enhancing production and conforming with the WTO provisions should lead to increased investment in developing countries, in particular external investment and expanding economies. We all hope for a successful negotiating process, which is due to be launched at an all-ACP level within the next couple of days.</p>
<p class="contents">On the key question of market access, we must move towards improved access to EU markets for exports from developing countries, so as to ensure that negotiating proposals take account of the economic interests of all parties. I would urge the Commission to carry out an impact assessment of all the proposals. I would also urge the Commission in its negotiations to strongly promote the importance of increased assistance for trade-capacity building.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to take issue with the rapporteur's insistence that a reform of the common agricultural policy is a necessary part of the process of integrating the developing countries into the world trading system. Issues surrounding the external effects of the CAP will be dealt with in the context of the Doha round of the World Trade Organisation talks. European farmers have had a very turbulent few years, following on from the BSE and foot-and-mouth crisis. There was a major reform of the CAP with Agenda 2000, and we are now faced with review proposals that will profoundly disrupt our production and our markets if carried through. Stability is needed, and suggestions that a new reform is necessary will only bring about more uncertainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Customs barriers are not, however, the most important problem for the ACP countries. Instead, this is, as several other fellow MEPs have also pointed out, the EU’s heavily subsidised agricultural exports. To give just one simple example, it costs Europe slightly less than EUR 700 to produce a tonne of sugar, but it costs only a little under EUR 300 to do so in many African countries. Simple economic theory therefore tells us that African countries would have a superior position in the sugar market and that opening up the markets would be the route to growth. Because of the EU’s export subsidies, the conclusion is not, however, quite so simple because the EU backs up European exports to the tune of EUR 1 104 million so that European farmers are able to sell their sugar much more cheaply than the developing countries. Nor, of course, will the situation change through the ACP countries’ developing internal markets. It has been said before, but it cannot be repeated too often: the EU is not a credible partner as long as we retain the agricultural subsidies. They stand in the way of any development and of any fight against poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of noting an increase in their exports to the European Union, the ACP countries have seen them fall almost by half since the signing of the agreement. Instead of improving, trade terms between the European Union and the ACP countries have deteriorated. Instead of developing, these countries have become poorer. The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the objectives stated in the Lomé Convention and the Cotonou Agreement and so on are far removed from reality. They masquerade as a system of preferences, but these agreements encourage the pillaging of poor countries by large investors of rich European countries. In the colonial past, pillaging was carried out in an open and shameless fashion. Today, as ex-colonies have become independent, we speak not of diktats but of negotiations, not of exploitation, but of partnership, but the system is still the same. Trade relations between imperialist countries and poor countries are designed in such a way that the former continue to become wealthier at the expense of the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the rapporteur’s opposition to the Commission proposal seeking to put in place free trade zones. This sort of freedom would equate to getting the fox to mind the geese! It would, however, be futile to attempt to improve a system that is fundamentally flawed. The only salvation for poor countries is to be found in a radical transformation of the global economic system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All too often, in these institutions, there is a massive incoherence between European trade policy on one hand, and European development policy on the other, with trade concerns all too often undermining development objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">With this report Parliament sends a very clear message that development concerns must come first. There are some key points I would like to underline. First, capacity. It simply beggars belief that some of the poorest ACP countries can possibly have the financial and technical resources to pursue the WTO's Doha agenda, the GATT's agenda, the NEPAD or FTAA agenda, at the same time as the EU economic partnerships agenda; and still at the same time still somehow pursue their own regional integration processes. Yet it is these very regional integration processes that the Commission says that it wants to support. We must get away from externally imposed timetables of which countries need to adopt new arrangements, and instead allow them to adapt at their own speed, according to their own development needs, just as the industrialised countries were able to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of waiting until we have the results of the impact assessments of these proposed economic arrangements. These must be conducted with the full participation of local people and we must have the results of those impact assessments before negotiations start. If necessary, we should be prepared to delay negotiations until we have them. Only in that way, can we be sure that the initiative will genuinely contribute to poverty eradication and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many fine phrases such as: 'worldwide inequality must be remedied'. But, as ever, it is all hot air and naïve idealism. In fact, what really strikes me here is the large element of sheer hypocrisy. Agricultural produce is a large element of ACP exports. Yet, despite all the fine words, the tariff regime makes the EU a difficult market-place, with 16% being a fairly typical entry price for ACP goods. It also means that consumers pay far too much for food here. Of course, the solution to all of this – real reform of the common agricultural policy – is nothing more than a mirage.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we even talk about partnership agreements with these countries, given the continuing scandal of the European Union fisheries deals? This Parliament continues to give its overwhelming endorsement to deals that involve huge sums of taxpayers' money going straight to corrupt African regimes: up to EUR 1.4 billion in the last few years alone, and little or none of it going to the local communities that need it. As a result of all of this, hundreds of indigenous black African fisherman are continuing to die. I have raised this point here before, and I am met with aggression from the Spanish and with indifference from Commissioner Fischler. To satisfy the greed of large companies in Europe, this place turns a blind eye to a humanitarian disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not expect many people here to agree with my view about political integration in the European Union. On this one area of fisheries deals, please surprise me and let us see some reform and let us give these struggling African coastal communities some sort of chance. Since 1994 there has been repeated documentary evidence about all this and it is high time that something was done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
