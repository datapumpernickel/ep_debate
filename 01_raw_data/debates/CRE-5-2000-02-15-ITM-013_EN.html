<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andersson (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one. This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU. The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy. It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems. These areas are mutually dependent upon one another. Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment. It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision. But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth. In other words, social security is a factor of production. </p>
<p class="contents">Social security systems differ from one EU country to another. This is largely due to historical factors. We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate. The labour market is also changing. Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers. Another challenge is presented by technical development. We must meet these challenges together. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced. What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment. This is good, but it is not enough. We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process. Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans. We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity. This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period. Parliament must therefore be involved in the work – not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on. </p>
<p class="contents">Like the work on employment, the Commission’s proposal is founded upon four pillars. These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care. All this is important. In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Equality has no pillar of its own. There, it is mainstreaming which applies. All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality. This is something we have borne in mind. We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living. These proposals favour women especially. Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable. We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme. </p>
<p class="contents">Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping. The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee. We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report. Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen. This indicates that we have a broad consensus. A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject. I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report. On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. I think this proposal is a good one. Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade. The EU is also a union for employment and social justice. In creating a citizens’ Europe, social policy has an important role to play. By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society. We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy. The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The mutual interdependence of issues pertaining to the national economy, employment policy, and social protection in the internal market calls for there to be joint deliberations at Community level in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We have not achieved equal rights for men and women either in the sphere of work or that of social protection. The unemployment rate for women is considerably higher than that for men. It is still much more difficult for women to gain access to certain professions and there are far more women than men in precarious and part-time jobs. Wage levels for women are still way below those for men. As a result, they have a low level of social protection or none whatsoever, for paid employment serves as the basis for this according to systems currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Many women are only accorded derived rights, which reinforces their economic dependence. In view of the fact that economic and social conditions have changed, we should aim to achieve individualised social protection, with people being treated independently of their partners, and guaranteed lasting security. However, it must still be worth an individual’s while to work, notwithstanding all the necessary contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Reforming social protection must encompass support for and recognition of, in insurance law terms, the time it takes to bring up children, as well as care of needy family members. It is shocking that an ever-increasing number of elderly women live in poverty. They were unable to contribute to the social security systems because of the time they invested in bringing up their families, but they too must be afforded protection. An individual’s entitlement to high-quality health care must be assured, irrespective of their contribution to the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">As before, in principle it is the Member States that are responsible for framing and financing their social protection systems. Nevertheless, cooperation within the EU on the part of the expert working group, in which women must be suitably represented, could be instrumental in bringing about convergence of the social systems in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pronk (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion. In the capacity of coordinator of the European People’s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into. I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report. </p>
<p class="contents">The goal of the Commission’s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection. Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection. </p>
<p class="contents">Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals. I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important – if not <span class="italic">the</span> most important points which merit further thought.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence. Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together. The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness. It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy. These aspects are very much interconnected. It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission’s notification constitutes a break-through in a way. It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon. </p>
<p class="contents">We should, of course, not get overly excited about it. It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process. Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue. But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion. The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another. The challenges are different. The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless. In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges. The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen. </p>
<p class="contents">The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report. It is a report which tries to give direction. There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific. I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this. But that does not take away from the fact that the report’s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon. I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success. If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past. As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before. </p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report. I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance. There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward. It is also a timely discussion – as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago – at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society. Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon. </p>
<p class="contents">My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000. However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now. It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP’s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable. Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level. The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters’ thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground. But this new course of action is very exciting. The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition. </p>
<p class="contents">But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation. They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001. I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group’s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process. The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union. We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States. If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security. It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda. </p>
<p class="contents">In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence. As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies. It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives. It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy. We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern. National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty. It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation. So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means. </p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report. I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste. I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries. I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission’s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold. Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier. This seems to be a good thing and useful. I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach. We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved. </p>
<p class="contents">We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc. </p>
<p class="contents">We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found. The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence. I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union. It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements. </p>
<p class="contents">The lion’s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements. In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements. The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria. Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries. The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries. All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches. To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my constituency, there is deep scepticism about the Commission’s attempts at direction and control. If those who voted for Mr Andersson knew that he is proposing that social policy throughout Europe should be coordinated, that taxes should be harmonised and that the welfare system should be subordinated to the process of European Monetary Union, then they would protest vociferously and in no uncertain terms. I am certain that most of them would vote for another party next time. </p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, Mr Andersson’s report contains many good concrete proposals, which I can entirely support. But I am critical of the global perspective on social security which characterises both the Commission’s communication and Mr Andersson’s report. They seem to believe that it is the <span class="italic">Commission </span>which is the engine, centre and driving force of the process of change in Europe. Just as Mr Prodi described himself this morning as someone who bears the responsibilities of the world on his shoulders, what we are encountering here is a top-down perspective upon social issues, from which the talk is of convergence and harmonisation. There is even an attempt to make us believe that social integration can be considered a common pan-European process. </p>
<p class="contents">The reality is quite different. A socially integrated Europe is a distant utopia which not even an all-powerful Commission can turn into a reality. Great steps have been taken towards economic integration, and the process of political integration is now under way. But social integration is an entirely different type of process which presupposes cultural community and direct communication between people. The concept of a social Europe is a drawing-board product which is far removed from the real world. </p>
<p class="contents">Social policy is chiefly a national process. In my own country, we have learned that large parts of the social security system have to be created locally within the framework of the municipalities. Decentralisation and closeness to the people they serve are important factors for promoting quality and efficiency within health care, education and social services. The municipalities have responsibility for delivering almost all welfare services. Local democracy provides the framework for social security. Now that we have economic coordination, I certainly believe we need to increase the degree of coordination of social policy, too, at European level. But a European strategy for coordination must be based upon local initiatives and upon diversity. It must have democratic support and respect the principle of closeness to the people. I belong to a party which, once upon a time, believed in central control, five-year plans and far-reaching convergence requirements. We were horribly wrong, and history forced us to ask questions of ourselves, to reconsider, and to revise our ideas about democracy. I do not believe that the chief responsibility can lie with Mr Prodi and his Commission. I am convinced that this must be borne by those people who are directly affected by the social problems concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union’s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy. So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources. But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated. This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent. Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection. In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention. </p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.</p>
<p class="contents">Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union. Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable. Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection. Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor. And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees. </p>
<p class="contents">In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable. The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line. </p>
<p class="contents">The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious. It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations. </p>
<p class="contents">I endorse this view. I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of the scepticism of some people, there is consensus on the need for a concerted strategy for modernising social protection. The discussions that were held in the 1980s and 1990s demonstrate the importance of social transfers. More than 50% of people in the Union receive benefits that are not part of pensions. Denmark and the Netherlands are positive examples of the effort for cohesion that we must all make. In those two countries, over 60% of people at risk live above the poverty line, whereas in the Southern countries, only 7% to15% of poor people manage to do so. This fact creates the imbalances in society and in competition that have already been highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">The convergence criteria have created the temptation to reduce public spending, a phenomenon which has led to anti-European feeling. The truth is that high levels of protection coexist well with the best indicators of productivity. Nevertheless, where social policies are concerned too, a strategy for convergence which the report is advocating will benefit both the public and the success of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">All systems face new problems and these are identified in the report. The demographic issue is central, but the following are not minor issues: new forms of work, mobility within the Union and a shorter working life – young people start working later now and although the legal age for retirement is 65, in practice, people are retiring between the ages of 57 and 59, due to restructuring in industry. In addition to this, poverty is an ever-present phenomenon, particularly for retired women because their salaries and contributions have been low. These challenges must be responded to as a matter of urgency. We are happy to welcome the Portuguese Presidency’s initiative, which is to establish a high-level group which we want to be the preparation for action for legislation and for programming, not just another postponement or a simple diagnosis of the problem. We need common objectives with a realistic timetable.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere. </p>
<p class="contents">Social policy <span class="italic">needs</span> to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States. Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom. Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody. Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Andersson’s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU. The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect. Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere. The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds<span class="italic">,</span> table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States. The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean. It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference. Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater. There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area. The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences. It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too. It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden’s. Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the Commission's communication. It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for. It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it. We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast. I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.</p>
<p class="contents">To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole. We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an option for us any more. It is an imperative. European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings. We do not want the US model – a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life. What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States. That is not what we want to do in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things. But we have to grasp the tools to do that. I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people’s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion. This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position. Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission’s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery. The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of social protection, I am in favour of the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high. That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment, so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment. But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that Mr Andersson's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU. This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world. I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe. Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort. The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted. Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State. In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights. Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes. For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules. If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets. Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability. With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness. The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.</p>
<p class="contents">And therein lies the paradox. Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems. But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions. Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore – but only at that point – common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable. That is something we would do well to recognise.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report – and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this – defends the European social model’s approach, which is one based on solidarity. I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy. </p>
<p class="contents">I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model.

This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson. Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view. I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union. Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate.</p>
<p class="contents">In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain. We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc. What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice. In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: “The future of social protection” and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk. Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson. I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate. You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories – as the speakers said – there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken. As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June. The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession. I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion. Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment. I think the statement’s content makes this clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies. As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken. Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
