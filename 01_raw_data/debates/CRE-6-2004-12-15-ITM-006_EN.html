<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, it is almost nine years to the day since Bulgaria formally applied for membership of the European Union. Since then the country has undergone tremendous political and economic changes: it became a member of NATO earlier this year and is now well on course to join the European Union on 1 January 2007. I see no significant obstacles to this and I trust that the European Council, when it meets at the end of this week, will not only endorse this view but also set a date early in the new year for signature of the Accession Treaty. Bulgaria must be judged on its own merits and its progress should not necessarily be linked to that of any other candidate country. That is why a separate Accession Treaty for Bulgaria may be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at some of the changes that have taken place in Bulgaria. On the one hand we can recognise that the accession criteria and deadlines set by the European Commission have provided an external catalyst for change. However, on the other hand, internal dynamics have greatly altered the political and social landscape in Bulgaria as it cast off its old mantle following the collapse of communism in 1990. These changes are taking place not just because the European Union is insisting on them, but because they are good for Bulgaria and they are what the Bulgarians themselves want.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria is now a fully functioning market economy and has been recognised as such since 2002. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained, including adequate price stability and sustainable public finances and external accounts. To take just a couple of key economic indicators, Bulgaria's GDP grew by 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2004, up from 4.3 per cent in 2003, and one of the highest rates among EU candidates and new Member States. The unemployment rate has consistently fallen since 2002: at 12 per cent it is still too high, but it is falling. Foreign direct investment is at record levels this year. Enormous progress has also been made on privatisation: 80 per cent of the economy is now in the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the ongoing reform of Bulgaria's public administration, with the adoption of amendments to the Civil Service law. Improvements have also been made in the judicial system: there have been positive developments with regard to the recruitment and appointment of judges. However, more needs to be done, in particular in relation to pre-trial procedures and the position of the Prosecutor General.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not now just plain sailing. There are still areas of concern that I have been highlighting since 1999. Organised crime and corruption are an obstacle to reform in Bulgaria, having knock-on effects in all sectors of the economy and society. I have drawn particular attention to the need for more human and financial resources to be targeted to bring about major improvements in the welfare of children and in childcare institutions. I have called for a well-resourced, single government agency, with the power to ensure that child welfare reform happens.</p>
<p class="contents">The same strategic approach must be adopted for the integration of the Roma community into Bulgarian society. Bulgaria, assisted by the European Commission, must make an even more determined effort to expedite the integration of Roma into mainstream society, particularly through educational and employment opportunities, improved living conditions and access to healthcare and family planning. There is also another side to this problem: the Roma themselves must adapt. This point may be unpopular in some circles but it is the only way that real change will be brought about on the ground for the Roma. Over the past four years over EUR 160 million of Community funds have been directed at Roma issues. However, change must happen from the inside as well as on the part of government.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's enlargement to the east and south-east marks a momentous change in Europe. We have finally put an end to the hostilities and the divisions of the Cold War. History is being written as we speak – in Ukraine, for instance – and this morning Parliament gave its green light to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey. Great changes are taking place on our continent. We are in a time of transition and we must all work hard to ensure that the tide of change shifts in the right direction. Within Europe this means refocusing the nature and objectives of the European Union. This means the EU doing less but doing it better.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank colleagues across Parliament for their support and assistance in my work as rapporteur. There will be an opportunity for a more comprehensive report on Bulgaria's accession early in the new year. My report this time is deliberately concise. Some amendments were included during the committee stage, but I do not feel that I can support any of the amendments now proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to highlight the plight of Bulgarian nurses incarcerated in Libya and now under threat of the death penalty. I urge all Members to sign Written Declaration No 61 calling for their early release.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria knows the challenges that lie ahead. On 17 December I trust the European Council will formally conclude Bulgaria's negotiations and set the date for signature of the Accession Treaty in spring 2005. This will be a great achievement, but reform and change must continue both in Bulgaria and in the EU itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will now start the last, very important phase before entering the EU. The remaining two years should be used to prepare thoroughly for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU congratulates Bulgaria on this positive result, which has taken much effort and energy. It is a new step towards a truly reunited Europe, based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations with Bulgaria closed at the technical level in June 2004. This reflects the progress that the Bulgarian Government has made in recent years, which resulted in strong confidence on the part of all those involved and the ability to assume all membership obligations by January 2007. Still, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs also states clearly in its motion for an EP resolution on Bulgaria's progress towards accession, we should closely monitor the progress which still has to be made by Bulgaria. The commitments made in the Justice and Home Affairs chapter might need an amendment of the Constitution, which is a long and difficult process.</p>
<p class="contents">Other important areas, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs states, are the quality of border management, the fight against corruption, and the prevention of abuse of powers by State authorities against persons entering or transiting Bulgaria. The new penal code still has to be approved. Administrative capacity in a number of areas, including the agencies involved with the use of pre-accession funds, should improve.</p>
<p class="contents">Both in Bulgaria and in Romania, improvements in the standard of living should be a priority. The economic growth that Bulgaria and Romania have seen in recent years has had a positive effect on purchasing power, but the effects at grass-roots level, especially for the elderly, have remained limited. There are at least two more years to go before accession.</p>
<p class="contents">An historic step will be made on 17 December when the negotiations regarding the fifth enlargement have come to an end. Monitoring of the last part of the fifth enlargement will continue until 2007, in order to welcome the two new, long-awaited members then ready to join the European Union. As Mrs Kuneva said in October, she would like to publish the Monitoring Report on a big wall in Sofia in order to keep the process going. I think Bulgaria has made good progress, which gives us confidence for the numerous tasks still remaining.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council looks forward to the finalisation of the Accession Treaty with a view to its signature in spring 2005, after the Treaty has been submitted to the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday the EU finalised the accession negotiations with Bulgaria in the accession conference, with a view to accession on 1 January 2007 and with the signature of the accession Treaty in sight in the spring of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Parliament for its constant and balanced support for Bulgaria's ambition to accede to the European Union and I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, for the sound and even-handed report he has produced.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past few years Bulgaria has made steady progress in all areas in its preparation for accession and for meeting the Copenhagen criteria. Important and necessary decisions have been taken in this respect. Four units of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant are being closed on agreed dates for final decommissioning, showing Bulgaria's determination to respect commitments. Substantial support from the Union is being provided as assistance to these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, Bulgaria has consolidated and deepened the stability of its institutions. Continuation on its current reform path should enable the country to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the European Union. We will, however, need to keep a close watch on some areas. Our intention now is to intensify our monitoring of the commitments that have been made and of continuing preparations in general, in order to ensure that progress continues after the closure of negotiations and that Bulgaria will be effectively ready for membership in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, solid efforts remain necessary concerning the reform of the judiciary, the fight against organised crime and the fight against corruption. Bulgaria has made progress in gradually building up its administrative capacity but further efforts remain necessary in this regard in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As from November 2005 the Commission will issue yearly comprehensive monitoring reports for the Council and Parliament following the same methodology as was applied to the new Member States that joined the Union in May 2004. These reports will focus particularly on public administration, the judiciary and the fight against corruption, as well as the track record in economic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to take account of a longer period between completion of the negotiations and the effective date of accession than in previous waves of accession. A specific safeguard was agreed, which allows the Commission to recommend to the Council to decide by unanimity, at any time, to postpone the date of accession by one year to January 2008 if there is clear evidence that Bulgaria is manifestly unprepared.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that I share the conclusions of the report of your rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, which are, by and large, in line with the 2004 regular report. The Commission will continue to keep the European Parliament informed of Bulgaria’s progress towards accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria is on track for accession on 1 January 2007. With the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the fifth round of EU enlargement will be concluded. Thus the Black Sea will become a new coastline for an enlarged and unified Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets also supports an additional sum from the PHARE Programme of EUR 200 million for 2000-2006 for the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power station.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also pleased that in Spring 2004 a new funding framework was established for Bulgaria and that the Commission has adopted a consistent approach by restricting the aid package to a period of three years from the accession of Bulgaria in 2007 so that we can adapt it to any future reforms of policies which may be necessary as a result of the new financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets stresses once again that financial aid will depend on the new financial perspectives, but also on the adaptation of the annual Budget, in accordance with those financial perspectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was in Bulgaria in 1990, when the country first attempted to hold free elections. There was still some election-rigging, but the democracy movement was impressive. In many ways, it was reminiscent of the current situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria has succeeded, step by step, in overcoming these crisis situations, and must now be taken seriously as a very promising candidate for accession to the European Union. It has a rich culture and exerts a major stabilising influence over the entire Balkan peninsula. Although there is still a great deal to do – especially on the rule of law, justice and administration, where further reforms are required – Bulgaria is by far the most advanced of all the candidate countries, unless, that is, we forget a country which we should never forget, namely Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to appeal also to the President-in-Office of the Council to accept Croatia at the forthcoming summit without any prevarication or special conditions, and to make massive efforts to ensure that the negotiations with Croatia are opened without delay. Both these countries should become members of the European Union before the decade is out, and Mr Van Orden's excellent report makes a major contribution to this process. One of Bulgaria's particular achievements is the cross-party cooperation established between Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and the Bulgarian President, which is a prerequisite enabling Bulgaria to bring its progress towards EU membership to a successful conclusion in the coming years. Bulgaria enjoys democratic stability at domestic level and is remaining resolute despite the crises affecting a number of areas, including the economy. I would like to say how gratified I am by this development, and that Bulgaria is well on track. I could sum up my speech in a single word: ‘yes’ to Bulgaria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Technically, Bulgaria has completed all the accession negotiation chapters and is clearly headed towards becoming a full member of the European Union in January 2007. According to the report, Bulgaria continues to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and the measures taken to successfully implement them have been effective. However, this report also emphasises that there are still deficiencies that will inevitably have to be dealt with. We believe that Bulgaria is on track for accession and will continue to make efforts to complete successfully the reforms it committed itself to in the near future. These mainly include judicial reform and further increased efforts to counter organised crime and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The report welcomes positive changes implemented in the field of minority rights, as a result of which the so-called legislation on anti-discrimination was adopted on January 1, 2004. The report also emphasises the importance of the legislature’s practical extension, as discrimination against Romany people remains widespread there. The report acknowledges Bulgaria meeting the economic criteria and notes that it is a functioning market economy and at the time of accession will be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. The European Parliament and the Socialist Group will continue the monitoring system while ensuring that operations are run efficiently and obligations are fulfilled. Based on Bulgaria’s reform efforts and progress, the Socialist Group hopes that Bulgaria will sign and ratify the accession treaty as soon as possible and will become a member of the European Union in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore believe that this House can vote in favour of Bulgaria accession to the European Union in 2007 with a clear conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">We support Mr Van Orden's report and speaking personally, I would like to thank him and Mrs Dobolyi from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the good cooperation. As Mr Van Orden himself has said, he has deliberately kept the report brief. I therefore suggest that we discuss all the other tabled amendments, some of which are very detailed, next year when we deal with the longer report which will then be due.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria is well on track to join the European Union in 2007. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to highlight a fundamental problem, namely that of genuine compliance with the principle of merit. The Commission and the Council have both stated that each candidate's accession should be based on individual merit. However, this is incompatible with a situation in which a candidate country which fulfils the criteria is held back by the slower progress made by other countries. The countries making swifter progress thus accede too late while the candidates making slower progress join too early. To put it simply, the good performers are being penalised while the laggards are being rewarded. This situation must change.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of the Union as a whole is damaged if its practices conflict with the principle of merit. Commissioner Verheugen amply demonstrated this with the 'big bang' enlargement in May this year, which damaged the Union. A better option would have been for well-performing candidates, such as Estonia and Slovenia, to have been able to join much earlier. For this reason alone, namely to preserve the European Union's credibility and not because there is any doubt about the European prospect of either of the two candidates, my group has always been in favour of separate accession treaties for Bulgaria and Romania. Mr Watson reaffirmed this position this morning in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission and the Council, but also my fellow Members in this House, to ensure, during present and future enlargement rounds, that the principle of merit is not just proclaimed with pomp and ceremony, only to be ignored in favour of package deals, but is actually implemented in practice. In this context, a gratifying sign is the Council's decision to adopt differentiated approaches to Bulgaria and Romania in the chapters on competition and justice. Simplifying the mechanism to invoke the safeguard clause in the case of Romania will enhance the credibility of the accession process and thus the credibility of the European Union itself. On a more general note, I believe that we should be conducting this debate not in Strasbourg, but in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Old environmental problems, resulting from mining and nuclear waste, are still left unresolved. Much damage is being done by construction work for new roads through protected scenic areas and by the expansion of the largest airport. These days, poor maintenance, decay and poverty are noticeable throughout Bulgaria. The Roma people are still lagging behind and disadvantaged. EU funding for the benefit of projects for this group of people is divided and spent in a contentious manner.</p>
<p class="contents">In the minds of many Bulgarians, the nearby Greek and Roman coasts belong, in fact, to Bulgaria, just as do the greater part of the Republic of Macedonia and a few areas on the border with Serbia. The fact that the Bulgarian electorate still has not made any steady choices is apparent from the rapid changes within the two main rivalling political parties, and, above all, from the fact that a newcomer to the most recent general elections achieved almost the majority of the votes. Shortly after the surprising election as Prime Minister of the country’s former King, the candidate of the Communists’ successors was elected President. This instability has, however, produced one positive development in the form of greater involvement in political decision-making of the Turkish minority, which was discriminated against in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike in Romania, the problems in Bulgaria are no bigger than those in a number of the present EU Member States. That is why it is right to allow Bulgaria full EU membership from 2007. There is a strong historical and linguistic bond between Bulgaria and the Slavonic-speaking part of Macedonia. In 1878, last-minute Western European intervention prevented the two from uniting. It would be useful if the negotiations about Macedonia’s accession – for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has appointed me as rapporteur – were to run parallel with Croatia, which also has its roots in former Yugoslavia, so that we can welcome the Bulgarians and Macedonians to the European Union simultaneously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not overly keen on the black-and-white film presented by the European Commission entitled ‘Romania the bad and Bulgaria the good’. Black-and-white films are not popular either in politics or in real life. Not everything is as bad in Romania and as good in Bulgaria as would appear from the picture painted by the European Commission’s amateur artists.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Bulgaria has made progress and that it should join the European Union on 1 January 2007. At the same time, however, Bulgaria has not done many of the things it should have done. I should like to refer to a number of specific points. Firstly, what use is there in Bulgarian legislation complying with EU legislation, if implementation of this legislation continues to lag behind? Secondly, trade in human beings, in particular in women and children, is still a serious problem. As a third point, the adoption system and its lack of transparency, as well as the situation in Bulgarian orphanages and special schools, continue to be a cause for concern. Fourthly, there are also concerns with regard to the situation of adults in psychiatric hospitals, and this is included in Parliament’s motion for a resolution. As a fifth point, the continuing lack of reform of the judicial system, which lags a long way behind European standards, is an Achilles’ heel for Sofia. The sixth point I should like to refer to is the widespread corruption, which is a thorn in Bulgaria’s side as it enters the EU, given that it affects various areas and levels of government and is apparent at every turn. During the past few weeks I have visited Bulgaria twice, and my remarks are by no means merely quotes from reports, but reflect what is plain for everyone to see. The seventh point is organised crime. The Bulgarian Government is acting like the choir in a Chinese opera, where the choir sings ‘let’s run away, let’s run away’ for three acts, but stays in the same place the whole time. The Bulgarian Government constantly repeats that it is taking measures to fight the mafia, but it would appear that it is mainly conducting a war of words. The mafia continues to be a serious problem. At the same time, however, the EU also sometimes takes measures that the Bulgarian public finds incomprehensible. For example, it recently demanded that a power plant in Kozloduj be shut down, even though enormous amounts of Bulgarian taxpayers’ money had been spent on modernising it in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite these reservations we should welcome the fact that our European family is to be joined by a nation with a history dating back over 1300 years. Bulgaria’s history is longer than many of the present EU Member States. I should like to bid Bulgaria welcome to somewhere it should have been for many years. I am sure Bulgaria will feel at home in the EU which is a Union of homelands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I mention this in order to highlight the need to formulate an efficient policy at European level on urban security.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the subject in hand. Bulgaria made noteworthy progress in converting to a pluralistic democracy and functional market economy in keeping with European instructions at both political and economic level. The integration of Bulgaria into the European Union in 2007, in conjunction with its recent admission to ΝΑΤΟ, is a particularly positive development both for Bulgaria itself and for south-eastern Europe as a whole. I trust that the case of Bulgaria will also set an example for the countries of the Western Balkans as they move towards Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that there needs to be a constant and conscious effort on the part of the Bulgarian authorities to adapt pending full integration. Further efforts should focus on stamping out corruption and efficiently combating organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to call on the European Commission, within the framework of the Community policy on border regions with candidate countries, to draft a new study on the repercussions which the integration of Bulgaria and Romania will have on the border regions of the Member States. I would remind you in this context that the European Commission itself, in the person of the competent Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, found that regions such as north-eastern Greece, which border on two countries, face by far the most difficult situation at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The policies and actions of the European Union to promote trans-national, trans-regional and cross-border cooperation and to combat the repercussions of enlargement on development and employment in border regions should be continued and reinforced. Similarly, special care must be taken when distributing resources and preparing programmes for territorial cooperation in the new 2007-2013 programming period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy wishes to stress that in the sectors of research and development, energy, industrial policy and telecommunications policy an additional effort is required if we want the incorporation of Bulgaria to be an historic success, since the accession date is now getting very close.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order correctly to assess the progress made and thereby propose the changes still to be made, we should take account not just of the report of the European Commission, but also of the assessments of the different international bodies and other independent research centres, whose opinion may be of great assistance in analysing and evaluating Bulgaria’s capacity in these areas, with a view to its incorporation into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, our current views with regard to each of the sectors which are the responsibility of our committee are as follows: with regard to energy policy, Bulgaria – as has already been said – currently depends on nuclear energy to cover its internal needs, but the reality is that its nuclear power stations are technically obsolete and the dismantling of some of them has been very expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">As has also been pointed out, it is now proposed to modernise units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy power station, and additional funds will be required for this, since the European Union’s contributions are clearly insufficient. Funds from international donors are required, though we are not seeing the government prioritise this issue as it should do.</p>
<p class="contents">In the telecommunications sector, the independence of the regulatory authority should be guaranteed, and it should have the power to resolve commercial disputes and guarantee the principle of universality, in accordance with Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to reformulate industrial and business policy and improve the administrative capacity to facilitate the work of small and medium-sized businesses, which are the true creators of jobs and an extraordinary source of technological innovation. With regard to the research sector, despite Bulgaria’s participation in the Sixth Framework Programme, its presence has been very limited.</p>

It has closed all the chapters and is an example and an inspiration to all its neighbours. I repeat, to all its neighbours. It would be an even better example if it took just one more step in its relationship with its minorities and did the same for the other minorities living in Bulgaria as it has already done for the Turkish minority. ‘The Balkans, that ancient mountain range’, as the Bulgarian national anthem goes, and the word ‘Balkans’ as a political problem does not apply in the case of Bulgaria. Bulgaria already belongs to Western Europe and it is the Western Balkans that we will have to deal with in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I feel that it is important that when we are talking about Bulgaria, we should also pay some attention to Macedonia, which has already submitted its application for membership of the European Union and that the European Union itself should also take another step forward. The USA has recognised Macedonia by the name that it chose for itself. We still continue to use the name FYROM and it is high time we took another step forward because this would also be a great step towards the Europeanisation of this area. In an hour and a half's time, Commissioner, you will be meeting a delegation from Serbia and Montenegro. This is the delegation's first visit to the European Parliament and I believe that the example of Bulgaria should be used as an inspiration for all its neighbours to do more for the future prospects and stability of this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore it seems to me that we could all learn more from Bulgaria and that Bulgaria's principal neighbour could learn a lot. I am talking about Turkey, a country we have supported <span class="italic">en masse</span> today in saying ‘yes’ to the start of negotiations. Bulgaria is the last country on the road to Turkey and I believe that it is right and proper that all of us who have a task to perform in this respect, should support all of these countries so that they can participate fully both economically and politically and bring about a further enlargement of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolutions record, to a degree, certain aspects of the wretched and inhumane living conditions of the working classes in these countries and the poor grass-roots classes, but these are the result of the restoration of capitalism, which is eroding all the social rights achieved and, on the other hand, is concentrating wealth in the hands of a new plutocracy and foreign monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are in fact two Bulgarias and two Romanias: on the one hand, the countries of luxury for the new plutocrats in Bulgaria and Romania and the foreigners who are literally plundering these countries and, on the other, the countries of two proud nations literally being dragged into misery and humiliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of the integration process and of the humiliating terms accepted by the governments of these countries are already visible. You spoke to us of successes. So listen to the successes: in Bulgaria, the minimum wage is EUR 61 and in Romania it is EUR 69, compared with EUR 1 173 in France and EUR 605 in Greece. The rapid increase in imports, in conjunction with plummeting exports, has resulted in increased deficits. Purchasing power in Romania is 60% of what it was in 1989. Industry has been destroyed and agricultural production is operating below par.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the new direction proposed in the resolutions and the new measures is to create better conditions, an institutional framework and infrastructures for the most unaccountable action by capital, the complete selling off of public property and land and the abolition of any social rights achieved. The workers in these countries, together with the workers in Greece and other countries in Europe, must fight against the policy of the European Union and, more importantly, against the new tensions expected in the area as a result of the serious rivalry which is beginning to manifest itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A great deal, of course, still needs to be done in the field of human rights and human trafficking, but they are doing their level best, which was not evident before. It is for that reason that I believe that Bulgaria should be able to join the European Union in 2007. They belong among us. I would also like to see more attention given to a debate about Bulgaria’s accession than to one about Turkey’s. After all, Bulgaria is a truly European country, straddling the old and new Europe, and deserves all our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">I can foresee some problems with regard to its accession. While there are, of course, problems in Bulgaria itself, the biggest may well be in the European Union. The fact is that funding for its accession is not yet completely in place. After 2007, we will be talking about the financial perspective up to 2013, and I am surprised at the discussion that is being held in the Council and elsewhere, in which it is stated that we might be able to manage on 1% of the gross domestic product. If you look at all the forecasts that have been made, funding for Bulgaria’s accession is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to address a critical comment to the Commission, which was right in saying that it needs more money than 1%. If, however, we look at the proposals for agriculture, for example, we notice that those do not include a budget for agriculture in Bulgaria, while the development of the countryside in Bulgaria will play a key role in the development of that country itself. Anyone who loves the countryside, loves the country itself and actually does something for the future of that country. I am therefore interested to hear how the Council intends to fund this accession and how we can ensure in a correct and proper manner that Bulgaria becomes a truly European country in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with another point. In the responses by the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left – which does, after all, comprise quite a few former Communists – I was struck by the fact that people have some difficulty with the major political changes in Bulgaria. To those people, I have this to say. The Bulgarians have a better grasp of politics than your group, and do you know why? They judge politicians by their actions, which may lead to major shifts. I am pleased to see that the Bulgarians, in terms of democratic thinking, are further advanced than many Members from the GUE/NGL Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will close the circle of enlargement opened with the ten new countries. It is a development of strategic importance which unites the Balkans and Europe and will contribute to peace, stability, cooperation and development in the area as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to underline a number of crucial points both to the Commission and to the Presidency. During the next stage, Bulgaria will need to step up its efforts to apply the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>in four sectors which are of particular importance to the European Union and to Greece:</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the sector of environmental protection, nuclear safety, nuclear waste management and the quality of river water. Reactors 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy nuclear power station must close in 2006, in accordance with the commitment given by the Bulgarian authorities, and modernisation of nuclear installations with Community financing from the PHARE programme and from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development must continue normally.</p>
<p class="contents">In the sector of labour relations and labour law, additional reforms are needed for Bulgaria to approach European standards and overturn social exclusion practices which affect Community – and especially Greek – undertakings in border regions, where there is a serious problem with relocations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, deficits are recorded in the three sectors of combating organised crime, trafficking in human beings and controlling external borders and combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that more efficient procedures and greater transparency in the sector of public procurement and public works are needed, as is the safeguarding of equal treatment of all Community undertakings, including Greek undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission must use the mechanisms provided for, with annual evaluation reports and safeguarding clauses, to monitor closely the efficient application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>and safeguard Community interests, even after the accession of Bulgaria on 1 January 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Posselt, Mr Maat, Mrs Dobolyi and others were clear on that issue. Members said that there are still a lot of concerns. That is true. That is precisely the reason why we have the framework, the procedure, with extra monitoring and an extra benchmark and, if necessary, an extra sanction, an extra safeguard for an extra year before the moment of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the financial issue raised by Mr Maat and others, I do not think we need to be concerned. The financial consequences of accession are already covered in the so-called financial package for the years 2007-09. That is irrespective of the new financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">An important issue that was raised again today is the importance of having an individual approach to different countries. You know the formal position – one treaty for Romania and Bulgaria. It is important, and necessary, to differentiate. That is precisely what we want to do in the wording of the conclusions next Thursday or Friday in the Council, concentrating on the different chapters. If necessary we can differentiate at the moment of actual accession, because there is the possibility of postponing accession for a maximum of one year.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, for his adequate and balanced report. I really welcome its conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to say thank you for the pertinent debate and those points of view expressed which, in the main, support the Commission’s recommendations. I will respond to just a couple of the most central issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I will speak first about the coupling of Romania and Bulgaria. It is true that a joint Accession Treaty is being drafted for these countries. On the other hand, as Mr Nicolaï very clearly explained, each is being treated according to a differentiated approach, especially now the process is in its last stages and the monitoring system and safeguard clause are ways of ensuring that each country is assessed according to the extent to which they are able to implement the reforms and commitments that need to be fulfilled before these countries can accede to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that Bulgaria is not yet ready for membership either: much work is being asked of it, but, at the same time, Bulgaria has all the potential to fulfil its commitments to enable it to accede to the Union on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I will speak next about corruption, which has attracted much attention in speeches. That is quite right and I agree with those views expressed. Bulgaria has recently drawn up a determined strategy to act against corruption. It is particularly concerned with improving border controls, developing the work of the traffic police and the institutions in general, and countering corruption in Bulgaria’s administration. This is in fact the main focus of Sub-Programme 4 under the PHARE programme and it will also become much more obviously the main focus over the coming two years, in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, I wish to talk about the status of minorities, and especially that of the Roma. In Bulgaria, new legislation against discrimination has recently been passed and has entered into force there. It took effect in January of this year and it is presently being implemented in conjunction with an anti-discriminatory action programme to improve the status of minorities. We are very closely monitoring this new legislation and the implementation of the action programme to support it. I am also pleased that other European organisations, such as the Council of Europe, in the building next to ours, is giving attention to this issue and working to strengthen the status of the Roma. We would all certainly have been present at the opening ceremony of the Council of Europe’s Roma Forum at 12 noon today, but at the same time we were debating, and you were voting on, the very important report on Turkey, so, unfortunately, we could not get there.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the European Parliament for its support and counsel, and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, and Bulgaria, which hopefully will become an example to the entire Balkan region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
