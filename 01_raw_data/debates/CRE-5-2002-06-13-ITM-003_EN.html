<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, in particular Mrs Read and Mr Harbour, and the Commission Secretariat, for their pleasant cooperation, and state that I, as the rapporteur, am delighted to have submitted this report. It concerns the accessibility of government websites, especially to citizens with disabilities and to elderly people. In this connection, our meetings with the European Commission have also been very fruitful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication aims to draw attention to the web accessibility section of the Lisbon strategy. In order to make websites accessible to the equipment of people with disabilities, these websites need to be of a correct technical design. For this purpose, the Worldwide W3C Consortium has drafted guidelines. The Member States have committed themselves to applying these guidelines for government websites and the European Commission is monitoring the progress of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Since all citizens need access to government information, the accessibility of public websites is clearly important. Moreover, governments have a special responsibility towards the weaker members of society. The European Parliament can, therefore, give its full support to this process. It calls for greater efforts in the area of implementation. Otherwise it will not be possible to realise the objective which the Commission mentions, namely to achieve accessibility of public websites by 2003, in time.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the user, for example a disabled worker in government service, will gain access to government sites without any problems within the foreseeable future. In addition, it is essential for this official himself or herself to be able to place information on a website. Consequently, the software required to place information on the web must also be accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a final end goal is not conceivable. Internet technology is developing fast. I would therefore call for the guidelines to be developed hand in hand with this technical dynamic. Governments will thus need to follow developments very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings us to the question what these guidelines actually mean for government institutions. First of all, accessibility for all will need to be accommodated in the draft process right from the outset. Secondly, for the sake of accessibility for all, it is necessary for governments to offer their information in a technologically neutral format. This means not exclusively via the Internet. Subsequently, it is, of course, the question whether the guidelines will be formally complied with in an effective and practical format. The report therefore asks Member States to set up information points where users can lodge their findings and complaints. These signals from society will need to lead to improvements to the websites.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been discussion about the question of whether a more binding character of the guidelines would yield a better result. This would not, however, get to the root of the current problem. The root of the problem lies in the lack of familiarity with the guidelines, and not in any potential unwillingness on the part of the web designers. In my opinion, there is certainly no reason to draft legislation at European level at <span class="italic">this</span> stage. The Commission does also want private sites, however, alongside government sites, to become accessible as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, one of the points of discussion was which type of websites was most urgent. Since the field is making different noises, it would be useful to grant priority to websites with most relevance for user groups. This could be either commercial websites or websites of social importance. Furthermore, these websites of social importance also encompass websites that are commercial in nature. Shops, banks and public transport companies spring to mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also pays attention to the candidate countries. The extent of the objective yet to be realised means that in those countries too, accessibility is worth a great effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, improvements in the field will also need to be measurable. The report therefore supports further research into measurable criteria for compliance with the guidelines. We have received encouraging signals from the field. The Dutch Institute for the Blind, Bartiméus, which has given us excellent advice, has developed an initiative along these lines. It hopes to be launching a website next week, on which it will be possible to register for a regular check of the website. In this way, a seal of accessibility can be obtained. Although the site will start off in Dutch, the institute does not rule out the introduction of an English version, thus allowing non-Dutch-speakers to have their sites tested too.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, I look forward to a situation in which people with a disability, just like people without a disability, can have access to the medium of the Internet without any problems. I hope that this report can make a contribution to this. After all, the Internet is a source of information and, do not forget, a means of communicating which is playing an ever greater role in society as a whole. Technological development should not exclude any groups, but rather help them in their social participation. Indeed, effective technology is at the service of mankind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an extremely comprehensive document that involved a lot of research. The task of the shadow rapporteurs has been relatively easy because we have agreed with a lot of the content and we have been looking for ways to further improve the direction of his text.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up a few specific points in relation to issues that he has kindly incorporated in the final report. Firstly, it is correct to emphasise, as he has done, the remarkable opportunities offered to disabled people in society. The digital revolution will improve the quality of their lives and access to services. That is something we need to try to exploit together in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who have sat with someone who is partially sighted and seen them use a website realise that there should be better design, and it would not cost anything. It is a question of education, training and best practice. That is something the Commission is working on, but we need to emphasise it. It is something where public authorities can demonstrate best practice and set a lead for others. As an integral part of that, it is crucial to ensure that we have the instruments in place to benchmark and give access ratings to websites, because public comparison and encouragement of best practice will stimulate everybody to move forward. That is something the Commission is also working on, but we are right to emphasise that in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">That, of course, links in to the question of commercial services. The users' groups I have talked to – in the United Kingdom in particular – have emphasised the importance of encouraging commercial operators and commercial providers of services to make their websites user-friendly for disabled people. Those crucial commercial services – such as banks, home-shopping services, access to transport – being able to order transport and look at timetables – need to be made accessible to disabled users. They will really help them engage with this new revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Having those benchmarks and star ratings will encourage commercial firms to pick them up and to make their websites more accessible which will really deliver the sorts of benefits we are looking for.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to encourage both of those aspects, but overall this report is extremely worthwhile. We will not support all the amendments on this side, but that is more an aspect of detail. The overall thrust of this report is very commendable and I encourage the House to give it its full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He really has worked not only very hard, but also in a very open, intelligent and approachable way. I think we are seeing the fruits of that method of working in this report. It has been a great privilege to be part of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, access at its best is the great equaliser, the great force for democracy. That is why this report is so important: it is providing a mechanism in terms of active citizenship, which is becoming more and more important, for instance electronic democracy. We are moving towards electronic voting; methods of being engaged as an active citizen more and more depend on access. But the reason why I wanted to be shadow rapporteur on this report, and to support Mr Belder, was that, for disabled people, access to work depends more and more on access to the web.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour is quite right that much of this does not depend on money, or at least not on huge sums of money, and Mr Belder has been absolutely correct to enter into wide consultation with disabled people themselves. They already are in a position over and over again to explain to us what is needed, what will work and what will help them.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw attention particularly to paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution, and I shall quote from it, because it says that disabled people not only should be able to read web pages, but also should be enabled to manage the content of web pages. In other words, they are not only passive receivers of information, but also serious contributors. That is absolutely important.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that this is all part of the Lisbon agenda, making Europe e-friendly and e-workable, and it is going to mean that if this principle is carried through into other areas of work, disabled European Union citizens will be able to participate on much more equal terms in this respect than we have seen to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s aim to bring the information society within everyone’s reach is democracy. There is no information without learning how to produce and use it oneself. A connection to the Internet and other tools for accessing information are not enough. People have to be able to and want to use them.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur draws attention to the availability and compatibility of special hardware and software. As a separate issue, I wish to stress the importance of language. Machine language should be translated into human languages. We need links between people and not just to machines. In the shadow of privatisation we must not destroy the social institutions that democratise information.

This is why we will always support organisations dedicated not only to fighting ‘info-exclusion’, but also and principally, in a positive and pro-active way, to enabling the extraordinary resources offered by information technologies to best respond to the needs and aspirations of vulnerable and traditionally marginalised social groups, such as the disabled and the elderly. We must consequently give this boost all the support we can. It was during the last European presidency, held by my country, in June 2000, at the summit held in Santa Maria da Feira, that the ‘<span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2002’, action plan was officially adopted. One of its aims was to make the information society accessible to all the citizens of the European Union, focusing in particular on the disabled and on combating ‘info-exclusion’ in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We have kept extremely busy in this field. The EIB and the Member States’ adoption, in 2001, of the guidelines for Web sites was an extremely important development. Against this background, we welcome the Commission communication and the extraordinary work carried out by the rapporteur. Although we have doubts about the charitably generous view that the guidelines will be fully implemented by the end of 2003, we feel we must insist on this aim and make particular demands with regard to those public Web sites which, having a specific social function or being of particular importance for the disabled and the elderly, must be the first to fully meet this objective. There is no logical reason why there should be a delay in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the priority of the accessibility of the content of sites, particularly for the elderly and people with disabilities, I feel that we must focus our attention on civil and political rights, on the accessibility of these rights through the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the priority as far as content is concerned. There is an urgent need for on-line publishing of all the formally public parts of institutional life – not just the political process but the judicial and administrative processes too – if we are to recapture one of the basic principles of liberal democracy. In this regard, I and another 62 Members – and I would point this out to Commissioner Liikanen too – have tabled a motion for a resolution on <span class="italic">e</span>-democracy, calling for European citizens to be able to fully enjoy the rights of citizenship guaranteed by the European Union Treaties through the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this applies to all levels of public administration: in other words, our priority must be precisely to make it possible for everybody, including, that is, those who have most difficulty, the most trouble in gaining access to the Internet, to be able to fully exercise their civil rights through the Internet, the civil rights of the publishing of information on the work of the institutions, of access to democratic rights, in other words, the civil rights which can be exercised through the Web. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On-line services for all is the European principle on which we compete with the Americans. Unless everyone is involved our society will flag. Numerous special groups, such as the disabled, the elderly, single parents, the poor, the unemployed, and so on, are in this position. The number of old people is increasing. Even we in the European Union may shortly be going around in blinkers. Technical barriers must be removed. That can be dealt with by the engineers, just as long as there is the political will. Finances are not a barrier. There exist different solutions, for example, in Sweden and Finland, but everyone, ourselves included, must aspire to the Liikanen objective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to make it easy to access the web. Hard copy texts today are already too difficult so for many they will be too difficult on a screen too, but this is a measure of democracy, a measure of <span class="italic">e-</span>Europe, Europe’s gauntlet of competition for others to pick up. The extent to which our democracy has developed and matured will be measured by how democratic we are on the web. Then it will not be a question of accessibility but whether we are included, whether we can participate actively, and whether we are able to bring our own input to the web. Democracy is not a one-way process, as it can easily be on the web. The elderly, the disabled and all our citizens, the special groups in particular, all must be able to participate and bring their own input to the web. We therefore have to aspire to that. If that does not happen democracy will be distorted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is about the Internet, that is to say the alternative to the performance laid on for you here, and about direct access for you to something that can constitute the democratic opinion-forming process. We are talking about eEurope; have you tried it out yet? Have you yet visited Parliament's website, or the Council's, or the Commission's? If you did, did you feel the way I did? You feel as if you are facing a wall full of binder files. Some people get aroused by the binder files, but most do not. It is children and young people who are looking for something different, seeking information and debate. That is possible; Europe has the chance to make it so, but we – by which I mean also we in this House – have to work like crazy on the design of our websites and also on their subject matter. The most important information is not there. That having been said, the Internet is of real importance to democracy.

Mr Belder was able to use much richer language here, but I share the same conclusion. These groups risk severe social exclusion due to a range of technical barriers they face when using the Internet. The Commission is fully committed to taking action to identify and remove these barriers at European level, in order to secure an inclusive society providing equal opportunities for all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission Communication on web accessibility is an integral part of the eEurope 2002 Action Plan adopted at the European Council of Feira in June 2000. One of its specific aims is to ensure that people with disabilities benefit fully from new technologies and the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Representative organisations of disabled people such as the European Disability Forum have been widely consulted and we will pursue this consultation on issues such as eInclusion and eAccessibility when implementing the eEurope 2005 Action Plan to be adopted by the European Council in Seville next week. All the areas where we propose new actions must be available to anyone with a disability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed in particular to promoting the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines, which provide a voluntary mechanism for public information providers and website builders to conform to a set of informal rules on designing and structuring websites. Many of the Member States have already taken steps towards this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore welcomes the overall level of interest and satisfaction that this communication has received from the European Parliament. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, who drew up a very balanced and complete report on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regard specific issues raised in his report, the Commission agrees with the encouragement to Member States to ensure that the underlying objectives of improved web accessibility are achieved, to raise awareness and speed up implementation of the Guidelines and to organise follow-up of the achievements in this field. Most of these objectives are also set out in the Council of Telecommunications Ministers resolution on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already taken steps systematically to monitor progress in adopting and implementing the guidelines at European level as part of the eEurope benchmarking effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the requirement that web sites developed by the Commission and other European institutions should follow these guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">During the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003, the Commission will promote awareness of web accessibility and training initiatives for website builders and content providers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue its fruitful dialogue with organisations representing people with special needs, including the disabled and the elderly, to have their experience and guidance in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the European Parliament resolution on this subject will be a significant milestone in understanding the role and importance of accessibility in the inclusive information society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
