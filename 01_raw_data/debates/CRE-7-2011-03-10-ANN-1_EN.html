<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Honourable Members, I would like to thank you for putting this question, which is of particular interest to the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
<p>As you rightly pointed out, the Hungarian Presidency has put forward a number of activities in the area of family policy under the heading ‘Demographic Change and Family Policy’. These include an initiative on a European Year of Families to take place in 2014, building on the results of the European Year of Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010). The Presidency strongly believes that special attention needs to be devoted to families. Improving the social situation of families could have a positive influence on the current demographic tendencies, and will most certainly contribute to strengthening social cohesion.</p>
<p>As far as the impact of the crisis on the social situation of families is concerned, the Presidency has studied with interest the information available on family policies, in particular, through various reports prepared by the Social Protection Committee and the European Commission. In order to deepen knowledge on these issues, the Hungarian Presidency will organise on 28-29 March an experts conference on ‘The Impact of Work and Family Reconciliation on Demographic Dynamics’ and on 1 April, the Presidency will host an informal meeting of ministers responsible for family and demographic affairs. Issues related to families and the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as possibilities for enhancing cooperation in the field of family policies, will be addressed. It is within this framework of actions addressing the demographic challenge that the Hungarian Presidency is preparing the initiative on a ‘European Year of Families 2014’.</p>
<p>Whilst family issues are, first and foremost, an area of Member States’ competence, family policies are firmly embedded in our shared values and traditions, and there is considerable scope for cooperation at EU level. Actions such as those proposed by the Hungarian Presidency can also provide added value to policy options and solutions at national level. The Presidency hopes that its initiative on a ‘European Year of Families 2014’ will secure wide support. Of course, detailed objectives and measures of the European Year of Families will have to be discussed and decided upon at a later stage.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000062"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Direct taxation remains primarily within the competence of the Member States. Nonetheless, in a few cases corporate taxation has been subject to EU legislation and coordination where this was necessary for the functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p>Concerning EU legislation, the Council has adopted directives on cross-border income flows (Directive 90/435/EEC<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning parent companies and subsidiaries and Directive 2003/49/EC<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> concerning interest and royalty payments) and on cross-border merging of international groups of companies (Directive 90/434/EEC of 23 July 1990<a href="#defann_2_3" name="refann_2_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on mergers). It also adopted Directive 77/799/EEC<a href="#defann_2_4" name="refann_2_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> on mutual assistance.</p>
<p>As far as coordination is concerned, since 1998, the Council Code of Conduct Group meets regularly to assess potentially harmful measures in the area of business taxation. As a result, a significant number of harmful tax measures have been identified and rolled back. Lastly, in June 2010, the Council adopted a resolution on coordination of the Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) and thin capitalisation rules within the European Union, which is also aimed at coordinating Member States’ policies in the area of direct taxation.</p>
<p>As regards future work in the area of corporate taxation, the Commission, in its Work Programme for 2011, is planning to submit a proposal on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, on which the European Parliament will be consulted.</p>
<p>Against this background, any ideas on corporate tax rates are only being floated by a couple of Member States. Pursuant to the Treaty, EU legislation measures in the tax area require a proposal from the Commission and unanimity within the Council, which can adopt directives after consulting the European Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The European Council of 16-17 December 2010 decided that the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU should be modified in order to recognise the power of the euro area Member States to create a permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard financial stability in the euro area. It further mandated the Finance Ministers of the euro area Member States and the Commission to finalise work on the intergovernmental arrangement setting up the future European Stability Mechanism by March 2011. As this work is intergovernmental, it falls outside the competence of the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
<p>As for the so-called ‘European semester’, this was endorsed by the Council in its conclusions on 7 September 2010, and involves simultaneous monitoring of the Member States’ budgetary policies and structural reforms, in accordance with common rules, during a six-month period every year. The European semester is being implemented for the first time this year.</p>
<p>Member States had already submitted their draft National Reform Programmes in 2010, while the Commission presented to the Council the main conclusions of its first Annual Growth Survey on 13 January 2011<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This survey outlines priority actions to be taken by Member States and sets out priorities in three main areas, namely, the enhancing of macro-economic stability, structural reforms for boosting employment and growth-enhancing measures under the ‘Europe 2020’ strategy.</p>
<p>On 18 January 2011, the Council held a review of draft National Reform Programmes and had an exchange of views on the Annual Growth Survey submitted by the Commission.</p>
<p>On 15 February, the Council adopted conclusions on macro-economic and fiscal guidance.</p>
<p>In line with the road map set out by the Hungarian Presidency, on 28 February, the Council gave its reaction to the Annual Growth Survey presented by the Commission and is expected to discuss the Joint Employment Report on 7 March, the Research and Development Target on 10-11 March, and climate change on 14 March. On 21 March, the Council will be invited by the Presidency to endorse a Synthesis Report setting out the main messages based on the work carried out in the relevant Council formations, with a view to its transmission to the European Council.</p>
<p>Regarding the Member States’ budgets, the Council agreed, on 15 February, on strict compliance with the Council recommendations in the context of the excessive deficit procedure. Member States facing very large structural budget deficits or very high or rapidly increasing public debt levels should frontload their fiscal consolidation. Furthermore, all Member States should keep the growth of expenditure net of discretionary revenue measures clearly below the medium-term rate of potential GDP growth until they have reached their medium-term budgetary objective. At the same time, they should prioritise sustainable growth-friendly expenditure and promote efficiency of public spending.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) In its conclusions of 14 December 2010, the Council reaffirmed its unequivocal commitment to the European perspective of the Western Balkans, a prospect which had already been reconfirmed at the High Level Meeting on the Western Balkans in Sarajevo on 2 June 2010 and which remains essential for the stability, reconciliation and future of the region. At the same time, the Council reaffirmed the need for fair and rigorous conditionality, in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process, and in accordance with the renewed consensus on enlargement approved by the European Council on 14 and 15 December 2006.</p>
<p>The Council recalled that by making solid progress in economic and political reform, and by fulfilling the necessary conditions and requirements, the remaining potential candidates in the Western Balkans should achieve candidate status, according to their own merits, with European Union membership as the ultimate goal. A country’s satisfactory track record in implementing its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, including trade-related provisions, is an essential element for the EU to consider any membership application.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the progress achieved by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in key reform areas such as police reform, albeit at an uneven pace. The country continues to fulfil its commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The Council expects momentum of the reform agenda to be maintained. Further progress still needs to be made on issues such as dialogue among political actors, judiciary and public administration reform, the fight against corruption, freedom of expression and improving the business environment. The implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement remains an essential element of democracy and the rule of law in the country.</p>
<p>The Council broadly shares the Commission's assessment of the country’s sufficient fulfilment of the political criteria and noted that the Commission reiterated its recommendation that accession negotiations should be opened with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Council stated in its conclusions its readiness to return to the matter during the Hungarian Presidency. The Council reiterated that maintaining good neighbourly relations, including a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to the name issue, under the auspices of the UN, is essential. The Council also welcomed the ongoing high-level dialogue and looked forward to it bringing results shortly<a href="#defann_4_1" name="refann_4_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) With respect to developments in Egypt and Tunisia to which the honourable Member of the European Parliament refers in his question, the European Council, the Council (FAC) as well as the Presidents of the European Council, the European Commission and the High Representative, in a joint statement, saluted the peaceful and dignified expression by the Tunisian and Egyptian people of their legitimate, democratic, economic and social aspirations which are in accordance with the values the European Union promotes for itself and throughout the world. It was emphasised that the citizens’ democratic aspirations should be addressed through dialogue and political reform, with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and through free and fair elections.</p>
<p>The Council is determined to lend its full support to the transition processes towards democratic governance, pluralism, improved opportunities for economic prosperity and social inclusion, and strengthened regional stability.</p>
<p>On 4 February 2011, the European Council stated that it was committed to a new partnership involving more effective support in the future to those countries which are pursuing political and economic reforms. In this context, the European Council invited the High Representative to develop a package of measures aimed at lending European Union support to the transition and transformation processes (strengthening democratic institutions, promoting democratic governance and social justice, and assisting the preparation and conduct of free and fair elections); and to link the European Neighbourhood Policy and Union for the Mediterranean more to these objectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000074"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) In June 2010, the Council adopted conclusions on the interim joint report on pensions prepared by the Economic Policy Committee (EPC) and the Social Protection Committee (SPC). In these conclusions, the Council reaffirmed its commitment to the common objectives of sustainable and adequate pensions and to the three-pronged strategy for meeting the economic and budgetary consequences of ageing. This aims namely at reducing debt at a faster pace, raising employment rates and productivity, and reforming pension, healthcare and long-term care systems.</p>
<p>Following the Commission Green Paper and the finalisation of the EPC-SPC joint report, the Council discussed the issue on 17 November 2010 and underlined the long-term challenge of ageing populations for the sustainability and adequacy of pensions, as aggravated by the current economic situation. The EPSCO Council meeting in December adopted Council conclusions in this context.</p>
<p>Development of the pension systems is a long-term issue. Consequently, this must be constantly kept on the agenda now and in the future as well. That is why the EPSCO Council at its meeting of 7 March discussed the preliminary conclusions of the Green Paper’s consultation on the adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems The Council held a fruitful exchange of views on the most pressing dilemmas of European pension systems. The main issues were, besides the retirement age, the inter-related problematics of adequacy, sustainability and security, together with the special conditions shaped by the impact of the budgetary constraints. The main conclusion of the debate was that while most Member States deemed necessary the further strengthening of the coordination on EU level in the field of the pension systems, at the same time, they nailed down that pensions and retirements age are matters of exclusive Member States’ competence.</p>
<p>The Council stressed the urgency for further implementation of structural reforms, consistent with the Europe 2020 strategy, in order to support fiscal consolidation, improve growth prospects, strengthen work incentives, ensure flexible labour markets and extend working lives.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there is a need to consider pension policies in a comprehensive manner using existing EU level policy coordination frameworks, the design of the pension systems as much as the provision of pensions remain in the competence of Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000078"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Hungarian Presidency of the Council attaches great importance to the protection of victims of crime, which is also set out in the Stockholm Programme (‘An open and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens’) as a key objective for the Union. Indeed, in this programme, the European Council has stressed the importance of providing special support and legal protection to those who are most vulnerable or who find themselves in particularly exposed situations, such as persons subjected to repeated violence in close relationships, victims of gender based violence, or persons who fall victim to other types of crimes in a Member State of which they are not nationals or residents. The Presidency stresses that an integrated and coordinated approach to victims is needed, in line with the Stockholm Programme and the Council conclusions on a strategy to ensure fulfilment of the rights of persons who fall victims of crime and to improve support for them, adopted in October 2009.</p>
<p>In preparation of such an integrated approach, the Presidency will organise a comprehensive seminar, scheduled for 23-24 March 2011 in Budapest, under the title ‘Protecting victims in the EU: The road ahead’, where a wide range of issues will be discussed concerning the future legislative and non-legislative initiatives in this field.</p>
<p>The Council also awaits the presentation of the Commission’s package of measures on the protection of victims, especially in the context of criminal proceedings, at the Justice Council on 12 April 2011. Once this set of proposals will have been formally tabled, the Council will examine it as a matter of priority, and draw up a comprehensive list of action points which the Member States undertake to act upon in order to fulfil their commitment in the Stockholm Programme to enhance victims’ protection in the EU. This list will be centred around the upcoming Commission proposals, in particular, concerning the revision of Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA of 15 March 2001 on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, but will also look beyond that. The Presidency plans to include these action points in a Council ‘road map’, to ensure the coherence of future initiatives in this field, both through legislative and non-legislative measures. The Presidency plans to have the road map adopted at the Justice Council on 10 June 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000083"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council is committed to the protection of human health and the environment from releases of mercury and its compounds and is conscious of the concern that the honourable Member raises in his question. At present, the Council examines the review of the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury on the basis of the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 7 December 2010<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The review, under Action 8, describes in detail actions and measures addressing the mercury content used in energy efficient light bulbs, which were introduced at EU level following the progressive ban of incandescent bulbs from the EU market by the 2005 Eco-design Directive, as amended in 2009. The review refers also to the Opinion on Mercury in Certain Energy-saving Light Bulbs of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) which concludes that a human health risk for adults due to breakage of such lamps is unlikely. The Council is, for the moment, not aware of any other study stating the opposite.</p>
<p>However, the Council considers important that Member States and the Commission continue to study and to raise awareness of all stakeholders, including the general public, on the health and environmental impact of mercury, and to disseminate information about the ongoing EU activities in this field.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission’s communication on the Mid-term revision of the Small Business Act of 23 February 2011 contains measures to reduce administrative burden, dismantle barriers to effective cross-border operations within the Single Market, facilitate SME business in the global market, and improve access to finance for SMEs. The Presidency intends to focus on this Communication and submit draft conclusions for adoption to the Council in May 2011 on issues such as:</p>
<p>the application of the ‘only once’ principle, avoiding to ask SMEs the same questions by public authorities several times,</p>
<p>reducing ‘gold plating’ by Member States in line with ‘smart regulation’ principles,</p>
<p>systematically assessing the impact of legislation using an ‘SME test’,</p>
<p>presenting at a defined moment each year a forward planning of business-related legislation,</p>
<p>applying the ‘think small first’ principle also to administrative procedures affecting SMEs.</p>
<p>Existing actions will also be further developed in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, in the following areas:</p>
<p>making smart regulation a reality for European SMEs,</p>
<p>taking a broad-based approach to enhancing market access to SMEs,</p>
<p>helping SMEs to contribute to a resource-efficient economy, and</p>
<p>promoting entrepreneurship, job creation and inclusive growth.</p>
<p>As for access to finance, a number of instruments introduced by Member States for ensuring easier and more equitable access to bank lending already proved to be effective.</p>
<p>At EU level, the financial instruments of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), with a total budget of EUR 1.1 billion for the period 2007-2013, enable financial institutions to provide about EUR 30 billion. In addition, the European Investment Bank (EIB) almost doubled its lending for small businesses in Europe, with a target of EUR 30 billion for the period 2008-2011.</p>
<p>Finally, EU support instruments for RTD and innovation efforts by SMEs (such as the dedicated SME activities within the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP)) are important and effective in improving their competitiveness, as pointed out by the European Council meeting on 4 February 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000089"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Article 9(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation) states that a Commission proposal ‘shall be adopted by the Council unless it decides by a simple majority to reject the proposal within a period of one month after its submission by the Commission’. This means that at least fourteen Member States must be opposed if the proposed measures are to be rejected. The result of an informal consultation procedure on the proposal referred to by the honourable Member which ended on 24 February was that the majority of Member States did not reject the proposal. For that reason, the Presidency sees no need for further debate or for the matter to be referred back to the Committee stage. It will therefore recommend that, in order to comply with European Union law, the Council adopt the Commission proposal.</p>
<p>The information submitted by wind turbine or wind turbine blades manufacturers (a downstream user industry) during the investigation has been limited and of only a very general nature. Written submissions indicate that the vast majority of fibreglass products imported from China by this specific user sector fall outside the product scope of this proceeding. Furthermore, the cost and profitability analysis for the direct user industry, as summarised in recitals 119-126 of the proposed regulation, is reassuring, and the impact on further downstream users will be minimal.</p>
<p>The purpose of anti-dumping measures is to re-establish a level playing field on the Union market. Broader topics, such as the fight against climate change, are already covered by specific legislation, which includes public interest considerations. As a general rule, the Union interest analysis in trade defence investigations focuses on the economic impact of measures on the economic operators concerned. The industry within the EU cannot be deprived of its right to seek protection from unfair trade practices. Moreover, taking broader considerations into account would conflict with the precise technical nature of such investigations. Concerns relating to other aspects should be addressed through other appropriate instruments and measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000093"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) While the Council does not have a role in the implementation or the preparatory actions of the European Year of Voluntary Activities as it is implemented by the Commission and the Member States, the Council on several occasions, notably in its sessions of May<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and November 2010<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, held an exchange of views on the possible future priority areas in the field of sport.</p>
<p>In the May Council meeting, the ministers in particular emphasised the importance of investing in grassroots sport by focusing on recreational and health enhancing sport. They suggested the following areas for possible EU action:</p>
<p>- Social and educational functions of sport, e.g. social inclusion through sport and health enhancing physical activity, dual careers for athletes;</p>
<p>- Sport structures, in particular, those based on voluntary activity;</p>
<p>- Fairness and openness in sport, including the fight against racism, discrimination and violence;</p>
<p>- Physical and moral integrity of sportsmen and sportswomen, especially the fight against doping and the protection of minors;</p>
<p>- Dialogue and close cooperation with the sports movement.</p>
<p>In November 2010, the Council adopted a resolution establishing a high-level structured dialogue with sport stakeholders<a href="#defann_11_3" name="refann_11_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Such a dialogue will allow an ongoing exchange of views on priorities, implementation and follow-up to EU cooperation in the field of sport.</p>
<p>At the same meeting, the Council also adopted conclusions on the role of sport as a source of and a driver for active social inclusion<a href="#defann_11_4" name="refann_11_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The conclusions identify three common priorities for promoting social inclusion through sport: the accessibility of sport activity for all citizens (‘sport for all’ principle), better use of the potential of sport as a contribution to community building, social cohesion and growth, and transnational exchanges of strategies and methodologies.</p>
<p>The Presidency intends to invite the Council to respond to the Commission Communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’ by adopting a resolution in May 2011. Such a resolution could set out a limited number of priority areas and establish an EU work plan in the field of sport for the next three years. Moreover, the current and next Council Presidencies intend to use the theme of the year as a focus for a number of conferences and events.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Under the terms of the Treaty, in particular, Articles 165 and 166 TFEU, education and training constitute an area of national competence in which the European Union has essentially only a supporting role. As a result, the possibilities for adopting measures and actions at EU level are extremely limited.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in recognition of the fact that Member States face common challenges in this field which call for joint responses, and that all can benefit from the exchange of experience, the Union has progressively intensified European cooperation in education and training over the last decade. This process of enhanced cooperation culminated in May 2009 in the Council's adoption of the ‘ET2020’ strategic framework<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, under which Member States agreed to take steps at national level in order to achieve a number of jointly agreed strategic objectives. To create momentum towards these objectives, the Member States also agreed on a series of reference levels of European average performance (commonly referred to as ‘benchmarks’), one of which relates specifically to the reduction of early school leaving, i.e. that by 2020, the share of early school leavers should be below 10%.</p>
<p>More recently, the importance of tackling this issue has been recognised at the highest level of the Union. In June 2010, the European Heads of State or Government adopted the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Acknowledging the fundamental role which education and training should play in the strategy, they agreed that improving education levels was a priority for the Union and - reflecting the benchmark adopted under the ‘ET2020’ framework - set an EU headline target of reducing the overall share of early school leavers to less than 10% by 2020.</p>
<p>In terms of the specific measures being considered in order to meet this ambitious target (the current EU average is 14.4%), the Council has already begun examining a Commission proposal for a Council Recommendation on policies to reduce early school leaving.</p>
<p>This sets out basic guidelines for coherent, comprehensive and evidence-based strategies to be adopted and implemented in the context of Member States’ national reform programmes, and funded through the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, and the European Social Fund. The proposal will be examined within the Council during March and April, with a view for the Presidency to submit it for adoption by the Council in May.</p>
<p>On a broader level, progress toward the EU headline target of reducing early school leaving to below 10%, along with progress towards all the objectives and targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, will be monitored regularly during the first half of each year in the context of the ‘European semester’.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The 2006 Services Directive provides for points of single contact to be set up in the Member States. These points of single contact are one of the key aspects of effectively implementing the directive, and represent a vital source of information for those wishing to provide cross-border services or set up business in another Member State. They are especially useful for small-scale service providers who often cannot afford consultations on another EU Member State’s employment law, tax law, procedures for setting up businesses, and so on.</p>
<p>In some Member States, points of single contact have not been set up or do not work well enough, insofar as they do not provide the comprehensive information that service providers need.

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Points of single contact (PSC) were established in the Services Directive precisely to facilitate the lives of entrepreneurs by providing all the necessary information in a one-stop shop and it is important to make sure that they are in place and work in the best way possible to achieve their objective.</p>
<p>A great deal of work has already been done. PSC are now in place in 22 Member States. The five Member States without an operational PSC are advancing significantly and most are planning to make their PSC available in the course of 2011.</p>
<p>17 PSCs already allow for the online completion of some key procedures. Working in this direction would create a direct link between the ‘think small first’ principle, the Single Market Act and the ‘Digital agenda for Europe’. These three aspects, together with the monitoring of the implementation of the Services Directive have been the subject of constant and regular attention in the Council in the past years.</p>
<p>Overall, the development of the PSCs does not end with the implementation of the Services Directive. More work can be done to improve the existing PSCs to make them more user-friendly and useful for entrepreneurs, both as regards the availability and presentation of information as well as ease of the completion of procedures online within a Member State and particularly across borders.</p>
<p>In this perspective, the Presidency intends to submit Council Conclusions on a better functioning single market for services to the Council of 10 March 2011. In these Conclusions, the Council is expected to emphasise the importance of stepping up efforts for the full implementation of the Services Directive while welcoming the achievements so far, including the results of the mutual evaluation exercise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000104"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU has an established policy on promoting good governance in tax matters which is based on three principles: transparency of tax systems, exchange of tax information and fair tax competition. Although so-called ‘tax havens’ are de facto covered, the policy is not targeted at those, but aims at improving good tax governance in general.</p>
<p>The Commission is actively pursuing the implementation of the actions defined in its 2009 and 2010 communications on the ‘Promotion of good governance in tax matters’ and on ‘Tax and development’, which form the basis of its policy in this field. In practice, this means:</p>
<p>in the field of transparency and exchange of information, ensuring that tax administrations have access, can process and effectively exchange between themselves relevant (tax) information on taxpayers;</p>
<p>in the field of harmful tax competition, removing those tax regimes designed to unfairly attract taxpayers from other countries, while maintaining the capacity to use taxation as a fair competition tool in the Single Market.</p>
<p>This strategy has a clear international dimension. The Commission pushes for the inclusion of commitments to good governance in the tax area during the negotiations on EU agreements with third countries. Moreover, it builds on joined efforts undertaken in other international fora such as the G20, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the United Nations.</p>
<p>As regards taxation of savings income, and beyond existing agreements with third countries, the Commission is actively promoting its standards – including automatic exchange of information – both in its discussions with European countries that are not members of the EU and with other important financial centres such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
<p>The matter of tax justice is not within the Commission's remit. The Commission acknowledges the prime responsibility of countries to improve their revenue systems and policies according to their own economic and political circumstances and choices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000100"></a>

<p>(EN) Both the Commission and the Council repeatedly signalled downside fiscal and macro-economic risks related to the property boom in Ireland from as early as 2000, as part of our regular fiscal surveillance procedures and also later in 2007 and 2008 under the Lisbon Strategy. Despite this, the Commission has acknowledged that macro-economic oversight across all Member States in future needs to be broader and its surveillance mandate needs to be expanded to cover also risks building up in the private sector.</p>
<p>On the interest rate, the Commission supports, in principle, a reduction of the interest rate margin on the European portion of the borrowing covered by the EFSM and the EFSF. However, a final decision on this matter would be for the Council and the euro area Member States and would have to be viewed in the context of a comprehensive package that would include progress on economic governance in the euro area, the new European Stabilisation Mechanism (ESM) and the adjustment measures by Member States. For Ireland, any reduction in interest costs could not alter the agreed consolidation path which would see Ireland reach a 3% of GDP deficit by 2015.</p>
<p>As to the scope for modifying the EU-IMF financial assistance programme, the main elements or goalposts of the programme should not be renegotiated. The policy path set out in the programme is adequate to achieve its goals. The programme’s quarterly reviews offer an opportunity to evaluate whether changed circumstances warrant changes in specific elements of the programme. But all measures should take account of their effects on growth, competitiveness and the long-run sustainability of public finances. On the issue of wider economic governance, any agreement at European level would not, of its own accord, lead to a change in the agreed policy path with Ireland.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000066"></a>

<p>(EN) Staff teams from the Commission (EC), European Central Bank (ECB), and International Monetary Fund (IMF) visited Athens during 27 January to 11 February 2011 for the third review of the government’s economic programme, which is being supported by an EUR 80 billion loan from euro area countries and a EUR 30 billion Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. The Commission raises the attention of the honourable Member that the winter 2011 update of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), as well as the Commission compliance report, can be found on the Europa website<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>:</p>
<p>The overall assessment was that the programme has made further progress toward its objectives. While there have been delays in some areas, the underlying fiscal and broader reforms necessary to deliver the programme’s medium-term objectives are being put in place. In particular:</p>
<p>Greece achieved an impressive fiscal adjustment in 2010. The fiscal deficit for 2010 is estimated at 9½ percent of GDP; this is a fall of 6 points from 2009. However, the deficit was well above the programme target of 8 percent of GDP. Whilst the slippage was, to a large extent, related to the revision of statistics in autumn 2010, budget implementation encountered several problems. The fight against tax evasion has not (yet) yielded the hoped-for gains and there remain important problems in expenditure control.</p>
<p>For 2011, the target is of a fiscal deficit of 7½ percent of GDP, which remains in line with the programme’s target. This means that, in spite of the weaker-than-planned fiscal performance in 2010, the government has committed to catch up in 2011 and keep the fiscal adjustment effort on track, as initially planned. The fiscal targets of the programme have not been revised.</p>
<p>The government is currently preparing its medium-term fiscal strategy, with a view to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2014. In the context of this medium-term strategy, the government decided to considerably scale up its initial privatisation and real estate development programme, with a view to improve debt sustainability. The objective is to realise EUR 50 billion in privatisation proceeds from now to 2015. The proceeds from privatisation are to be used to redeem debt and do not substitute fiscal consolidation efforts. This has the potential of cutting the debt ratio by more than twenty points of GDP over the next five years. If successful, this new initiative has the potential of substantially improving the market sentiment vis-à-vis Greece. The Commission and the euro area partners should encourage Greece to show resolve in its privatisation programme.</p>
<p>The details and modalities of the privatisation and real estate development programme shall be designed, decided and announced by the government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Following the President of the Commission’s announcement in the State of Union speech to the Parliament in September 2010, the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have worked intensively to design the eventual scheme for EU project bonds. A stakeholder consultation paper with the proposed design was formally launched at a press conference given by the Member of the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs and EIB President Maystadt on 28 February 2011.</p>
<p>The consultation will run until 2 May 2011, with a final conference on 11 April 2011, and its aim is to allow the Commission to eventually establish a proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework in June 2011.</p>
<p>The general idea is to enable project companies to raise financing for infrastructure projects in the capital markets through bond issues, in addition to the traditional methods of obtaining loans.</p>
<p>Suitable projects should be in line with the Europe 2020 objectives, for example, long-term infrastructure projects that are of major public interest and have revenue potential.</p>
<p>Attracting sufficient financing is difficult because of the risks associated with the long-term nature of such projects.</p>
<p>In order to bridge this funding gap, the EU and the EIB would assume part of this risk, so that the private debt financing would become easier, and long-term capital market investors could find it attractive to invest in such long-term bonds. Such long-term investors are, for instance, insurance companies and pension funds.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that both the EIB and the EU would share the risk related and the remuneration, but would not issue bonds. In other words, this initiative should not be confused with the so called ‘Eurobonds’, which commonly refer to joint debt issuance by Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000081"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU is negotiating with Mercosur an association agreement which is composed of three chapters: Political, Economic and Trade. Negotiations were resumed in May last year at the EU-Mercosur summit. Since then, there have been three rounds of negotiations. However, up to now, discussions have focused on rules such as sanitary requirements, technical barriers, trade defence instruments or general rules for services and government procurement. No discussions have taken place on market access yet.</p>
<p>After each round, written reports as well as the updated texts have been sent to the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and the Trade Policy Committee in the Council.</p>
<p>Whereas it is still too early to identify the main difficulties of these negotiations, it is clear that discussions on market access, especially in agriculture, will prove to be challenging.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the Parliament that it is fully aware of the sensitivities of the European agricultural and food sectors. This is why it always made clear to Mercosur - from the very beginning of the negotiations - that for certain agricultural products, we would not be in position to fully liberalise trade with Mercosur. Beef is one of these products.</p>
<p>It is, however, important to remember that the EU also has offensive interests in agriculture and it should therefore seek the elimination of existing Mercosur import duties on agri-food products as well.</p>
<p>Even if agriculture will be a difficult area of negotiations, the Commission expects the same to be the case for discussions on market access in Mercosur for EU industrial products and for services.</p>
<p>The EU and Mercosur are now, on both sides, preparing internally the market access offers. Once these offers are ready, a decision will be taken on the best timing to proceed to a simultaneous exchange.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is fully aware of the concerns raised by the honourable Member, as well as those expressed by the farmers in the EU, regarding the need for compliance of imported products with the same quality standards as goods produced in the EU.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission wishes to stress that all agricultural products that are placed on the EU market have to comply with the import requirements regarding food safety, animal and plant health, as well as certain animal welfare aspects. These imported products are therefore considered as safe.</p>
<p>The Commission can guarantee that the EU-Mercosur Agreement, like any other bilateral trade agreements, will not lead to a lowering of EU import requirements.</p>
<p>Animal, plant and food safety standards, related to trade with third countries, deserve particular attention and will be addressed in the negotiation. The Commission is committed to negotiate the inclusion of EU standards and to put in place technical collaboration programmes in the future EU Mercosur association agreement.</p>
<p>The dates of the three following rounds of negotiations have already been scheduled for March, May and July 2011, alternately in Brussels and Paraguay. The Commission's objective for the moment remains to conclude the negotiations by the end of 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000090"></a>

<p>The EU’s trade policy has an important role to play in attaining the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, by means, inter alia, of concluding Free Trade Agreements (FTA). As one of the world’s fastest growing economies, India is set to become a key strategic partner of the EU in the coming years. An FTA will further increase investment opportunities for European companies in India, and enhance access to markets both for European and for Indian firms. The benefits of trade are likely to help lift millions of Indians out of poverty.</p>
<p>As India goes further down the road towards becoming a knowledge-based economy and innovation plays a greater role in the Indian economy, investment by innovative European companies will also help to foster innovation.

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees that the EU’s trade policy has a key role to play in achieving the goals of the EU 2020 strategy by stimulating growth and jobs. The negotiation of a free trade agreement with India offers a significant opportunity to deliver on these goals.</p>
<p>The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India is of major economic and strategic importance. As one of the fastest growing economies in the world, India is an important trade partner for the EU and a growing global economic power. It combines a growing market of more than 1 billion people with a growth rate of between 8 and 10%.</p>
<p>The adequate protection of our Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is an essential element of our external competitiveness strategy.</p>
<p>If the EU wants to remain a competitive economy, it will have to rely on innovation, creativity and brand exclusivity. This is one of the EU’s main comparative advantages on the world market. So the EU needs the tools to ensure that this comparative advantage is adequately protected in our main export markets, including India.</p>
<p>The EU’s objective in the IPR negotiations is to ensure that European innovators are able to operate and to compete in a legally secure and non-discriminatory environment and to guarantee a fair level of protection for innovations, inventions and creations</p>
<p>Moreover, that will enhance access to markets both for European and Indian companies and enable India to increase its own innovative capacity and contribution to the global economy.</p>
<p>An important element to keep in mind in this context is the role that India plays as a key provider of generic medicines to the developing world. The EU will therefore make sure that the IPR provisions in the FTA are balanced and that they would in no way hamper access to affordable medicines in India and in other developing countries. Effective IPR protection and access to medicines can, and should, be mutually supportive.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, in the interest of both the EU and India to secure a sound and balanced IP environment which will foster growth, facilitate business and create jobs in both our economies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000072"></a>

<p>The safety of sweeteners - and aspartame in particular - are kept under regular review by EFSA.

<p>(FR) Helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make better use of the opportunities offered by the Single Market is one of the basic principles of the ‘Small Business Act’ for Europe (SBA). This will remain one of the areas of priority action in the revision of the SBA, adopted on 23 February 2011. In addition, the ‘Innovation Union’ is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy. In its Communication of 6 October 2010<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission put forward a package of measures designed to ensure better exploitation of innovative ideas on the market, such as the creation of a single innovation market and support for industries with great creative potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, one of the most effective ways of supporting the activity of innovative enterprises is to improve their access to financing. Over the period 2007-2010, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), through its strand on facilitating access to venture capital for enterprises with great innovation potential, resulted in investments in 129 fast growing enterprises with a leverage effect equivalent to seven times the contribution of the EU budget. What is more, thanks to the JEREMIE initiative, the Structural Funds also contribute to the financing of SMEs with innovation potential.</p>
<p>Firstly, through their participation in the Seventh Framework Programme, SMEs themselves are able to create their own network in order to gain easier access to the international market and to cooperate more effectively with other innovative players. Secondly, 20 000 SMEs are able to benefit from direct support amounting to EUR 5 billion.</p>
<p>For the period 2014-2020, the Commission has set itself the objective of putting in place financial instruments to attract a major increase in private finance and close the market gaps in investing in research and innovation. Contributions from the EU budget should create a major leverage effect and expand on the success of FP7 and CIP. The Commission will work with the European Investment Bank Group, national financial intermediaries and private investors in order, first, to invest in knowledge transfer and start-ups, second, to provide venture capital for fast growing firms expanding on EU and global markets and, third, to grant loans for innovative SMEs.</p>
<p>In this context, it should also be recalled that, on 9 February 2011, the Commission published a Green Paper on the Common Strategic Framework: ‘From Challenges to Opportunities: Towards a Common Strategic Framework for EU Research and Innovation funding’<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Until 20 May 2011, the Commission is inviting stakeholders wishing to present their observations to participate in a public consultation on this issue at: http://ec.europa.eu/research/csfri/index_en.cfm#" .</p>
<p>Other lines of action aim to establish stronger links between innovative enterprises and suitable investors at transnational level and to enable venture capital funds established in any given Member State to operate and invest freely throughout the EU by 2012. Furthermore, in the context of the SME Finance Forum, the Commission will address, among other things, the specific funding problems faced by small innovative companies.</p>
<p>The new Single Market Act also recognises the need to create an environment in which SMEs can flourish. Specific actions to improve SME access to capital markets and to simplify the administrative environment have been proposed.</p>
<p>What is more, the Commission intends to make information and support services better known to SMEs so as to facilitate access to cross-border trade activities. The existing networks and instruments such as Enterprise Europe Network, Solvit, Your Europe Business Portal, and the Small Business Portal will be mobilised for this purpose.</p>
<p>A communication to strengthen support for SMEs on markets outside the EU is planned for the fourth quarter of 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The seized family members were incarcerated in conditions of inhumane squalor until the targeted women agreed, under severe emotional duress, to attend a medical centre to undergo ‘remedial surgery’ – a euphemism for forced sterilisation.

<p>(EN) As regards the navigability and optimisation of traffic, the Commission supports the development and deployment of River Information Services which provide enhanced information to the skippers and the authorities ashore with respect to navigability of the waterway and traffic management purposes.</p>
<p>The Communication on the European Union Strategy for the Danube Region<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> states the following: ‘Remove existing navigability bottlenecks on the river as to accommodate type VI b vessels all year round by 2015’. Type VI b vessels refers to the international classification of European Inland Waterways by UNECE<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and means ‘pushed convoys with one push boat and four barges’. This is the prevailing vessel formation on the Danube. For most of the Danube, the river is accommodating to VI b vessels.</p>
<p>The same document states: ‘the Commission strongly believes that setting targets is essential, to focus and prioritise efforts’. These targets are now being further developed with Member States and stakeholders and shall be finalised before the European Council in June 2011. Consequently, the targets which were included in the document play the role of examples. In the specific case of the navigability target the honourable Member refers to, the Commission has already opened extensive discussions with the concerned partner countries in order to provide a more flexible approach, as also requested by the ‘Joint Statement on Guiding Principles for the Development of Inland Navigation and Environmental Protection in the Danube River Basin’, to the specific situations like that in the section of Straubing-Vilshofen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the measures to remove these bottlenecks have to be assessed in an Environmental Impact Assessment according to the natural characteristics of the stretch, its morphology and hydrology. Solutions for improved navigability will have to be reconciled with other objectives, such as the achievement of good water status, and the reduction of water continuity interruptions for fish migration. This is reflected in the Communication and Action Plan on the European Union Strategy for the Danube Region.</p>
<p>For this specific stretch, Straubing-Vilshofen, a study is currently being carried out, with the support of the Commission, which will form the basis for any further decisions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
