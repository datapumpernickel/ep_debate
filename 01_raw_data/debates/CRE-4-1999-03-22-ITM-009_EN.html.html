It involves extending the existing system for the current year and, at the same time, establishing a band – between 15 and 25 % – within which the standard rate must fall.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues are well aware of the recent developments – significant ones – concerning taxation: there have been various proposals to coordinate the Member States' taxation systems with a view to abolishing harmful fiscal competition and, on the other hand, allowing healthy fiscal competition to take full effect. However, alongside this much‐needed coordination – which, as I said, has already occurred to some extent – other measures, by their very nature, require fully‐fledged harmonisation to allow the internal market to operate smoothly. In the action plan for the single market presented at the Amsterdam European Council almost two years ago, the Commission pointed to the need to work towards a common system of taxation in the area of VAT, which would eventually replace the current transitional system, while at the same time modernising and simplifying it.</p>
<p class="contents">A three‐stage approach has been agreed: this will involve measures to correct the distortions in the present VAT system, modernising the current system by extending it to new leading‐edge services and, of crucial importance, establishing the definitive VAT system by adopting the ‘country of origin' principle. This approach will allow existing procedures to be simplified and will reduce red tape for national administrations and firms, while helping to resolve the serious problem of fraud in the Community. It should also bring benefits for citizens and consumers, because greater transparency and competition between the systems of the various Member States will bring about convergence towards more acceptable levels of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">But since, as a result of delays, we are still awaiting the definitive system, a directive such as the one now before us is required for the current year, 1999. Basically, the proposed directive extends the present system for one year and sets a band – between 15 and 25 % – within which the standard rate must fall. I believe that we are bound to accept this request, even though it is already belated, given that we are now at the end of March.</p>
<p class="contents">While coming out in favour of the Commission's proposal, Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wishes to take this opportunity to emphasise the urgent need to adopt the definitive VAT system. The committee has put forward an amendment on this point, stressing that in one sense this is the final extension, and at the same time calling for the definitive system to enter into force on 1 January next year. A second amendment, which I have tabled on behalf of my group, reformulates this concept as a recital, adding that the present system – the one providing the transition to the definitive system, as it were – has a whole series of drawbacks, including the ones briefly listed in my explanatory statement.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these amendments will be taken up by Parliament and viewed by the Commission as an incentive to proceed towards the definitive system, which is talked about so much but seems to be some kind of remote and increasingly unattainable dream.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Paasilinna </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the points the rapporteur, Mr Secchi, makes in his well‐informed report. The Commission"s proposal which forms the background to his report deals with the harmonisation of value added tax in the Member States and is an attempt to make up for the delay in reform. This is an important issue, which is being hampered by the fact that Union"s decision‐making machine is not working. The rapporteur is quite rightly firm about extending the period of transition currently in force. The reform of the VAT system must be brought to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal is largely a technical one, but the subject in itself is mainly political. The relationship in principle between indirect and direct taxation and the idea of goods and services as a source of indirect taxation are linked to the question of social fairness. Switching the focus of taxation to indirect taxes hampers progressive taxation, and it is through progressive taxation that the income gap will narrow. While the Union is involved in the process of harmonising tax policy we should not ignore this important social tool.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what we are discussing here is indirect taxation. At least as far as food is concerned, the harmonisation of VAT in the Union would ease the situation in Finland, for example, where the VAT rate on food is, at 17 %, currently about 10 % higher than the EU average. Lowering the VAT rate on food would improve prospects for employment through support to the food industry. Consumers would gradually turn their attention more to processed foods. It is also a question of social fairness. The smaller a person"s income, the more indirect taxation takes, in relative terms, from that income. Lightening the tax burden on food would make an immediate difference to how much money people had in their pocket.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the level of VAT in the production of services is one of the key issues of tax policy. From the point of view of employment, high levels of taxation on services and consumption have hindered growth and, consequently, prospects for employment. It is a sort of phenomenon of suffocation. We therefore have to lighten the VAT burden on the labour‐intensive service industries. However, a certain degree of harmonisation of the standard VAT rate is inevitable. We can make a virtue of this inevitability, though, by tying the lightening of the tax burden to policy on employment and growth. Easing the VAT burden on food and services would therefore lend support to this policy.</p>

But we are not just here to keep Mr Secchi company while he presents his report on the common system of value added tax. It is not only the hour that is late: this amendment to Directive 77/388 was supposed to come into effect on 1 January this year and to remain in force until the end of the year. The Council has also been tardy in taking all the decisions necessary for the changeover to the definitive VAT system, which is supposed to come into force as from 1 January 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are here at this late hour, to support the rapporteur in stressing the urgent need for universal adoption of the country of origin principle, to cut down on red tape, to facilitate commercial activity, to combat tax evasion and to reform indirect taxation with a view to total transparency. Although the single market is operational, it has still not been completed, and here and in other areas there are signs of distortion of competition. The introduction of the single currency and the disappearance of exchange rate competition between the various Member States has exacerbated the market disturbances caused by tax competition. Whether you call it tax coordination or tax harmonisation, there is a set of measures that needs to be jointly adopted for all fifteen tax systems in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking here today quite simply about defining a band of between 15 % and 25 % as the range for the normal minimum and maximum VAT rates to be applied by Member States. However, the scope for applying reduced rates will have to be reviewed in the near future, because of the distortions in competition it causes between certain geographical areas and between certain products and services, whether it be between Belgium and Austria or between Portugal and Spain. VAT, which is an intrinsically neutral tax, has ended up being a factor influencing company locations and trade flows. This harmonisation of rates and this changeover from the transitional system to the definitive system demands courage and sacrifices of all the Member States if we are to achieve closer alignment of national tax systems, even if this is phased in under a timetable. Unless we can end fiscal chauvinism, the single market and economic and monetary union themselves will remain weak and incomplete.</p>

This is all about whether the Union can summon up the strength to discuss or regulate properly the conditions of competition in the single market and to eliminate the opportunities for both tax evasion and distortion of competition that exist in the realm of value added tax under the recipient‐country principle. That is indeed a crucial requirement. I can fully endorse what the previous speakers have said on that point. This is really the political point of the Secchi report. I do not think we should labour under the illusion that it will be easy to meet this target of 1 January 2000. But it is right for us as a Parliament to put this demand on the bargaining table again. That way, there is a chance that at least the fundamental principle will have been accepted by the target date.</p>

Anything along those lines is certainly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some of the underlying ideas are much more worrying. First of all, the determination to constantly regulate and increasingly limit the Member States" scope for independent action is tantamount to reducing the fiscal sovereignty of the various nations that make up the European Union. In our opinion, this amounts to a body‐blow for fiscal democracy, in that decisions taken at the level closest to the public are becoming increasingly subordinated to decisions taken at more remote levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following the introduction of the euro, we should certainly be concerned about the possibility of short‐term asymmetric shocks, since the Member States have fewer and fewer options open to them for regulating their economies. In the event of inflation, for example, if all taxation is harmonised, each country can no longer have its own monetary policy or apply its own fiscal policy. All that is left is wages and incomes policy, and that really represents excessive state control.</p>
<p class="contents">The choices that have been made keep VAT rates extremely high, with the standard rate planned at 15 to 25 %. Why not under 15 %? The VAT differential between the European Union, the United States and Japan is still huge, and is probably one of the things that is to blame for Europe"s unemployment rate, which is much higher than in the other two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why although this report is extremely good in the context of the current approach, we are not happy with it and we reject its recommendations on principle.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, the European Parliament and the amendments which it has proposed reaffirm its support for the movement towards a new common VAT system. The Commission entirely supports the stated objectives. Nevertheless, the adoption of a final VAT system by the Council between now and December 1999, I am afraid, does not appear to be realistic. Indeed, in its programme the Commission had sketched the broad outline of the VAT system envisaged for the future as well as a timetable based on a gradual approach for the presentation of specific proposals. This programme proposed three main headings: modernisation, the simplification of the current system and the change of the place of taxation. The Commission has already submitted several proposals, currently on the Council table, which cover simplification and the modernisation of the current arrangement specifically with a view to meeting operators' immediate expectations, that is to say, the transposition of the recommendations for the Slim II exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are essential to progress towards the final VAT regime. Indeed, the passage from non‐harmonisation to complete harmonisation, if it is to take place at all, can only be achieved in stages; and the proposal on the standard rate falls within this context. The Council, however, does not show any readiness to follow the Commission's proposals, preferring to maintain the <span class="italic">status quo</span> , which does not go in the desired direction of greater alignment of VAT rates. Nevertheless, the Commission's view is that general simplification of the current VAT system cannot be achieved without radically amending the current complex rules especially those relating to the place of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the improvements to the current VAT system constitute an essential phase for the passage to a new system which envisages a single place of taxation, the only way of ensuring the radical simplification of the VAT system demanded by European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that at the moment the proposals currently on the table of the Council, with a view to simplifying the system and to ensure more uniform application of the tax, are at an impasse while the European Parliament of course has supported then unconditionally.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you therefore for the support that you have given to this proposal and more particularly, the objective being pursued by the Commission, that of the definitive VAT system.</p>
