These two reports present the European Parliament with a heavy responsibility: promoting the liberalisation of international goods transport by rail.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission directives, to which these reports refer, contain no more than technical provisions and do not recommend this solution. In the Council, the governments of the Member States are divided on this issue. Moreover, the railway workers, their unions and the European Trade Union Confederation expressed their opposition to such an approach through a European day of action and strikes, which was widely respected, and during talks with each of the two rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I call on Parliament not to go down this road and to refer these two reports back to committee.</p>

I should like to make the following quite clear: firstly, rail freight has been declining for years, as has employment in the sector. That is why it is absolutely essential and high time to reform the railways. That is the idea behind my own and Mr Sarlis"s reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is unfortunate that the Commission rejected some of our points yesterday. That is why it is also high time to explain our point of view clearly to the Commission. We are not calling for unlimited, broad‐brush liberalisation; we are calling for a sensible approach towards giving the railways more of a European dimension. We have to achieve this, and that is why I really do ask that we put this to the vote today. We have discussed it at length in the committee; Mrs Moreau was the only one to vote against. That is why it is important for us to vote today.</p>

<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam includes the concept of general interest services. In a field such as rail transport, it is clear that this concept must take precedence over a liberalisation of rail transport services. Yet today we have no framework directive that defines what a general interest service actually is.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is impossible to liberalise this key sector or open it up to competition. Indeed, it is a sector in which, as Mrs Moreau said, workers are very active in defending not just their jobs but also the general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is premature to discuss this subject before we have a framework directive on general interest services. Like Mrs Moreau, I would also ask that this report be referred back to committee.</p>

Today Parliament must vote on both of these reports. The majority opinion of all the groups in this House is that the issue of the gradual liberalisation of rail transport must at last move forward. I repeat that, at this stage, we are talking about gradual liberalisation only in respect of the transport of goods. We have been debating this matter in the European Parliament since January 1998, when we adopted a special resolution in which we said that we wanted to go forward with gradual liberalisation. The majority opinion, if not the unanimous opinion, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism led to the findings that we are putting before the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say that since 1970 there has been a Commission directive which calls for partial liberalisation. Nothing has been done in the 27 years since then, while we have liberalised sea transport, air transport and road transport. We must now move forward and show the Council and the Commission what we can achieve.</p>

The scope of the report is limited to the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The North Sea has a highly productive system in comparison to the Atlantic. The total biomass of all the fish species present in the North Sea is estimated at approximately 10 million tonnes. The annual fish catch is around 2.5 million tonnes. It is estimated that the main species of predatory fish consume a similar quantity every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Commercially, the most important catches are sand eel (38 %), herring (13 %), Norway pout (10 %), sole, haddock, saithe, whiting (8 %), sprat (7 %), horse mackerel (4 %) and plaice (3 %).</p>
<p class="contents">The North Sea conference in Bergen established nine priorities: the reconstitution and maintenance of the reproductive biomass; a reduction in the capacity of the fishing fleet and/or fishing; the protection of juvenile fish, crustaceans and molluscs; the protection of species and habitats; protection against activities other than fishing; control and implementation; scientific, technological and economic consequences; information and participation; and greater integration of fisheries and environmental policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of these conclusions is therefore particularly wide and may have consequences for Europe"s fishermen as a whole, to the extent that they affect elements of the common fisheries policy, such as the TACs, quotas, the reduction in the capacity of the fishing fleet, net size and technical fishing measures.</p>

<p class="contents">During the last part‐session, we adopted an own‐initiative report on the regionalisation of the CFP which introduced certain notions that we believed were open to criticism. In fact, rather than seeing the North Sea as a regional entity, in terms of a production pool, the principle adopted was that of regionalisation based on territorial administrative regions. The report on the Bergen conference that we are considering today clearly shows that the European Parliament"s approach is unrealistic, especially if we include the zone"s extension from 12 nautical miles to 24. To my great surprise, this latter provision was adopted by certain French Members, despite the fact that it would have the effect of banning access by French fishermen to certain essential fishing areas to which they currently have access.</p>

That is why we are backing the amendment tabled by the rapporteur, who rejects the Commission's suggestion to revise and amend the guidelines by producing new White Papers.</p>
<p class="contents">We simply cannot accept the proposal that only those seaports with an annual goods turnover of at least 1.5 million tonnes can be considered as interconnection points for developing intermodal transport. We are voting against this amendment as it will most likely be detrimental to the seaports in my country and elsewhere, condemning them to isolation and cutting them off from funding that would enable them to create intermodal systems and establish satisfactory links with the major transport networks. It would prevent them from developing on an equal footing with the others.</p>
<p class="contents">Proposals to extend those same criteria to seaports in the ultraperipheral regions are doubly unacceptable. They would affect, for example, the seaport of Ponta Delgada in the Azores.</p>

For the internal market to operate efficiently and to ensure that all regions within the EU can compete on a competitive basis then the completion of the trans‐European transport network must be made a priority for all national EU governments.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is clear that European Community financing does not meet the requirements and challenges to complete trans‐European transport networks despite the beneficial effect that such investments have in developing local and national economies. It is clear that the development of such networks will create a higher number of jobs as well as put in place infrastructural projects which could improve the economic competitiveness and productivity of particular regional economies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission commissioned a report on the issue of whether public/private sector partnerships should be given a role in the development of trans‐European transport network projects within the European Union as envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty. This report concluded that public/private partnerships would be an integral part of such developments. The European Commission has now, quite rightly, invited Member States to identify specific projects which will be suitable for the public/private partnership approach. Member States are invited to involve the private sector as soon as possible in the development of such infrastructural projects.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, I welcome on a broader level the initiative of the Irish Government which has sought to give private firms the opportunity to fund major public projects under the partnership approach within the workings of the Irish economy. We must be realistic about the state of play of European Structural Fund receipts for Ireland after the conclusion of the next Community Support Framework. In the year 2006, Ireland will be receiving only 20 % of its present allocation of EU structural funds. The Irish Government must be innovative and proactive in devising new ways of compensating for the reduction of EU regional and cohesion fund monies.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the opportunity given to the private sector to have a tangible role in addressing how best public project initiatives and programmes which have previously been funded by EU monies can, in the future, be funded by the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission Neil Kinnock has already noted the role that the private sector can play in the transport sector. Representatives of Irish and European businesses from the economic and social sectors which will be receiving a shortfall in EU structural funds should take the opportunities being afforded to them to see how best they can enter into partnership with the state for the development of their respective regions.</p>

<p class="contents">The report by my colleague Mr Piecyk forgets that a port can only exist as part of an overall maritime chain, that is, repair, construction and trade itself. Yet these three activities have been progressively separated to each die a slow death. A good example of this is the independent port of Le Havre. This is a jewel among French shipyards. It was where some of the greatest ships were built, such as the ‘France" and the ‘Club Med 2' – a superb cruise ship with five masts, 134 metres long, with sails measuring 2 000 m<span class="sup">2</span> , and steered by computer – as well as oceanographic vessels, cable ships, ferries and, above all, liners.</p>
<p class="contents">But now that is all over. Already dealt a blow in 1979 by the sale of the liner ‘France", the town, with its 30 years of communist management and CGT co‐management, has just lost its port which will be shutting down in two years" time. On 9 November, the European Commission deemed illegal the FRF 1.8 thousand million in aid granted by the French Government to Le Havre"s workshops and shipyards, demanding that it be returned in accordance with the rules of competition. Anybody taking over the port would therefore have to pay this back. As you can imagine, there have been no takers.</p>
<p class="contents">After having destroyed our agriculture and our farmers, our public services, our textile industry, our mines and coal industry, as well as our merchant navy, Brussels has now turned to our ports and our shipbuilding industries. Brussels is refusing to adopt a policy of European preference in the building and repair of ships flying a national flag. Brussels is banning all state aid and subsidies aimed at bailing out companies. Brussels is forcing any company that takes over a firm that has received aid to pay back all the public funds received. Brussels is opening up our ports and shipyards to competition from those with cheaper labour costs. Enough is enough; there is no doubt that this sector is going to die a slow and painful death.</p>
<p class="contents">We refuse to accept this. That is why the National Front proposes a fundamental reform of the sector, a reform of the tax system for shipowners and investments in port infrastructures. We must encourage maritime investment, either through direct aid or fiscal measures. We must protect the industrial know‐how of our highly skilled workers and re‐introduce Community preference for the use, construction and repair of boats flying a national flag – as the United States did long ago – while penalising by means of compensatory taxes those vessels that fail to respect these preferential measures. With its moves towards free trade and deregulation, Brussels is trying to drown our seafarers, eliminate our workers and sink our ports. We must resist such measures.</p>

This is also an important area of cooperation between the Member States and the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">We believe that the Commission"s proposal is of note in terms of both its structure and the approach adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of structure, it is wise to include inland ports and intermodal terminals together with sea ports given that there is a close relationship between sea ports and the interconnection points which are situated inland, and this allows intermodal transport to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the Commission"s approach, it would seem necessary – while naturally respecting the principle of subsidiarity – to better integrate the interconnection points by including in the guidelines specific references to the interconnection points, by identifying them and by introducing new or revised specifications for projects of common interest.</p>

For the time being the report deals with the liberalisation of international goods transport, but there is no doubt that the aim is also to liberalise passenger transport, both domestic and international.</p>
<p class="contents">It opens up the possibility for any entity, person or group, not necessarily with previous experience of or links with the rail sector, to gain access to a business, regardless of their national origin and the Member State in which they are applying. That business would enable them to use infrastructures built with state money and gain access to profitable parts of the rail network, while maintenance costs – in other words, the unprofitable aspect – would generally remain in state hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of investing in improving the quality of public services in the various countries, linking up regions nationally and internationally – a vital task up to now and one that should continue – instead of accepting the need to modernise and rationalise the management of the railways in general in order to serve communities, instead of considering the very positive experience we have had of cooperation between public services, instead of improving the conditions of competition with other forms of transport, we are opting for unacceptable liberalisation, the consequences of which can only harm the sector as a whole.</p>

<p class="contents">A number of key ideas were set out in the document. The important thing at that time was to implement an ambitious and quality programme for national rail companies which were often in debt.</p>
<p class="contents">A year later, we are calling for the same thing: liberalisation of Europe"s railways for international freight transport, then progressively for national goods transport and for international passengers. The gradual extension we are calling for is getting off to a very timid start. Revitalisation is more necessary now than ever before and the only way to achieve it is by extending the laws of the free market to this vital area of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our networks are finding it very difficult to move to a European scale. The interconnection of existing networks poses both material and legal problems. The grand axes are not being extended and free access to rail infrastructures is not always fully applied in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Our national rail companies – together with our respective governments – are finding it very difficult to distinguish between managing transport infrastructures and operating railways.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore still need to plan new measures and to define additional approaches to complement the existing provisions. The ones I see as most necessary are flexible management that is better adapted to customers and open competition in a free market.</p>

What is its aim? Essentially, it is designed to divide up the railway market and thereby speed up the move towards the liberalisation of goods transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept this under the present circumstances. Why seek at any price to redefine Directive 91/440 without even agreeing to first assess it? Between 1985 and 1995, 500 000 jobs were lost in this sector. How can we possibly believe that the Commission"s proposal to liberalise the market will provide an effective solution for the railway sector? We are not fierce opponents of the concept of liberalisation when it is well measured and well considered. But in this case it is a matter of advocating blind competition, of opening up the lines to organisations other than the railway companies. And what about passenger safety? What are going to be the respective responsibilities of these newcomers and the railway companies?</p>
<p class="contents">The rail sector needs new impetus and we must encourage what is already taking place, namely, cooperation between national networks. With the help of the reports submitted for our scrutiny, the Commission is giving a free hand to the implosion of this sector, and that is something we cannot accept.</p>

While not denying the solid work done by Pavlos Sarlis and Hannes Swoboda, I strongly oppose the Commission"s desire to impose a uniform liberal system on the railway sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for us to question the forced march of the British towards the complete deregulation of their rail network, but the experience has clearly been a failure, from the point of view of both the consumers and the operators. For the former, this privatisation has not led to the improvements previously heralded. For the latter, the initial birth of several operators is now giving way to the reconcentration of the sector in the hands of a single company.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I accept that certain services cannot be run by the public sector alone, I believe that in the case of rail transport, only the public sector can absorb the costs of this operation which directly affects large numbers of people, falls within the scope of town and country planning and has many consequences for the environment. When it comes to freight transport and the transport of certain sensitive goods in particular, the public sector is best placed to guarantee safety due to its status and its ethics.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposals submitted to us, which threaten to dismantle the very nature of universal service, forget two things. The first is that the government will have to bear the cost of infrastructure investments, which means that it is the tax‐payer who will initially pay. The second is that if the operator is going to be able to satisfy its shareholders, it is going to have to make a profit. We are therefore deluding ourselves if we believe that the consumer will see any reduction in fares. On the contrary, he will often pay more as a result of higher fares. These arguments may perhaps cause some people to smile. But I believe that they cannot simply be brushed aside.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore vote against these two reports and would call on the Commission to put forward new proposals that are more realistic. There must be no more cursory deregulation.</p>

<p class="contents">As our rapporteur pointed out, the European Parliament"s wish, as expressed in its resolution of 13 January 1998, is indeed to achieve the widest possible liberalisation of rail transport, even if this should take place in successive stages.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very unfortunate that the Commission is making no proposals to this effect. The liberalisation of rail transport principally rests on two pillars, which must be acted on as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the need to institutionally separate the business of operating rail services from that of maintaining railway infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the need to open up access to national networks under fair conditions and to grant the right of transit to new operators in order to allow them to face their competitors on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, our rapporteur"s amendments go in the right direction and are perfectly in keeping with the route outlined by Parliament. Liberalisation must not of course result in reduced safety for railway users. On the contrary, the very highest levels of passenger safety must be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential – and on this point I totally agree with the rapporteur – that those who manage the rail infrastructures take responsibility for operating and supervising the safety systems.</p>

Today"s debate is therefore very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">There is indeed a very real need to revitalise rail transport in Europe, and goods transport in particular. Among other things, rail transport can reduce the nuisance caused by road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">But ideology – I would not go so far as to say dogmatism or excess – must not result in a total disruption of the rail sector. I am thinking in particular of the desire for liberalisation, as proposed or sought by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the extent to which the Commission is committed to the virtues of competition. But in this instance, excessive development of intermodal competition would most certainly prove damaging to the rail sector as a whole. That does not mean that nothing should be done, that the status quo is a solution. On the contrary, we should prepare the rail sector to face its own future. That is why the market may be opened up, but progressively and between equals who must bear the same responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions relating to authorised candidates, which provide simple intermediaries with the power to reserve capacities, are a threat to the railways. They actually introduce discrimination between the players: rail undertakings would continue to bear investment costs, and often the debts of the past, while being relegated to the role of a sub‐contractor vis‐à‐vis these new intermediaries, which would be free to select the most profitable market segments. If the Member States want to allow companies other than rail undertakings to reserve rail capacities, then let them do so by means of their national legislation. They do not need the authorisation of a directive.</p>

That is why it must be developed, modernised and adapted commercially to stand up to the fierce competition from the road network.</p>
<p class="contents">The decline of railways over recent years, and goods transport in particular, is very evident. Faced with this situation, European policy has been to liberalise the railways. Since the early 1990s, a whole series of first generation directives have contributed to this. Some of these have yet to be fully transposed into the legislation of all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Before moving any further in this direction we must therefore take stock of the present situation and assess the effectiveness of the decisions taken to liberalise and internally reorganise public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the Commission is already seeking to take liberalisation even further and to totally open up goods transport by rail to competition, when liberalisation has to date been limited to combined transport. The Commission believes that logistics companies should also have access to railway infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Railways must clearly be made more competitive in comparison to roads. Their very survival depends on this. However, to totally open up the railways to competition risks dismantling the public service, not to mention the fact that the system established by the directives to allocate rail infrastructure capacities is both costly and bureaucratic. Those in charge must be independent of the railway company, and there must be a supervisory body to control all elements.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore share the opinion of Mr Wibe, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, when he states that ‘The cost of increased administrative burden in the Member States could easily outweigh the benefits in terms of increased efficiency".</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I am voting against the Sarlis and Swoboda reports.</p>

The two rapporteurs should be congratulated on their excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">These directives are a step in the right direction. After having liberalised air transport and the gas and electricity market, the European Union could not ignore the railways for much longer. Rail transport, which is very frequently used in Europe, has been experiencing a serious crisis for some years. After having tried planned methods – nationalisation of railway undertakings, public status for employees, inflexibility within the market, significant deficits, and so on – which proved catastrophic in the Member States as a whole, the only way to now revitalise the railways is through liberalisation and a return to the market realities. In this respect, some Member States have been able to react quicker than others and we must draw inspiration from the successful experiences in each of the Union"s Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe"s consumers are demanding when it comes to both safety and also quality, particularly in terms of delays, prices, services, and so on. Over recent years they have tended to move away from this form of transport. Today we must give rail the means to regain a potentially large customer base.</p>
<p class="contents">This liberalisation must naturally be progressive and take place in stages, as our two rapporteurs have indicated. The railways are a form of transport for the future for passengers and goods. But there is more to it than that. Rail transport makes a major contribution to town and country planning and plays a very important role in rural and isolated regions, for example. Moreover, in the fight against air pollution, rail – and the combined transport of goods in particular – is a political choice that we have always defended.</p>

<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty refers to general interest services but there is in fact no directive that defines its framework or guarantees the logic of public service, namely, equal access by people and territories to rail transport infrastructures and services on the one hand, and the adjustment of costs that guarantees the right to transport and movement on the other. In the absence of such a framework, liberalisation is dangerous even if it is gradual. It will increase the inequalities between the regions and the people of Europe, dismantle public services and, in most cases, be accompanied by a deterioration of social conditions for the workers in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe"s trade unions representing the rail transport sector were right to express their opposition to this plan. Unfortunately, the areas that have already been liberalised have experienced a deterioration in the service to users, particularly the more modest of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be voting against the Sarlis and Swoboda reports and the related proposals for a directive.</p>

<p class="contents">That being so, the sine qua non for those attractive conditions to exist must be modern infrastructures, and these can hardly be expected to exist in a country like mine where, for decades, nobody believed in trains and road transport won a huge advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">The railways have to be seen as a means of transport that is closely linked to others, since that is the only way to guarantee users satisfactory services and to ensure that all means of transport achieve maximum profitability. For example, to take an issue in the news at the moment, it is inconceivable that a new airport is being built that will not be served directly by a major rail link, thus, incredibly, making access for over 10 million passengers a year possible only by road.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is at stake here is not only the existence of railway lines, however modern. It is equally vital to have a regular rail service, one that can only be provided by intercity rail links linking conurbations that have several million inhabitants. Otherwise, in the case of a thinly populated hinterland near an airport, we inevitably fall into the vicious circle of laying on fewer trains because of the lack of demand (only or nearly only airport users), which then puts people off using the trains because they are so infrequent (after all, nobody wants to wait an hour for a train after a one and a half hour flight).</p>

<p class="contents">The railways are an environmentally friendly transport system for goods and passengers which have a promising future, but whose potential is not being exploited adequately at present. For it to be possible to take full advantage of this potential in the short term, far‐reaching reforms need to be set in motion today. There is no avoiding partial liberalisation in the railway sector. Firstly, however, liberalisation is not the same as privatisation and, secondly, this partial liberalisation will be introduced progressively and with due consideration of the social aspects. In this way, the ground will be prepared for developing the railways into an efficient and reliable mode of transport for the future – not least in Luxembourg, in the centre of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European People"s Party and its Luxembourg members will ensure that this process of liberalisation in the railway sector is not half‐hearted, but balanced and objective‐driven. Make no mistake: this is about the survival of the railways. Action is needed now.</p>

<p class="contents">Although I too believe that going back to the railway policies of the past is no longer an option, as a politician and trade unionist the various strategies for moving towards greater liberalisation fill me with fear for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the heritage of a hundred years is being broken into pieces here, and we do need to ask ourselves whether the Commission"s policy – which always sees the liberalisation of the national and international economy as the only answer – is the right one, because where this policy leads is best illustrated by the example of a country with a highly developed rail system, such as Germany. There is simply no end to the series of train accidents there; this shows that making savings in the wrong place can be rather expensive and, even worse, that the staffing cuts which the railway companies have been forced to make are being made at the expense of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Luxembourg was one of the countries which had the most to lose from a decline in rail traffic, it has held on to its railways, modernised them and downsized, in the only operation of its kind in Europe, and yet at the same time care was taken to ensure that no social hardship was suffered. And is all of this now supposed to have been in vain?</p>
<p class="contents">We are right to ask why directives such as Directive 91/440, which has not even been transposed in all the countries yet, should now be hastily amended and whipped through Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and why they have not been given a longer trial.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, it seems to me that the Commission has once again been too perfectionist. What is the point of having separate accounts for freight and passenger transport? Instead of simplifying matters, this is once again increasing bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there are proposals on the independent management of railway undertakings, on debt remission and the improved management of public finances, but at the same time the governments are reminded of their duty to guarantee access rights to international groupings for international rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of this, even at this early stage when the discussions have not even been concluded, the Commission is also being asked to take action on route pricing. Does that mean that in the not too distant future, prices on routes through Luxembourg are to be calculated on the basis of the cheapest supplier? If so, then some interesting pay negotiations are in store for the unions.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the impact of the new measures seems impossible to assess. But a desire to ensure optimal infrastructure use is not, on its own, sufficient to yield improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">The best example of this are the ‘freeways", which were announced with great ceremony. Large maps were unveiled showing 25 of these lines, only seven of which are in operation, however. And that too is only because the smallest railway company, the Luxembourg one, brought all its diplomatic skill to bear in the ‘<span class="italic">bureau unique</span> ". The various railway companies have proved here by their exemplary cooperation that they can achieve something across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether the Commission"s interfering in this way will improve matters, I have my doubts. In any case, I do welcome the fact that the majority of the European Parliament has spoken out in favour of a more moderate approach and is proposing that the new directives should be introduced progressively – and this in spite of the Commission"s negative stance.</p>

<p class="contents">These proposals retain the basic philosophy which underlies the liberalisation process and which is characterised by the separation of the provision and maintenance of infrastructure on the one hand and the provision of rail transport services on the other. In other words, public budgets are being asked to continue to bear the burden of infrastructure funding, while private railway undertakings are exploiting the capacity of the rail networks. The Commission, however, does not stop at that. It has decided that infrastructure managers who will operate along private lines may also be private undertakings, in the context, of course, of the more general move towards privatisation of infrastructure by means of the funding and exploitation of infrastructure by private capital. However, there are no safeguards for rail sector workers. On the contrary, large‐scale redundancies are being forecast and a regime of total flexibility in relation to the number and working conditions of rail sector workers is being promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports under debate go much further than the Commission proposals. They call for the liberalisation of international passenger and freight transport both within Member States and internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither the reports nor the package of proposals put forward by the Commission make any reference to the impact these measures will have on rail sector workers. The easier access private undertakings will have to infrastructure is preparing the ground for the privatisation of the profitable activities of public railway undertakings and the overhaul of labour relations. Furthermore, the bill that went through the Greek Parliament recently, which aims to bring Greek legislation into line with Community directives, is moving in the same direction and provides for the axing of thousands of jobs over the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of rail transport that is being put forward will not lead to the revitalisation of the railways, as has been hypocritically claimed, but it does jeopardise the notion of public service. Against this background we can look forward to further increased charges. As one of the rapporteurs put it, ‘the main reason why there are so few companies competing in railway operation is (...) that the profitability in railway operation is too low". Closing down unprofitable lines necessarily entails reducing rail networks, to the detriment of regional growth and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The repercussions we are already seeing in the other transport sectors that have undergone a process of liberalisation, our concerns for the fate of the public service, for the protection of the environment and regional growth, our diametric opposition to the practices of social dumping and to the policies aimed at overhauling labour relations, lead us to vote against these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling for a policy in the rail sector to support public undertakings and the development of the network so that it can meet the needs of the national economy, of rail users and of rail sector workers. We are calling on the Commission to withdraw its proposals and we are calling on the governments of the Member States to reject these proposals in Council. We hope that rail sector workers will make a concerted effort to overturn this unpopular policy, which promotes the profit‐making management of the railway to the detriment of transport safety and the rights of rail sector workers and rail users.</p>

<p class="contents">The railways play a tremendously important role in large and sparsely populated countries such as Sweden. For obvious reasons, certain sections of the railway network have never been profitable, but it is still essential for the traffic on them to be maintained if the main objective is to ensure that the whole country ‘lives".

How radiation from these appliances affects people's health in the short and long term is something we know very little about. One might say that we are guinea pigs in our own development. Nevertheless, we suspect that radiation can cause cancer, changes in the workings of the nervous and immune systems, cell activity and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions reached by the Commission and the committee of experts are clearly at odds with a large number of scientific publications, which have been ignored in the Commission's proposal. In its recommendation to the Member States, the Commission states that there is no convincing evidence to suggest that extremely low‐level magnetic fields cause genetic damage and that they are therefore unlikely to lead to the onset of cancer. In fact, it is not possible to make such an assertion when no one really knows the answers, and when there are others who take a different view. In this case, the precautionary principle must be applied. According to the World Health Organisation, it is not possible to guarantee that electromagnetic fields do not cause harm, and people are becoming increasingly concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy, Luxembourg and Sweden all have stricter provisions than those proposed by the Commission. We should be following this path too, until our knowledge is more complete. Therefore, the precautionary principle must be applied. We should lay down minimum safety distances from housing and workplaces for the siting of structures which generate electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely regret that we have not adopted all the amendments tabled by the Greens as well as by Mr Tamino, in particular those relating to safeguards and quality criteria for the long‐term effects of electromagnetic radiation.</p>

Generally speaking, the June Movement is a great supporter of applying the precautionary principle. However, we also think that the application of the precautionary principle should be critically assessed case by case. And in this case, we have come to the conclusion that the European Parliament should resist the desire for very restrictive recommendations in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In his work on the report, Mr Tamino wanted to take into account the possible long‐term effects of magnetic fields. This topic has attracted the interest of the general public for many years and has been the subject of intense research over the past 20 years. However, it has not been scientifically proven that there are health effects, such as the development of cancer, in the long term. At the moment, large‐scale research projects are being carried out to assess the significance of electromagnetic fields in the development of cancers, for example. We therefore believe that it is inappropriate to react to isolated studies, and that the EU should wait for the imminent completion of the WHO's major evaluation project, amongst others, before embarking on legislation dealing with possible long‐term effects. Research in this area, such as that carried out by the Anti‐Cancer Association in Denmark, is very extensive, and on the basis of the results of this research, we unfortunately cannot support Mr Tamino's very restrictive amendments. If the research results expected soon from the WHO and others provide supporting evidence, we would of course be glad to assist in legislation to protect people against possible long‐term effects. But until then, we will stand by the advice we have received from the Anti‐Cancer Association.</p>

<p class="contents">It is therefore essential that our decisions be accompanied by all the necessary scientific precautions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore share the views of our rapporteur. Protection measures must be regularly updated and reassessed in the light of the increase in our scientific knowledge and the patterns of usage of energy transport systems and types of device likely to increase the exposure of consumers and the population to electromagnetic fields. This is not to impede technological progress, but to optimise the benefits by constantly reducing the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current absence of a single Europe‐wide system for measuring the conformity of devices and the need to introduce a uniform control system which is not an obstacle to the single market, it is wise to call on the Commission to propose in the very near future a system to continuously review devices that generate magnetic fields which takes account of their relative intensity and the actual length of time they are used.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore support the proposal for a recommendation, as amended.</p>

The Commission's proposal gives rise to such a possibility, since it contains less stringent rules than those currently in force in Sweden; Italy and Luxembourg are in the same situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also like to say that we are most surprised that the Swedish Government, in the Council of Ministers, according to the minutes of 5 February, did not support Italy's demand for a tightening‐up of the rules relating to both the short‐term thermal effects and the long‐term risks, for example of cancer, which largely corresponds with the Tamino report. On the contrary, it seems that Sweden, in some instances, recommended a watering‐down of the Commission's text. We find this remarkable in the extreme.</p>

Scientists tell us – albeit still without total certainty – how hazardous both high and low‐frequency electromagnetic waves are to human health; and yet the Commission simply denies the existence of any such danger, thereby reneging on its duty pursuant to Article 130r of the Treaties to formulate policies to protect human health. And yet the people of Volturno cannot sleep at night because of the repeaters located above their heads.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's main aim is to safeguard the profits of its industrial overlords, and public health is an optional extra!</p>
<p class="contents">How can it refuse to define limits to protect consumers? Why not make it compulsory to label products, indicating the dangers deriving from electromagnetic waves and giving instructions for use? For example, why not label hair‐driers, explaining that it is safer to use them as far as possible from one's head? Or microwave ovens, simply advising people to stand a few metres away while they are in operation? Why not inform people that prolonged use of mobile phones could damage their brain cells? The very thought that the profits of telecommunications companies might be dented is a deadly sin to you, the priests of the god Market. We Italian Communists, on the other hand, consider public health to be paramount.</p>

The Commission has provided us with information on this. Some aspects of the approach adopted in the Needle report are good, but in other places it oversteps the mark. The fact that there are unsuccessful health policies in some Member States is no reason for shifting the responsibility to European level. That is why I have voted against the Needle report. We must use the little money we have in Europe for specific projects, and not distribute it here, there and everywhere.</p>

<p class="contents">Community public health policy needs to be somewhat adapted in line with new priorities and new structures. The serious ‘mad cow" crisis unfortunately brought home to us the importance of improving the information distributed when it comes to promoting public health. Collecting data on the health of the people of Europe is more useful today than it has ever been before. Disseminating the subsequent analyses has become essential, not only for the general public but also for the professionals who need to make changes to their national health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, we can promote and consolidate the activities of the Member States in the various fields and disseminate information on the best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not enough to merely provide information. We must also react quicker to health threats. Speed is a crucial factor in medicine and one which requires increased monitoring and the introduction of new forms of coordination within the Community. This would involve many fields: rare diseases, food safety, blood safety, ecological threats, the side effects of medicinal products, etcetera.</p>
<p class="contents">We could also give more consideration to the unique medical situations in each of the Member States and implement appropriate policies, particularly for problems such as drug addiction, cardio‐vascular diseases, nutritional problems, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore approve the Needle report due to the way in which it has been able to turn to good account the beneficial effects of the Maastricht Treaty in the crucial field of public health.</p>

<p class="contents">Community action is therefore justified, in so far as cross‐border aspects are concerned. Just as water or air pollution has consequences which are not confined to one Member State or another, similarly viruses, bacteria, microbes and other pathogens are not discouraged by national borders. Just as environmental policy has a cross‐border dimension, public health policy has a European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The need then is to distinguish clearly between what should and what should not be covered by Community action. The relevant articles here are Article 52 (formerly 129) on public health and Article 5 (formerly 39(b)) – plus a protocol and two declarations – on subsidiarity and proportionality. Both talk of <span class="italic">complementary</span> Community action consisting on the one hand of policy measures and on the other hand of cooperation by Member States and with third countries or international organisations. But Member States must fully discharge their ‘responsibilities... for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care". This means that the role of public health systems and the provision of medical services as such is not a <span class="italic">European</span> responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">When the rapporteur calls in paragraph 6 for ‘a prime objective of Community action to be focused on fostering equality in health", he is overstepping the boundaries not only of subsidiarity, but also the letter and spirit of the Treaty. Firstly, there is no legal basis for that kind of measure. Secondly, ‘equality in health" is not a Treaty objective. The Treaty speaks of ‘ensuring a high level of health protection". The Treaty also says that Community action must be directed towards the improvement of public health and the prevention of human diseases, in particular the major health scourges. So the stated aim is not maximum <span class="italic">equality</span> in public health, but as <span class="italic">high</span> a level of human health protection as is possible. And that kind of aspiration is dangerous, because equality is attained not only by raising poor standards but also by lowering good ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the rapporteur to withdraw the first part of paragraph 6 in order to avoid a split vote on this demand, which is meaningless in terms of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it could be said that a subsequent Treaty revision may address a problem of this kind. But we are not talking today about a mandate for an intergovernmental conference. The Commission says after all that its communication contains no new proposals for a new Community policy on public health. In the communication it notes ‘disturbing inequalities in health status between social classes", but makes no suggestions at all for remedying that state of affairs. Understandably so, since the Commission does not have a leg to stand on – legally or politically – when it comes to preventing and combating social inequality in European health.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not be reactionary. The Maastricht Treaty includes a separate title on public health, and the Court of Justice, with the Decker and Kohll judgments, has ruled on the Community dimension of certain social security services. So there is some leverage in favour of a European health policy. But we must not go too far and outrun or circumvent the Treaty. Rather than making plans for an intergovernmental conference even before the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified, we must first of all apply that Treaty in such a way that the European citizen above all benefits by it. It is his taxes which are being spent, and it is his health which is at issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">People expect cross‐border health hazards to be tackled effectively, and therefore at European level. Cross‐border health hazards have increased considerably as a result of trade and mobility – both recreational and occupational.</p>
<p class="contents">Food and food poisoning come from factors not only at home but also abroad. Thus BSE, salmonella, antibiotics and hormones threaten to invade our food and our bodies too. Health protection is therefore unquestionably an issue of consumer policy as well. And consumer policy, like public health, is a title in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Maastricht Treaty laid the basis for a European contribution to consumer and health protection. The Amsterdam Treaty has broadened and adapted that basis. So for the most part, we must make do with what we have.</p>

The Treaty of Amsterdam is therefore right in stating that a high level of health protection must be guaranteed when defining and implementing all the Community"s policies and actions that are likely to affect health, and in subsequently defining the role of the Member States in organising and supplying health services and medical care.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is so important that it may even be appropriate to set up a directorate‐general specifically responsible for managing the various aspects of public health policy, including questions relating to resources and health expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an area in which the principle of subsidiarity must be fully applied. There is therefore no question of the Union replacing the Member States in the field of health. Its role must be to support and complement the action of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am also of the opinion that in addition to the search for greater consistency with socio‐economic policies and programmes, Community action in the field of health must also make it a priority to actively promote real equality between people in terms of free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this objective it will be necessary to combat inequalities and fight for equal access to health care for all. We will also have to increase the scope for health professionals to improve their knowledge and practical skills, perhaps even by creating priority health areas. In addition, we must provide the population with better information on the inherent risks of their lifestyle and diet, while actively preventing the causes of illnesses.</p>

There clearly seems to be a danger that, in setting its sights so high, the Community believes that it should take over the Member States' responsibility, instead of merely complementing it. A telling example of this is to be found in the proposal to appoint a Commissioner and establish a directorate‐general with responsibility for health, which would encompass all aspects of public health policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be made abundantly clear that overall responsibility for people's health, including the political and economic aspects, rests with the various Member States. The European Union should perform a complementary role and not try to usurp the Member States' responsibility.</p>

<p class="contents">I support the report in so far as it sets out to improve public health. Cooperation between the Member States, and indeed worldwide, needs to be strengthened in order to improve the health of men, women and children. Nevertheless, the relevant legislation and its implementation should in the first instance be dealt with at national level. Minimum standards of care can be a way of resolving questions where a clear‐cut decision is difficult, but those countries with higher standards should be allowed to keep them.</p>
