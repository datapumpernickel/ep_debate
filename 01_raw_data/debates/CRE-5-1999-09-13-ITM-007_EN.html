<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, I rise as the rapporteur on the draft recommendation from the European Commission on the provision of minimum criteria for environmental inspections. The most important thing about my report is that I rejected the idea – and the Committee has backed me on this – that it should be a recommendation. I want to make sure that this instrument is in fact a directive. I am absolutely certain that the speech which Mr Marin is now anxiously looking through rejects what I am about to say.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very important point and underlies some of the disappointments that people feel about the European Union in many of our countries. It is based on the perception that we adopt legislation in the European Union which is then not implemented universally throughout the Member States of the European Union. I do not know about my MEP colleagues but certainly this was one of the criticisms made against the European Union during the British version of the European election campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a situation at the moment where there are currently more than eighty actions pending before the Court of Justice against eleven Member States for infringement of European Union environmental legislation. I know, as rapporteur on the recent directive on landfill, that what is happening is that the European Commission is proposing legislation on the basis that it will be adopted and properly implemented in all the Member States while at the same time the same directorate-general of the European Union knows full well that in some areas of policy no inspectorates at all exist able to see that that legislation is implemented in some Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s recipe for dealing with this is for inspectors from the various Member States to meet together from time to time to try to improve their techniques and to make that into a recommendation. There is nothing particularly radical about it at all. I and the members of the Environment Committee feel that this is grossly inadequate and that if it is not a directive there will in fact be no impulsion on the Member States which are currently lagging behind to do anything at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantage of transforming the recommendation into a directive is twofold. First of all it creates the momentum for changes to take place under the eventual sanction of financial penalties and secondly, by taking the proposed text of the recommendation, which we have before us as its base, avoids creating a directive which is too heavily prescriptive in detail. People want to see the legislation implemented. They do not want what they call ‘red tape’. This instrument, if transformed into a directive, would mean that we are able to see through the European Commission and through the Members of Parliament whether anybody is actually doing anything. The likelihood is that if we leave it as a recommendation somebody in five years time or so may or may not remember to report to the European Parliament that a recommendation was passed and that very little was done about it. A directive has legal force and we feel that is what is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that the Greens have proposed an amendment drawing attention to the opinion of the European Parliament that there should be some form of European Union environmental inspectorate. We have to tread very carefully here if we are not to tie up even more red tape around the Member States. It is much better, rather than going for a supranational environment inspectorate with all the difficulty about right of entry, if we have the legislation in place to make sure that the environmental inspectorates in all the Member States (a) exist and (b) are performing their tasks to more or less the same standard. You can only do that through a directorate. A recommendation is grossly inadequate.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is an important question. We have seen it happen, even if it is not the direct subject of this report, with the dioxin case. We can set up all the European directives, all the recommendations, all the laws that we want. If their application is not guaranteed by inspection, I believe that the grave doubts of our fellow citizens regarding European effectiveness and the value of these standards may well increase.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to establish control and inspection on a Community basis. Obviously, a fair balance between the responsibility of Member States and European intervention must be found. In this area, we support the request from Mrs Jackson not to limit ourselves to adopting recommendations, but to go on to the phase of an actual directive, which establishes precise criteria, which each of the Member States shall have to respect in its performance of inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support all the amendments, requesting the Commission to take note of the need to set strict frameworks. We have heard the new Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, whom we questioned on the matter of the effectiveness of laws. She stated the intention of the Commission to be stricter to ensure that, in the end, inspection is effective and its application strict. We therefore support adoption of the amendments by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, after the cases we have experienced with dioxin, we can clearly see the risk we face. We can progress in a reasonable and strict manner towards effective European inspection of Member States, within the framework of a European vision. But the second phase is the creation of European inspectors – I might call them super-inspectors – who will be able to check the proper performance of Member State inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not do this, when the first crisis comes along, given the lack of inspection in a Member State and the lack of a European principle on inspection, we shall resort to an independent agency which must be created in order to manage the question of food, for example, as we have seen when debating this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is not the correct response. The proper response is inspection, control, regulations, managed politically by the representative authorities of the Union, and in which the European Parliament must have entire responsibility. We therefore would request the Commission to heed the proposals of the Jackson report both to go on to issue a directive but, at the same time, to finally initiate a new phase as regards Community inspection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because people everywhere recognise that pollution knows no national boundaries and can only be tackled effectively by countries working together. To its great credit Europe has taken a lead in introducing legislation to protect the environment. But laws which are not enforced equally by all 15 Member States will be cynically ignored by those who seek financial gain at any cost and will generate a sense of injustice and eventually hostility in all those who play by the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">None of us, of course, have any reason to feel superior. No country has a perfect record when it comes to enforcing environmental legislation. This report takes us a positive step forward and shows Parliament at its best as a defender of the public interest. It emphasises our commitment to protecting our environment and applying equal procedures in each Member State. It greatly strengthens the Commission’s well-meaning but frankly insubstantial recommendations for inspection procedures which could not guarantee that improvements will actually take place and it provides for a detailed programme of action to make sure that existing laws are properly enforced within a realistic but tight timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">There are one or two sections in this report, as drafted, which I believe would benefit from some very minor amendments to tighten them up. I have tabled a couple and one of the delights about making a maiden speech in this House is that one has the feeling that those words might actually be studied for their merits rather than simply judged on their party political background. The real substance of this report and my concern is as raised by Mrs Jackson, that the Commission may not give its support to these proposals. I congratulate Mrs Jackson on the work she has undertaken. I believe strongly that this report should be given Parliament’s wholehearted support and a message should be sent to both the Commission and the Council that we are determined that these essential measures should not be diluted or weakened in any way.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group gives its full support to this report. But at the end of the day the European Union must work towards setting up an independent environment inspectorate. At the present time, those countries that fail to comply with environmental legislation have to supervise themselves, which, of course, is not working.</p>
<p class="contents">This report aims, by realistic political means, to kick-start this stalled process and get it moving again, an aim which merits praise. But more needs to be done in the long-term. Where cartel formation and competition law are concerned, European officials, together with national investigators, drop into companies unannounced and are able to confront the company administration. Our proposed environmental inspectorate has a very long way to go before it reaches this stage. But if we regard the economy and the environment as being of equal importance then we should also conduct unannounced environmental inspections coordinated at European level.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we had had such inspections over the last few days in Greece, especially in Athens, even in the form recommended by Mrs Jackson, we certainly would have been able to protect, albeit indirectly, by looking after the land and the urban environment, most of the dead, the injured and the thousands of homeless which our capital is witnessing today.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we support the proposal for environmental inspections. I just wish to add two comments, Mr President, one of which is in slight disagreement with Mrs Jackson. I too believe that the inspections should at some point be carried out at a Community and pan-European level. It is not certain, it is not inevitable, as Mrs Jackson says, that this will lead to increased “red tape”. There are ways in which we can organise it to make the inspections of a random nature and perhaps have them at a higher level of legal redress, which would not necessarily involve any red tape. On the other hand, it incorporates rules and, I believe, it satisfies all the citizens of the European Union, who not only want the legislation to be enforced but who also want it to be enforced to the same degree and at the same level in all the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment – and I am, of course, stirred by my anguish and great sorrow in the wake of those earthquakes in Athens – is that our environmental legislation, which we will now have to review and enforce, still does not incorporate any, or does not incorporate enough, regulations on the use of land, the urban environment, and the degradation of the environment within towns and cities.</p>
<p class="contents">With these two comments, which I hope we will be able to bring to the table as soon as we have settled the general issue raised thanks to Mrs Jackson’s report, I once again wish to offer my support of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this to be a success the Member States must implement the directives, regulations and recommendations in the right and proper manner. It is, of course, extremely important for environmental legislation to be implemented and upheld if we are to protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow an industrial sector in one Member State to expel far more polluting substances than the same industrial sector in another Member State. This would result in the manufacturing industry moving to the country where the most lax environmental regulations are in force; the environment would then stand to lose the most and those Member States that were taking the environmental legislation seriously would be punished for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must invest a great deal of time and energy in the coming months in bringing about improvements in the way in which this legislation is implemented and upheld, in order to provide adequate guarantees that our policy really will bring about improvement in the quality of the environment. I want to emphasise how important it is for EU environmental legislation to be upheld to the same standard across the board. The existence of the internal market justifies striving for common competition regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">How can this best be achieved? The Member States are empowered to implement European directives under the terms of the subsidiarity principle. Equally, the Member States themselves bear full responsibility for implementing European environmental legislation. After some hesitation, I have allowed myself to be convinced by Mrs Jackson’s arguments in support of establishing minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States in a directive, and not settling for the European Commission’s proposal for a non-binding recommendation. However, in future, this Directive on environmental inspections must not be further embellished.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has in fact proposed a recommendation. Parliament would like it to be a directive instead. This is not really, and I must repeat this, because we have a problem with the content, since none of the amendments are fundamental to the recommendation proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has the Commission considered that in this specific case, it was better to present a recommendation rather than a directive? Firstly, Mr President, because the Commission, before making a legislative proposal, holds appropriate consultations with Member States. Of the fifteen Member States, only one is in favour of a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">And once more we find ourselves caught between a rock and a hard place. When the European Commission proposes a recommendation, you in Parliament want a directive, and when the Commission proposes a directive, we should be making recommendations, because the principle of subsidiarity must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore extremely difficult, given that out of the 15 Member States, 14 think that a recommendation would be better. Firstly, because it is sometimes right to respect the principle of subsidiarity. Secondly, because we prefer the concept of shared responsibility. Thirdly, because in this case, it concerns a measure within a programme which does not exclude the possibility of presenting it as a directive in the future if the recommendation proves insufficient. </p>
<p class="contents">This means, firstly, that it is just a pragmatic approach, knowing that most of the Member States do not want a directive. Secondly, it would have recourse to the principle of subsidiarity. And thirdly, the Commission prefers to maintain this programme through recommendations, see the results of this phase of closer cooperation on the question of inspections, and then present a directive at some point in the future if it considers it to be appropriate. These are the explanations which I am able to give you on behalf of the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to ask the Commissioner, given that all of us will be lobbying the Member States to change their minds, whether he can let us in on a secret in the interests of transparency.

<p class="contents">I will now tell you once again why the rest of my colleagues are not here. It is because, as I am President-in-Office, and because my attitude is always to be the “last of the Mohicans”, I have taken the decision to represent the Commission for the whole week, with the aim of making things easier for our new colleagues who will be meeting next Wednesday. It is also because COREPER must meet in Brussels. COREPER has a decision to make. The new decision must be made official by midnight on the 16th, and that is why the administrative machinery must be set in action.</p>
<p class="contents">But think carefully. Presenting a directive when you know <span class="italic">a priori</span> that 14 Member States are against it, is still a task fit for heroes. Try it. One of the points that you will be negotiating in the European Parliament, with the “Prodi Commission”, is the sharing of responsibility for legislative initiative with the European Commission. I think that this will prove to be extremely useful for the European Parliament, because maybe then you will discover that working with the Council of Ministers is much more difficult than just producing a report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
