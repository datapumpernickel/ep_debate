<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, thank you very much. Unfortunately, we now have to return to our work, but I would like first of all to express my complete solidarity with what President Cox has just said.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the objective of the Commission's proposal today is to update Community Regulations (EEC) Nos 1408/71 and 574/72 in order to take account of the evolution of national legislations, to clarify the legal situation with regard to certain articles of these regulations and to take account of the recent judgments of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal, which is based on criteria endorsed by the Council, contains a new list of non-contributory benefits which are subject to specific coordination. This coordination, based on the principle of residence, was ratified by the Court of Justice in relation to the <span class="italic">Snares </span>case. In its judgment, the Court established, on the one hand, the non-exportability of the benefits in question and, on the other, the obligation of the new State of residence to grant benefits in its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this judgment it was essential to re-examine the list in Annex IIa in order to verify whether all the benefits fulfil the special and non-contributory criteria. In this regard, special benefits are those which are halfway between special security and social assistance and are principally aimed at guaranteeing, as a supplementary or additional sum, a social security benefit, a minimum subsistence income the amount of which is set in accordance with the socio-economic circumstances of the State of residence or those which are intended to ensure the specific protection of disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">The examination of Annex IIa has demonstrated that many of the benefits currently appearing in it should not be maintained. I am talking about those which, despite being intended for people with disabilities, have the main objective of alleviating the dependency of these people, improving their state of health and living conditions with regard to people requiring special care.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission's position on the amendments? I would like firstly to congratulate Mrs Gillig on her excellent report on a delicate and technically complex issue. The Commission can accept Parliament’s Amendments Nos 1 to 3, since the benefits indicated in them fulfil the criteria I mentioned previously.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, however, cannot accept Amendments Nos 4 to 8, whose objective is to exclude two Dutch benefits from Annex IIa: that for unfitness for work for young disabled people and supplementary sums or minimum incomes for receivers of social benefits. The Commission takes up these two proposals in its proposal, the first already appears in the current Annex IIa, because on examining its characteristics once again it notes that they are special non-contributory benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, neither can the Commission accept Amendments Nos 9 to 12, which do not intend to exclude, but rather to include in Annex IIa, four benefits laid down in Swedish legislation, since they are family benefits and are therefore exportable. The regulation defines family benefits as those intended to compensate for family burdens and this definition was interpreted in a very broad way by the Court of Justice in the joined <span class="italic">Hoever </span>and<span class="italic"> Zachow</span> cases.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments Nos 4 to 12, which the Commission cannot accept, the Commission insists on the importance of treating all benefits, both those whose inclusion in Annex IIa is accepted and those which are excluded, in the same way in terms of analysing the special and non-contributory criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the approach the Commission has taken in the negotiations of this Annex for the candidate countries and we believe it must be maintained in relation to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, to remove the Dutch benefits from Annex IIa and to include the Swedish benefits would compromise the balance proposed by the Commission in relation to the Annex.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, the Commission can adopt Amendments Nos 1 to 3, as I have indicated, but not the others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this report, which concerns the updating of Regulation No 1408/71 and of the Regulation which lays down implementing procedures for the former regulation is, therefore, the subject of debate in our Parliament today. As has just been pointed out, the purpose of the amendments proposed to us is, on the one hand, to incorporate into the document changes that have appeared in the various social security schemes and, on the other hand, to perform the essential task of incorporating the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Communities when the latter has had to give a ruling upon these topics. </p>
<p class="contents">It should be remembered that the issue of the updating or general modernisation of the Regulation is currently being debated but also that, on many occasions, our Parliament has asked for a general overhaul of the regulations coordinating social security schemes. The proposal that we have to consider today is basically aimed at updating the list of what are termed non-exportable benefits, contained in Annex IIa of the aforesaid Regulation. </p>
<p class="contents">The decisions of the Court of Justice have made it possible to single out two essential characteristics which these benefits must exhibit in order to be considered as non-exportable and, therefore, to enjoy derogations from the general principle of the exportability of social benefits: their special character in the Member State concerned; the fact that the beneficiary does not contribute to them, in other words that they are funded from, and on the basis of, general taxation in the Member State concerned; and, finally – and as a supplementary factor – the fact that the amount is in line with the minimum necessary income required to live in the economic environment of the country granting the benefits. </p>
<p class="contents">In practical terms, non-exportable benefits may be talked of in the case of certain additional resources paid to elderly people or designed to offset transport costs or even in the case of benefits linked to disability. We can only note that, when they are not exportable, similar versions of all these benefits exist, in general, in the other Member States and are, therefore, able then to be collected. </p>
<p class="contents">What is the meaning of this updating? It seems to us that the import of the proposal being put to us is very positive. Firstly, it effectively enables the exceptions to this general principle of exportability to be limited through the strict application of the ‘special’ and ‘non-contributory’ criteria. Once systems predicated upon exceptions are left behind, the conditions are always more favourable for everyone concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this proposal puts an end to the divergent interpretations of the various national administrations and so ensures legal security for employees induced to move within the European Union. It brings transparency and greater clarity to an area which, as we know, is eminently complex, bordering, as it does, upon both what appear to be social security benefits in the very strict sense of the term and social action, which is a non-compulsory feature put in place by the Member States. It is at this level that the debate must take place and at which all the interpretations are possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it must be possible for this proposal to be adopted without delay in order to avoid further legal disputes in this area that is very sensitive for the citizens of the European Union. As we know, this issue does, at a social level, sometimes alienate people from the European Union. In their eyes, the EU seems not to respond as quickly as it should to putting everyone on the same footing. Finally, the proposal is a factor that facilitates and promotes the advances expected in the current general overhaul of Regulation No 1408/71.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we have to express a reservation regarding the specific situation of one of the Member States which has not so much seen a benefit removed as a formerly exportable benefit reintroduced in the non-exportable category. This situation should, we think, give rise to a more thoroughgoing study of the citizens concerned. There do not appear to be very many of them, but the simple fact that a number of them are likely to suffer would in our view seem to require that, when cases come to light, thought be given to having a transitional period and a series of bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, when, in a moment, we vote, I shall consequently have to table an oral amendment in the form of a supplementary recital along the same lines as the amendments that have been tabled by my fellow MEPs and that the Commission tells us it cannot follow up. This was also the position adopted within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This oral amendment should enable us to move forward. I shall conclude by pointing out that, in this scenario, we are faced with delicately balanced situations, linked to the procedure used. It is this open method of coordination that is delicate. We definitely must preserve the gains it affords in cases such as this. That is why I hope that this report is adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fighting terrorism is an extremely difficult business.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are discussing a proposal that is an annual fixture and that concerns all Member States, because every year, a clear distinction should be drawn between exportable and non-exportable social rights. The former are related to social security contributions and premiums. It has always been Europe's wish for social security to be exportable in terms of the offices to which contributions and premiums are payable. As far as non-exportable social rights are concerned, we continuously aim to perfect the definition. Even now in the report on the proposal for a regulation submitted by the Commission, an attempt has been made to further specify the definition of non-exportable rights. It is necessary to do this every year, because the Member States update their regulations every year and there are new developments on the market all the time. That is why the exportability of the rights involved should be considered each time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has written in its report: ‘The first element of a “special non-payment-based or non-contribution-based benefit” is, essentially, the “special” nature that this performance must have. This applies to all sections of social security under which the analysed performance falls. “Special” benefits are situated halfway between “traditional” social security and support benefits and are related to social security “since the need constitutes the essential criterion for allowance”.’ </p>
<p class="contents">I think that with regard to what has been listed in the annexes, the need does indeed constitute the essential criterion for allowance. On this basis, my group takes the view that the countries where rights which, according to Europe are not exportable, are exported nevertheless, will need to adapt their social legislation. In this respect, as Mrs Gillig has already mentioned, a transitional period will need to be provided for during which a solution is sought with the countries to which social legislation is exported.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands has clearly formulated a request and tabled quite a few amendments. In other countries, including Belgium, the situation is probably not so very different from that in the Netherlands. I am therefore of the opinion that Mrs Gillig's oral amendment, which is in keeping with the position of some of my fellow group members, should be supported. We are prepared to accept Mrs Gillig's text and meet the request that the Commissioner made a moment ago. In that way, we have an agreement in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This legislation has been in place for over 30 years, and, as has already been said by others, we reform it every year in order to incorporate the latest changes to national laws, and also to take account of the most recent rulings by the European Court of Justice. I think the Commission proposal makes sense, as do Commissioner Solbes’ suggestions relating to the amendments. I see it as regrettable that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats seeks to use this report as a means of engineering changes that belong in the main reform and not here.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it might seem somewhat confusing that we should today be discussing the revision of Regulation No 1408, for, over recent months, during the last few weeks, and in the last meeting of the Committee, we have been having very in-depth discussions about the major and imminent reform, which has been in progress alongside this, in which, too, we have made definite improvements for the benefit of the European public, and which is, to all intents and purposes, about to be completed. All this, though, has to be said with the small reservation that the great reform will enter into force only in 2007, and that is why adjustments are needed right now.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me extend my group’s thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gillig, who has produced a creditable and responsible report; she could, of course, have yielded to the temptation to introduce lots of nice amendments, but either the Commission or the Council would have ended up preventing us from putting them into effect. That is what makes this report so responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem, of course, still remains, one that my two lady colleagues from the Netherlands and Belgium will address, namely the situation of those who commute across borders; this will no doubt give rise to more major difficulties in all the Member States and will probably still be doing so after enlargement. We have, however, managed to find a balance between, on the one hand, enabling citizens to enjoy the social security benefits of a particular state, and, on the other, preventing national social security systems from being overloaded. It is a balanced report and a realistic one, and what I would say to the Members from the Group of the European People’s Party is that we should not weigh it down with amendments that are actually ill-advised at the present time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult after such an incident to return to business as usual, but we have to do this all the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened to a number of fellow Members here, and they assume that the proposal is an improvement on the current situation. What is certain is that this is a very complex issue. I have also listened carefully to Mr Solbes, who particularly envisages an improvement for people who are disabled or partially disabled. I share Mrs Smet's view that there will be problems that will need to be overcome in more than one country. I am not familiar with the situation in all of them, Commissioner, but as far as the Netherlands is concerned, I can tell you that the situation is deteriorating for people who are unable to participate in the labour market, those who probably never have been and never will be again. In their case, it is true that they are not entitled to contribution-based benefits, but this right should nevertheless be exportable, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">To those fellow MEPs who take the view that the discussion should be reduced to contributory versus non-contributory entitlements, I should like to press home the fact that there is also such a thing as social justice. I cannot see a need for housing costs to be exportable to another country, because these are related to the duration of housing. However, this specific case is about people, including people in the Netherlands, who are unlikely to ever be able to enter the labour market again. I would ask you to consider seriously whether other rules should not apply here. We wax lyrical about the free movement of persons, while at this moment in time, 1 300 people from the Netherlands live elsewhere in Europe and will lose the benefit they are currently drawing. I will therefore examine which premiums or proposals will receive my backing in order to haul in as much as we can, but I hope you will allow me to ask the fellow members and the Commission to consider this very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am very anxious about the future of Regulation No 1408/71. Can a committee be set up to examine carefully what the restrictions are? The fact is that, as a result of enlargement, major debates on the exportability of social security are anticipated right across Europe. I would urge you to set up a committee which follows all the problems, looks for solutions and also consults with the Member States in earnest in order to eliminate injustices of this kind in one way or another. I am not saying that this is the answer to all our problems, but I think that the derogation that the Netherlands has requested affects the weakest and least protected. The benefit in question will be exported to third countries, but on the basis of Regulation No 1408/71, it will no longer be exported within Europe, and that is a huge injustice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To move to the business of the sitting, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for her work on this report and for the moves that she has been prepared to make in terms of a general solution to what may be a general problem, which is, after all, part of what the Regulation is supposed to do. Therefore, we are prepared to support her oral amendment on this occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the difficulties with this Regulation is that over the years we have seen the Court substituting for a lack of clarity in the current Regulation and, indeed, for the shifts in the development of social security systems within Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the important things provided by this update, for the simplification and modernisation of the Regulation as a whole – which we have already taken on board at first reading – is the set of definitions relating to special non-contributory cash benefits. Once that is adopted it will provide a clear reference framework for what is in and what is out. In the past this has been left more to the opinion of Member States and there has not been any set of clear criteria which people can understand. It will mean that for some Member States some things will be brought into the exportability pattern. Therefore, it will provide benefits for some people.</p>
<p class="contents">I sympathise with the Dutch colleagues in their particular situation and, as I said, the oral amendment tabled by Mrs Gillig will go some way towards that.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the background arguments that we have heard in this debate concerns issues of parity between the treatment of nationals and third-country nationals. That is not part of this discussion. We need clear criteria, which is why we support the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I turn now to the document submitted to us. Allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur who, on a sensitive subject, has succeeded in preparing a document that is balanced and, I think, satisfactory to employed persons, self-employed persons and members of their families.</p>
<p class="contents">This document will enable the current system to be updated in a very positive way and, as the rapporteur said, will put an end to the differing interpretations at national level, while making it easier for our fellow citizens to move about. Moreover, it is based upon the decisions of the Court of Justice, defining the non-exportable character of certain benefits. The latter have three characteristics: their specificity, their non-contributory character and the fact that they are in line with each country’s level of income.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the position of our Dutch fellow MEPs where a number of the benefits are concerned. It has to be understood, however, that, in a system of social benefits, there are, on the one hand, what are termed legal benefits, having to do with retirement and sickness and, on the other hand, benefits of another type, termed non-contributory and referred to in France as optional benefits. All countries have benefits of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was responsible for social matters in France, I created what was termed a parental presence benefit. For families suddenly finding themselves with a disabled child, we created, in Paris, a benefit in the region of EUR 500 per month for 12 months. This benefit is now non-contributory and does not meet the criteria of exportability, meaning that, if a family with a disabled child goes tomorrow to Belgium or Spain where they are not granted a benefit of the same type, they will be hit very badly.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must support Mrs Gillig’s report. In a certain number of cases not exclusively concerning our Dutch friends, we must also come up with bilateral solutions, for this issue has to do not only with freedom of movement and, therefore, greater intelligibility but also with social justice. That is why we must support the rapporteur’s amendment and why, Commissioner, we must also be able to benefit from your support. Indeed, you will appreciate that, for our fellow citizens, it is social justice that is at stake today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this Parliament cannot condemn such acts of violence enough.</p>
<p class="contents">This year’s annual update of the coordination regulation is a little unusual, for we are not only discussing technical changes, but also attempting to formulate a coherent position for non-exportable benefits. I am pleased to concur with the words of Mrs Hermange, who notes that the Court of Justice has always stressed that the exceptions to the principle of non-exportability must be interpreted to the letter. In other words, these pertain much more to measures of social security that are payable to all citizens within the territory. The Commission too is in favour of a strict interpretation, and that is why I support the proposal that is now before us in Annex IIA.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, nevertheless, like to make two crucial observations. First of all, an overall agreement is to be reached shortly about the modernisation of the coordination regulation, including an agreement about non-exportable benefits. Word has already reached me that serious attempts are being made in the Council to extend the list of non-exportable benefits considerably, thus undermining the coordination regulation. By approving these annexes today, we have to send a message to the Council that Parliament will not tolerate this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is interesting if a system is constructed logically, but we should also realise that changes affect real people. Certainly if they concern regulations that have been laid down in order to guarantee people a minimum income, we have to consider very carefully what impact changes have on a country’s citizens, and particularly if there is no analogous regulation in place in other countries. I believe therefore, Commissioner, that it is appalling to have to conclude that, yet again, no such verification has taken place. For years, this Parliament has asked for the marginal effect to be verified, and what is happening now demonstrates what a fair question this is. By adding the Dutch Extra Allowance Act, which was included on the list with good reason in my opinion, nearly 200 Belgian border workers will be losing their extra allowance. Some of those will be compensated on the basis of the Belgian Social Security Act, but others will lose part of their income and that is why, Commissioner, I urge you to mount a thorough investigation into the effects on those involved, if need be via the EURES networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is necessary for the Member States responsible, in this case Belgium and the Netherlands, to agree on transitional periods and compensation measures, possibly by means of a bilateral agreement. The amendment that is being tabled in the plenary meeting today must be supported come what may. Along with my Belgian and Dutch fellow MEPs, I intend to write to the ministers responsible in order to find solutions for the people who risk losing part of their income and, consequently, falling below the poverty line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The key date will be 1 May 2004. It is then that the new Europe will be built. Unfortunately, our celebrations are commencing, however, with all the Member States erecting new walls to keep out those who wish to come from the new Member States to the 15 current Member States. That is extremely depressing. I believe that this can be avoided. I do not therefore share the Commissioner’s view.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic conditions are so different from one Member State to the next. As long as we do not have a common welfare system, common funding and a common tax system, it is only sensible for us in the new, large EU to take account of different national viewpoints. Doing so will not in any way endanger freedom of movement for workers. On the contrary. What is important is that, through these changes, we reduce the need for transitional rules. No one will be discriminated against. The situation is the same for Poles, Germans and Danes.</p>
<p class="contents">The two most generous benefits in Sweden – parental benefit and child allowance – are paid to everyone who has children in Sweden. They are not earnings-linked, but are funded through tax. Most other countries have already safeguarded themselves and entered many benefits among the derogations in the annex. I would therefore request the House’s full support for Amendments Nos 9 to 12. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are adapting the coordination regulation on social security, which we do nearly every year because something changes in the Member States nearly every year. We are also adapting it to take due account of the decisions of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is not necessarily a great gift for the people to whom the regulation applies. Something about which I, together with some other fellow MEPs, have remonstrated, is that the Netherlands has added to this list of non-exportable rights a benefit intended for one-income families, in an attempt to prevent the family from falling below the social minimum, namely a benefit of EUR 200 a month. By including this benefit in the list, this benefit is repealed immediately. The Netherlands is therefore saving that money. This means not only that 2 Danes, 193 Belgians, 395 Spanish people, 94 Italians and 55 French people are losing that benefit, it also means that the inclusion in the list is, in my view, not acceptable, because it creates discrimination between people within the European Union who no longer receive the benefit and people outside the European Union who do.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that I am campaigning as a candidate in the European elections, but quite apart from that, I think that an MEP simply cannot justify the fact that a European citizen is treated worse than third-country nationals. I can even give you the details: we export to Morocco 1 061 benefits, and a total of 1 300 within Europe. We export to Bosnia, Indonesia, the Czech Republic, the United States of America, Israel, and other countries. It is this unfair treatment that has caused me to include in my amendment a number of elements that I have also heard echoed in the discussion by fellow MEPs, and to submit this as a basis for a compromise. What this amendment boils down to – and with this, I am also addressing Mrs Van Lancker's remarks – is that the inclusion of the benefit in question on the list by the Netherlands should take effect from the moment that European and third countries are treated equally. The second condition is that arrangements should also have been made with regard to phasing out these benefits and compensation for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, if those two elements are added to the compromise, a solution is within reach. I respect the Council, which has managed to mobilise people in this matter by creating the impression that something dreadful is happening here, while Parliament surely has the right to rubberstamp the text by ordinary qualified majority. It follows that this social dossier requires unanimity in the Council, but if we notice that certain things are going wrong, we are entitled to bare our teeth. The whole of my group supports Mrs Gillig's compromise amendment and it will also back the compromises and Mrs Van Lancker’s request for more precise wordings. I hope that this will enable us to reach agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Cross-border work is very important in my region. Mobility is also a topic within the framework of the Lisbon objectives. If we do not regulate mobility effectively, we might as well forget about the Lisbon objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not in an election campaign here. There is a need for some sharp criticism on a number of issues, but it should be levelled in a matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to say that I wholeheartedly support Mrs Gillig's and Mrs Lambert's position to follow a clear system in this coordination regulation and the corresponding annexes, and I am in favour of dealing with the annexes in a very restrictive manner, because the sting is in the tail in this case. We already stated with regard to the Lambert report that whatever was removed from the regulation could be retrieved via the annexes, and that is what the improvements we have made risk doing in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that, when a benefit is no longer exportable, equivalent benefits and protection should be in place in other European countries. The Dutch government, but also the Commission to a certain extent, can be blamed for not having checked carefully enough whether this was the case. Mrs Van Lancker already indicated that there is no comparable system in Belgium, and we are, of course, unable to dash such an evaluation off for the 15 Member States, let alone for the 25 Member States following enlargement. That is clearly an omission in the report. It is also the point that we should address the most firmly. A solution is only possible if there are bilateral compensation regulations between Member States. I welcome Mrs Gillig’s willingness to include a recital in the text by way of an oral amendment, which Parliament, it is to be hoped, will approve. The Member States should subsequently set to work, and the Commission should see to it that sound work is carried out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Solbes and all my Spanish colleagues have my heartfelt sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Gillig report this morning, each year we visit the whole area of further clarification of the exportability of benefits to try to achieve the goal of free movement of more and more of our citizens in the European Union. This is necessary as Member States add to or change their own legislation in this area and as European Court judgments point out anomalies or clarify certain Articles.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that several entries that are currently in Annex IIa will have to be removed from it in the light of recent jurisprudence. On the issue of the amendment to Article 33(1), I am anxious to ensure that a Member State should not be able to levy more contributions on a pensioner who receives pensions from several Member States than if that pensioner were receiving all his pensions from just that Member State. I particularly welcome the addition of mobility allowance in Annex IIa under Heading G 'Ireland', that is, new point (da).</p>
<p class="contents">I have one difficulty which is not exactly related to this, but I would appreciate a response from the Commissioner as to what the Commission will do about it. At the moment there are different criteria in each Member State regarding eligibility for certain benefits, such as invalidity, disablement, blindness, and so on. With the permission of a constituent I shall read a couple of paragraphs recording a specific case where this is hurting:</p>
<p class="contents">'I was involved in a traffic accident in May 1988. As a result of the damage to my brain I have been registered as blind with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland. A scan showed damage to my brain, then different tests that were carried out by ophthalmologists for both hospitals and the National Council showed that permanent damage to my eyesight had occurred. This qualified me for the blind person's pension and to be registered for blind in Ireland. The problem that I – and I am sure many others like me – now face is this: my registration is accepted here in Ireland, but once I cross the border to the north, to the UK, different criteria are needed to be registered as blind, and I am led to believe that this is the case in every other European state. This seems to say that when you enter another European country a cure of some description happens and if I was to live in another part of Europe I would have to go through the same process again. If I am a cripple in Ireland, I am a cripple in Europe. If I am deaf in Ireland, I am deaf in Europe. If I am blind in Ireland, I am blind in Europe.'</p>
<p class="contents">My constituent goes on to say that it is not just a cross-border issue, but a European one. Commissioner, could you please tell us how quickly we will be able to resolve this issue of different eligibility criteria for different benefits? Because this is causing major problems to the mobility of our citizens, particularly the disabled and the invalided, in the areas I have referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">Another small issue I point out is that the word 'benefit' in English, certainly under the Irish system, means different things. It is 'contributory pension' in some countries. In other countries it just means a social welfare payment of some kind. We use it rather lightly here and as a result it can cause confusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Alongside our debate on the annual changes, the modernisation of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, which is linked to these annual changes, is also taking place. This means that we shall presumably have to debate this annex again in the autumn. It will then be called Annex X instead. I rather think that the Commission should have been cautious and not made any changes this year until we had completed the modernisation, in which the principles are partly changed and laid down. That is my personal view.</p>
<p class="contents">Annex IIA is based upon certain principles governing what may be entered by the Member States. The Member States cannot enter whatever they think is appropriate in Annex IIA. The benefits concerned must not be universal ones, but require something in the way of a means test. Family benefits definitely do not have their place there. To Mr Schmidt and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I wish to point out that the Swedish child allowance is universal. That also applies to the supplement for families with more than one child, to study grants and to the sum guaranteed for the parental benefit. This means that they do not have their place in Annex IIA. This may be considered right or wrong, but everyone must no doubt agree that the annexes have to be based upon certain principles. Nor, probably, should a question mark be placed over the housing allowance for families with children, but that is the only benefit that could possibly be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore reject Mr Schmidt’s proposal. It is unacceptable to ignore all the principles upon which we have jointly agreed. Mr Schmidt says that we have such different systems – which is true – but he also says that we could live with these different systems, that they do not affect freedom of movement and that we do not need these regulations. On that point, I do not at all agree with him. We naturally need regulations governing people who move across the borders and who are to receive social benefits. Were we drastically to change this system by, for example, saying that no family allowances might be transferred, it would have a harmful effect upon freedom of movement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me also to express my deepest disdain for this vermin in human form and above all affection and solidarity with the families suffering today; solidarity and affection in their pain and suffering. As Commissioner Solbes said, we must carry on, although it is not easy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are debating the Commission’s proposal to update Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 with regard to specific benefits and non-contributory payments. The proposal is mainly aimed at incorporating the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, specifying the special and non-contributory nature of certain benefits, and also reflects the changes which have taken place in the different national legislations. I believe that the crux of the debate is whether or not to include in Annex IIa the benefits laid down in national legislations and the consequences of that inclusion in the said annex, in other words, their non-exportability or, where relevant, their exportability.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the various amendments presented, I agree with Nos 1, 2 and 3, both because of the characteristics or nature of the benefits in question, or because of the conditions for receiving them, or the difficulty or impossibility of controlling them.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, Amendments Nos 4, 5, 7 and 8, which relate to benefits whose exportable nature was mentioned a while ago, are dealing with benefits which sometimes have equivalents in the Member States, suited, furthermore, to living conditions. In any event, I believe this should be studied.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree with Amendments Nos 9 to 12; firstly because they involve family benefits in all cases. The general criterion of the regulation is that family benefits are exported; anything else would be discrimination, and would hinder the free movement of persons, and within the context of that free movement, would prevent families from travelling with their rucksacks of social protection on their backs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, I would like to draw attention to making present or future health care in certain Member States conditional upon payment of certain contributions from pensions. Naturally I am referring to the new paragraph 1 of Article 33 of the Regulation. This means that the incomes of a very significant number of pensioners would be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Spaniards residing in other Member States, their pensions would be reduced while, if they lived in Spain, they would receive 100% of them, since health care is a right which we could describe as automatic. We would therefore be faced with a clear case of discrimination and hindering of the free movement of persons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I said earlier, we must return to our work and I am going to try to respond to your concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must not forget that the issue we are dealing with here is the competence of the Member States: organising their own social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to stress the point raised by Mrs Doyle. It is a real problem. Nevertheless, it is also the case that there is no harmonisation of these issues at Community level. We can make progress by means of the coordination of national legislations undoubtedly. This naturally means that each Member State should adopt national legislation in agreement with the others. In this regard, the open coordination method can help us, but we have no one single solution. There may be an intermediate way – which is being worked on and on which we may make progress – mutual recognition, which would not lead to a situation of complete harmonisation, but to a situation of recognition which could allow us to solve some of the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we work on the basis of the fundamental fact that we are talking about decisions and competences of a national nature, it is clear that any element of coordination must be carried out according to pre-established set criteria. Those objective criteria are the ones we have tried to include and which I referred to earlier in my speech. In some cases, therefore, we accept some of the solutions you propose and in relation to others we believe that the solutions you suggest do not resolve all the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue we are talking about, the fundamental idea is based on special advantages based on the principle of residence. In some cases, therefore, the intention is that, if residence is changed, the advantages of one country be replaced by the advantages of another. Those advantages depend on objective conditions, in accordance with the characteristics and the social security systems defined in each country. I appreciate that in some specific cases this may mean of loss of relative advantages in comparison with the country of origin, which reflects the existing differences between the nationals of the different States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that there is no gap in the legislation, there is coherence throughout the system, which does not imply that no specific problems will arise or that we will not have to try to resolve them. In my opinion, the situation is that the margin here is much more evident at national level than at Community level. In this regard, the best system for moving forward would be the adoption of national actions allowing this type of problem to be corrected or bilateral agreements between countries which allow some of these difficulties to be resolved. Otherwise, clearly, at Community level, we can apply harmonisation where possible – in many of these cases it is not – we can make progress on coordination by means of the open coordination method, we can make progress on the issue of mutual recognition in order to prevent these problems with the free movement of persons which many of you have mentioned. This is the basis we are working on and we will continue to do so in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
