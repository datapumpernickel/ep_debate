<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busk (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries for the considerable interest and support elicited by my report on the multiannual guidance programmes for fishing fleets. It shows that this is a very important report. The multiannual guidance programmes proposed by the Commission make a lot of sense. The overriding problem is that they are not being implemented in the Member States. Therefore, we never find out whether or not they would be a success. It is quite simply unacceptable that they are not being implemented in their entirety. According to the Commission, there are 7 or 8 Member States which do not comply with MAGPs. If one adds to these the countries which do not have a fishing fleet at all, not many countries are left which comply with the common decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We simply have too large a fleet fishing for too few fish in the EU. There has only just recently been a ban on cod fishing in the North Sea, and this clearly shows that there are some very weak links in the chain when it comes to the ability of the common fisheries policy to secure sustainable fisheries. European fishermen are entitled to a more stable fisheries and quota policy as a basis on which to organise their industry. One of the most important tools for securing sustainable fisheries is simply to ensure that the size of the fishing fleet corresponds to the quantity of the fish that can be caught. Technological progress entails a still greater need to reduce fishing fleets. We are now, of course, in the unfortunate and regrettable position arising from the failure to renegotiate a fisheries agreement with Morocco. The EU’s over-capacity when it comes to the fishing fleet is therefore a great weakness.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to the Commission’s using the new tools in the form of Articles 6 and 10 of the Council Regulation which of course enable the Commission to withhold aid for, respectively, fleet renewal and the modernisation of vessels. It is naturally sad that the Member States do not have a greater incentive to implement those decisions which they themselves have been involved in taking on a joint basis and that some countries feel superior about the fact that they are to implement the guidance programmes, given that they are not exceeding the quotas. I find that deeply regrettable. One is almost tempted to propose introducing a system of rewards for those countries which comply with the common decisions and reduce their fishing fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">I am obliged to criticise the form taken by the Commission’s annual report, which is impossible to read unless one is an expert in the area. The various figures are set out without any comments as to their reliability. For that matter, they are included in the report in such a way that it is largely up to the reader to interpret the figures and make what he considers to be the correct interpretations. In other words, the annual report is not easy to read and it provides absolutely no overview of the situation. For example, there is no clearly set-out table to permit comparison of the individual Member States. It is, unfortunately, a very poor point of departure for the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002. The Commission therefore has a very great deal of work ahead of it, Commissioner, if a new and better guidance programme for the reduction of the fishing fleet is to be carried out and if this is to be implemented in all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group is going to support this report from the first line to the last. I also thank him for the collaboration which we have had with him at all times in the work we have carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The report echoes yet again the request by this Parliament that the European Commission should make an example of and apply truly dissuasive penalties to those Member States that repeatedly fail to comply with the fleet objectives they have been assigned, so as to avoid once and for all that the general objectives for the Community fleet should be forever jeopardised, despite the very high social and economic sacrifices made in some regions of the Member States that have traditionally complied. This lack of compliance with the MAGPs has led the European Commission to present its proposal to extend MAGP IV until the end of 2002, unfortunately setting out a number of conditions which are absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In a further attempt to adapt the fleet to the resources, the Commission has again forgotten that there are countries that have broadly complied with their objectives, and is presenting a global proposal which will punish everybody with the threat of new cuts in fleet size and the intention of withholding aid for the modernisation of the fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said so many times (the last time was right here, during the last part-session), the structural aid for modernisation is the only guarantee to maintain a competitive fleet and to ensure the best conditions for the quality of Community fisheries products and the quality of life and safety of our crews. Far from understanding it in this way, the Commission shows it has completely lost touch with reality by persisting in suppressing such aid, and in real terms the new MAGP proposal literally says that it will suppress the article that allows fleets to seek modernisation, for safety reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">With the review of the common fisheries policy, the Commission talks a lot about listening to those involved and consulting the industry and the administrations. Time and time again, they have all made it perfectly clear – and they are unanimous in this – that they consider the modernisation budget to be indispensable. Because of all this, I ask the Commissioner to explain to me the reasoning behind this proposal</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lage (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the common fisheries policy has the difficult and, at times, thankless task of reconciling the interests of an activity as old as mankind with preserving fishery resources and marine ecosystems. The continual erosion of fish populations will, in the long term, threaten the survival of European fishermen and the preservation of the species. And without fish, it goes without saying, there can be no fishing. It is therefore crucial, as Commissioner Fischler suggested, that we make a clear decision to accept short-term losses in order to achieve economic and environmental benefits in the long term. The overcapacity of the Community fishing fleet, which marine scientists estimate to be 40%, a figure adopted in the March 2001 Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy, is one of the main causes of the excessive pressure that fishing exerts on fish stocks. It must not be forgotten, however, that other activities apart from fishing, namely tourism and various forms of pollution, also contribute to the destruction of the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the multiannual programmes for reducing the fishing fleets are an important component of the measure that has been implemented in order to protect species that are being fished at dangerous levels. The basic aim of these programmes, which are truly complex and hard to implement, is to achieve a balance between resources and catches, not to punish fishermen. A permanent reduction of the fishing fleets is, of course, viewed with apprehension by fishermen and others in the industry. The reduction must therefore be implemented rigorously and transparently and with fairness to all those concerned. The results for 1999 are mediocre and disappointing and it is, therefore, worth emphasising the recommendations contained in Mr Busk’s report, calling on the Commission and the Member States to adopt clear and precise criteria for measuring the capacity of ships and fishing fleet categories so as to guarantee control of developments in the fishing fleets and the multiannual plan objectives. Member States must have the courage to respect the limits that have been set. Fishing must, increasingly, become an activity which is not predatory but rather one which is friendly to the sea and to marine life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several Member States are behind in their obligations to reduce their fleets and once again nothing is being done to improve matters. The next report, by Mr Nicholson on cod in the Irish Sea, clearly shows the failure of the present approach to fleet management.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing to extend the MAGP by one more year in order to debate fleet policy in the context of the Green Paper. We support that. We think it is a good idea. However, there needs to be a major rethink about fleet policy. We would agree with the Commission that fleets are too large and must be reduced. We also feel that the Council should wake up and join the real world, because it seems to think that this is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">As a step in the right direction the Greens support the idea of penalties for those countries which are not observing their legally binding commitments to reduce fleets. We must get serious about this problem and also look at the countries that are claiming to have met their obligations under the MAGP, to ensure that they are not transferring their vessels to other flags. We must ensure that they are doing what the MAGP intends they do in the long run. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If a Member State’s fleet keeps to its quota, it has met the principal objective. Threatening to reduce the quota if the MGP targets are not met ignores that objective. One then finds the odd situation that fleets that meet the MGP target but structurally overfish go unpunished, while fishing fleets that do not overfish are penalised because their engine capacity is too great. On the latter point it was a considerable step forward that in 1999 account was taken for the first time of countries that regulate their fleet capacity through a days-at-sea scheme, in other words capacity limited by activity. Unfortunately an end has not yet been put to the confusing number of units to denote fleet capacity such as gross registered ton, gross ton and kilowatt propulsion capacity. It is an illustration of the lack of vision of fleet structure and the inflexibility of the Commission’s fisheries policy that as yet no proper unit has been found for fleet activity. With the increasing catching efficiency, the need for an indisputable indicator of the catch per unit of effort is great. On the other hand, great engine capacity need not indicate a greater fishing effort if we consider that the freezing capacity also requires extra engine quality as on some ships.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable fishing can only be achieved if there is room for an efficient fleet within the permitted catches. Grants for newly-built ships disrupt the operation of market forces and encourage an expansion of capacity. I therefore call on the Commission to end these grants, and I know that I have the support of Dutch fishermen in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs support among the fishermen, if it is to have a chance of succeeding. The MGP must not be seen as a separate instrument with independent objectives from the other policy measures such as the TACs and the quota. By giving fishermen in their product organisations scope to shape policy for themselves within a single framework, such support can be created. These producers’ organisations can then be tackled on the division of the quota, transparency of catches and the registration of ships. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Annual Report – whatever the rapporteur’s qualities and however much work he puts in – appears repetitive, conventional and quite pointless each time. The pointlessness of this exercise underlines, if there were any doubt, the vacuity of a process, namely the MGPs or multiannual guidance programmes, the principal effect of which is to encourage fraudulent behaviour, favouring certain fleets to the detriment of others. The purchase of virtual wrecks from outside, in order to break them and thereby have unjustified reserves of kilowatts available, distorted the mechanism from the start. This corruption has even become a veritable national sport in certain States. Indefinitely lamenting the poor quality of the statistical data on MGPs therefore does not make much sense. To embark, as the Commission proposes, on a course of punishment and penalties for Member States – which would, in fact, hit the workers – would be dangerous. What we need is simply to take note of the failure of the MGPs instead of trying to artificially prolong the life of this ineffective and counter-productive measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite their elevated cost, these MGPs have not achieved their objective. Adding to the total allowed catches – the TACs – they were badly designed from the outset and have made the second-hand market rocket to the detriment, in particular, of young small-scale fishermen who are just starting out in this profession. Everyone recognises this failure in private. It would be sensible to have the courage to recognise it publicly and draw conclusions from it. The main conclusion should be the need to include in the new common fisheries policy, along with the abolition of the MGPs, reorientation of the sustainable management of resources according to a reformed system of TACs and improved, fine-tuned multiannual quotas based on refined assessments of resources made possible by a substantial increase in scientific research and close collaboration with workers in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">In wishing to prolong the MGP policy the Commission is in danger of committing itself to a dangerous path, and we are warning it against this. This is not the way to reconcile fishermen with the common fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He, like myself, has been given the great problem of trying to deal with a highly technical report and trying to find a way through. My report comes later. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate him on an excellent report. I think those of us who participate in the fisheries committee in this parliament do not always get the credit for what they achieve or indeed what the Commission achieves.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to ask the Commission and indeed, we all have to ask ourselves, why is the multiannual guidance programme not being implemented? It is all very well to complain about it, but we have to ask the question 'why'? The main reason why it is not being implemented is because Member States and national governments are not prepared on many occasions to find the matching funding required to bring about what is necessary to restructure an industry which we all know and agree must be restructured.</p>
<p class="contents">Until we find a way of encouraging all the Member States to do this, there is no point in one Member State doing it, there is no point in two or even three, four or five Member States: it has to be right across the board of all Member States or else you will end up with massive recriminations between Member States as to who is doing what. The fact that we have not been able to give it that priority in the Member States is certainly something that we all view with great concern. I would be inclined to say to the Commissioner that, no matter what you call it or how you achieve it, what you should do is to take the problem, give it a good shaking, get on with it and to try and force Member States to bring about the result everyone agrees is required and sort out how it will really affect the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the Member States going one way, we have the Commission going another way, we have scientists telling us another thing and in the middle we have fishermen and the fishing industry wondering what way they can go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States must also be obliged to fulfil their fleet reduction targets so I welcome the general thrust of Mr Busk's report. Unfortunately, an amendment in committee added a reference to the Cunha report and brought with it the concept of quota penalties, a proposal which is against the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. As the Commission itself stated in this House on a previous occasion, and I quote: "The automatic reduction in quotas for non-complying countries seriously undermines the basic principle of the common fisheries policy which is that of relative stability".</p>
<p class="contents">Quota penalties are impractical as well as unjust, punishing fishermen for their Member State's wrongdoing. Quotas should be based on science and conservation objectives, not misused as automatic penalties. I ask therefore for a separate and split vote on paragraph 4 of this text and I urge Members to reject the references to the Cunha report and make sure that effective sanctions are targeted against those who are obliged to fulfil MAGP targets, that is, Member State governments, and not fishermen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I start by thanking Mr Busk for his excellent report. As we all know, the multi-annual guidance programmes are important instruments for fleet policy. I agree with you wholeheartedly there. According to the information in the annual report, not only were the MAGP IV targets not ambitious enough, even these modest targets were not all met.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I should like to comment on the two main demands contained in the report: measurements of vessels and sanctions for Member States which fail to meet their MAGP targets.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Mr Busk, you call for precise and clear criteria for measuring capacity. In theory, we introduced a uniform definition of tonnage which applies throughout the Community in 1994 in Regulation No 3259. According to this regulation, the Member States had to file tonnage estimates by 1995 and have until 2003 to measure all vessels in accordance with uniform regulations and notify the actual values.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, we have only received estimates and now they must gradually be replaced by actual values. This means that we shall have to work with a mixture of accurate measurements and estimates until the end of 2003. In theory, there are also harmonised definitions for engine power. There is a problem here with controls, however, because the actual engine power is often higher than the value declared or is subsequently increased.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put a stop to this practice and the Commission will be organising a workshop of experts from the Member States in the autumn of this year in order to find solutions to these problems. In all honesty, however, there is good cause to question, over and above this, if these two criteria, that is, engine power and tonnage, really are the only possible and the most suitable criteria for assessing the fishing effort of a vessel accurately.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, I intend to raise this question again when we consider the reform of the common fisheries policy and investigate it more closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Busk, you call for effective sanctions against Member States which fail to honour their obligations under MAGP IV. You refer in this context to earlier resolutions by Parliament on the Cunha report on the same subject. I agree with you wholeheartedly here. We need more effective sanctions which will have the right impact. The most effective method in the past, with the exception of legal recourse, has been to freeze state aid for fleets. This is, of course, completely pointless in Member States which do not grant state aid, such as the Netherlands or the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The only legal recourse available if the MAGP IV targets are exceeded is to go to the European Court and institute infringement proceedings. We have prepared infringement proceedings against several Member States and we now intend to set them in motion because there is no other way of making sure they toe the line.</p>
