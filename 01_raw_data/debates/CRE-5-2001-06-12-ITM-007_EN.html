<p class="contents">Ground level ozone is a serious air pollutant which creates considerable problems for public health and the environment. The targets we are setting to reduce the extent of pollution must be binding, otherwise we risk the decisions becoming mere castles in the air. It is therefore not good to have legislation which only talks about targets being reached as far as possible, as expressed by the Council of Ministers. In this respect we naturally support the committee’s proposal for clearer wording. Our group also supports Amendments Nos 5 and 23 which state that the targets must be entirely attained by 2020 at the latest and that they may not be exceeded by more than 20 days a year until 2010. Without these changes the legislation will be toothless.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect of Mr Davies’ report is the more stringent requirements in terms of information to the public. This type of air pollution has a considerable effect on public health. It is therefore important that all available information is made public to the general public and voluntary organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be consistency between the EU’s environmental policy in different areas. We have common targets for air quality and are currently negotiating with the Council to approximate the rules on national ceilings for emissions and large incineration plants. If this policy is to hold together, we also require binding rules on ozone emissions. With these words I wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work which we will vote for in every respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive is part of an overall package which is being implemented by the European Union at this time to comply with the obligations under the Kyoto Accord. We can all recall that the Kyoto Accord sets down a timetable for the reduction in the level of the use of greenhouse gases. The US President, Mr Bush, has already stated that he wants to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord. This is highly regrettable because, in the eyes of many, it is felt that the targets set by the Kyoto Accord will not even achieve the goal of substantially reducing the use of greenhouse gases. The clear scientific evidence is that climate change is real, is happening now, and will get worse. Emissions from the developed world are the primary reason for global warming. Developed countries must take the first meaningful steps in reducing emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is determined to play its part in reaching our targeted 8% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels over this decade. We are all aware that President Bush is due to meet the European Union leaders in Göteborg this week. I hope that the US President will come up with a firm proposal to outline how his administration intends to reduce the level of greenhouse gases in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is unequivocal scientific evidence about the damage which has been done to many communities as the ozone layer is being depleted. Extensive production of greenhouse gases is resulting in the depletion of the ozone layer which, in turn, is resulting in higher sea levels, contributing to greater coastal erosion, greater flooding and the elimination of many of our island communities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a moral obligation to ensure not only that the quality of life of present communities is protected, but that the quality of life of future communities is protected also. That is why it is so important that we all guarantee that we reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, the United States of America and elsewhere so as to achieve our objective in this regard.</p>

I myself, in my <span class="italic">département</span> in France, chair an air-quality monitoring network, and whenever the weather is very good, when it is sunny and there is no wind, I dread the effects of road traffic, because I know that the maximum levels will inevitably be exceeded, and there will be what we normally call an ozone peak.</p>
<p class="contents">In such conditions, what can we do? What can we do to comply with the Kyoto Accord and solve the problem of climatic change? We know that it is human activity, in the form of industry and road traffic, which causes the maximum ozone limits to be exceeded in our urban areas, but afterwards this ozone, depending on wind and topography, spreads to regions which ought to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vitally important to set objectives which are precise, to have real, effective air-quality monitoring networks. The rapid alert system which comes into play when ozone limits are exceeded to an extent which is likely to be harmful to the health of susceptible people such as children, the elderly, or people with heart or respiratory problems, must be effective. The network must cover the whole of Europe, so that everybody can be properly informed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should be aware that it is difficult to reduce excessive levels in Spain, Greece and Italy, and that it is much more difficult in the countries of southern Europe than in those further north. Those who are responsible at local level should take effective town-planning measures, in the context of sustainable development, without, however, harming the competitiveness of our businesses. We should aim our awareness campaign above all at those who are in a position to change their behaviour but, more than anything else, in order to succeed we must make sure that all countries are aware of their responsibilities, so that our decisions are not merely European, but international as well. President Bush has arrived in Europe, and we should do all we can to make him aware of the responsibility which the United States also bears in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He brings something to us which will hopefully provide some interesting issues to be debated and discussed and then resolved in consultation. This report excellently demonstrates why environment policy has to be achieved at a European level. Ozone is a European problem and the best example I can think of a problem that has to be addressed at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, within the United Kingdom, where in many ways the circumstances are amongst the most favourable within the European Union, 50% of the ozone is created by emissions outside the UK. That is very much the pattern for the rest of Europe. Indeed, in many parts of Europe, a great many of the problems about ozone are not necessarily a consequence of activities by that individual Member State. Ozone is a collective problem which has to be dealt with collectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one concern, namely that we are trying to set too strict values. We are setting target values that, by their very nature, will be almost impossible for many Member States to meet in certain given circumstances during the year. They are going to be, through no fault of their own, in breach of European legislation. It is not sensible that we should create a piece of legislation that puts Member States in this position.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many Member States, particularly in southern and eastern-central Europe who are going to find themselves constantly in breach of this legislation, no matter what they do. Some of the things they are going to have to do, where physically possible, as indicated in the compromise amendments, is to close factories, perhaps shut down whole parts of industry, and create car-free zones inside their cities. And still they will not solve the problem of ozone. Still they will find themselves breaching this regulation we are creating. When we go into conciliation – as I expect we will because we will have the votes for many of these amendments in the House – we are going to have to think very carefully about whether we continue to adopt this type of approach and this type of legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Davies, for his hard and dedicated work on this important and complex issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal sets target values and long-term objectives for ozone in ambient air. While the long-term objectives are based on the latest advice from the World Health Organization, the target values have been set with regard to the best attainable air quality. In doing so, the transboundary nature of ozone and cost-efficiency aspects have been taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned earlier, this proposal is closely related to the proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings where conciliation negotiations are currently under way and we have to recognise the difficulty of finding a solution for linked issues, for example the target values for ozone, in the absence of a definitive outcome. At its first reading in March last year, Parliament presented a well-considered report including 18 amendments. Council's common position adopted in March 2001 takes due account of most of Parliament's concerns. Now 32 amendments have been tabled to the text of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4, 15 and the first part of Amendment No 23 all seek to turn the target values into binding limit values. In light of the insufficient scientific knowledge on ozone formation, the Commission cannot accept any of those amendments. On the other hand we can accept in principle Amendments Nos 30 and 31 requiring binding target values, save where physically impossible. However, we would also have to bear in mind that target values would not be attained where it is not efficient from an economic viewpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the target values, it is not acceptable for the Commission to keep 20 days as the target value for the protection of human health. The Commission agreed on Council's common position on national emission ceilings, which result in 25 days as an attainable target. Therefore the Commission cannot accept the second part of Amendment No 23. Moreover, Amendment No 23 would set 2020 as a binding target year to attain the long-term objectives. Amendments Nos 3, 5 and 15 follow the same intention. As there is there is no scientific evidence yet to prove this aim to be feasible, the Commission cannot accept those amendments. However, the Commission agrees on the general aim fully to close the gap between long-term objectives and current ozone levels and could accept Amendments Nos 2 and 6.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 26 to 31 would require attainment of the long-term objectives, save where physically impossible. Again, this would have to be complemented by taking account of economic efficiency as well. Therefore, those amendments could only be accepted in principle. Several amendments would enforce the obligations of Member States to report to the public and the Commission. The Commission welcomes these amendments if the requirements are considered feasible and useful. The Commission therefore could accept Amendments Nos 8, the second part of 10 and 16. Amendment No 11 would be acceptable in part. Amendment No 17, in principle. Amendment 32 would complement Amendment No 17 in a way that is acceptable. The first part of Amendment No 10 and Amendments Nos 18 to 20 and 25 are not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 12 and 14 both clarify responsibilities in setting up short-term action plans and are acceptable in part and in principle. The last part of Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 13 are acceptable in stressing the role of guidance on examples for short-term actions. The Commission accepts Amendment No 24, which supports a more effective trigger value to initiate short-term actions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four amendments on other issues. Among those the Commission cannot accept is Amendment No 1, as it is directed towards candidate countries, which is not appropriate for an EU directive. We can accept Amendment No 7 on tightening requirements to maintain air quality. Amendment No 21 would require a direct comparison between the performance of Member States in improving air quality and the Commission could not accept this amendment as the proposed comparison is not considered appropriate, in particular, with regard to the transboundary nature of ozone. As Amendment No 33 incorporates those aspects, it could be accepted in principle. However, no direct comparison of Member States should be required. Finally, Amendment No 22 requires special attention to the effects of ozone on human health and the environment and the Commission accepts this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it essential to put this legislation in place soon, so that appropriate monitoring can start. Member States need to be able to identify problem areas, so that they can make sure that the public's health is properly protected in the future throughout the Union. Hopefully a valid compromise will soon be found, having regard to the outcome of the conciliation negotiations on the directive on national emission ceilings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
