<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s communication of last December on the Community objectives for the 33rd Assembly of the ICAO, constitutes – and how could it not do so – the frame of reference for preparing and assessing the results of that 33rd Assembly, with regard to both reducing noise and the sound emissions of aircraft and also reducing gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that the Transport Council of last April saw fit to support this strategy proposed by the Commission. This communication is very explicit on the subject of reaching agreements within the ICAO, with regard to both the reduction of aircraft noise and measures for reducing gases which increase the greenhouse effect, as well as the restriction of operations of aircraft which only marginally comply with the acoustic standards of Chapter 3 and which are the greatest sources of noise at airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of our objectives is to reach an agreement as a result of this Assembly, with a resolution which allows the contracting countries to fulfil their obligations in the field of reducing greenhouse gases more easily and comfortably.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is one aspect which we can already say is likely to have a positive result at the ICAO Assembly. I am, of course, talking about the constitution of the new Chapter 4, with a reduction of 10 decibels on the maximum emissions authorised in previous chapters. In this respect, furthermore, the ICAO Council has adopted rules which guarantee rigour in relation to the recertification of aircraft with the aim of preventing repetition of the current situation where recertified or reclassified aircraft have passed from Chapter 2 to Chapter 3, which is the source of all our controversy with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the preparations by the ICAO Assembly are intended to ensure that the contracting countries are sufficiently flexible to implement those instruments which allow – in the words of the ICAO – a balanced response to noise management. This balanced management is based on four elements. Firstly, measures for the reduction of noise at source. Secondly, rules relating to the occupation of land. Thirdly, lower-noise procedures, which allow pilots to limit noise at the time of take-off and landing. And, lastly, measures intended to limit the operations of aircraft from Chapter 3 which are the noisiest.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, above all, this last point which – as you know – presents the most difficulties in our discussions with the United States. In order to facilitate an agreement within the ICAO on this point, we are holding parallel discussions with the United States and with the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out that neither the ICAO nor, of course, the United States can ignore the problems caused by aircraft noise for many airports in densely-populated regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we note that, in some large airports, this type of noise disturbance is reaching truly critical levels and that, therefore, it is extremely urgent that we introduce measures to resolve this situation and allow these airports to continue operating.</p>
<p class="contents">For others, however, the problem of noise is much less important. We will therefore have to consider decisions – we are working on this – in which there is a certain flexibility, taking each airport individually. Furthermore, this point is going to make it easier for us to reach an agreement with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a certain degree of risk caused by using certain differing approaches to restricting the operability of Chapter 3 aircraft – the noisiest ones – which may distort competition between the different airports. In this respect and in order to prevent an explosion of the Community situation, the intention is to negotiate with the United States and, of course, within the ICAO, so that we can frame these individual decisions for each airport within a general framework which lays down different levels of operative restrictions in accordance with specific areas of sensitivity.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I once again commit myself and the Commission services to maintaining an open dialogue throughout these months with this House and I hope that we will finally reach an agreement within the ICAO which will ensure that we resolve this issue of airports and the noisiest aircraft and, at the same time, avoid any type of confrontation with the United States, which would benefit no-one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was one of the matters discussed at our committee meeting last week; it is a matter which has concerned the European Parliament for a very long time and we, the committee, had intended to put an oral question to the Commissioner. That is why we are delighted that the Commissioner herself has taken the initiative and come to address Parliament and clarify the Commission's stance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a matter of vital importance to the electorate which put us here. For the sake of the environment and for the sake of our quality of life we need to reduce the noise emitted by aeroplanes, especially as air traffic is increasing and the situation is getting worse year on year. There have been some developments, which the Commissioner has described for us and on which I should like to comment. I must say that I personally have reservations as to whether these developments can bring about a positive result. However, we must be resolute and we must demonstrate that Europe is on an equal footing with the United States of America. We are friends and we want to remain friends, but they must realise that they have an equal partner on the other side of the table who wants to resolve this problem the best way possible and find rules which will be applied as quickly as possible. And I trust that the United States will take the same approach and speak with one voice and not several voices as has been the case in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to clarify another point, i.e. that we are calling for an international solution because this is an international problem and international problems require international solutions. We are here to talk. We hope that they take the same view. Otherwise circumstances will force us, the European Parliament, to take unilateral action and adopt solutions already adopted by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The 33rd assembly of the ICAO is an opportunity which we must make good use of and not allow to slip through our fingers. For our part, I should like to say that the European Parliament – and I think I speak for most of the members now – has confidence in Mrs de Palacio's ability to negotiate on behalf of the European Union and I trust that we shall finally reach a result at this assembly which will resolve the matter once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But anyway, a symbolic presence counts for something as well, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I am left with a few questions. Chapter 4 is sound, except for 10 db, which is excellent. It appears that the re-certification or shifting of aircraft between categories has been regulated. If I have understood you correctly, it is now impossible to have a repeat of what we have experienced in the past, namely a shift from category 2 to category 3. That is now ruled out, if I understand you correctly. I welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must at least ensure that it is impossible to make changes for the worse at any airport. The situation must not be worse than it is at present at any airport. As you yourself said that the sensitive areas should be examined for each airport, things should therefore start to improve quickly, preferably as soon as possible, for a number of airports.</p>
<p class="contents">But my question is, then, whether the agreements for classifying airports apply worldwide? Who lays down the standards? Does the European Union have a say in this? Can we be stricter? How do we go about this? What is happening about competition between airports? When we discussed Mrs Lucas’ report, we then stated that competition was one of the key points. Competition between airports at the expense of those living near airports and the environment is unacceptable. Do you know yet how we will tackle this in the Union? What will be the role of the local authorities? You stated that that would be done via the Planning department, but that is typically a local power. So how will you tackle this? As you can see, I have quite a few questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the phase-out. If I have understood correctly, we have not yet accomplished this, and airport classification should help solve that problem. If there is no phase-out, in other words if those chapter-3 aircraft remain in the air until they reach retirement age, if I can put it that way, is that not too long? Should we not be somewhat more ambitious and introduce new aircraft onto the market more quickly?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the state of play on a uniform method of measuring noise? Surely it is a matter of extreme urgency for both Europe and America to measure noise in the same way, in other words for the ‘footprint’ to be determined in the same manner everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a question on air pollution. You have said very little on this matter. What is stipulated in the air pollution agreement? One final question: what is happening with the directive on hushkits? Is it being repealed? Will you be making a proposal to revoke it, or will we simply retain it? Have the Americans commented on this at all? Does it or does it not form part of the package? I am still left with a few questions, but I believe we are on the right track. I hope that we can in any case find a solution in September. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I very much appreciate the Commissioner's statement. I believe we are all agreed that the forthcoming ICAO general assembly meeting is going to be a key one as far as aviation and environment are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Sterckx has said, I was the rapporteur for Parliament's response to the Commission's proposals on air transport and the environment last year. You may recall that Parliament put a very strong emphasis on the need for a positive outcome from this ICAO meeting. We said, crucially, that if ICAO did not deliver what we need then the EU will have to seriously consider adopting its own complementary measures to ensure that environmental concerns are more properly integrated into the aviation industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us recall just two key points of the context of those discussions. First, air transport is growing at a phenomenal rate, with global passenger numbers due to double in less than 20 years' time. Secondly, the current policy framework artificially subsidises aviation and therefore stimulates this growth still further. Aviation fuel is not taxed, it is not subject to VAT and it is not covered by the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does Parliament expect from this ICAO meeting? On noise reduction: at the Cape Working Group meetings over the past few weeks and months the EU has proposed phasing out Chapter 3 planes and upgrading Chapter 4. That is a minimum requirement: to try to reach the target of noise reduction of, at best, –14 dBA, but at the very least, –10 dBA reduction at source. If ICAO cannot do that, we will need to look at differentiation, as the Commissioner has said, in introducing operational restrictions on Chapter 3 at a number of noise-sensitive airports. But the EU may also need to look at introducing an aircraft noise limitation directive in order to achieve that reduction of, at the very least, 10 dBA, in recognition of the particular problems of a densely populated area like the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">On emissions, we need concrete and efficient measures to reduce aircraft emissions, including not only voluntary measures but also emissions-related levies. Aircraft should fulfil ambitious but feasible emission reduction targets. If ICAO will not deliver then the EU will have to develop its own emission limits.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that we are not able to have a Parliamentary resolution on this subject. I believe a strong message from this Parliament could have strengthened the negotiating hand of the Council and Commission at ICAO. I hope that both Council and Commission will hear very strongly the strength of feeling which is shared by all groups in the European Parliament on this subject and seek to get the best possible deal in September. But if such a deal cannot be struck, they must come back to Parliament so that we can work together to ensure that the EU's own treaty commitments and obligations on integrating the environment into all areas of policy can take proper effect in the field of aviation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we accomplish this breakthrough, I will be the first to extend my best wishes to Mrs de Palacio in this connection. Given that the noise certification standards have not been adapted since 1977 and that aviation has expanded so enormously since then, I believe it to be of huge importance that we agree on a drastic approach very quickly. We must introduce modern, quiet aircraft which meet stricter noise standards, phase out noisy aircraft and, needless to say, reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, it is my conviction that there is no room for supersonic aircraft which may fly at an enormous speed but use up far more energy than the current aircraft, thus contributing to more greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is of vital importance for us to continue in the same vein, along the lines of the resolution on aircraft fitted with silencers, which we adopted in March 2000. I wish the Commissioner great success in the negotiations. We will continue to follow the proceedings at close quarters for, if no solution is found, we will unfortunately need to act at European level, which I do not consider to be desirable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She showed clear conviction and also a certain amount of grit and determination in such a sensitive matter as this.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is not possible in the three minutes available to me to analyse the entire issue, so I will focus on just a few points. Firstly: the improvement of aircraft. Clearly, less noisy aircraft means more modern aircraft and more comfortable aircraft, but, most importantly, it means safer aircraft, and not just in terms of the engines: in fact, for example, during landing, a large part of the noise is made by the landing gear rather than the engines.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of competition between airports, it is undoubtedly necessary to give responsibility to local authorities as well. Clearly, the airport authorities can be persuaded to grant derogations, to make exceptions in order to increase the volume of traffic, but if the local authorities have decision-making powers and take a stance, then it will be the communities involved who will decide the interplay between money/trade/profit and noise prevention, not just the airport managers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of airports, the rules need to be fairly flexible for, clearly, an airport such as Malpensa, near where I live, where 70 planes take off or land an hour, is quite different from some other airports which only have four or five planes landing or taking off a day. Obviously, if there is little movement during the day, a small increase in noise levels could be acceptable in view of the almost ridiculously small number of planes passing through.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards subsidies, I have to say that, although air transport is subsidised to a certain extent, it is much less so than urban, rail, sea and all other types of transport. Therefore, it does not seem appropriate to complain about subsidies to the air transport industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that, at the ICAO, the European Union will be able to achieve the goals and results that the Commissioner has set herself, irrespective of Parliament's resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Please count on the support and backing of Parliament, and we hope that the European Union’s objectives on this issue are achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be at the forefront by adopting a series of measures which do not only relate to the issue of this statement on air transport and the environment, but also to its effects on the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union. We must achieve some concrete and quantifiable objectives. And we must also achieve a timetable which makes realistic demands. Because otherwise, we will not achieve any of the objectives we have discussed so many times in committee relating to noise levels of aircraft, the situation – as Mrs Lucas has expressed very well – of the increase in the demand for air transport, the situation of certain airports which are not in a position to deal with the air traffic they are currently receiving, the measures proposed by you – by the Commission – such as taxes relating to noise, restrictions on the operation of certain types of aircraft within the European Union, or clear policies in relation to the use of land with regard to air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">A second problem which I believe to be of concern is that of gas emissions. There is a lot of talk of the greenhouse effect, caused by CO2, when air transport could reduce its greenhouse emissions by between two and four times; I believe that, given the significance of this, we must take a clear and determined position in this regard. However, at the same time, neither can we forger what air transport has meant for the development of the Communities, for the economic development of the states and also for the quality of life of the citizens, for speed and for the opportunity to visit and discover other places. I believe that we need sensible, concrete and totally efficient measures which will genuinely improve the environment and the quality of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Sabena disaster just goes to show how thousands of jobs can be hit within the shortest period of time. Finally, the costs that have to be borne by airline companies are also a decisive factor affecting ticket prices. Ticket prices are very important for social, but not exclusively social, reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial problem when it comes to noise is congestion. When we fly out of Brussels, we often see five, ten or fifteen aircraft queuing on the runway, waiting for permission to take off. I believe that the fight against congestion in general, but particularly in the field of aviation, must be given priority and that we must make efforts to acquire more efficient systems so that such congestion can be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the basic and further training of personnel is also crucial, and not only in the control tower and on the aircraft. If consideration were to be given to providing special training, specifically from the noise and environmental viewpoints, a very great deal could be achieved in this area. Finally, it is also a question of infrastructure. We are all aware of the problems with Eurocontrol, and enough is known about the difficulties of dividing air space efficiently between civil and military aircraft. I believe the Commission should exercise significantly more pressure so that we might more quickly find successful ways of getting on top of congestion and, at the same time, guaranteeing passengers greater safety and comfort.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development is currently being drawn up. I consider it necessary to press very hard for a solution for the traffic sector in particular. In this area, we need new approaches in the Sixth Framework Programme. We know that congestion will be one of the main themes of the next few years. I believe we need intelligent solutions that will help us guarantee the mobility of the population and, at the same time, get on top of the problems. With a view to being able to offer the population convincing solutions in this area, we should therefore do more to initiate our own research programmes specifically for aviation in the context of the Sixth Framework Programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What she said did not appear very clear or precise at all in terms of the situation as it stands. I find that disappointing.</p>
<p class="contents">We gave you a brief in March 2000. We expect you to stick to the brief or to come back and tell us something different. We need to know what progress you have made with that brief. We need to know what you are doing about it. We need to know what progress has been made on noise emissions, gaseous emissions, and indeed on fuel economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Successful negotiation requires preparation and hard work. We need to know that is being done and we need to hear from you that it is being done. We need you to go out there and tell the Americans very clearly that noise and gaseous emissions from aircraft are a serious problem in Europe, a more serious problem than in the USA because we are a smaller place and we have a different infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">The projected growth of air traffic demands is clearly an issue that requires action now. We need you to stick to your brief. We will be watching very closely. But essentially we need our Commissioner to stand up for Europe, to stand up for Europe and its industry, to stand up for Europe and its environment and to stand up for Europe and its people. We expect you do it. Let us hope that you can say something further at the end of the debate that will reassure me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all, Commissioner, whilst saluting the way in which you have maintained your negotiating position, expect you to tell us that it is not indefinite – and neither is your patience.</p>
<p class="contents">You have a mandate from every party and group in this House to tackle the problem of the increasing pollution of the skies and the damage to the lives of those who live around airports as a result of the current situation. There is a belief still that the endless expansion of air traffic is an unmitigated good, that everyone gains from it. They do not. There are social limits to growth and to how much we can enjoy even something as life expanding and enhancing as travel. We heard many threats and some bluster from the United States last year, when it looked as though hushkitted aircraft and Chapter 3 planes would be leaving our skies, perhaps in the year 2002. But Europe as a whole suffers problems, particularly those who live around airports who suffer not only noise pollution, but also aircraft emission pollution with consequences for the environment. We must see the beginning of change.</p>
<p class="contents">In the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, where I live, a number of small new airports are coming into being. Many of them are desperate to compete with 'through-the-night' traffic. This means air traffic using older aircraft, which are going to stagger on for another few years, if they are allowed to, with few controls on how they operate. Obviously, that is something on which the Member States can act. Unless there is a framework for taking older aircraft out of service, we will never have the degree of control we need. I join with other colleagues who have spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lucas put it very lucidly for us all – in saying that if there is a failure to agree in September we should not just leave the matter there and agree that we tried and failed. This House does not want the Commissioner to fail, we want her to succeed. If we are telling her so rather bluntly, it is in a friendly spirit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Otherwise, I wonder how you got here if you did not fly. This is clear: airports are necessary. What we clearly have to do now is create fewer problems for the surrounding community, but we also have to remember that the community often builds up around the airport because of the activity of that very airport, because of the economic development it generates and the infrastructures which accompany it. We have to see things fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that of the responsibilities of the local authorities. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a question of subsidiarity. Each country has its own rules and I am not going to tell the countries what they have to do on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue concerns the hushkits<span class="italic"> </span>regulation, which was introduced and adopted in 1998 by Parliament together with the Council, unanimously. Ladies and gentlemen, if at any point I present or propose to you a modification of this regulation, it will be to replace it with something which is even better for the communities surrounding airports. It will be in order to make improvements. Furthermore, to do so in a way which does not lead us to controversy and international dispute as has been the case with the current regulation. Of course, the Commission, the Community as such, is not part of the International Civil Aviation Organisation but rather it is the Member States who are members. We have a kind of secondary position in one corner. That is the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation has been condemned by the United States in accordance with Article 84 and we succeeded in postponing the decision at the last meeting of the ICAO Council a week ago and leave until November, that is until after the assembly, the decision on whether the complaint from the United States against our <span class="italic">hushkits</span> regulation is justified. We will have to wait and see the result. I would like, together with the United States, the developing countries and the other countries which make up the ICAO, to agree on regulations which improve the characteristics of aircraft and bring about the modernisation of the fleets of the different countries as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another issue, highlighted by Mr Sterckx, Mrs Lucas and others as well such as Mr Blokland and Mr Hatzidakis and that is the renewal of the fleets. There are two different aspects to this. Firstly, thanks to our regulation, we have managed to move things ahead within the ICAO. That is why I said before that we have already achieved positive results. There is going to be a Chapter 4 with a reduction of 10 decibels. There is not going to be an agreement on phasing-out because, until Chapter 4 enters into force, it cannot take place, as happened before with Chapters 2 and 3. That is to say that it will be at the 2004 assembly, surely, when we can agree dates for abandoning the Chapter 3 aircraft. We have agreed that the methodologies and evaluation systems for a reclassification of aircraft are a key issue. We must move beyond the current situation, with Chapter 2 aircraft reclassified as Chapter 3, which meet the criteria of this last chapter only under certain flight regulations and furthermore in a very restricted way, which means that, in other circumstances, they greatly exceed those noise levels and do not comply with the rules of Chapter 3.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the origin of our complaint about hushkits. Ladies and gentlemen, we are seeking some points of agreement with the United States and with certain other countries, and I believe that the best thing is for us to reach an agreement amongst all of us. Of course, I am going to defend the positions of the 15 countries of the European Union. However, I would like to remind you of the situation a year ago, when the pressure – which is now less, amongst other things because we are negotiating and it seems that we are reaching agreement on some points – from the United States was much greater and there were threats of trade reprisals against a number of countries. This pressure came from various countries, delegations of countries and also various representatives in this House. I do not want to find myself in that kind of situation again, because it was clearly me who was taking the strain. What I want is to reach an agreement with the United States which will allow us to achieve the objective we all share of reducing the noise levels around our airports. That is what I am working on, but I am also seeking agreements with other countries, because the ICAO does not only include the 15 countries of the Union but also the United States and a number of other countries from other parts of the world which have rather different interests from ours and with whom we have to reach agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">A further two issues have been referred to: the issue of competition between airports, the noisiest ones and the quietest ones. That is why we are proposing to take decisions on individual airports on a case by case basis, within a global framework in which the different levels of restriction of operations and noise-levels are reduced to two, three or four in accordance with the specific areas of sensitivity of the surrounding community. There are certain geographic conditions – I am thinking, for example, of Strasbourg airport, where there is a problem of boxing-in between mountains and phenomena of echoes are produced which aggravate noise problems – and other issues which justify the adaptations and specific measures for protection of these areas. We are suggesting that decisions be taken individually, which is what the United States is calling for, or that a general regional geographical approximation be carried out, as we are requesting. The intermediate solution which we are negotiating with them is a geographical framework with a maximum of 3 or 4 levels of sensitivity. A situation without special limitations and another two or three levels of specific operational restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by thanking all the speakers and thanking you for your support, with the hope that it might be possible for a delegation from Parliament to participate in the ICAO, alongside us. I believe that there may be a common interest in incorporating a parliamentary delegation into the debates, and we will have to see how we could articulate it according to what happens in other types of negotiations. It has been pointed out by one speaker that air transport has its limits. Ladies and gentlemen, everything has its limits. We all know that airspace is limited, capacities are limited, but I believe that, as things stand, we have not yet reached that point. What we have to do is achieve better management of all resources, specifically in relation to these transport limits, not just in the case of air transport but of transport in general, with growth possibilities within a sustainable development. I hope that, if things go well and we get through the internal discussions within the Commission, in the coming weeks we will be able to begin to discuss the White Paper on transport where, amongst other things, we propose the high-speed train as an alternative to air transport for journeys of less than 800 or 900 kilometres. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
