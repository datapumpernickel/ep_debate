<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Savary (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I welcome this point of order, for foresters and the forestry sector cannot wait for the outcome of these rather irregular debates which can only have one effect today, and that is to send out a message proclaiming that the European Parliament is made up of absentee Members, whereas most of our fellow Members, including those here today, are certainly not relaxing in front of their televisions but are working in the field. The issue is wider than that. In reality, this is nothing more than a feature of the anti-Strasbourg sniping which has developed. Let us be completely clear about this and not try to pretend it is otherwise or to evade the issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the forestry sector. As it happens, we already expressed our sympathy, as we are wont to do, in a resolution of 20 January 2000, and requested that the Commission supply us with certain information and undertake to help those of our citizens – and they were numerous – who were in difficulties, for this disaster affected the whole of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, four months later, we are sufficiently removed from events to be able to learn both from what has been done and what has not, and we are expecting a tangible response from the Commission to this question. Did we actually intervene? Did we employ the means available to us? This time, we are not claiming appropriations for exceptional circumstances under the “natural disasters” heading. The sector is simply assessing the extent of its difficulties and the resulting risks – economic risks, security risks, that is to say fire risks, and also risks of non-reforestation, for if it is not possible to remove the wood in the coming weeks, many foresters would prefer to leave them where they are, and then the forestry sector will be in permanent difficulties, and with it the primary processing industry. </p>
<p class="contents">Four months on, the purpose of this oral question is therefore, Commissioners, to inform you, first and foremost, that the condition of the forestry sector is critical. In the space of two days, 193 million cubic metres of timber have flooded the market. The first question is that of price control and regulation of the market, since the cost of removing some low-quality species is now more than the market is willing to pay. We are familiar with the regulation of the market in the context of the common agricultural policy. We are not asking you to include timber in that policy, but it appears that Europe could have employed equivalent measures to assist the timber market during this exceptional crisis. It could have temporarily regulated the timber market for a period of several months. The question has been put to you. What action are you going to take? </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available? I refer to the means which allow us to grant exemptions from the competition laws to help exporters, for the cost of transportation of timber which has been exposed to fungal or parasite risk is totally unacceptable, provided that there is a buyer. If we want to support the market, we must support the transportation necessary for export to places further afield. Is the Commission prepared to take steps to do this? To what extent has it implemented Article 87(2) of the Treaty, which allows it to grant exemptions? To what extent, if at all, has it approached the WTO to request it to grant derogations? What has it done to set up means of remedying the natural disasters affecting the forestry sector? These are not virtual instruments. We have rules, such as Article 30 of Regulation 1257/1999. If it has not done so, what action does it intend to take in the forthcoming weeks? The matter is urgent. Finally, I call for the DOCUP development plans to give unequivocal consideration to the forestry sector and the timber industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would like to inform the honourable Member that the Commission is quite aware of the extensive problems caused by the hurricanes at the beginning of December 1999 in Denmark and Sweden and at the end of December 1999 in France and Germany, the devastating effect on the entire forestry industries of these countries and the implications for those employed in the industry. May I refer you to Mr Barnier’s speeches at the plenary sitting of 18 January 2000, when he stressed that the Commission would willingly employ every available means to assist the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, with regard to forest damage, I must also remind you that the European Parliament, notably in its resolution of 31 January 1997 on the forestry strategy of the European Union, and also the Council of the European Union, have repeatedly stressed that the Treaty does not lay down any specific competence for a Union forestry policy. Thus, the European Union does not have the necessary means to intervene in the way stipulated by the two resolutions. In effect, timber is not among the products listed in Annex I of the Treaty. There is no legal framework and timber cannot therefore be governed by a specific market policy, even temporarily. Although such actions are theoretically possible under WTO regulations, well-defined, solid legal, economic and commercial grounds would be necessary to persuade our trading partners to accept them. To date, the Commission has not received a detailed analysis justifying its taking such a step. I will come back to this point in a moment. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore, first and foremost, national aid to the timber industry which is the most appropriate means, at national, regional or local level, of supporting the worst affected forestry sites in the industry, and the Member States have to decide on the procedures for providing this aid. The Commission is therefore currently assessing the national aid systems notified to it by the national governments for alleviating the effects of hurricanes on the forestry sector according to the effects on competition at European level. The departments of the Commission are assessing these aid systems, particularly in the light of Article 87(2b) of the Treaty, which governs the compatibility of the aid envisaged by the Member States in the event of natural disasters. </p>
<p class="contents">The aid programmes notified by the French Government do, in fact, contain a general measure supporting the windfall transportation which may result in some of the timber being transported to countries outside the Union. The Commission stresses that Article 87, paragraph 2b of the Treaty does not constitute an exemption from GATT regulations as such, and we and our legal departments are assessing the compatibility of this measure with the Treaty on the basis of recent information. The French authorities may be requested to provide further information. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the joint financing of aid programmes proposed by Member States under Article 30 of Regulation EC/1257/99 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), I would further stress that the Commission is prepared to be extremely flexible. However, it is first of all up to the Member States to amend their initial programmes. In the meantime, two Member States, including France, have presented their adapted programmes, which now include a substantial section on bolstering the forestry industry following the storms at the end of 1999. In this context, actions are proposed for the removal, storage, transportation, protection and replenishment of the devastated forests in order to support the sector. These dossiers are currently under negotiation between the Commission and the Member States, but I can state here and now that the Commission’s attitude is favourable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Daul (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on the way you handled the debate this morning. You encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the Commission. But Commissioner, I would also like, and I feel that this is essential, the institutions of the European Union to bear witness to the solidarity which unites the Member States, in particular in the event of exceptional disasters such as the storms of 26 December last which caused such unprecedented damage to a number of forest regions in France, Germany and Austria. </p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need for us to begin using the instruments available to the Union to assist the affected regions and support the individuals and companies concerned. The need for our support is all the more pressing given that transportation, storage and forest exploitation cannot be delayed without serious consequences in terms of both the quality of the products and the restoration and protection of forest ecosystems. Thus, in the Alsace region alone, more than 6.5 million cubic metres of woodland has been devastated, which is essentially equivalent to one to three years’ harvests. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the influx of timber onto the market will send prices plummeting and so further damage the industry’s economic operators. Once again, the way that the sector is structured may facilitate the search for joint solutions between the upstream operators which manage forestry resources and the downstream operators which exploit them. The inter-trade system introduced in France can certainly play a major part in the search for, and development of, these joint solutions. Indeed, since they are designed not to protect the interests of any one section of the industry, they facilitate the protection of the industry as a whole, promote the timber sector and ensure respect for the great internal balances which make it possible to consolidate the whole. Although regional in scale, inter-trade bodies also have a local impact and are immediately efficacious in critical situations such as that of our forestry companies and the timber industry. </p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore favour direct contacts with potential partners, even more so given that inter-trade bodies are also the consultative partners of local governments and national authorities with regard to defining forestry policies and hence with regard to the search for immediate solutions to crises. They are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes. This is why I ask you not to disregard direct consultation with the industry’s operators in your consultation mechanism. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, regulations can be a constraint which varies according to the State in question, as is, notably, the case with regard to grain storage, in respect of the impermeability of the ground, the water sampling limits, which are set at 5% of the low water discharge in France and 30% in Germany and waste disposal monitoring. I therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented. The scale of the disaster shows that the aid pledged by the State or confirmed at local level will not be sufficient to cover the damage reported. It is therefore essential to be able to draw on the Structural Funds to finance special measures for forests and the timber industry in the case of disasters in objective 2 or former objective 5b areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to rural development measures and other, more specific, economic or environmental programmes, in parallel with actions for using up workable timber, which represents about 50% of the windfall. It would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production. However, the urgency of the situation calls for flexible, simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the Member States</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the Commission to seek consensus with the industry as a whole and the Member States concerned in order to find effective, immediate solutions, for the greater the consensus, the more effective the solutions will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further south-west, in France, my parents spent many days in the dim light of the petroleum lamp which I had given to them once as a present. We do not know when and in what form the next disaster will strike.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me, therefore, to say something about the current problems and to expand on one aspect of the comments of my fellow MEP and friend, Gilles Savary. It concerns point 8 of the joint motion for a resolution in which we ask the Commission to create instruments which make it possible to take rapid and effective action within the European Union if we are faced with a crisis situation as a result of accidents or natural disasters. We presently have neither the money nor the infrastructure for this.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not in future rely on cross-border neighbourly aid as in the case of the storms at the end of the year. It was offered on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner. It is also a healthy and important expression of solidarity. However, in itself it does not constitute a European solution. The European Union must take full responsibility for its citizens. The Commission must, therefore, quickly rack its brains to find instruments for rapid and effective emergency aid. We will expect proposals for solutions soon. We need have no qualms about making these proposals unconventional and bold. There will certainly be no lack of support from the European Parliament. The time has come to move on.</p>
<p class="contents">But first we must sort out the current consequences of the Christmas storms. This involves three things in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: we must not let the timber market collapse and must, therefore, directly intervene on behalf of the many small and medium-sized enterprises. Secondly: we must, as an exception, also support necessary transportation and exports of valuable timber to third countries. The Commission must urgently discuss the approval of export subsidies with the WTO. Thirdly: we must do everything we can to counter the risks of fungus, pest and fire so that the damage does not become even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, when you say that national aid is the important thing now, then I would say to you that this also means that, in this instance, you do not want to organise the common European market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Barnier was very emphatic in his speech, assuring us that the European Union was, in effect, going to do something to help the victims. By victims I mean the small-scale foresters who have been ruined, but I am also referring to the small seaside businesses who now have to face the influx of tourists. Well, now we know that forests do not fall within the remit of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">So we are going to use part of the Structural Funds to finance emergency aid in the event of natural disasters. Yet we are well aware that this will take time. And, in this regard, may I say that the European Union’s policy consists of robbing Peter to pay Paul. We cannot support this policy, for it amounts to depriving some to provide for others, to the detriment of future projects. In my opinion, this is really not good enough, and we expect tangible measures from the Commission. The citizens are calling for immediate action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolutions deal mainly with the regulation of the timber market and export subsidies. </p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I would like to speak up on behalf of forestry workers, who receive no mention at all, even though it is their efforts which are keeping the timber sector going. The storms were more than just an environmental disaster for all of us and an economic problem for the profiteers of the timber sector. They have resulted in a sharp deterioration in the working conditions of foresters and lumberjacks, whose jobs are extremely dangerous at the best of times with the very highest accident rate which will continue to rise. The discomfort and danger involved in their profession is illustrated by the fact that there were over 100 casualties in the 1990 storms in Germany. The forestry workers’ salary is shamefully low – a mere 6900 francs. They are calling for a decent salary which offsets the risks involved in their job. They are demanding to be able to retire at 55 and calling for an improvement in their working conditions, which are still antiquated and result in the physical deterioration and sometimes death of a number of workers each year. We support these legitimate claims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has a duty to learn the lessons of the storm disaster, and strengthen the effectiveness of Community texts. Between the initial emergency period and the current challenges, with problems in the transportation, storage and sale of wood, there is a chronological gap corresponding to a gap in institutional support. This must be remedied and the States concerned must be awarded logistical support in the follow-up to the initial emergency period.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution last January, Parliament asked the Commission to submit practical proposals if it were found that the funds available for aid were insufficient. So what has become of these famous practical proposals? The Commission should use these proposals to prioritise its reaction to the slump in wood sales, for what we had feared is actually taking place, and it is becoming impossible to sell wood. And what measures has the Commission taken or planned to promote the immediate cultivation of damaged plots of land, without which the effective reconstruction of our forests cannot begin. Sadly, one merit of this ordeal is that it will have reminded us that wood is an industrial raw material, one that is, furthermore, essentially renewable.</p>
<p class="contents">The sustainable and efficient management of our forests requires an economically viable forest. Similarly, only sustainable forestry can provide a proper foundation for a competitive wood industry, while making a crucial contribution to the development of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are, and must continue to be, the main operators in forestry policy in Europe. This must not, however, stop Europe pursuing the coordinated management of forestry issues. The sometimes extremely binding regulations governing the single market apply to forestry products. In return the Community must provide support for these products, especially at times of crisis. Community action in favour of the forestry sector is appropriate inasmuch as it creates added value for the national action which has been undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an ideal justification for the principle of subsidiarity, for instance in matters of protection against atmospheric pollution and forest fires, or forestry certification, and also in matters of support for the implementation of a world convention on forests.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Community initiatives in favour of the tropical forests, but I am astounded that there is not the same enthusiasm to come to the aid of our own devastated forests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Baden-Württemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about 25 million solid cubic metres. This equates to three times the average annual felling and this has already led to 30% lower timber prices. Just the cost of remedying the damage in Baden-Württemberg, the area for which I can speak as the delegate, runs to about DM 1.5 billion, of which DM 300 million are needed simply for reforestation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Hurricane Lothar is not a problem specific to Baden-Württemberg. France and other EU States have also been greatly affected. Nevertheless, the Commission has so far refused to make additional budgetary allocations available and prefers to cite, in this instance represented by Mrs Schreyer, the fact that final agreement has already been reached in the European Parliament on Budget 2000 and that the requirement for additional funds should be covered by the Member State in question from the funds already allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the redistribution of funds was made subject to approval and this approval has not yet been given. I consider the argumentation of Mrs Schreyer to be somewhat cynical when you consider that, only a few days later, she announced that the additional financial requirement of EUR 300 million for the EU Balkan commitment, which is undoubtedly important, would be covered by EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget without the farmers noticing it, and this includes forest owners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress once again that we are dealing here with extremely long-term damage which may also have ecological implications. Tidying up, storage and reforestation all involve intense physical work. Commissioner, I know what I am talking about. I am a farmer. I have seen how the hurricane took the roof off our stable and I have seen the state our private woods are in. We were able to put things right ourselves but, by and large, this is not the case for all areas, all persons, all communities. You can see that. But that this is done quickly and efficiently and, above all, is sustained long term is an ecological necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">During his visit to the Black Forest on 16 February, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries, Dr Fischler, indicated broad flexibility within the existing financial framework for measures for rural development. He indicated, as you have today, Commissioner, that you are willing to give consideration to, to help ...</p>

I am in complete agreement with the Members who have spoken on the matter and, believe me, the Commission would love to be able to do something about it. Yet neither the Treaties nor the budgetary regulations provide for this possibility. </p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, no Community framework exists which would allow the Commission to adopt initiatives to provide direct aid to the forestry sector. Moreover, the same applies within the framework of Regulation 1257/99. It is the Member State itself which has to adopt the necessary initiatives and provide for appropriate aid. According to the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission cannot direct resources from the rural development programme towards channels supporting the timber industry following storm damage. The Commission cannot apply competition regulations to authorise national aid or joint financing initiatives under the provisions of Regulation 1257/99. Moreover, negotiations are in progress with the Member States and I have made it quite clear that, within its institutional and legal capabilities, the Commission is doing everything in its power and more, and is being as flexible as it possibly can. </p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the institutional authorities have decided that forestry policy is to be governed by subsidiarity, and that it does not fall within the competences of the Commission but is wholly the responsibility of the Member States. This is something which the Commission cannot change for the moment for that would mean amending the Treaty, although reform of the Treaties is currently being discussed. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon all Members who are convinced that subsidiarity should not apply to forestry issues but should be the remit of the Community to make representations to their national governments to this effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Imagine if other citizens were to go about their work in the same way as those delegates who think that they have a four-day week here, even though the five-day week for the plenary meeting was agreed in Strasbourg. This Parliament has actually agreed, and I also say this to the delegates over there who want a democratic vote, that Friday will be a session day in Strasbourg. It is indeed a strange concept of democracy, and this also applies to the others who instigated this circus, if the opponents of Strasbourg are now using genuinely dirty tricks to sabotage Fridays.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a Member of this Parliament 35 years ago and in all my time I have never seen such abuse of the Rules. One really should expect delegates to respect a democratic decision reached by majority, such as that concerning our session calendar, even if it does not suit them. But they are bad losers and they really do not care that they have prevented important resolutions being taken for the citizens of the EU and, in particular, those who are starving in Ethiopia. This latter point is especially grave and reprehensible. I hope that those who instigated this procedural circus will be punished by the voters.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interest of forest owners, including in my own State where, to be fair, the last storm disaster was not as devastating as here, for example, in Alsace, I hope that measures will be taken by the EU, as proposed here, in order, above all, to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises going under ….</p>

That was the formal declaration of vote. I would like to rid certain people here of the misconception that those who took the initiative for quorum counts are no longer present. It is true that some have left. But I am one of the people who took the initiative and I am still here, just as I am here every Friday. I have noticed that some people say that there are people who are after a four-day week, but I am certainly not one of them. I am, however, of the opinion, that we need to work a proper five-day week, which is not happening at the moment, if the number of MEPs in attendance today is anything to go by. And this is why the problem has arisen. If Fridays were like Tuesdays or Wednesdays, then it would not have been necessary to have this debate and the counts here today. This will now have to be carried through to the moment at which Fridays either run in the normal way or, due to a lack of interest, they are abolished, which is once again a likely scenario.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our position is that we have concerns about the Union’s courts having responsibility for forestry policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I fail to mention the fact, which has already been referred to here, that the saboteurs of this morning’s sitting did not take part in the vote, and I am delighted that the PPE has suggested a nominal vote, which will clarify the matter. There is a French saying about the <span class="italic">arroseur arrosé </span>– the biter being bit. Here we have the <span class="italic">saboteur saboté</span> – the saboteur hoist with his own petard. It is deplorable that we have been involved in this circus. Those concerned could have made a point of order, since it is an important issue that the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents have to address. But they went too far. They showed no consideration for Ethiopia and sabotaged the votes. They then suggested a nominal vote so a count could be taken. As we can see, however, when we take a decision here on an issue related to storms, disasters or Europe’s interests, that is, serious matters, they are no longer present. Almost none of the 32 gladiators were present for the final vote, which is utterly deplorable and which clearly reveals the true intentions of those who destabilised this morning’s sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no different for you than for those colleagues who tried what they did.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time this morning I joined in the request for the quorum to be established. I am a supporter of Strasbourg and a supporter of Fridays. However, I am of the opinion that those who wish to ensure that the work of Parliament continues to be carried out should also be present. I therefore thought to myself that a warning shot was in order; what then happened I thought went too far and I did not want to fall into line because I thought that it was about Strasbourg and Fridays. For that reason, I did not go along with it any further. But the fact that those delegates did what they did you have to grant them. You then have to respond accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rules of Procedure, and I would like to pay my respect to the President here, were sensibly interpreted this morning with great composure and great calm. Matters proceeded as was established. The votes which were carried out are proper votes. They are no less valid because only a few delegates participated.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that, by exhorting our colleagues, and also the Groups, to be present, we should try to rescue these Friday debates and these Friday votes and to bring about a positive outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, with regard to the forestry issue, I would like to say that, although your openness has sometimes made your words difficult to accept, you have, at least, been frank, in contrast with those declarations made at the time of the incidents, which may have been rather rash. I sincerely feel that your approach is far more beneficial to the credibility of the European Union than the tone of the declarations made when the issue first arose, which led us to believe that Europe was much more involved than it actually intended to be. </p>
<p class="contents">The subject of the forestry sector is now open to debate, and we must take up the issue of natural disasters as well, for we cannot endeavour to draw closer to our citizens and then explain to them that we are unable to help them when they are in trouble, while, at the same time, we are sending task forces abroad. This is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance. So thank you. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my support for the comments of Mr Daul, who worked together with Evelyne Gebhardt to draft this resolution on the timber industry, and to express my regret and shock at the fact that we have exploited the plight of the people of Ethiopia to further our petty games. Petty games which are not acknowledged, moreover, for although, effectively, the right does exist to request that the quorum be tested and also to bring up the issue of Friday working, it is blatantly obvious that this morning’s events were an attack by the anti-Strasbourg faction. And, even more seriously, it appears that this incident may well be repeated every Friday. We do, however, have one small consolation in that it will not be long before their refusal to participate affects those who were conspicuous by their absence today and who managed to derail this morning’s sitting. </p>
<p class="contents">We simply need to return to the issue of the agenda again as soon as possible. It is a well-known fact, and I am publicly admitting it before all those here today, that the Chamber is never full because Parliament’s work is specialised. Nevertheless, we must stop trying to hide...</p>

I have been in this House for 21 years in all, although only 6 of those as a parliamentarian. I have taken part in every Friday session for 21 years, even when I had another job and was not a delegate. In this regard, I would also like to thank the staff who work so exceptionally on Fridays. However, irrespective of that, I would like to say that I have repeatedly seen such attempts over these 21 years. For this reason we introduced a quorum for determining the quorum because we wanted to rescue Fridays. That is how all this came about.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to say to Mr Meijer that at some point it was also decided that we would pass legislative resolutions from Tuesday to Thursday and not on Fridays, for which the quorum is not prescribed as compulsory, when we would deal with issues which are not controversial so that resolutions which are not controversial, but important nevertheless, can be passed. That was the consensus, and this consensus was reached here. Perhaps it is a healthy shock and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is perhaps right. But I would ask you to clearly understand that Friday was never intended for legislative resolutions. These resolutions are not legislative. They are, however, important and they are consensual. We should therefore be able to pass them peacefully and in a dignified manner, and that is why, at the end of the day, we have passed them peacefully and in a dignified manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
