<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, three weeks ago, I suggested that we stop the clock. The time has now come for us to set it in motion again and to submit my team for this House’s approval. The decision to postpone the vote was widely welcomed, both inside and outside Parliament, as a means of laying the foundations for this process to come to a positive conclusion. This is a process that shows European democracy in action.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow Parliament has the chance to give the incoming Commission a ringing endorsement and, in so doing, has the chance to deliver yet another victory for European democracy. It is in your hands to approve the Commission, and I shall strive, as I clearly indicated in July, when I received the honour of your support as President-designate, to ensure that this Commission will enjoy a close relationship – or positive complicity, as I like to call it – with Parliament. This is a Commission that, with your support and partnership, can drive forward a European agenda that can make Europe matter to its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, I have paid a great deal of attention to your comments. You have stressed the need for a strong and competent Commission, and a Commission which is there for all European citizens. I have made a number of changes in order to meet these demands, changes which I believe to be fair and necessary, but which have not entailed a completely new line-up. In the process of doing so, I have had to take account of a number of different and sometimes contradictory expectations, both from political groups in this House and from Member States. As you will be aware, I had to choose the members of my team in agreement with each Member State, and the responsibility is therefore shared, which is a point I should like to stress. During discussions with my colleagues in the Council I made sure that Parliament’s concerns were raised, and I proposed the changes I believe to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I have brought two new Commissioners onto my team, Mr Frattini and Mr Piebalgs, and I have reallocated Mr Kovács’s portfolio. All three of these Commissioners have now appeared before hearings held by parliamentary committees, and this has made it possible both for Members of this House and for the wider public to become better acquainted with them and to gain a better understanding of their vision of Europe. I should also like to express my thanks to Parliament for the flexibility it has shown in organising these hearings, which nevertheless retained all their substance and stringency. These hearings provided you with an opportunity to ask the Commissioners-designate serious and complex questions, and I believe that the answers they gave to these questions were very good ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst presenting my team to you today, I should of course like to reaffirm my commitment to the establishment of a new group of Commissioners responsible for basic rights, the fight against discrimination and equal opportunities, as well as my intention to put forward proposals on a series of ambitious measures aimed at strengthening our respect for basic rights. This is an issue which touches upon all areas and which all Commissioners must bear in mind, and this is why I myself will act as chairman of the group with Mr Frattini, Vice-President of the Commission, as vice-chairman.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have taken other steps as announced before the October part-session, which include the putting in place of extremely strict procedures to avoid any conflicts of interest with regard to competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken as a whole, these changes have made it possible for us to retain the balance of the original team. The new Commission still has a higher proportion of women than any Commission before it, and the Commissioners bring with them a broad range of political experience and an in-depth knowledge of the European Union. It should not be forgotten, however, that the Commission gains its strength from the collegiality it embodies, which is enshrined in the Treaties and which forms part of the history and beliefs of the Commission. Provision is made in the Treaty for the Commission to be approved as a whole. I would therefore call on you, when voting, to judge us on our capacity to serve the European interest, both individually as a Commission and jointly with this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that we are intent on working in an open and transparent fashion. I hope that our work together will be based on mutual respect, which has been strengthened during the approval process and which I hope will be reflected in a renewed framework agreement. If this is the case, we will be able to provide constructive answers to the issues raised in the motions for resolutions upon which you will be asked to vote, and to which I shall respond tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to return to my invitation last July to build a partnership for Europe, a partnership for prosperity, solidarity and security. Now we urgently need to get back to work. Both in July and last month, I set out our policy priorities and concerns in some detail, so I do not wish to repeat them today. Nevertheless, whatever our priorities and objectives, we can do more by acting together than we can by acting separately.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add two comments. First, I believe the Union, the European Commission and this Parliament can emerge stronger from this process of approval. We may not agree on every issue. Like any family, we will have arguments and differences. However, let me assure you that this Commission will, with your help, play its leadership role. It will strive to lead a dynamic coalition reflecting the views of this Parliament and promoting the common European interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, with this new strength comes greater responsibility; a responsibility to work together; a responsibility to forge a relationship built on mutual respect and shared confidence in Europe's future; a responsibility to deliver results which make a difference to the lives of Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to shift the focus from who we are and where we have come from to where we want to go. We must implement a positive agenda for change. We must create the conditions for growth and jobs, sharing prosperity and opportunity across the whole Union. To do this we must put a premium on innovation, education and research. We must exploit knowledge to promote growth.</p>
<p class="contents">If I refer to the economy first, it is not because it is an end in itself, but because a strong and dynamic economy is a precondition for our ambitious social and environmental goals. We must reinforce European democracy, reconnecting the Union with the people, and work towards the ratification of our new Constitution. We must reach out across our continent to make a success of our recent enlargement. We must work to improve the quality of life within a modern European model based on economic dynamism and social justice. We must reaffirm the Union's pre-eminent role as an area of freedom and justice and we must consolidate our leadership in striving for peace, security and sustainable development around the globe. We must, therefore, shape a Europe for future generations and capture the imagination and enthusiasm of our young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I ask you for your confidence so that we can start this task. With your support we can build a better Europe. My team is ready and anxious to play its part. So let us now get on with our job!</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When the President-in-Office of the European Council is present, he deserves our appreciation for it. I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, to persuade your successor to follow your example when important debates are held in this House in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It was on 29 June, Mr President of the Commission, that the Heads of State or Government nominated you to your position. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly welcomed this nomination and still does so from where we stand today, knowing as we do that you possess the capacity and willingness to head up a strong Commission. On 22 July, here in this Chamber, you were elected President of the Commission with 413 votes, representing far more than the absolute majority. It was with a large degree of unanimity that our Group expressed its confidence in you, which it still has today and without reservations. On 27 October, with no certainty of a majority for them, you took the decision not to put your team to the vote. Had a vote taken place, the college of Commissioners would have had the PPE-DE Group’s virtually unanimous endorsement. What it would not have got was support from two of the other groups, which it might have had expectations or prospects of receiving. This being the situation facing you, your decision not to put your Commission to the vote on 27 October was the right one; I might add that it was the one we recommended to you. On 1 November, Mr Buttiglione, whose convictions had been the subject of a surge of emotionalism hitherto unknown in either this House or among the European public, told a press conference in Rome that he was no longer available to serve on the Commission, adding that he wanted to open the way to broad support for the Commission with you, Mr Barroso, as its President. Speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to express our gratitude and appreciation to Mr Buttiglione for this noble gesture.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Buttiglione’s decision opened the gate to more changes. The Italian Government put forward Mr Frattini as its new candidate. It became apparent from the hearings that Mr Frattini is an outstanding personality, competent, persuasive, and astute, with an in-depth knowledge of his brief. Mr Piebalgs, the new candidate from Latvia, gave a convincing and impressive account of himself. Let me also add – quite soberly and calmly – that many of our group would have welcomed it if the Hungarian Government had followed the example of its Latvian counterpart and changed its candidate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What, now, are the conclusions we should draw from the events of the past few weeks? Let me put forward three of them. Firstly, we must call to mind our European values. Underlying our liberal European society is respect for the dignity of each and every individual person, as well as tolerance, pluralism and the rule of law. Every human being has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Our European cultural identity derives its strength from our acceptance and toleration of cultural differences. If we abandon that, I am convinced that Europe will collapse, and what that means is that nobody in the European Union, nobody in Europe, nobody in the world, must suffer discrimination, not even on account of his or her religious convictions.</p>
<p class="contents">My second conclusion is this. We want a strong Commission and a strong European Parliament. The Commission and the European Parliament are allies in the defence of the community of Europe. At the same time, Parliament exercises parliamentary control over the Commission, and so what we expect of you, Mr Barroso, and of the Commission as a whole, is that you and all the Commission’s members should make yourselves available to Parliament whenever the European Parliament so requires. We propose that we should hold a debate here in this House in December on Parliament’s political priorities for the legislative period leading up to 2009, and from what we say in it you will be able to come to your own conclusions as regards the programme that we expect from you from January onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Council and the governments must in future give the President greater discretion when it comes to appointing individual Commissioners and allocating their portfolios. Our expectation of the governments is therefore that they should work together better with the President-designate of the Commission in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The hour of decision is now upon us. In the vote, a very large majority of the PPE-DE Group will be expressing its confidence in the Commission. The PPE-DE Group wishes you, Mr Barroso, and all your Commission, every success in the onerous task of working for the well-being of the citizens of the European Union and for the unity of our continent.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the speech you delivered today, Mr Barroso, demonstrates that substantial changes have taken place since your last speech, when you were presenting your proposals for the Commission – these have been changes in the right direction, changes demonstrating that you have drawn conclusions from what happened before the last plenary part-session here in Strasbourg. We believe that you should have learned those lessons earlier, but never mind; you have arrived at the right answers, and the proposals you have announced today and will be presenting tomorrow are better than what you put forward a fortnight ago. This Commission is of higher quality. That is progress, and it could have been much better than it is. It is at this point that I will address Mr Balkenende and say that it could have been much better than it is if your government, Mr Balkenende, had acted to resolve an issue about which we have had very lively discussions and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However much regard I have for your Presidency of the Council and for you personally, I found it regrettable that the Italian Government took a more flexible approach than did its Dutch counterpart. I think we will have to have further discussions about the conclusions we should draw from what happened. Mr Barroso has alluded to some of them, and it is a subject to which I shall shortly return.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing, though, is perfectly clear, and that is that if this House has become stronger in relation to the Commission and also the Council – and it has become stronger – then my group has played a decisive part in that. Of that I am proud, but, as we have just heard, there are always many who can claim a share in credit for victory. That those who sat out the battle hiding in the bushes should now, apparently, be the loudest in proclaiming victory, may well be understandable in human terms, but it is not politically justified.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are another two points that we will have to sort out with Mr Barroso. Firstly, you have announced that you will be carrying on with the agreements that Mr Prodi made with Parliament following the change of Commission in 1999. You will have to be more precise about what you mean by that. This is an issue to which we have returned in the resolutions we have submitted. Making things more precise means that we assume that the undertaking still stands according to which Commissioners leave the Commission as and when you demand that they do so and that this will initially be dealt with within the Commission. We also take it as read that you accept, in individual cases where there is hard evidence from Commissioners’ conduct in office of incompatibilities with their previous activities, that you will have recourse to this when Parliament requires it. That is what we expect of you, and I think there were indications in what you said today, that you do, and that you will go into more detail about it tomorrow. It also features in our resolution and is something on which we insist.</p>
<p class="contents">In the previous part-session, Mr Barroso, you attempted – and were, I think, ill-advised to do so – to get together a majority to defeat the Socialist Group, but in that you did not succeed. If there have been changes in this Commission, they have come about as a result of proposals made by the Socialist Group and of vigorous pressure exerted by it. If you want a broad majority in this House, you will not get one without the Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, and also because a large proportion of your Commissioners belongs to our political family, I recommend that you seek our group’s cooperation. A Commission supported by a broad majority in this House is a strong Commission; that would in any case be better than to depend on the votes of the extreme Right. That, today, is something I want to have set down.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you gain our approval, that is approval for the composition of this Commission and a signal for the work to begin. It is not a statement about the legislative programme that you will be putting forward in January, which we will judge, not by the people in the Commission, but by its contents. The 200 Social Democrats sitting in this Chamber were elected because the people of Europe have expectations; they do not want the social achievements that we, the European Left, have successfully fought for in the Member States of the European Union to be cut back by a Commission in Brussels; on the contrary, they expect that Commission to secure them. That is particularly true of the Lisbon process, which is a process of growth, but must also be a process leading to social cohesion and social stability. By that we shall judge you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that we are willing to cooperate constructively with you and with your Commission. Mr Barroso, I have had many opportunities for discussions with you over the past weeks, and it was only yesterday that I saw at first hand your own hard work, for which you have my personal respect. I sometimes wonder whether that hard work is a response to the pressures of the situation. If it were no more than that, that would be a bad thing, but if what we have here is an ongoing endeavour, if you – as you stated in your speech – know that the Commission whose President you are is composed of diverse political tendencies, the same as are to be found in the Council, in the make-up of the governments represented in it, and in this House, and that in all three institutions Social Democrats have a decisive role to play, and if you bear that in mind in your own personal work, in the work of the Commission and in your legislative proposals, then you can expect the Social Democrats in this House to support you. If you fail to take that to heart, then remember October 2004, for that is what will then happen again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Four weeks ago, Mr President-elect, your rooster refused to crow. Tomorrow I believe it will.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, Liberals and Democrats were satisfied with the performance of the new reshuffled Commission. Mr Piebalgs and Mr Kovács did well. Mr Frattini was soft on specifics, but sharp in general. He has the capacity to be an impressive Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, although he might need to disown much of the record of his patron in Rome in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a better Commission. I challenge anyone in this House to say otherwise. I challenge anyone to say that Parliament was not right to demand that you remake it.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats stand by our approvals with the same conviction that set us against Mr Buttiglione. We were forced to define your college by its weakest link. That link has been replaced and today we acknowledge the strengths of the college. It has real talent and deep reserves of competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament is asked to do the work of scrutinising the Commission, but given only the rudest tools for the job. The Treaty gives Parliament the bluntest possible instrument; the heaviest possible sanction and nothing else. In political terms, the Treaty offers only the possibility of destroying the town in order to save it.</p>
<p class="contents">A system of checks and balances that has no middle ground between the cosmetic and the crisis is not worthy of European government and for that reason the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe must attach a price to our support tomorrow. We expect that if, during your term, Parliament withdraws its confidence from any of your Commissioners, you will come before this House to address the failing. You will either defend that Commissioner on your personal authority or you will ask for a resignation.</p>
<p class="contents">In July you wrote the principle of individual responsibility of Commissioners into your speeches. Well, today we want that promise in stone.</p>
<p class="contents">The current framework agreement stresses that the Commission President will 'seriously consider' any such withdrawal of confidence. That is not enough. This House wants more than 'serious consideration' and we will not consider your Commission serious without it.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we must now rise consistently to the challenge of critical partnership that we laid down a month ago. There has been too much talk of political retribution in this House; there have been too many attempts, here and elsewhere, to govern this process as if it were a sideshow of the internal politics of Parliament and not the selection of a European government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz, my Group may not agree with your assessment of individual Commissioners, but we acknowledge that you have sought a dialogue with Mr Barroso which respects the necessity and the inevitability of compromise. To the green and red banners of the permanent opposition, I would say this: there is no dignity or honour or even refusenik glamour in voting against an agreement on this Commission which respects Parliament's complaint within the constraints of the possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-elect, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats is ready to give you and your Commission its support.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has considered it very important to fight for the European Parliament to make its own voice heard on an important issue: respect for a common European feeling in the matter of freedom and non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The choice of those – among whom I include you, Mr Pottering, Mr Watson – who cried sacrilege, an apocalyptic crisis over something so mundane as the demand to change a team that was not working, has proved to be mistaken. Contrary to what was thought, public opinion has understood and supported what happened here perfectly. This, it seems to me, is something that should be strongly emphasised. Nevertheless, my group has decided unanimously not to support your Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The modifications that you have made are minimal, and even if they have cleared the field of the awkward presence of Rocco Buttiglione, they have not solved the more serious problems. Above all, they keep your Commission in an unacceptably weak and vulnerable position. It is true, Mr Watson, this Commission is better than the one we had on 27 October, but we could have had one that was better still.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to regard it as an error, leaving aside his personal competence, for a Commissioner for Justice to be nominated who is a minister who has signed a farcical law on conflict of interest and who comes from a government led by a man, Silvio Berlusconi, for whom a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment for corruption has just been demanded.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yet, alas, the Berlusconisation of Europe proceeds apace, and with your Commission conflict of interest becomes a European vice. It is precisely from the Netherlands, a country that is always ready to deliver grand lectures on morality, that there arises a case that we see as more problematic. Without wishing to underestimate the negative impact that Mrs Fischer Boel’s conflict of interest may have on the common agricultural policy, it is the clear that the case of Mrs Kroes represents the most dangerous landmine on the road to credibility for your Commission, Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The ridiculous statistics produced by the Commission on the basis of invalid calculations cannot disguise the fact that if Mrs Kroes had been in Mr Monti’s post, she would have had to stand aside in no less than 35 cases. What is more, the statistics indicate that there are three cases at the moment on which the Commission will be a lame duck and will have little credibility: reform of the competition rules in the maritime transport sector, the investigations under way in the so-called ‘bitumen cartel’ (which is a particularly serious case because Mrs Kroes was until a few weeks ago a member of one of the businesses in question), and finally, the inquiry into a possible abuse of its dominant position by the British mobile telephone operator <span class="italic">mmO2</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition – frankly, it is a little ridiculous that a ‘Green’ should bring this to Parliament’s attention when it and the Commission are full of liberals – represents one of the cornerstones of the Union’s credibility, and the responsible Commissioner must be above all suspicion.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, please explain to us why you want to make Europe run this risk. Why, after having lived through the Santer crisis, the Eurostat polemics and the Buttiglione psychodrama, do you take responsibility for weakening your Commission to this level? It is true that you are not alone in sharing this responsibility: Messrs Shultz, Poettering and Watson have helped to shoulder it. They took fright at their great success on 27 October and wished to return to being an acquiescent Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not for us and the responsibility will not be ours if there is trouble. The responsibility for the future of your institution will lie with you, and with the groups who have offered sacrifices to contingent party interests and to counting how many Commissioners belong to their own political families.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, Mr President, in our opinion the choice of Stavros Dimas for the environment is not by chance. It reflects the precise hierarchy of priorities in your Commission, where the environment is not to be found. Nevertheless, we are certainly ready to try a sort of charm offensive towards Commissioner Dimas and also to admit that we were wrong if he proves to have more energy and more competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Very quickly, Mr President, I should like to conclude by saying that not only is the composition of your Commission a problem but also the direction in which this Commission wishes to go. We shall try to act as an opposition in an absolutely constructive spirit, and we hope occasionally to convince you that our road is the correct one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This assessment did not relate just to the tip of the iceberg, that is to say the Buttiglione affair, but to the overall profile of this college, marked by unbounded liberalism. The holders of the competition, internal market, external trade, agriculture, environment, and a few other, portfolios were particularly targeted, as well as the holder of the justice, freedom and security portfolio. In the meantime, the President of the Commission has had to distance himself from the person who brought about the scandal so as not to run the risk of an additional and, in this case, probably definitive defeat before Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that, setting aside this key concession, Mr Barroso has applied homeopathic treatment where the disease required a surgical operation. The patient is in danger of suffering greatly in the future as a result of this serious diagnostic error. Frankly, I fear that it is not so much a diagnostic error as a deliberate choice. One need only consider what I have had occasion to call, if you will excuse the term, the double provocation caused to a large minority of MEPs and the millions of people they represent by confirmation that the highly significant competition portfolio and the justice and freedom portfolio had been awarded to, respectively, Mrs Kroes and Mr Berlusconi’s right-hand man.</p>
<p class="contents">The former is known for her deep involvement in the business world, a position particularly conducive to confusion between public responsibilities and private interests. Mr Barroso is thus taking the risk of putting in place a veritable machine for producing conflicts of interest and of doing so in the Commission’s main area of competence, that in which it has discretionary power.</p>
<p class="contents">The latter Commissioner-designate has emerged from a select band of people who will scarcely go down in history as the most assiduous defenders of justice or as unrivalled promoters of freedoms. The date on which the Commission takes up office is even in danger of coinciding with the general strike of Italian magistrates in protest against the future justice and freedom Commissioner’s godfather, accused of corrupting magistrates and liable, it has been said, to an eight-year prison sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has just decided to launch the <span class="italic">Communicating Europe </span>programme. Where the Commission is concerned, this has got off to a rather bad start. Unfortunately, what we have here are not just mistakes in casting but considered decisions. That is much worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, your team will no doubt be confirmed in office tomorrow, but will be so without our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that a Christian and Eurosceptic has now been removed has not mollified us. We have not obtained the assurances of transparency and public scrutiny we requested. Mr Barroso’s Commission was not inclined to promise that the EU’s auditors and the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control could now be given permission to audit every voucher for the use of EU money.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has Mr Barroso’s Commission promised us full details of the Commission’s more than 3 000 working groups. Who is involved in these groups, what do the groups do, who set them up and what do they cost the taxpayers? Where is the will to draw a line under the sins and errors of the past? When will apologies be made to heroic whistleblowers such as Paul van Buitenem and Dorte Smith Brown? When will sacked chief accountant Marta Andreasen have her dismissal notice exchanged for a medal in recognition of her services? Those employees who help clear up fraud and who prevent fraud must be rewarded rather than punished.</p>
<p class="contents">The people who should be punished are those who conceal fraud, who are responsible for its being possible to go on committing fraud and who refuse to introduce the public scrutiny that exists in each and every one of our countries. We need a Commission that will introduce general law and order. Let us hope that Mr Barroso will support his Vice-President, Mr Kallas, and that they will together show uncompromising openness and zero tolerance of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Each country should elect its own Commissioner and hold him or her politically responsible, while Members of the European Parliament should be able to monitor their conduct as European administrators and, if need be, request the Court of Justice to sack them for dereliction of duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Briefly, we expect the creation of a Europe that can at last take on an effective and realistic role. There are many aims that cannot be postponed further: in the first place, we need the much discussed revision of the Stability Pact, so that it becomes a pact for growth and development also. On that subject, we shall insist on the inclusion of the so-called ‘golden rule’ – the rule that allows spending on research and investment to be removed from the computation of public debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental subject is the fight against illegal immigration and terrorism. This cannot be reduced to repression alone, but must be directed towards the implementation of a plan for economic aid to the poorest countries of the Middle East and to developing countries, thereby acting on the most basic causes of the problem, which can be identified first and foremost as lying in poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the common foreign and security policy. After the implementation of monetary union, we need finally to take realistic steps to ensure that Europe plays a leading role on the international stage. It is therefore fundamentally important to open a debate on reform of the United Nations Security Council, such that the European Union can afterwards lay claim to a decisive role. What matters is that this Europe does not stay looking on, in its torpor and its rhetoric, but instead makes itself active and efficacious in practice on the international scene.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to remind Mr Schulz that the European Commission has the precise and democratic duty to deal with the whole of Parliament and must not reach an accommodation – as he maintained – with one political group alone. His observations amount to – and excuse me for using a term that may be a little too vehement – vague blackmail, and are unworthy of a major group such as that which he represents.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me a closing line: we hope that the same degree of fervour employed by one part of this Parliament in the anti-Buttiglione, and also somewhat anti-Italian, crusade will be directed in future to the better cause of a Europe that is a practical and effective exponent of the aspirations of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time I would like to draw its attention to questions of economic growth. The European Union began life primarily as an economic grouping which, on the basis of growing economic power, could have a positive effect on foreign policy processes. I therefore consider it to be a warning sign that the economic growth of the Eurozone is noticeably lagging behind that of its major world competitors such as the USA, China, Russia, and others.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Strategy has foundered without even reaching the halfway point, and the crucial developmental instruments of the European Union are failing. The enormous resources invested in the agricultural sector mainly serve to remedy inefficient production or to encourage a decline in production. Resources aimed at structural operations that would stimulate the economy of the European Union have largely dried up, while the commitments remain. Thus we are silent witnesses as the total sum of the legally founded budget obligations of the European Union reaches EUR 200 billion , corresponding to the equivalent of five years‘ contributions. Moreover, the pre-accession and post-accession aid to the new Member States is also lagging behind.

<p class="contents">I must congratulate you, because the hearings have shown that you acted swiftly and intelligently. You have managed to create the climate required for that essential partnership to take place. It is essential because, let us not be under any illusions, what the general public and Parliament hope for from the incoming Commission is a clear vision and clear guidelines for action on the Lisbon Strategy, on Transatlantic relations, on the Financial Perspectives, on enlargement and on negotiations with Turkey. In short, they hope that we shall finally have a Commission with a vision, a Commission that is not afraid to take risks, a Commission with objectives, a Commission that is able to work with the Council and with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sure, in our Group, and, I believe I can say today, in Parliament, that you have the necessary personal attributes and that you have set up a Commission with the necessary attributes to make the incoming Commission a great one for Europe, one that serves us well in all three Institutions. Good luck. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is a triumph for you personally, but also for the Commission, for this House and – most important of all – for the people, for the voters in this Europe of ours. The fact is that quite a few voters have said to me – and, I am sure, to other Members too, ‘Now I know why I voted in the elections for the European Parliament’. I hope the reason why all those people who tell me that turned up to vote was because it had dawned on them that actually turning up to vote, and the way they voted, makes a difference. I believe that means that it is not just a victory for individuals, but a victory for us together, and I also believe that both the Commission and Parliament have come out of this process stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Poettering, let me turn briefly to the business with Mr Buttiglione, around which so many myths have gathered. One of your vice-chairmen said at a discussion in Vienna that it was quite extraordinary that a Communist could become a member of the European Commission, whereas a Catholic could not, and that, precisely, is what I find extremely problematic in view of the myths that are being generated. We all know and respect many of the Presidents of the Commission who were Catholics, and I take it as read that former Commissions – and certainly this one, although I have not checked – included or include many Catholics and persons of other faiths. That is perfectly acceptable, but that is not what it was all about. What it was about was whether Mr Buttiglione was suitable for the office to which there were plans to appoint him.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else I have to tell you, Mr Poettering, because you had a lot to say about tolerance and because I can thoroughly agree with much of what was in your speech: when the same Member attended the hearings of Mr Kovács and used the same argument with reference to him – a man who helped to bring down the Communist regime, who played an active part in bringing about a single and shared Europe – there were those in your group who regarded it as disgraceful that one of their party colleagues should take such a line. That Member is not here, but I hope that, today or tomorrow, when we give our broad support to this Commission, a stop will be put to underhand moves of this kind, and we will be able to cooperate constructively with the new Commission. I also hope that is what your approval of the Commission means.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me consider two more points of substance, the first of which has to do with the social dimension. Mr Schulz has already gone into detail about it: at these elections, we have seen how many citizens – by no means all of whom voted for us, although most did – are affected by a high level of unemployment and by the renewed increase in poverty on this continent; this means that there is an obligation on this Commission to do everything possible to create more jobs and also put social security systems on a sustainable footing. That is not an argument against reforms, but we are profoundly sceptical about much of what is to be found in, for example, the Working Times Directive or in the Services Directive. The problem is not that there is more competition, but it is problematic when competitiveness is won at the price of worsening social benefits or deteriorating working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment must be that cooperation with the United States of America is of particular importance. The United States of America is getting a new administration, which is in part the same as the old one. They are getting a new Secretary of State. Our Commissioner with responsibility for foreign relations will have to work together a great deal with Condoleezza Rice, but let me recall what you, Mr President, said at the outset of your Presidency, that we wanted to work together with America as equals, and what we expect of your Commission is not some kind of anti-American policy, which would be foolish, but we do expect an independent policy, one that can enable us to be proud of it as Europeans and to work confidently together with America, correcting it where it makes mistakes and telling it so, frankly, honestly and clearly. Such are our expectations of your Commission, and I hope you will be able to meet them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will have noticed that. I am convinced, though, that democracy must be fought for day by day, and that, if we want democracy in Europe, we cannot wait for permission to be given before going into battle for it. So we urge you to prepare yourself; we Liberals and Democrats will be a critical partner over the next few years. We expect you, even now the composition of the Commission has changed, to put people and citizens’ rights first. We also demand that you pursue an economic policy guided quite explicitly by the principles of the market economy and one that takes to heart the truth that you cannot distribute what you have not earned.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be a policy that requires reforms of the kind that are so very necessary in many Member States, including my own country, and so I ask you to very carefully observe whence criticism of your policies or even of individual Commissioners comes. It may be that it is not so much about the individual; perhaps it originates from that quarter that questions the principles of the market economy and is afraid of liberalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, we also hope that you will join with us in a common commitment to bring more democracy into Europe. We – your Commission and us in this House – should be allies against the national defenders of the status quo, who are to be found above all in the Council. For that, it is necessary that you should respect this House not only in extreme situations, and should also see us for what we are – the assembly of Europe’s citizens. As Karl Popper once put it, who rules is not important; what is important is that bad governments should be able to be voted out of office, and on that we take our stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Forced by the democratic will of the Chamber, Mr Barroso had to withdraw his proposal. That was important in strengthening the European institutions and Europe itself as a political entity.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger of a Commission not supported by this Parliament forced Mr Barroso to make new proposals and that was a good day for our institution. The most visible problem was supposed to be Mr Buttiglione's controversial statement during the hearing, but that was merely symptomatic. In the past we have had several Commissioners with the same opinions and nothing happened. In fact, the problem was that the majority of Parliament thought that the Commission should be a better one, more in accordance with real European needs and with European institutions and more sensitive to European peoples and stateless nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the European Free Alliance, part of the Verts/ALE Group, are convinced that your new proposal is not substantially different from the old one. Mr Barroso, when you asked for more time three weeks ago in Strasbourg, we hoped you would bring us a better proposal. But we have seen that you are in a way a prisoner of the will of the Member States. You are not free to build a Commission based on the general interests of Europe, as distinct from the interests of each Member State. We parliamentarians have no freedom to choose the Commission and each of its members on our own. For that reason, Mr Barroso, we cannot back your proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU is going through a period of immense change and in the months ahead countries will debate and vote on key issues, most notably the EU Constitution. There was a real opportunity following enlargement to come forward with a Commission which was open and progressive and which could have a positive impact on those inside and outside the European Union's borders. Unfortunately, this has not happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, we in Sinn Fein expressed our opposition to the incoming European Commission because we were deeply concerned at the political and policy complexion of that Commission. For us this was never about individuals or the personal convictions held by some within the European Commission. Our analysis is rooted in the manifesto that we presented to the Irish electorate in this year's European elections. In that manifesto we set out a clear and radical vision of Europe based on principles of equality, justice and human rights. We also made clear our opposition to the continued erosion of public services and social welfare provision Europe-wide and the role that the EU is playing in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">During the September hearings, many of the proposed Commissioners outlined support for social and economic policies that will actively undermine equality, justice and social solidarity. There are also, as previous speakers have noted, a number of proposed Commissioners who have serious questions to answer with respect to their record when acting as ministers in their home states.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the rhetoric, the Commission that you present today, Mr Barroso, represents only minimal and cosmetic changes to your team. It is on this basis, and not through any desire for refusenik glamour, that Sinn Fein MEPs cannot support the European Commission team.</p>

We are opposed to this mockery of a state which the European Union aspires to be, as well as to a Commission that is playing at being a government and that apparently needs to be confirmed in office. Obviously, we cannot tolerate all that.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we tolerate the atmosphere in which your Commission has been constituted, Mr Barroso: that of a witch-hunt. Firstly, let it be noted that the Member States have been dispossessed of their last prerogatives in respect of the Commission, since two of them have had to back down. For us, that is, of course, a worrying phenomenon. Then there was the sacrifice of Mrs Udre who, far from just being suspected of prevarication, was accused of being critical of Europe. Apparently, the totalitarian enterprise known as the European Union cannot tolerate the slightest internal criticism. Finally, we dislike the general atmosphere because of the fate reserved for Mr Buttiglione, who was thrown to the lions in the Coliseum. By signing the would-be European Constitution on Capitol Hill on 29 October, the Heads of State or Government also turned their backs on the Vatican and on our Christian roots, a wayward move that, in our view, is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that French Catholics – indeed, French and European Christians – will remember this episode and know that Europe is, without a doubt, turning its back on its roots. I think it is an illusion to believe that, in such conditions – that is to say, by severing our roots – we can make much progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we supported Mr Barroso and we are not ashamed of this. We believe we were right to do so, as he is a guarantee that this Commission will achieve good results and be a good European Commission. We also believe it is in the interest of many Member States, especially those whose economies are weaker, for us to have a strong Commission, and we hope Mr Barroso’s Commission will be a strong Commission serving the idea of European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, we were confronted with an extremely worrying precedent, namely that under the influence of the extreme Left in this House, and of ideological prejudices held by Members of this House, Mr Buttiglione’s, nomination was withdrawn. We believe he would have been a good Commissioner. In fact, Mr Buttiglione is no longer a member of this Commission. By way of contrast, this House was ready to overlook the totalitarian past of certain Commissioners and their membership of the criminal Communist Party. In our opinion, this means that double moral standards are currently being applied. The standards applied to European citizens who hold conservative views, notably Catholics, are not those applied to Communists, people who worked to promote a criminal ideology and the subjugation of their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For the members of the Law and Justice (PiS) delegation within the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, however, the principle of Member States’ sovereignty is of paramount importance. We recognise that the European Commission as it stands has been negotiated by sovereign states and the sovereign governments of sovereign European nations, and we therefore reject this House’s right to question the decisions of the Member States. We cannot, however, vote against this Commission, because we believe, and this is a point I should like to stress, that the House has no right to question the decisions of the Member States’ governments. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, however, we will at the same time be unable to vote in favour of this Commission, despite our great respect for Mr Barroso and many of his Commissioners. Without wishing to stand in the way of the Commission’s election, we intend to abstain from voting, whilst wishing Mr Barroso and his Commission the best of luck in their work for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nothing else has changed; we now know that there are serious things lurking in the appointees’ pasts. What does Mrs Kroes want to take decisions about? How careful must Mrs Fischer Boel be if she is not to take the wrong decisions? As for Mr Kovács, he has apparently, in the space of nine days, become a tax expert, having previously known nothing of the subject. If such a thing is possible, then any European citizen, soon perhaps even a woman, could take a fortnight to become Pope.</p>
<p class="contents">This is no way to go about things; an opportunity is being squandered. There is no transparency, and the Commission is more neo-liberal than any of those that have gone before it. What a pity that there are so many in this House whose courage has deserted them; there has not, in fact, been that much change as yet. We must once again take it as read – indeed, we already know – that the party leaders and Heads of Government, be they Schroeder or Blair or anyone else, have been on the phone, not only to you, Mr Barroso, but also to the widest possible variety of their colleagues.</p>

<p class="contents">We are in any case bound by the provisions of the Treaty. The composition of the Commission requires interaction on the part of the institutions. It is the responsibility of each of the institutions, ourselves included, to ensure that a Commission actually exists at a specific moment in time. This time, the delivery has not been an easy one, but, Mr President-elect, as soon as the child is strong enough, he will certainly be able to develop and flourish.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to this that we must devote our shared efforts, each with our own task to perform, and so let us work together honestly, faithfully, constructively and productively – not for the sake of our own comfort, but because it is what people now expect of us. People are not bothered about who does what; they judge by the final balance, by what the EU does for them, and they want to have their say. So, Mr President-elect, let us make the partnership work to which you have made reference twice before, a partnership between the institutions, the Member States, the social partners, consumers and the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore get to work with an ambitious programme, concluding agreements that allow us the maximum of opportunity to get to grips with the real challenges that face us. And, whilst this obviously means putting enlargement into practice and promoting the ratification of the Constitution, it is also and primarily incumbent on us that we work out how we can help to realise the Lisbon targets of growth, work, prosperity and a better quality of life. For us, it means that we sort out asylum and immigration policy and do so in a humane manner. It means that we combat terrorism without tampering with fundamental freedoms and that the EU can play an important part on the international stage.</p>

The first debate, three weeks ago, primarily concerned itself with problems around the nomination of a number of new Commissioners and with the lack of cooperation between Parliament and the incoming President where the composition of the new Commission was concerned. Then, the eyes of all Europe’s media were upon this House. Everyone was asking themselves whether a majority in the European Parliament would be prepared to accept the logical consequence of the work done in the hearings over the previous weeks. The specific question was whether a majority in this House would be able to summon up the discipline and the courage to deliver, in their final resolution, a substantial, fact-based weighing-up of the qualities of the individual Commissioners and of the new European Commission as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">What eventually came out was the statement that ‘No, we do not have the confidence that the Commission, as at present proposed, will in the best possible way be able to defend the interests of the European public’, and this represented a manifest victory for Parliament. Through, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the united stance of my own group, it became apparent that the European Parliament was prepared, and able, to make the best possible use of the options available to it to get Mr Barroso to make the necessary adjustments to the Commission he had presented. The hearings we have had this week with the candidate Commissioners have indicated that, in terms of quality, the Commission has been improved by this.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that it appears that everyone has emerged stronger from the dispute surrounding the appointment of the new Commission. Parliament formulated its position in a serious and open debate, and in an open process of hearings. This enabled it to make clear that its position, having been reached openly and on the basis of consideration of the facts, deserves to be respected and to be taken very much to heart by the other European institutions, the Commission and the Council. Parliament’s position and prestige are thereby very definitely reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, and its future President, have, however, albeit at a very late stage in the proceedings, found a way to cooperate with this House and resolve the outstanding problems. This new way of cooperating will ultimately also mean that the Commission will be in a stronger position, something that will be useful to it in discussions and negotiations with the Member States over the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">As we see it, one group, united, has been able to make it clear that it is not possible, in European politics, to push through resolutions with the support of just one political force in this House. We are prepared to take upon ourselves responsibility for the future policy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual core point that I want to make, though, is that the real winners are the European public. They have been able to see that this House is willing to take seriously the battle to make Europe as good as it can be. The debate, which was at times hard-fought, on the putting together of the Commission, has given their votes in the European elections a manifest added value. Parliament and the Commission also have, as I see it, the grave obligation to flesh out, over the coming years, the added value that we have gained for ourselves over past weeks; in my experience of contacts with people in the Netherlands who voted for me, these events have in any case considerably enhanced Parliament’s prestige. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the first presentation of your Commission, you in fact took until the last second of the last minute of the last hour finally to appreciate that there was a problem. You gave way before our Parliament, not so much out of respect for our institution but because you had no other option. As I see it, that showed how indifferent you were for a time to what we were saying. The fact is, it was your responsibility and your duty to understand us, to hear us and to support us in this matter. You should have been on our side. Mistakenly, you chose to be on the side of the Heads of State or Government. You then deliberately chose to offer us a merely partial and limited response.</p>
<p class="contents">In the space of a few weeks, you had two historic opportunities, Mr Barroso, to affirm your independence of the Council, and you decided not to do so. That does not augur well for all those who do not want an intergovernmental Europe but who, instead, want to construct a genuinely political and democratic Europe. Tomorrow, there will be no suspense. You will receive the formal approval of our Parliament. You will still, however, have the most vital task ahead of you: that of finally winning the confidence of the majority of MEPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The CAP, to which the European Union still devotes almost half of its budget, does indeed loom large for the EU. What, moreover, is at stake is the future of our rural areas, our food, our health and our relations with developing countries, as well as making a success of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the position of the majority of farmers is now very difficult, and this in spite of a food-processing industry that, in itself, is flourishing. What with the disappearance of small to medium-sized farms due to the persistent injustices linked to subsidies; trade wars that have little to do with the fair competition otherwise enjoined upon us; the deterioration of the environment, including our soil and water; and ever more standardised and artificial food, the CAP has, in our view, a very great deal to answer for.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform adopted in 2003, which is still very liberal in its inspiration, does not, unfortunately, enable these problems to be treated satisfactorily, and your answers on the subject have been particularly feeble and evasive. We would therefore ask you right now to take a very serious look at these issues. We cannot approve a Commission that comes up with such feeble answers in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You know, President Barroso, that in the matter of justice the conduct of the Italian Government, of which Minister Frattini is still part, has provoked a joint strike of magistrates and lawyers.</p>

We therefore observed the Commissioners-designate who took part in hearings before the individual parliamentary committees very closely. There was one of these 25 Commissioners-designate whose abilities were unquestionable, and who, as a lawyer, political scientist and experienced statesman, met the necessary criteria in every respect. Yet Mr Buttiglione fell victim to blatant discrimination in this House because of his Catholic beliefs, even though these beliefs would have had no bearing, as he assured us, on the quality of his work. I therefore fully concur with the view held by Cardinal Friedrich Wetter, Archbishop of Munich. The Archbishop pointed out that not one of the founding fathers of the uniting Europe would have any chance of becoming a Commissioner in today’s European Union. It follows from my previous statements that the way in which the EU currently operates is a travesty of the ideas of Jean Monnet, Alcide de Gasperi, Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Out of respect for the right of Member States’ governments to appoint the Commission, I intended to vote in favour of the Commission initially presented by Mr Barroso. It was an expression of the pluralism in European politics, and Parliament had to live with the fact that there were Commissioners with whose positions we disagreed. As is well known, a majority of this Parliament did not wish to approve the Commission because of a single conservative Catholic Commissioner-designate, Mr Buttiglioni, who had some old-fashioned views on homosexuality and the position of women in society. Now, Mr Buttiglioni has been replaced following negotiations between the President of the Commission and Parliament’s group chairmen – not because of his actions but because of his personal views. There are still nominated candidates with a Communist past. Someone is still designated Commissioner for Competition who scarcely has the required independence for that post.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of the Member States to appoint Commissioners themselves is therefore contested when the Commissioners concerned are Catholics with right-wing leanings but not when they are Communists and people with special financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not a Catholic, and I do not share Mr Buttiglioni’s view of homosexuals or of female equality but, in the light of the clearly dictatorial censorship of opinion in the opposition to Mr Buttiglioni, I intend to vote against this Commission, which has been constituted in a way that does not reflect the various political positions in Europe. The EU contains, for example, Communists, as well as Catholics with right-wing leanings who share Mr Buttiglioni’s position. Only the first of these political positions is permitted according to this Parliament’s majority view. What is happening in this case is a very dangerous enforced orthodoxy, and I do not wish to be a party to approving this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I do so, however, I should like to remind you of the comments you made when you asked this House for its vote of confidence in July. You said that Europe must first earn itself a welfare state, and I am sure that you will not lose heart or flinch before the task of giving an effective boost to the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we were told by Mr Balkenende, President in Office of the Council, that the leaders of the Member States would like there to be a parliamentary committee on employment and growth. Yet a parliamentary committee would not guarantee new jobs, it would merely take more money out of taxpayers’ pockets. There is only one way in which economic productivity can be increased and jobs created, and I am sure you are well aware of what this is: businesses must be persuaded that the European Union is the right place to be if they are to flourish. This is the task facing you and your Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have here an EU flag which I bought on the floor below this one. There is nothing remarkable about it on the whole, except for a small label upon which is written ‘Made in China’. This shows that it is cheaper today for businesses to manufacture EU flags in China and then import them all the way from China to the heart of the European Union. This is, unfortunately, a direct result of the economic policies which have been pursued to date, and this is something which must be acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I believe that you will make your fellow Commissioners conscious of the fact that we cannot create a welfare state on credit, in so doing frittering away our children’s future. I would ask you to encourage certain of the leaders of the 25 EU Member States to show similar courage, so that instead of creating parliamentary committees they begin to reform their welfare systems, lower taxes and make savings. I am keeping my fingers crossed for you and your Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow, Parliament will free you, and it is time it did so, for there is work awaiting you. Your task has not been easy, faced with the inertia of the Council, which is more concerned about defending national interests than about presenting a vision of Europe. Mr Barroso, the events of these last few weeks will, I hope, have brought you closer to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, we have regrets. We regret that the Dutch Government did not accept our recommendation of a change of portfolio for Mrs Kroes. Her task will not be easy, for all her decisions will be subjected to debate. We regret that you have been required to keep Mr Kovács. I have the gravest doubts as to his ability, given his origins, to deal with tax issues. That being said, we appreciate the withdrawal of Mrs Udre, and bravo Mr Frattini for his very commendable performance. We were already able to gauge his interest in a more efficient EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall therefore put our confidence in your Commission, Mr Barroso, for you have shown responsibility. Let us look at the future, then. Our Parliament has spoken, and it intends to play its role alongside yourselves. It will be your partner for, as I have already said to you, Europe will only make progress by means of a strong Commission and a strong Parliament working in tandem. We are in fact only too aware of the paralysis due to the Council. Your task is a huge one, involving a vote in favour of the Constitution, together with the issues of employment, competitiveness and support for our SMEs and our self-employed. What we expect from you is a genuine industrial policy conducive to supporting growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, priority should be given to defending the interests of Europeans. What I took from your speech was your desire to create an EU that speaks to young people and to their generation, an EU that, as I myself see it, should pave the way for their future through professional training and through language learning accessible to everyone. Two major challenges await you: the ageing of the population and the demographic downturn. If you have the required will and the required ambition, President Barroso, you will be able to count on us. What we ask of you is that you lead a visionary team for Europe.</p>

Overcoming difficulties always makes people stronger, and I believe that you too have become stronger now that you have seen things through. You have now put together a Commission that is better than the one you chose not to present to Parliament. You deserve that recognition, also accorded to you by my group chairman. I should also like to accord you the same recognition on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">You said today that you wanted to strengthen the connection between ordinary people and the European Union. That is incredibly important, and I believe that your Vice-President, Margot Wallström, has the required talents and ability to communicate. I sincerely hope, therefore, that you and the whole of the College will correspondingly give this high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s problem is, however, not just a problem of communication but also one of action. For ourselves in the PSE Group and for the party of which I am chairman, it is now very important for you to confirm that your highest priority – as you expressed it within the confines of the European Union – is jobs, jobs and more jobs. You have to understand that there is a prevailing uncertainty among people in Europe. They wonder if they will be able to get jobs in the future and what will happen to their children and families. Genuine answers can only be given to those questions if the European Union can present a comprehensive strategy that provides jobs, jobs and more jobs. If we are to deal with globalisation in a pro-active, rather than defensive, way and if we are to offer a pro-active response during the forthcoming trade negotiations with the United States, China, India and all the developing countries, we must be able to create jobs, jobs and more jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that, in the last analysis, it is perhaps the governments that are the most important interlocutors. The Lisbon process – which all of us, or many of us in any case, are solidly behind – must be taken seriously by the governments. I would appeal to you to make an effort to ensure that, in particular, the responsible ministers in the governments – that is to say, most notably the finance ministers and, of course, the prime ministers – understand that social security and economic growth are not incompatible but are prerequisites of each other. It would be of vital importance if you could confirm this in your response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given this promise, I was delighted to approve you as Commission President. You lived up to my expectations when you quickly and efficiently put together a Commission with eight female Commissioners and sound liberal people of first-rate ability in important posts. In the light of this, I supported you all the way, not least when things got rough in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore with great regret that I must now point out that you have broken your promise concerning eight women in the Commission. My support is thus rewarded in the form of a broken promise, and I must therefore draw the necessary conclusion. I cannot, unfortunately, vote in favour of your Commission tomorrow. That is something I deeply regret, but I will not break my promise to my electorate. I must also be able to look those people in the eye who feel strongly about our original demand for eight female Commissioners. They can now justifiably ask the very relevant question: does the demand for eight female Commissioners no longer have the character of an ultimatum? No, apparently not. Nor, however, can I vote against a Commission of your making that is so liberal and sympathetic to reform. You will therefore see me not taking part in the vote tomorrow. That is not the way I should have liked it to have been. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not the case, Mr Barroso, that, on the one hand, you have the economy and competitiveness and, on the other hand, the social dimension and the environment. I subscribe to what Mr Rasmussen said but should like to add that, if we do not embrace the conclusions of the Gothenburg European Council, which commit the entire EU and are genuinely at the heart of a European strategy for qualitative growth, and if, furthermore, India and China were to go down the lines you proposed, the earth’s ecosystem would, in this century, be in a disastrous state.</p>

The new Commission is dominated by Christian Democrats and Liberals, who quite openly proclaim their intention of implementing the right-wing political programme contained in the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the change in the Commission’s political complexion, it is apparent that some of the candidates have a history of giving priority to their private business activities over and above any kind of public interest. Mrs Kroes, if she gets the competition portfolio, will have to monitor whether others are doing what she herself has done for decades, namely giving preferential treatment to one business rather than another, concluding secret deals and enabling a clique of friends to profit from them. When asked in her hearing about the award of subsidies to criminal friends, she gave the same explanation that the Dutch parliament had unanimously rejected back in 1997. Moreover, she has now for the first time admitted that, ten years ago, she sent a secret letter with the aim of enabling an associated business to get a share in a transaction conducted by the Dutch export consortium she chaired. The Dutch Government claims that only President Barroso can reject her, while he puts the ball back in their court. It would be a good thing if this House could reject contentious candidates by voting for one candidate at a time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite simply, it is about the question of whether we in Europe are getting a Commission that can successfully handle the challenges of the years ahead. Are we getting a Commission that is capable of meeting people’s expectations? Are we getting a Commission that can give Europe strong leadership and will be a respected actor and partner on the global stage?</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which is after all, numerically, the strongest in the European Parliament, let me say that we are indeed getting such a Commission, one that is capable of performing these tasks, one that enjoys our confidence and has earned that of the European public, whom we, in this House, represent. To that confidence and trust in the Commission we will be giving voice tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make it equally clear, though, that we also hope that the more mature cooperation between the new Commission and this House which has come about over the past three weeks will not prove to be ephemeral, but that this close cooperation will continue to be sought. As I see it, we have our mandate as the European Parliament and you have your mandate as the Commission currently in office, and we are to exercise them in the interests of the public. That is what we are prepared to do, and I would urge you to do likewise with all parties, not only with Mr Schulz and his team – which is not as homogeneous as it always likes to appear in this House – but with all the groups in this House and in particular with those who really have taken over the leadership of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">President Barroso reached the bottom of the political abyss into which Mr Buttiglione and Mrs Udre had pushed his Commission when, during the night of 26 October, he realised that the unity of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would make a parliamentary majority in his favour unlikely. Mr Barroso was right not to persist in his error. The Commission, as an institution, would have suffered a defeat. Even if a chance majority had given Mr Barroso an all too short victory, the Commission would not have emerged strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, the modified Commission will be able to count on a very comfortable majority. In no way, however, will the size of the vote in favour ensure an indefinite vote of confidence or a sort of blank cheque. We are going to give our agreement to what is far from being a dream team, but which appears to be more competent than Barroso I. The new Commission will have to apply itself in order to win the confidence of the large majority of MEPs who want to see an active and prosperous Europe that defends its social and environmental model.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is unusual as parliaments go. When it comes to supporting or resisting a government programme, there is neither a parliamentary majority nor a structured opposition. All the political groups are at one and the same time in the majority and in opposition, with majorities forming around precise political objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has succeeded in building a broad coalition of pro-Europeans and anti-Europeans, loosely held together by a few conservative values. It has thus become the largest group in our Parliament, but without, for all that, calling all the shots, Mr Ferber.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that President Barroso has faced the facts and understood that he will not be able to rely solely on his party of origin, nor even upon all those on the right, and that he will have to count, in particular, upon the PSE Group which, with its 200 MEPs, is crucial to forming a qualified majority in any legislative procedure. I hope, Mr President, that you will take account of this fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Cohn-Bendit recently quoted Mao Zedong in one of his speeches before this House, a leader whose writings you are acquainted with, Mr Barroso. I should like to quote Lenin, who taught that it is sometimes necessary to take one step back in order to take two steps forward. You did not heed Lenin’s advice. Instead you took two steps back and only one step forward. I remain unconvinced that the Commission’s current line-up is any better than the previous one, yet I understand that we must vote in favour of this Commission, as there has been enough confusion within EU structures. I certainly agree this has been the case. Mr Barroso, I would like to say that the members of the Polish political party Self-defence (Samoobrona) will vote in favour of the Commission line-up you have proposed, even though we still have reservations concerning some of the Commissioner-designates nominated. We will vote in favour of the Commission, but this is not a vote of confidence for the next five years. We are doing so merely for the purposes of this vote, and we will keep a close eye on your actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President-elect of the Commission, I should like to say that we are also voting in favour of your Commission because you appear to be an honest person, and there is a lack of honesty in European politics. I hope you will remedy this lack. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have demonstrated clearly your pro-reform views both as Prime Minister in Portugal and also in your prospectus for the EU, especially on the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we remained concerned that the objectivity in the process of judgment of your Commission team was corrupted here by left-wing politicians in this House. We have great reservations about Mr Kovács in particular. We were very sad to see the loss of a good man in Mr Buttiglione. In addition, the goodness of Mr Kovács is as yet far from proven. The inconsistency in our failure to give at least an indicative vote on that candidate, when we have given one Mr Buttiglione, is a matter of some concern.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Barroso, we wish to give you our support in the work that you have to do. We welcome you as incoming Commission President. The complications of the ratification process must, however, provide us with a serious lesson for the future. We on this side of the House are always willing to learn. It seems to me that Socialists and Liberals never seem to learn; they may well gloat, but they do not learn.</p>

The idea, present in the European Constitution, that this House reinforces the Commission’s legitimacy, has come into effect even before the Constitution has been ratified, something that I, as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, can only welcome. We should give this achievement a permanent place in the Interinstitutional Agreement and secure it for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Commission includes a Commissioner appointed specifically to handle communication policy, an innovation that we cannot do other than welcome; there has never been one before, and by appointing one you are filling a vacuum that, in former years, made for a great deal of insecurity and helped foster Euro-scepticism. Policies originating in Brussels were simply not communicated successfully to the general public or to individuals, so I can only congratulate you on what was very much the right decision, and one that we endorse. Like all of us, I know that the national governments very often make political capital out of the idea that everything bad comes out of Brussels, and everything good from the national capitals. That has not failed to have an effect on people: they are unsettled, and that must be made good.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Constitution now affords you, over the next two years, a unique opportunity to present the values and foundations of the European idea to the outside world. An opportunity as good as that is a rare occurrence. I hope that you will be pro-active rather than sit back and let things happen. It is our task as a European institution to do our bit. The national governments must of course play their part, which is an essential one, but we are the advocates of the European Constitution, and it is we who must defend it against falsifications and distortions. I put it to you that this House, together with your Commission and the Council, will do everything possible over the next two years to ensure that this historic project be brought to a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On two things: firstly, and in accordance with Article 214, on a list of Commissioners drawn up by the Council of Ministers of the European Union. There is little to say about this list. It could have been better, and it could have been worse. I do not believe there is reason for contesting it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also going to vote, however, on the way in which, in application of Article 217, the President of the Commission has assumed his obligations in terms of organising tasks, and here we clearly see that things have not been done in a satisfactory way. They were not done in a satisfactory way to begin with. It is absurd to appoint a representative of the Berlusconi government to the freedom portfolio. It is absurd to appoint to the competition portfolio someone who, whatever her merits, will not be in a position to exercise her powers in full.</p>
<p class="contents">One point emerges from these two considerations: either Mr Barroso is responsible for these choices, in which case that is a serious matter because he has made bad choices; or he has allowed these choices to be imposed upon him by the governments, which would be even worse.</p>

The nations' loss is this Parliament's gain. We might at first use it sparingly, but imagine a time when we do not. What would then prevent the two largest groupings in the European Parliament from using their combined majority to demand Commissioners with political beliefs more similar to their own? Or let us take it a step further. What would stop them from making a list of 25 names and informing the nations that this is the only list they will approve? Maybe 13 for the PPE-DE Group and 12 for the PSE Group. What promises will Commissioners need to make next time, with threats of rejection hanging over them? One institution has gained, 25 countries have lost, and we are the union of nations no more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall not be voting for your Commission because you have not resolved the numerous conflicts of interest. Through hard work, logic and mechanisms typical and emblematic of the most sinister type of government by compromise, you have merely managed to shuffle the designated Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">You have easily persuaded the most pro-Atlantic and pro-United States ally in the Council of Europe to replace Professor Buttiglione – who, while I do not subscribe to the prejudices expressed by him against working mothers, has been discriminated against all too easily – while Mr Kóvacs and Mrs Kroes, who are both involved in affairs where there is a clear conflict of interest, remain among your Commissioners.</p>

Therefore, since I consider this affair to be a story with a happy ending, I shall limit myself to some expressions of gratitude, albeit with some questions.</p>
<p class="contents">My first and most heartfelt thanks is to you. You said you wanted to do what was necessary and sufficient to obtain the approval of Parliament. I have genuinely failed to understand why it has been necessary to replace Commissioner Buttiglione, but at any rate Italy has kept the justice portfolio and has an excellent Commissioner and Vice-President of the Commission. For me, that is more than sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks are due to our friends in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: they have truly provided an interpretation for the bewildered Italian parliamentarians who have been debating the subject of conflict of interest for years. Thanks to the ineffable way in which they have fought their battle for the prerogatives of Parliament, we now know that conflict of interest is defended in this way, or rather is fought in this way: by pretending that there is no interest. When you evoke the monster Berlusconi from those benches, we know that it may be written Berlusconi but it is pronounced Kroes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks also go to our friends in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. I have not quite understood why their opposition to the Barroso Commission should all of a sudden have disappeared. However, I believe that perhaps it is linked to the lack of action against the Hungarian Commissioner. For this I should above all thank the valiant leader of the Socialist group, but I shall not do so, because every time that someone from my side of the house speaks of the honourable Mr Shulz, he gets promoted to a higher office.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall limit myself to asking one final question: does the concept of necessary and sufficient as expressed by you perhaps consist of depriving a Commissioner-designate of his freedom of expression and of thought? You said that democracy is half plus one, but perhaps democracy in this Parliament equals the whole minus one – the most wretched and most Catholic Mr Buttiglione. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since then, you have made a clever strategic withdrawal, but in no respect have you abandoned those values of yours that you also put into practice in Portugal, in both the social and foreign policy spheres. You now want to make a political victory out of this tactical manoeuvre. This seems to me to imply a lack of respect for ourselves as MEPs. You have made some slight modifications, voluntarily or otherwise. We take due note of these, but in no way are they enough. Mr Buttiglione was the scapegoat. By sacrificing him, you thought you had succeeded in making us forget the rest of the Commission. You erected a smokescreen which cannot make us accept, in particular, a competition Commissioner who, in the kind of phrase already used, you will find is a fly in the ointment until the end of your term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what you are proposing to us, I know that you have not gone back on your intentions and that, to mention just two areas, the social dimension and public services are not really your Commission’s priorities. You are asking us, however, to think again and to accord you a majority such as no other President of the Commission before you has been able to enjoy. That would be an incredible turnaround, Mr Barroso, but also an incredible instance of your turning your back on us as MEPs. Parliament’s new, pride-inducing legitimacy as something more than a simple recording chamber or rump parliament cannot now be called into question by clever presentation and a certain talent for oratory. There is always a link between a programme and the personalities who implement it. That is why, as a French socialist, I can only express defiance regarding the Commission you are proposing to us. In order to remain faithful to my values, consistent in my choices and concerned to see Parliament respected, I shall not vote in favour of your Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are presenting a Commission without Mr Buttiglioni, whom Parliament could not accept – not because he was, and is, a Catholic and not because he was, and is, a conservative, but because he was unable to take on the task he was appointed to take on. His attitudes and his previous actions were proof that his position was simply untenable.</p>
<p class="contents">I now see before me a Commission that will be in a position to fight for gender equality and protection of the rights of minorities, a Commission that will be able to fight for reforms in Europe. I myself attended the hearing of, among others, the Budget Commissioner-designate, and that was an excellent experience in which no punches were pulled in connection with the issue of the necessary reforms. I look forward to our cooperation. I am convinced that your cooperation with Parliament will be constructive, but that you will not go uncriticised either, and this will be of benefit to Europe and to us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On it also depends good cooperation between the two institutions in this legislative period. There are those who have labelled the events of the past few weeks as an institutional crisis; nothing could be further from the truth, and the President-in-Office of the European Council rightly said so this morning. It is not because it is the first time that this would not be normal procedure. It is undoubtedly to Mr Barroso’s credit that he has indeed played the game, and that has put him in a stronger position; it may even make for a stronger Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-elect of the Commission did not have an easy time of this, and it is also apparent that we too have a number of lessons to learn from it. This procedure, it is clear, puts the President-elect of the Commission in an uncomfortable position. On the one hand, the Member States allowed him little or no discretion in the choice of Commissioners; on the other, Parliament treats this matter as if he really did have a free choice.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid such a situation, the Convention had proposed that each Member State should present three Commissioners, including at least one man and one woman. The elected President would thus be given a real choice and would be able to put together a balanced Commission. The IGC, lamentably, did away with this solution. In the light of our most recent experience, it strikes me as essential that we consider taking this stipulation on board in practice, even if only as an agreement between the institutions. It may well not be set down in the Constitution, but it does not conflict with it either.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we in this House need to evaluate all aspects of the procedure. Mr Duff will be drafting a report on this. This is where it seems to me to be essential that we should safeguard the collegial nature of the Commission, which would be put under strain if Parliament were to approve Commissioners on an individual basis. We must not become a <span class="italic">gouvernement d'assemblée</span>. We must keep a watchful eye over the balance between the institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, you have promised us a genuine partnership, which is imperative because the European Union is facing huge challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Lisbon strategy needs to be revitalised, as it is clinically dead. Secondly, a deeper European Union must be dependent on the implementation of the Constitutional Treaty. Thirdly, the current enlargement needs to be consolidated, with the new Member States fully integrated and guaranteed equal treatment and the enlarged European Union made into a coherent whole. Finally, Europe needs to be publicised because there is an enormous gulf between Europeans and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For us – that is to say, for the new Member States – equal treatment is crucial. We are very well aware that there are no reserves left in terms of financial resources but, like the Hungarian Socialists and the former Portuguese minister, who empathised with the new Member States, we ask you to do what Mrs Fischer Boel promised us during her hearing and find new means and methods more appropriate to specific conditions, for example in the sphere of rural development.</p>

President Barroso, you have tried until the very last to ignore the will of Parliament. When you were forced to do so, you made as few changes to your team as possible, forgetting, for example, to replace Mrs Kroes at competition, despite the blatant and serious conflict of interest in which she finds herself.</p>
<p class="contents">In that sense I should like to reassure Mr Mauro from the PPE-DE Group. I, a Liberal, shall be voting against your Commission precisely because you have not replaced the Liberal Mrs Kroes. Neither does the replacement of Mr Buttiglione by Mr Frattini appear satisfactory to us, despite the indubitable professional capabilities that we recognise in Commissioner Frattini. However, it is precisely these professional capabilities, which he has put at the disposal of the Prime Minister of Italy to draw up a law on conflict of interest in a truly partisan way, that make us uneasy.</p>

In the last week of October, there were people who did not understand – and indeed criticised – your decision to postpone the vote on the Commission. You deserve congratulations because you were right and because everyone now acknowledges that you were right.</p>
<p class="contents">The European ideal and the Community process require an effective relationship between its Commission and Parliament. You rightly referred to this as positive complicity. It is in our common interest and we must build this to last permanently. You have made your intentions clear in recent weeks, so it is now up to us to make our intentions clear by voting resoundingly in favour of the Commission of which you are President.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we need a strong Commission that shows authority and legitimacy. The challenges ahead of us make this a necessity. We are looking to you and to your Commission to defend the Community spirit. We are looking to you to strengthen economic and social cohesion. There will be no common project if there is an increase in inequality and imbalance. We are looking to you to ensure that adequate funding is available. It does not make sense to ask the Commission for more responsibilities and activities without granting the necessary funding. We are looking to you to promote cultural and linguistic diversity. The European Project will be enhanced if we can promote the cultural identity of each of its communities and if each citizen can receive information and interact with the European institutions in their own language. We are looking to you for fresh impetus in bringing Europe closer to its citizens and in putting an end to the shortfall of information and of participation in the European democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I speak here not merely as a member of the same party, but, more importantly, as a Portuguese and a European and it is as a Portuguese and a committed and faithful European that I wish you and your Commission every success. Good luck in your new job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have asked to speak in order to welcome loudly and clearly the course of events in recent weeks and to express my satisfaction at the way in which the nomination of the Commission has been handled, both by you and by us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-elect, the fact that you decided to delay the vote on the Commission, that you listened to the mood of Parliament and that you made welcome changes to the composition of the Commission, means that, <span class="italic">de facto,</span> you showed respect for Parliament and contributed both to its reputation and its strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for Parliament to make an equally sensible move by supporting your Commission and contributing to its reputation and strength.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, what is needed is the reciprocal strengthening of the roles of the main European institutions, which would lead, one would hope, to greater trust in both the European ideal and the European Union on the part of our fellow European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-elect of the Commission, Europe deserves a strong Parliament. Europe deserves a strong Commission. The tasks which await us in this mandate demand vision, boldness and, as you have correctly pointed out, a robust institutional partnership. In any event, Europe needs strong political leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">At the very least there are two tasks which are essential. The success of the Lisbon Strategy and the successful ratification of the European Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the first task, Mr President-elect, you have said many words, but in the case of the second far too few. Let me now finish by calling on you to ensure that the European Constitutional Treaty is successfully ratified as part of your personal and collective political responsibility.

<p class="contents">Leaving anecdotes aside, Madam President, I believe that today history is being made in the present tense and, in this historic present we are living through, the European Union is emerging as one of the main players. With a total of 450 million people, 300 million of whom use a single currency, it is the main commercial, financial and industrial power, the main donor of development aid and a key player, though still a beginner, on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Madam President, that, as Mr Durão Barroso has said, what the Commission has to do now is to get to work on the internal dimension of the project, the internal market and economic and monetary union – in accordance with the direction and the commitments of the Lisbon process, with a view to achieving sustained growth and job creation – and on its external action, Madam President, exporting our system of values, making our contribution to the peace process in the Middle East and restoring relations with the United States on the basis of our convictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Durão Barroso, Quixote said "They bark, then we ride". A majority of this House will be investing a great deal of political capital in you tomorrow. Use that capital responsibly, create a strong Commission that serves the interests of the citizens, defend the common interest and, above all, establish a direction for the integration project.</p>
<p class="contents">Do so, Mr Durão Barroso, by fulfilling your commitment, with a strategic alliance with this Parliament, establishing – as Mr Coelho said a moment ago – a positive complicity, and I am sure that you will make a success of the European integration project, which is one of the most exciting projects of our times.</p>

Mr Barroso, you persuaded me to vote for you this summer, and, now that the gun smoke is clearing and I can now inspect the battlefield, I have to say that I was right to give you my vote back then. I said at the time that I thought that a President of the Commission had to be a leader and a democrat at the same time. To be both is a tremendous balancing act and you have skilfully negotiated the tightrope.</p>
<p class="contents">The witch-hunt by the Greens against Mrs Kroes demands a response. If you take their thinking to its logical conclusion, it would follow that a doctor could not be responsible for public health, a former trade union leader could not handle social policy, a woman could not deal with emancipation, and a Green could not head up environmental policy. If ever I need a referee, I prefer to choose someone who can play football. Moreover, nobody is bound by so stringent a code of conduct as a Commissioner, and that too is institutional reform. Mr Barroso, your Commission has outstanding ambitions in the field of economic regeneration and the combating of discrimination. Like my group, I expect more democratisation as well.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the European Commission, as an institution, has, in fact, been held up in its work of submitting proposals for legislation since last Christmas, and I think it has slept for long enough now.

<p class="contents">On behalf of the Polish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to lend my support to the second Barroso Commission. It is with a heavy heart that we do so, for the changes made within the Commission are on the one hand unfair and on the other not far-reaching enough. Yet the enlarged European Union is in need of a new Commission and of your strong leadership, Mr Barroso. Our common European interest demands such leadership. It is therefore the substance of the new Commission’s policies that is now the issue at stake, not individual Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we expect of the new Commission? We expect it to implement three priorities. Firstly, we hope it will complete enlargement. This was initiated but not carried through. Secondly, the Commission needs to maintain and develop the European Union’s solidarity and cohesion. Thirdly, it must develop the European Union’s eastern dimension. As I said, enlargement was carried out in formal terms, but has not been completed. The important point here is that the new Member States should achieve equal involvement in all dimensions of the EU’s policies, as well as full and equal rights, and that they should be treated equally.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority, and one which is particularly important for the new Member States, is the European Union’s social and economic cohesion, something that flows from the ever-necessary principle of solidarity. The Commission’s most immediate task will be to convince the Council that the budget for the next seven years should correspond to the tasks entailed by EU enlargement. As you said in July, Mr Barroso, ‘you cannot have more Europe for less money’. We expect you to keep your word and support the budget proposals put forward by the Prodi Commission. This House will be on your side, Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority is the eastern dimension and the new neighbourhood policy., We expect you to take a proactive approach to this policy, Mr Barroso. We need a policy which is generous but not permissive, which is demanding but effective, a policy which exports the European model of democracy and a market economy, a policy which opposes violations of the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, a policy which promotes civil society and honest and free elections in Belarus and Ukraine, and an open-door policy for the European ambitions of a democratic Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we support your Commission, Mr Barroso. Trusting that it will focus on these priorities, we hope it will be a strong Commission and that you will be a strong leader. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You said at the time that you would pay great attention to the views of the members of the European Parliament, even if they opposed your own. On 27 October, you listened to the voice of Parliament and acted accordingly, with respect both for the role of Parliament and the confidence it placed in you in June.</p>
<p class="contents">This act on your part means that you believe deeply that politics are the art of composition, which the European Union itself personifies.

That third entity is the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I take note of the effort that you have made in this direction: whether it is in recognising, I hope definitively, the role of Parliament, or in modifying the composition of the team that will accompany you in the coming years. However, certain problems remain unresolved, and they cannot be underestimated. I shall stress two of them: the first concerns the guidelines for social policy that – to say nothing else – are well short of Europe’s needs for jobs, welfare and rights in the perspective of Lisbon. The second problem is the presence in your team of Mrs Kroes. I have the impression that this Commissioner will soon find herself in a mass of problems. Her conflict of interest is now seen by all and with her confirmation, President Barroso, you are undermining yourself and your actions.</p>

Such a method denotes a marked feeling for the European institutions. That is why we are convinced that you will lead the Commission in the next five years in a way that is new and different from that of the recent past, carrying out a sort of Copernican revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sure that we shall have a President who is not allied to this or that political camp. Europe needs women and men who can play the role of supreme representatives of all the institutions, including the European Parliament and the Parliamentary committees, in this way -– I refer to my colleague Mr Bourlanges, who is absent from the chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we need to have a growing enhancement of the institutions. That is why we should have liked other governments, beginning with the Socialist Government of Hungary, to have shown the same institutional sensibility in these weeks as the Italian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Only a Commission not concerned with influencing national politics can have the prestige and authority to allow Europe to have a balanced system of institutions in the ambit of which this Parliament can finally take full possession of legislative power. A Commission with such a profile must be dedicated to securing swift approval of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The birth of the first basic law of the European Union represents a great result for us all, even though I, together with the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, harbour a regret that an explicit reference to our Christian origins is missing. However, together we all have the duty to imbue this great work of constitutional engineering with political will. In short, Europe needs to be given a heart and soul, otherwise we risk only having a Europe with a currency and a bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this Parliament has declared itself in favour of a seat for the European Union in the renewed UN Security Council. The goal is to have a Europe that counts for more and more on the international chessboard, a Europe that is the bringer of peace, as it has been within its own frontiers for the last fifty years.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sure that you will opt for Parliament’s positions, as a man not of a party but of the Institution. Because you will be a man of the Institution, at the exclusive service of our citizens, you will have the confidence of the Italian delegation of the European People’s Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenge is also, however, that of taking leave of a Europe that was divided and whose history can never be forgiven.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against that background that I have to say how unfortunate it is that, after twenty years in the service of a dictatorship, a Commissioner considers himself not to have any cause for regret. Nothing to be sorry for after twenty years in the service of a dictatorship. This says more about the Hungarian Government and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament than about the Commission, because the responsibility lies neither with the Commission nor with the President.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also interesting to note the debate we have had in this House today. The PSE Group clearly believes that someone with their background in a free economy is more to be criticised than someone emerging, devoid of any sense of remorse, from one of Europe’s brutal dictatorships. That is to your discredit and is difficult both to explain and to defend.</p>
<p class="contents">The task now, however, is to give some impetus to Europe, and it is in the light of this that we are giving President Barroso and the Commission our support. It is a question of deregulating and of opening the way to freedom and transparency. It is a question of advocating a Europe based upon the ideals of freedom and democracy. What matters is to get the Lisbon process moving and to give Europeans the maximum amount of opportunities. This Commission will then be a commendable one, and we give it our support.</p>

That is, however, the most normal thing in the world in a team sport such as this; now the match is over, what matters now is the acquisition of capacity to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell Mrs Gebhardt, though, that if someone like Mr Buttiglione is to be criticised for the values he holds, conservatives must be allowed to criticise socialists without that being described as improper. This, I believe, is where we have to maintain a balance, and I would urge that we do so, so let me – to take an example – say by way of an appeal to the Greens and others, that the game is over, that Parliament has won its points, and that what matters now is that the Commission be endowed with a large majority, thus legitimating it and enabling it, over the next five years, to do the work that we exist to monitor.</p>
<p class="contents">Of that work there is plenty to do. Reference has already been made to the consolidation of the enlarged European Union and to the Lisbon process, as also to Europe’s role in the world and its trans-Atlantic relations. How is terrorism to be overcome, and what part do we have to play in that? How are we to secure our currency’s stability when some of those who participate in debates are endeavouring to pretend that the Stability Pact is not there?</p>
<p class="contents">These are challenges of enormous significance, and so I would like to invite the House to give this Commission a big vote of confidence, while at the same time telling the Commission that a high degree of trust does also mean close monitoring of work in progress, combined with simultaneous good cooperation. For it will be the two Community institutions of Parliament and Commission that will have to implement the Constitution, thereby making this Europe of ours a Community rather than an inter-governmental arrangement. What this means is that cooperation between our two institutions is of crucial importance to Europe’s future, and we should stop sniping at each other and get on with the job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is especially true in the case of the Commissioner responsible for justice and home affairs, a portfolio which is after all of particular importance to the public. As coordinator for my group within the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can confirm that we were extremely impressed by the high level of competence demonstrated by Mr Frattini, Commissioner-designate and Vice-President, on various issues, including those of a highly complex legal nature. He has at any rate a much better understanding of what this House expects of a Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that Mr Frattini is capable of putting his past as a minister of the Berlusconi government behind him, even though it surprises us somewhat that he was able to remain a minister in Berlusconi governments for so long whilst holding the view he put forward during the hearing, demonstrating a very strong commitment to fundamental rights and the principle of the rule of law. In view of this, how was it possible for the government to adopt so many laws which were questionable from the point of view of the rule of law, and which the Italian and European courts now have to apply? We must therefore assume in his favour that, as foreign minister, he was always abroad when these laws were adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Finally and most importantly it has enhanced the democratic legitimacy of the EU by engaging our citizens in a genuine European debate through the forum of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally now feel more confident in supporting a stronger college, reinforced by astute adjustments that have been made in some portfolios. If only you could have gone further, Mr Barroso, but you have killed two birds with one stone in swapping the portfolios of the Hungarian and Latvian Commissioners. In addition, I welcome Mr Piebalgs to the energy brief as a promising and able candidate untainted by the spectre of alleged impropriety, unlike his country's original nominee.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kovács, who displayed incompetence and complete disdain for the parliamentary process during the first round of committee hearings, has inspired slightly more confidence in the role of taxation Commissioner-designate. While I disagree with his political views, I am personally reassured by his statement to the effect that corporate tax harmonisation will remain a Member State competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am in no doubt about her professional competence – and I underline that – I would like to reassert my concerns in relation to a range of conflicts of interest that may attach to Mrs Kroes as a direct result of her successful corporate career to date. Perhaps, Mr Barroso, it is a case of the right woman in the wrong job this time round, but I wish her well.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole I endorse your Commission as representative of the views of the democratically-elected Parliament. While we will have just one vote for or against the entire Commission, I would ask you, Mr Barroso, to put clearly on the record today your full support for the principle of the individual responsibility of each of the Commissioners. It would have been preferable not to leave your changes to the eleventh hour, but the outcome of the whole episode is that cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council has been strengthened. This Parliament has emerged as a much stronger forum, and as one not to be treated lightly. We have given you a clear message. We are not rubber stamps. I wish you and your college well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to refer to one in particular. That is the choice of seasoned and experienced personalities, as we have seen in the enormous majority of hearings before Parliament, including the hearing that I attended in the Committee on Transport for Commissioner Jacques Barrot. I make no secret, however, of the fact, Mr President-designate, that certain issues have yet to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you organised the Azores Summit for President Bush and today, eighteen months after the start of the war, that war has not yet ended. We are unfortunately aware of the number of victims it claims every day: I would like to know your views on that matter today.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that should be considered, and which has just been mentioned, is the reshuffle of the Commission. Reshuffle; that is a fine word, since it has changed little. Do you not fear, Mr Barroso, that by appointing as Commissioner for competition a person who, whatever their qualities, which have been highlighted, will be at constant risk of conflicting interests. Do you not fear that the decisions that your Commission will have to take in such a sensitive area as competition will be permanently in question?</p>
<p class="contents">The third and last point, which is particularly close to my heart, is the case of Turkey, and everyone here knows your views on the subject. In our view, Turkey, as we have said many times, should not become a member of the European Union, and there are many reasons for this. I will mention just one, however: its accession would put an end to the Community project. By enlarging ad infinitum, the Union will soon become an enormous free trade area or a classic international organisation, and will therefore lose all of its individual nature.</p>
<p class="contents">For several years, Mr Barroso, our group – and I did so myself in November 2002 – has been calling for a privileged partnership between the European Union and Turkey. Are you open to that third option, which would resolve the dilemma between accession and exclusion?</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, Mr President-designate, certain questions remain and we hope that this debate will serve to reassure us this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, a sad fact that certain Members have, improperly and wrongly, allowed their view of the Commission as a whole and of the challenges facing us to be obscured by differing views on individual Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and Parliament form a channel of communication, and we need each other. We need a strong Commission which shows initiative and which is dynamic and competent. We need a strong European Parliament; without Europe’s citizens, or their representatives, nothing should and nothing can be decided in the EU, as we must bring the European Union closer to its citizens, as well as making it more transparent and democratic. We must do everything in our power to ensure that EU policies can finally be made on the basis of the Constitution, internally, as is the case in the outside world, instead of their being based primarily on national and party politics; I say this thinking back to the comments made by Mr Schulz.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn the public into participants, and declare our goals, motives and successes. I expect of you, Mr Barroso, that you give the Lisbon and Barcelona processes practical expression and make them operational, and that you do both these things in a way people find easy to comprehend. I also expect you to eliminate obstacles within Europe and to drive forward the common foreign and security policy, as well as to ensuring that the Stability and Growth Pact remains strong, carrying out subsidiarity tests before presenting proposals, putting forward a clear and comprehensible justification for the added value of European regulations, and reaching an agreement with the Council that the 12 stars are to be visible anywhere the EU has invested euros. This is the only way in which a European awareness can be created and the distance reduced.</p>

Had that been the case, you would have already started your work. Upon reflection, however, I think that benefit can be derived from what has occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">The first lesson is that the European Union – and, in particular, the European Commission – must appreciate that it should not interfere in matters relating to faith, morality and ethics. I have in mind, in particular, delicate issues relating to abortion, euthanasia, cloning, the family and marriage, which are all very sensitive topics concerning which there are different opinions in the various Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the events of recent weeks, I think that you, Mr Barroso, would be very wise to distance yourself from such topics and to avoid any incidents. After all, if we really believe in the principle of subsidiarity and in unity in diversity, we must allow the individual States to regulate such matters according to their nations’ circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The second lesson that we can draw from what occurred is that the European Parliament is strengthening its position and is steadily becoming more determined in the role it plays in the decisions taken by the European Union. This strengthened role of the European Parliament places the European Commission under greater scrutiny and makes it more accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, the European Commission will in this way be building up its own strength as it will be increasing its legitimacy in the eyes of the public. That is to say, Mr President-elect, after has what occurred we now have a stronger Parliament. We also, however, have a Commission that is stronger as it is more open to inspection and scrutiny by the representatives directly elected by the European people. We have thus reduced the democratic deficit in Europe and have moved the European Union a step closer to its citizens. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your guidelines were positive and your stance was firm and clear. The aims you put forward were both beneficial to Europe as a whole and fair to the cohesion countries. It remains a good Commission today for precisely the same reasons. The majority of its Members were and still are worthy of our approval, because it has avoided any split between super-Commissioners and second-class Commissioners, because it is closely aligned with our ideological values, and because, overall, it is closer to the opinions of the majority of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Mr President-designate, the Europe I believe in is a Europe of freedom, diversity, security, prosperity and solidarity. Those should be our guiding principles and indeed those were the values that you promised to defend, Mr Durão Barroso. Europe must remember that without security there is no freedom, without competitiveness there is no lasting social model and without subsidiarity there is no unity in diversity, but a fusion of separate entities, which is something we do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Barroso Commission has our support because it represents an opportunity to restore transatlantic ties. Europe is not defined by opposition to any country, particularly not by opposition – and certainly not by submission – to our main ally, but I believe that this is clear for all to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, a word to Mr Durão Barroso, who was a good Prime Minister of Portugal. I do not ask you to be our Commissioner, nor do I want you to be our Commissioner. I ask you to be the President of the Commission who never forgets the concerns of the citizens and of the Member States, regardless of their economic, demographic or geographical dimensions, and I trust that doing so will inspire you as you carry out your new and important duties. Good luck, Mr Durão Barroso. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank you for this debate, for your generally positive reception and for having expressed different points of view. I take note of the support of the majority of you, the concerns you have expressed, the suggestions you have made and also the priorities you have expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to respond in particular to three points: firstly, the composition; secondly, possible conflicts of interest; thirdly, cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission, thinking in particular of the framework agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with the composition. Some of you have criticised me because I have taken account of the will of the Member States. That is true: I have taken account of the will of the Member States. That is what the Treaty requires. The composition of the Commission is not the sole responsibility of the President-designate the Commission: it is a responsibility shared between the President-designate and the Council. What I am presenting here is therefore already the result of a compromise. I say this so that it may appear in the Minutes, so that it may be made perfectly clear. It is already the result of a compromise between the President-designate of the Commission and the Members of the Council, naturally also taking account of the will of the European Parliament as I have been able to analyse it. That is why the debate in October was a positive one. In fact, it was as a result of that debate that I came to understand your main concerns and have been able to try to resolve them.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I have not been able to resolve all the problems raised and I must tell you why. To a certain extent, you have made contradictory demands. Some of you, for example, are very much in favour of keeping a particular Commissioner, while others do not want that Commissioner. I have been surprised to hear some members of a parliamentary group express serious criticisms of a Commissioner, in this case the Commissioner responsible for competition, when that same group had insisted that I retain the Commissioner in question in this post, which puts us in a peculiar situation in terms of relations between Parliament and the President-designate. In these circumstances, I must say that it is very simplistic to present the composition of the Commission simply as a problem between the President-designate of the Commission and the Council. No! When the President-designate of the Commission allocates portfolios, he is subject to the contradictory demands not only of the different political groups, but also of members of the same political group, as we have seen today.</p>
<p class="contents">I say all of this thinking of the future, since there are two aspects that I believe to be absolutely essential. First of all, respect for the Treaties. As you know, the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, which means that I have had to respect them. I am very much in favour of the Commission’s institutional position, not through institutional egotism, but because more than ever we really need a strong Commission in order to move the European project forward. I am therefore prepared to work with you in an honest, transparent and open way; I am ready for this positive complicity with the European Parliament, but I must tell you that that will not be done to the detriment of the Commission. I could not accept that, because we in Europe all need an independent, credible and strong Commission, in accordance with the Treaties. It is very important that I make this clear to you, so that all of us are aware of our responsibilities. That is why I have taken account of the will of the Member States, while always respecting the Treaties, naturally. I must also say that some of you have cooperated more than others. It is true that certain Member States have shown greater understanding of the concerns that I have expressed than others. I believe this should be pointed out, because I believe it is important to learn every possible lesson from this experience, for the future of the Commission and the proper functioning of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of conflicts of interests, I will say this. First of all, I have taken account of the conclusions of the committee that held the hearing with Mrs Kroes. I must read to you the conclusions of that committee. I shall read them in English because I have the original in English. The committee has confirmed that Mrs Kroes had, and I quote: </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Those are the words of the letter addressed to me by the President of the European Parliament, which was written by the chairman of that committee. The committee also asked me, as did the Conference of Presidents, what guarantees I could give, as President of the Commission, with regard to the mechanisms for preventing conflicts of interest. In fact, we have taken a whole range of measures, too many to list now, but the philosophy is as follows: when a service, and in particular the Director-General responsible for competition, comes across a potential conflict of interests, he has the duty to point it out, but not to examine it, which is important, because the decision is not the responsibility of the Director-General, but rather of the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the President of the Commission cannot keep abreast of the hundreds and thousands of competition issues the Commission has to deal with. The Director-General, who is assisted in this task by the Commission’s legal services, therefore has a duty to provide warnings. It is then the President of the Commission - who, as you know, in accordance with the Treaty, is responsible for the coherence and continuity of the Commission - who takes the decision, if he thinks there is a potential conflict of interests, to transfer that portfolio to another Commissioner, or to take that decision himself within the college. There is, therefore, a mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, certain comments have been made. Mrs Frassoni has mentioned three cases currently under examination, which could involve the anti-trust effort and which could involve conflicts of interest. I accept that, Mrs Frassoni, but they are just three cases out of 561 of the same type which are currently being examined by the Commission, of a total of more than a thousand cases relating either to mergers or to State aid. So there are cases that could clearly lead to conflicts of interest. We have transparent mechanisms, however, for preventing these conflicts of interest from having any real effect. This mechanism is democratic because the college has responsibility, and it falls to the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, some of you have made comments to the effect that a Commissioner from the Italian Government should not be made responsible for justice, simply on the basis that he is Italian or is a member of the Italian Government. I must tell you that that is something I could not accept, on the basis of the principle of non-discrimination. This responsibility depends first and foremost on the person, on the individual. The notion that a person from a particular country or from a particular government cannot, as a result of that, offer a particular degree of responsibility, when they have the necessary political, intellectual and professional qualities, is not acceptable. The Member States are democratic countries. It is not for us, the Commission, to decide which governments are acceptable and which are not. That is not our responsibility. It is up to the electorates of the different countries to decide that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for another Commissioner, that is, the Commissioner nominated by the Hungarian Government. The Hungarian Government is a democratic government. If it were not, I do not believe it would be a Member of the European Union. To say that somebody nominated by a democratic government of our Union, furthermore somebody who has until now been President of the majority party in that democratic country cannot, as a result of that, for a purely political reason, be appointed a member of the Commission, seems to me to be unacceptable. That is why I believe we should try to keep that Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are clearly compromises to be reached here, ladies and gentlemen. As somebody quite rightly said, there are twenty-five members of the Commission. I would put the question to you: in each of your States, when your party is in power, are all the members of your national governments subject to your approval? I believe not. Why demand more of the European institutions, therefore, than you demand of your own national institutions?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is where the problem lies. I readily accept that there must be more transparency, more demands, but at times I wonder whether certain people, some through naivety, some with other intentions, are not trying to weaken the European institutions, which we want to be strong. We are willing to accept great demands, but it sometimes makes me suspicious to see members of the Commission being subjected to much more stringent demands than national executives. I wonder how many of our national governments would actually be approved if all their members were to be subject to the kind of hearings that you have organised here in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the composition of the Commission, some people have said that it is too liberal. Let there be no doubt: this composition actually reflects the pluralism within our Member States. If there were Communist governments in our States, I would have Communist Commissioners. If there were governments led by the Greens, I would have Commissioners of that persuasion. I would have no problem with that. It is the governments, which represent the majority in their countries – since, in all of our countries, the rule is the majority – who make the proposals. There is therefore absolutely no justification for criticising the Commission because its composition is too left-wing or too right-wing. The Commission is genuinely the fruit of pluralism and I would like to repeat what I have already said to you, above all to the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and that is that I will not be a partisan President. To respond directly, moreover, to the concerns expressed by Mr Schulz, Mr Swoboda and Mr Rasmussen, I must point out that, while I have a particular ideological political conviction, I nevertheless believe that as President of the Commission, I cannot be a President of the right against the left nor the left against the right. I believe that, at European level, we must first and foremost unite, all of us with pro-European convictions, and work for the common European good.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me also to say something to the members of the Socialist group, with all the respect due to them: you will very often find that in the field of social cohesion, for example, you will have less difficulty with me in the Commission than you would have with certain Socialist governments currently in power. We will see this when we discuss the Financial Perspectives; we will see then who really defends social cohesion and who defends a more active policy of redistribution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We often say that we must defend the European social model, and that is true. Did you know, however, that, in many Member States, particularly those that have just joined, there is no European social model yet, and therefore their problem is not how to preserve the European social model? Their problem is how to achieve the European social model. We must therefore work to make this enlargement a success and that is the direction we must work in.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, I do not wish to anticipate the result of the vote on your resolutions tomorrow. Since some of you, however, have put the question to me directly, in particular Mr Watson, I should like to say, with regard to the motion for a resolution presented by Mr Poettering, Mr de Vigo, Mr Duff, Mr Schulz, Mr Swoboda, Mr Crowley and others, that point 5(a), in its current form, is perfectly acceptable. The principle is as follows: if Parliament decides, through a vote, to withdraw its confidence from a Commissioner, the President of the Commission must seriously examine whether it is appropriate to ask that member to resign; the President then either asks that member to resign, or must justify to Parliament why he is not doing so. That is the meaning of the text presented to me and I believe that is the commitment my predecessor, Mr Prodi, had made; I feel no need to change anything.</p>
<p class="contents">The important issue is how to reconcile the principle of individual responsibility with the collegiate nature of the Commission. This balance is not easy to achieve, since, as you are well aware, the collegiate nature of the Commission is laid down in the Treaties, it has the force of the law. I cannot, therefore, accept going against the Treaties; I cannot accept the idea that a Commission should resign automatically in the event that you withdraw your confidence, because that is not laid down in the Treaties, and nor is it in accordance with either the spirit or the letter of the Treaty, and, as President of the Commission, I should be the principal guardian of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaties establish the principle of collegiality, which does not mean that, on a political level, I am not perfectly willing to examine the concerns that you express with regard to a member of the Commission extremely carefully and to justify my decision. Furthermore, I have asked the Commissioners to accept the principle of resignation in the event that the President requests it, and they have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in today's Europe of 25, the authority of the President, which was increased further by the Treaty of Nice and which is still in force, has become essential in terms of the Member States as well. That is why, at informal meetings, the Members of the Commission have accepted the principle that they should resign if their President requests that they do so. So in certain respects we are going further than what you are asking. What I cannot do is change the balance between the institutions established by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that tomorrow we will have the opportunity to react and to make statements following your vote. I could go into greater detail on this, if you wish. I can tell you, however, that from now on the Vice-President, Mrs Wallström, and I, will be ready to work with you on the renewal of the framework agreement, taking account in particular of the letter sent to me by Mr Borrell and also certain initiatives, in particular that of Mr Poettering, who has set several important milestones in the institutional debate. So I see here a genuine will for constructive openness with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end by referring to the issue of transatlantic relations, which has been raised. In this regard, I believe we must work with the United States of America on an equal and dignified footing, in a spirit of mutual respect. We need it more than ever and the whole world needs that cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today you have received the President of South Africa here. I met him yesterday and he told me, as all the leaders of the developing world tell me, that closer cooperation between Europe, which is currently the biggest economic and commercial power, and the United States, is very important to them as well and that we must commit ourselves positively to a progressive transatlantic agenda with the United States. That is what I will do, of course, while defending the European common interest, it goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that the debates this week have enriched us all. I reject the idea that there is a winner and a loser here. I believe that the European institutions can strengthen each other mutually and that we can all emerge as winners from this constructive debate. I would repeat to you my wish, and that of the whole of the Commission, to cooperate closely with you and to establish a positive agenda for Europe, because we have a great deal to do. This idea of positive complicity with Parliament will be very important over the next five years. They will be difficult years. We are facing increasing numbers of demands, but we can work together, the European Parliament and the European Commission, without any party-political pettiness, without pointless divisions, above all trying to unite all of those who believe that Europe has a future and who believe that we can inspire our young people to support Europe. On this basis, I can guarantee that I am willing to cooperate closely within the context of a constructive and transparent relationship with your institution.</p>
