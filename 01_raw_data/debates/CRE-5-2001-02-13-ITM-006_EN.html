<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boselli (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive regulates the protection of copyright and related rights in the information society. It is an important directive and its path has by no means been easy. We have reached the second reading and Parliament is now called upon to express its opinion on the position adopted by the Council which, as you will remember, was forwarded to us 18 months after it had been adopted at first reading. The reason for this is that a controversial, delicate compromise had to be found between all the interests covered by the directive. I see this difficult, delicate compromise as a step forward for, apart from anything else, it includes many of the points proposed by Parliament at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">There was room for improvement in some parts of the directive and this is what I have attempted to do. Although some compromise amendments were adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, opinion is still divided, particularly with regard to the article on copying for technical purposes, or caching, and the article on private copying. There are many amendments regarding this point which I do not endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why, as far as private copying is concerned, the compromise amendments adopted in committee represented a major new development benefiting the authors lies in the fact that they stipulate that private copying – and I quote – must be<span class="bold"> </span>"made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly or indirectly commercial, on condition that the rightholders receive fair compensation".<span class="bold"> </span>This amendment introduces a new principle into Community legislation, in that it limits the scope of the definition of private copying, to the benefit of the authors, while clearly, at the same time, safeguarding the legitimate interests of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">This amendment, adopted by the committee, halts the huge increase in exchanges of unauthorised copies between users of sites such as Napster, and it will mean that it is no longer possible to describe the exchange of unauthorised works between Napster users as private copying. I see this as an improvement on the text of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the other element, technical copying, I feel that the balance achieved in the common position is more than sufficient to protect both rightholders and consumers. Although the intention behind the amendments tabled on this issue – Article 5, point 1 – to provide greater copyright protection is commendable, none of the amendments are acceptable, apart from anything else because they relate to application, not regulation which is the subject of this directive. Furthermore, these amendments are intended to introduce a system of dual authorisation of works on the Internet, one for hosting and one for caching, which would be a heavy burden for the network management.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, to sum up, the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market showed that it is possible to reach a broad consensus, to adopt the directive and to improve the common position without running the risk of a long, tedious conciliation procedure; all this after three years of debate, argument and dispute. In my opinion, this is an opportunity which the European Parliament must take: if, tomorrow, it supports the agreement reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and adopts the amendments which are the result of a broad compromise between a large number of political groups, then we will, at last, be able to adopt the directive. This will benefit not only the European Union, which has been waiting for legislation on the subject for a long time, but also and most importantly, the rightholders. Indeed, if the directive is adopted, not only will the exceptions which are still disputed enter into force, but also, most importantly, the rule established by Article 2 which lays down the principle of authorisation of rightholders for the use of works in new digital environments.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, it should I hope, be possible, at last, to adopt the text of this directive tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, I am an owner of intellectual property, being the author of several books and publications, and, on the other, I am a member of the Internet Foundation, which has various supporters in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today coincides with an important event from the point of view of intellectual property in the information society, that is the judgment of the San Francisco Appeal Court in the Napster case, which brings us closer to finally resolving the vexed question of the use of the Internet to breach intellectual property rights. The judgment of the San Francisco Court of Appeal confirms intellectual property rights and establishes certain measures for the protection of intellectual property in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge facing us is to ensure that Europe also establishes a system which would safeguard intellectual property, otherwise we could find that, by means of installations in Europe, the effective protection measures which are currently being adopted in the United States under the Millennium Law, which has been in force for more than two years, could be violated. We are lagging behind the United States, and, in this respect, I am in agreement with the rapporteur in the sense that we should bring this directive into play as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in doing so, the Socialist Group is concerned that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water. We have tabled two amendments which we consider to be very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the amendment relating to what is known as private copying. Private copying, which was a traditional right of any person obtaining an intellectual work or intellectual property, must now, in the information society, be subject to very strict requirements, because of the enormous ease of reproduction. This amendment proposes that the private copy should be intended for the personal use of the person making it, because otherwise, given the ease of reproduction, we run the risk that many copies can be made for the private use of persons other than the person making the copy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, another very important amendment is the one relating to the incidental and transitional nature of reproduction. If, as a consequence of the processes established by the information society, it is necessary to make a copy of a transitional and incidental nature, this should be intended to be of a genuinely transitional nature. It would be unacceptable to create large libraries of intellectual property so that, at any given moment, the person who has been using that property can access it at will. We believe that the accumulation of requirements that they be of a transitional and incidental nature is essential to safeguarding intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in tomorrow's vote the various political groups can come to an agreement in order to offer alternatives which will truly guarantee the protection of intellectual property in the information society, since in a few years time, all intellectual property will probably be of the type that travels around the great communications networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a tough job and he had to walk on eggshells to do it, but I feel he has managed to strike a better balance with the aid of his compromise amendments. I also think – and perhaps we should really look into this as a Parliament some time – that there has perhaps been more lobbying over this issue than I have ever experienced in my brief career as an MEP. If you consider that over 300 lobbyists have an interest in this report, then that means half a lobbyist to every MEP, and perhaps a few question marks are in order here too.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a good thing if the common position, together with Mr Boselli’s compromise amendments were to be adopted tomorrow. The liberals disagree on quite a few points, but as I understand it, we are at least united behind it, and I think that is indeed a positive sign. In addition, there are a number of issues that Mr Boselli and Mr Medina have already mentioned today. I have yet to see whether the compromise amendment on private copies goes far enough because I still have not read to the end – and as a lawyer, I dealt with intellectual property in my practice over a long period of time. I have yet to discover whether it is now no longer possible for a student to make copies for all his or her fellow students which they are allowed to use in private. I have my doubts about this because I think it will allow illegal copying to continue with a vengeance. So I am in favour of restricting private usage.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have my doubts about the technical measures that Member States are at liberty to introduce. I fear that this will have a distorting effect on the internal market and will lead, in the final analysis, to the Court of Justice having to settle the matter again on the basis of the internal market principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Caching, now that is something I still have some difficulty with, the way things are going at the moment. I believe this only has to do with the e-commerce directive, so I hope the Commissioner will take another look at the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with a comment, and I hope – on behalf of the Liberal Group at any rate – that an even-handed and fair balance will be found in this directive for all market participants and all parties concerned, and I feel that the digital copy should be regarded as an opportunity and not a threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Numerous problems, numerous conflicts of interest have still not been resolved. Harmonising cultural traditions is no easy task. A compromise does not really satisfy anyone and the European Parliament does not hold a magic wand. There is talk of a balanced common position. A balance between whom? Between rightholders and the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost – and this is my opinion and the opinion of the Greens – the rightholder's status under copyright law must be strengthened. Copyright law must serve the rightholder. His position must be strengthened for future contract negotiations. As a politician for culture, my responsibility is, firstly, to give rightholders a secure basis for their existence and, secondly – and I do not mean secondarily but equally – to guarantee the public free access and, at the same time, ensure that high-quality works are available to the public in all their diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to extending the list of exceptions; some of the contentious points can perhaps be resolved between the parties, because we too are keen to find a satisfactory solution which we can all live with. The Greens, you may have noticed, confined themselves to proposed amendments which relate solely to the rightholder – I refer to Amendments Nos 34 and 36. Perhaps, you will say, they anticipated future contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to reply: much is anticipated in the recitals which is of benefit not to the rightholder author but to other interested parties. And as the Napster case has already been raised, Europe should discuss whether or not it wants a miniature version, a European Napster, and then it should hold a round table discussion between providers, producers, rightholders and consumers. But I would not want Napster to find its way to Europe, in through the back door simply because copyright law is weak and the wording woolly. This too is a possibility which we should debate. We shall also have to hold a discussion at some point in the future – soon, I hope – on performing rights societies and on the possibility of contracts for copyright contract law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This confusion is due to the fact this directive represents three different interest; i.e. authors and creative artists, consumers, who are also users, and producers and market makers. Producers and market makers are trying to fit in between the other two and I feel that the directive is also in this uneasy position with its list of exceptions, to which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has just added another, extremely problematic, exception regarding broadcasting. I believe that we are favouring the opinion of consumers. However, what are we trying to make them buy? I put to you the question: just what shall we buy in the near future, if we fail to protect and defend creativity? That is the question we should ask ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">As it happens, outside my parliamentary career, I have written books and I use public libraries and research centres. In both cases, we need to have some protection, some security rather than insecurity, in order to be able to produce works. If I look at this from the consumer’s point of view, I am surprised that Parliament, the defender of Market Europe, defends production in this market in such an ultimately very poor fashion, because, given this list of exceptions, people will refuse to pay for goods which they will want for nothing. You must admit that it is surprising.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions in which these goods are produced are not being questioned either; yet, to produce goods, we need creative artists and authors. I have no idea what you will sell or buy when you no longer have any creative artists or authors but, in any case, Market Europe will not fare very well. That is what will happen to the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if we take a close look at the details of the directive, it becomes apparent that if we say, for example, that archives come into being immediately, or after an hour, this means that everything broadcast on television is archive material. Anyone with an interest in history is slightly surprised to hear archives being defined in this way. If archives are just that and if private copying is widespread, what can we do to ensure that culture, and indeed cultural diversity, is not just heritage, museums, not just a list that we will find in places that are the stuff of archives and museums, but that it is a living creative field? To do that, we must – like it or not – assist artistic creation. To assist artistic creation, we must support copyright rather than criticise and attack it. That is what my group will try to defend by its vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although the harm caused by this system is obvious, because harmonisation provides less protection than that previously afforded by Member States, despite that fact – I shall not give an example – the Commission and the Council are now proposing to transform all cultural services into saleable commodities, as Mrs Fraisse has just clearly said. Using as an excuse the concept of the information society, which the financial markets are in the process of levelling out – we have come a long way in the last three years – this directive and the common position, which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market suggests we adopt, seek to make all European creativity, i.e. all creative artists, subject to the international trade regulations of the World Trade Organisation, though it is here dubbed the World Intellectual Property Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is utterly ironic that the European Union institutions are basically in the process of becoming a subservient lapdog to globalisation without restriction or conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that many of us here in this House will try to stop the acceleration of this process which completely strips the concept of Europe of all content and all meaning. I hope that we shall reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market because they break with the tradition of a Parliament – as Mrs Fraisse quite rightly said – which has, until now, defended diversity in cultural production in Europe and the specific, and indeed exceptional role, of creative artists, writers and artists in European civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The information society is no more than a snare and we are indulgently allowing it to be used here in an attempt to confiscate the most timeless and most precious thing we can own – intellectual property. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It might be said that consumers’ interests are society’s interest in seeing the dissemination of both knowledge and cultural expression rather than the suppression of these and their subordination to the interests of capital. Naturally, creators and authors must, and ought to, be assured of a fair economic return, but I have to say that, for me and the People’s Movement I represent, there are two crucial main points. The first is to ensure the public’s or consumers’ interest in being able to use both knowledge and culture. In Denmark, the country I come from, we have a very well developed tradition of youth and adult education, and this must not be interfered with. The second point is that the systems of enforcement and sanctions that have been developed and are practised in the different legal cultures in the different countries must not be interfered with either. We have our own special system in Denmark, and I do not think it should be substantially interfered with.</p>
<p class="contents">I can say that I have seldom been exposed to such intensive lobbying as in connection with this proposal, and that is by no means strange. There are billions of kroner and euros in the system in a sector dominated on the producer side by, above all, the American entertainment industry, but it is not of course this that we must mainly take an interest in. I might also add that copyright is, of course, among the most complicated aspects of the legal world and that, within the copyright field, the law relating to digital products is practically incomprehensible. I cannot imagine that more than a few per cent of MEPs at the most have any idea at all of what the problems really relate to. Against this background, it is an interesting fact, and one worth noting, that the proposal has been so balanced that I shall recommend my group to vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the robust way that he has defended the balance of this directive. As the rapporteur said earlier, with the compromise amendments – the set of amendments passed by our committee – I am sure that we have the right directive at the right time.</p>
<p class="contents">No one pretends that it is perfect. It is important to emphasise that. There has been considerable difficulty in reconciling national traditions and exceptions. There are countries that have levies, for example, on recording media. We have sustained the objective of this directive because, above all, we want to encourage new creative artists to exploit this new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an enabling, liberating directive. It gives them the assurance that they will be able to create new works and to get fair rewards. Equally, on the balancing side, consumers expect that their existing rights to be able make private copies, to be able to use library facilities, to be able, if they are disadvantaged, if they are blind or disabled, to have access to new forms of media will be safeguarded. We have got that balance right.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point, colleagues, is that we are not arrogant enough in the Legal Affairs Committee to suggest to you that this is here for all time. We have proposed and recommend very strongly to you that in 18 months' time this directive be reviewed. We must, in a very fast-moving world, take responsibility for our work but be prepared to modify it in accordance with what is going on in an entirely new world. That is a very important provision. We have strengthened the review provisions. We propose a very speedy turnaround, and that shows that the Legal Affairs Committee has taken a very responsible attitude to this directive. We now want to get it transposed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we want to get it transposed as soon possible? Because a crucial element in this quick transposition is that the European Union will be able to accede to the World Intellectual Property Organisation Treaty and that will bring a very important measure of global protection to all the artists involved. That is really a prize worth having and worth having as quickly as possible.</p>

The protection of intellectual property has always been a cause for concern to the European Union and to the European Parliament, because we know that only this protection guarantees that we have culture, that culture flourishes and that economic production takes place. This could have been an historic moment for the European Parliament. But it is not. For the first time in our lives, the protection of intellectual property is being undermined. With the consent of the European Parliament. As we have found out, the European Parliament still has only one objective: no conciliation. After 18 months of deliberation in the Council, we have been told to get a move on. After 18 months of deliberation in the Council. And then the Council says "unanimously", although it could have voted by a qualified majority, given the balance we keep hearing about. And then Parliament is asked not to make any more amendments. We might just as well shut up shop and go home.</p>
<p class="contents">I have never seen Members put under such pressure by their governments and parties. But with the Council and the governments on either side, in the Council and in Parliament, what need is there for Parliament? Parliament has its own responsibility and it must live up to it. The common position has dramatically undermined authors' rights. I am on the authors' side and I call on Parliament to restore these rights – at least to some degree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So, is there to be a return to all that lobbying? Is it not all a bit too soon?</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that can be said about the directive has already been said. It is therefore a little difficult to begin to speak now. I nonetheless want to express my warm thanks to our wonderful rapporteur. I also want to say that the official line of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party at first reading was more balanced than that of the parliamentary majority. We may therefore also consider that essential parts of the common position need to be changed. At first reading, we were concerned that the parliamentary majority was jeopardising the Internet’s function and that there was a danger of creating a system which also made it unattractive to have material on the Net in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the <span class="italic">Human Genome Project</span> have been published on the Net in the last few days, partly in the journal, Nature and partly in the journal, Science. Via Nature, everyone can access the material but, via Science, it can only be accessed by paying SEK 3 million. That is, of course, a protection of copyright. But is it the same thing as promoting the spread of science and knowledge? Where is the right balance to be found? This is something I believe we should reflect upon when we adopt a position on the directive. I also want to point out once again that our group’s official position now is to have as few amendments as possible. The common position is a fragile compromise which must not be disturbed. Otherwise, we might not get the WIPO Treaty signed, which is of course the most important thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am a bit sad that the tone of the debate has been in part negative and guarded. We need to remember that new communication media have in fact liberated interaction between people and ideas and between people and people. Of course, that does give rise to some reasonable concerns about the protection of legitimate copyright interests in this age. Meeting these concerns must not result in obstructing the ordinary person, the scholar or the scientist from accessing and using materials that are subject to copyright.</p>
<p class="contents">The balance between producer interest and consumer interest has been stressed in this debate and is the balance that we have to try and strike. If we in the Union were to strike the wrong balance, it would seriously inhibit the democratic openness of discussion that the Internet and related media facilitate. If, for example, unreasonable restraints are placed on libraries, students, scholars and scientists will be the sufferers. The Inter-Library Loan scheme might become an accidental casualty of change.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft directive before us refers critically in Article 5.5 to the well-established restraints on fair practice that are enshrined in the Berne Convention. Subject to this, Member States will be able to create regulated limits on copyright interests for the benefit of disabled people, private consumers, public libraries and museums and some others. That is permissive – Member States will not, in any case, be required to do it. It will be a matter for local judgment guided by subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">As an author myself, I yield to no one in maintaining the rights of authors and performers – I add "performers" deliberately – to fair recognition and reward, but these values will be misapplied if they are used as a ground for obstructing reasonable limitations on commercial copyright interests and, I stress "the commercial interests", which we need to differentiate from the moral right of the author, which is expressly excluded from this directive. Like others, I am delighted with Mr Boselli's work and I hope that we will pass this with relatively few changes.</p>

With the new technologies available, artists are now looking more than ever to the European Union to deal with this issue at Community level. Clearly, there are numerous contradictory points, multiple pressures and disputed theories and we ourselves – over and above the lobby – have seen another side of authors, another side of consumers of these works and, in this sense, I think that the work undertaken by Mr Boselli and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is the work of a magician. I think they have seriously improved on the Council's common position, which did too little to protect intellectual property. It is important that we limit the exceptions and I think that the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market is a careful amendment, although it might have gone further. We also have to take care with libraries and archives because, if we make various amendments here, we will end up infringing intellectual property rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, this issue, which is difficult and has been a very arduous task for all of us in the Legal Affairs Committee, has thrown up a number of conflicts, one of which most often mentioned within this House is the conflict between copyright-holders and consumers. Many people feel that these two differing groups cannot be reconciled. I believe that within the present text we have the opportunity to reconcile these two parties, and to lay down a number of fundamental principles which could be copied in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles comprise, firstly, remuneration for those who are entitled to remuneration for creative works and for new ideas; secondly, the right of access to those works; thirdly, the rights of libraries and other institutions, educational institutions in particular, to make use of these works for research purposes; and fourthly the introduction of a number of exceptions to the copyright legislation to ensure that people with disabilities will not be unfairly discriminated against and to ensure that educational institutions can continue. This is no easy task. Each of us has a right, and indeed a responsibility, to ensure that we can maintain the best possible balance for all within the fundamental principles of consumer rights and protection as well as remuneration for the artists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His task was made all the more difficult by the Council’s failure to adopt all Parliament’s amendments at the first reading stage.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned, the aim of the new directive is to adapt current legislation to the new technologies while respecting the international treaties adopted in 1996. There is a legal void with regard to copyright protection in the digital age. The Internet is a powerful tool but it must not be an unregulated area. The cultural and economic stakes are high and, with the Internet expanding at an incredible pace, a legal framework in Europe must be found, as in the United States, where this kind of framework was adopted two years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, an urgent matter, all the more so because this directive is a key factor in the fight against illegal copying, a matter particularly close to my heart, and because pirate copying is the scourge of the information society. It becomes all the more crucial in a digital age because the first copies and any subsequent copies retain a quality close to that of the original. Consumers are acknowledged as being entitled to make private copies. It is only natural that the eligible parties are fairly compensated in return, it is only fair. In order to ensure that we are talking about purely private copies, the law must be written in sufficiently restrictive terms and the wording of the definition must be perfectly unambiguous. So I am in favour of a restrictive definition of private copying.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to protect works of art against illegal copying, eligible parties must be given the opportunity to use technical protection. That is why hackers, as they are called, must be fought by clamping down on the means they offer to the public to overcome protection systems, thereby encouraging the illegal copying of protected works of art.</p>
<p class="contents">This new context is constantly changing and raises many questions and concerns. The directive must balance the interests of consumers and eligible parties. It is trying to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but in a necessarily imperfect way.</p>

In other words, hope remains for authors and performers that this Parliament will have a change of heart, if not today then tomorrow. I say this because I believe that a balance can be reached between the democratisation of knowledge that the new technologies and the Internet offer us with one click of the mouse and the continuity of the creative act, which will die out as a result of non-payment and lack of fair compensation for its value.</p>
<p class="contents">The virtual contradictions that mask financial interests and demagogic opposition are therefore unacceptable in this real social debate. Let us not be naive, Mr President. Creation and performance are economic factors and always have been. Hence the need for copyright and performers’ rights. Unfortunately, the Commission proposal and the Council common position reveal a degree of thoughtlessness that warrants our criticism. In the name of consumer freedom, the consumption of art is pitted against artistic creation, in the same way that the Council accepts creative freedom as an obstacle to knowledge and to Europe’s citizens becoming enriched by culture. New media technologies are not the enemies of intellectuals and authors, but we cannot pretend that, in this cyber world we live in, protecting the weakest member, i.e. authors, means defending a monopoly. Let us not, in the name of consumers’ rights, sacrifice authors’ rights, and, above all, let us not accept the idea that artistic creation should be suspicious of technology, which is the cardinal sin of the text we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, despite the considerable efforts that have been made and despite a certain amount of progress, which is due to the attitude of our rapporteur, whom I warmly congratulate, we still do not have a text that brings together the three fundamental freedoms of the cultural act: the freedom to create, the freedom to communicate and the freedom to consume. Unless we achieve this quickly, some of Europe’s fundamental values will disappear for good. Furthermore, our languages will be of little use if, at the altar of technology, they become merely the remnant of the identity that gives any European uniqueness in the eyes of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am absolutely convinced that we must endeavour, on a couple of points, to revert back to Parliament’s opinion from the first reading, which we adopted exactly two years ago by a very large majority. It is mainly to do with tightening up on private copying, establishing clear regulations for the on-line storage of data so that the responsibility of Internet providers is better defined in line with the e-commerce directive, and the possibility of Member States being able to introduce technological protection measures without disrupting the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I defending this opinion? First and foremost for reasons of principle. Is there anything more important than protecting private property? Is there anything more personal than the product of human talent, the creation of something which rejuvenates. The European Parliament has always been the guardian of Europe’s cultural heritage and that is how it must stay, also in the digital age. If we do not put a brake on indiscriminate copying, there will soon be nothing left to copy. After all, if we fail to provide protection, people will lose the incentive to be creative and produce new works of art.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is more to this debate than principles. Copying will also cost jobs. According to current estimates, one hundred thousand jobs have been lost in the European Union owing to the copying of CDs. The State loses out on income too. Apparently, the State of Belgium alone, which I know very well, misses out on one billion Belgian Francs in VAT as a result of this practice, and the same goes for all government coffers. We must be in no doubt about what it is we are risking. I would like to echo Mr Rothley’s sentiments. So all in all, I think there is good reason to support the amendments which I tabled, together with many of my fellow delegates, for which I would like to thank you in advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we impose higher costs on e-commerce and increase the cost of connection, Europe will not be the world’s most competitive economy in ten years’ time, which was, of course, the goal set in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">If we in Parliament are to increase people’s confidence in us as European legislators, European legislation must be coherent. The e-commerce directive and this directive must be in line with each other. We must not therefore alter Article 5.1 or recital 33. Copyright must not become a patent right because of the new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Our good will towards copyright holders must not involve our creating regulations which restrict freedom of expression or obstruct the free flow of information. The ceiling above which an outsider’s server may be closed down must be set very high.</p>
<p class="contents">If every bit of data that passes through the server every second is to be monitored, we forfeit what basically has made the Internet successful and has increased productivity in countries with high Internet use, namely the fact that <span class="italic">everyone</span> gets to be involved and to share knowledge. I would therefore ask you to support Amendment No 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Our copyright legislation must be created around the work and around the artist entitled to remuneration, and not around the technical form. TV channels must decide for themselves how they make their programmes and the music they want to play available. A right to copy on-air broadcasts for storage on electronic systems is required because, otherwise, the giant recording companies will be able to control the radio and television companies’ music output. I would therefore ask you to support Amendments Nos 31 and 32.</p>
<p class="contents">Copyright is not absolute. Exceptions are required. I therefore hope that the Chamber will safeguard the exceptions for libraries and for people with disabilities so that we do not undermine democracy by shutting people off from information.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have a WIPO position to defend, and we must vote consistently. I am hoping for a positive decision, for then we shall be accepting international responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very little because the level of harmonisation of copyright in the European Union will not be very high, much lower in fact than in many other less important areas. National traditions are simply too varied here and the interests of all those involved are too diverse and too contradictory. But, compared with the current situation, we will have achieved a great deal if the directive as contained in the common position or, even better, with the amendments adopted tomorrow, can be improved and can enter into force quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">At least we now have a standard definition for a few core concepts. The full development of the information society will no longer be impeded by a grossly insecure legal framework and rightholders and their agents will have ways of protecting their interests. Technical means of protection in particular are developing at a very fast pace. At the same time, however, we must guarantee wide public access in the interest of cultural diversity. This obviously includes not criminalising consumers or charging them several times over. It also includes developing cultural heritage, such as the cultural heritage stored in television archives, and ensuring that libraries are able to fulfil their valuable role in the online world.</p>
<p class="contents">Like some of my fellow Members, I feel that the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has compromised the hard-struck balance in favour of the exceptions and I therefore hope that at least some of the proposed amendments tabled by my group will still be accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It makes no sense for Europe to herald the fundamental value of its cultural and linguistic pluralism and, at the same time, render it devoid of meaning. I do not know of a single author in Europe who agrees with the compromise amendments on private copying. This means something. I also wish to say that it would be much better if the directive were to give this satisfaction to authors now and were then to be reviewed within eighteen months.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the exceptions to copyright that are provided for open the way for a cancerous type of process, which will give rise to the wild, uncontrolled proliferation of copyright abuses. The more exceptions are provided for, the further the right to regulate is weakened and the more harm is done to the harmonisation and coordination of national organisations in this field. It is extremely important that the range of exceptions should be limited. It is not enough to remove the possibility of using copies for purposes that are directly or indirectly commercial. Copies are very frequently used for atypical purposes such as exchanges, loans and gifts, and there are many other causes for the uncontrolled proliferation of further copies, which has serious consequences for authors and publishers.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless the concept of private use is made to mean only home use or copying with the author’s permission, instead of solving the key problems, the directive will continue to be an incentive to unbridled piracy. To conclude, I shall quote from one of the messages that I have received from various Portuguese authors, one of whom is the Nobel prize winner, José Saramago, who writes: “as artists, we are particularly concerned that large-scale unauthorised copying will make it impossible for all those who make up the creative community to earn a living. Those who have nothing to do with the creative process will consume the fruit of other people’s labours without making any productive reinvestment, unless private copying effectively retains its status as private copying”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive, as a piece of intellectual property legislation, must try to incorporate structures to reward the creative industries, which in my own Member State alone contribute GBP 60 billion to our national economy and GBP 8 billion of exports. They also employ 1.4 million people. At the same time we must not strangle or restrict freedom of access for legitimate users. This fits in with the EU action plan and the forthcoming summit in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the Internet genie is out of the bottle. We cannot stop technology, but neither can we allow it to render copyright dead or to let it be abused as a safe haven for piracy, parasites and mass illegal copying. Yesterday's Napster ruling clearly showed that copyright has to be applied to cyberspace. We must not encourage people to infringe copyright.</p>
<p class="contents">The composition of the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur has maintained this balance between rightholders and users effectively. The exceptions which currently exist in Article 5 mean that the generous provisions on exceptions that we have in the UK will continue to help vulnerable users and ensure that schools, libraries and research and education institutions can benefit from private copying. In the UK we also record programmes so that we are able to watch at the time and place we choose and that, of course, needs to remain intact.</p>
<p class="contents">It is however regrettable that some unnecessary, unhelpful amendments have crept in at the last stage in committee. I refer to: Amendment No 11, which seeks to give an exemption to broadcasting companies which no one else enjoys and which would reduce performers' and artists' rights in contravention of the WIPO Treaty; and Amendment No 4 which, in the second part, introduces an unnecessary and unwarranted EU restriction of the freedom of national courts to decide how to deal with injunctions, in particular concerning piracy, and amendments on levies. While this is well-intentioned, we cannot support this approach because it could be interpreted, taken in a vague sense, to mean that levies should always be introduced when you have no technical protection in place. The UK does not operate a system of levies and we do not want to see it introduced through the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as with every other piece of legislation on the Internet that comes before us in this House, we should use the provisions of the directive, the review clause in Article 12 and the role of the contact committee to prevent both the abuse of private copying and any abuse or limitation on fair use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is amazing how calmly and composedly he has cut his way through this jungle of interests. The lobby has already been mentioned. It was indeed persistent but, on balance, it was, I think, a fair discussion and for that, too, I am grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been said about the need for balance. I am afraid that the common position has not yet struck the balance needed. Parts of the directive penalise the internal market, parts penalise consumers and parts penalise innovation. The directive penalises the internal market because, at the end of the day, the harmonisation is only cosmetic and the Member States are defending their conventional payment systems tooth and claw, even though they are basically unsuited to the digital world. We want to prevent that, which is why we suggest in proposed Amendment No 12 that the Member States should at least submit new compensation systems to the Commission and obtain a recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also penalises consumers because it is quite possible that consumers will have to pay once when they buy a CD or a DVD and then again in the form of a levy. Then when they come to make a copy, the data is copy-protected and the Member States have not even undertaken to look at copy protection systems and legal copying. And the common position penalises innovation because it tries desperately to keep the global fee system alive in the digital age, despite the fact that new technology basically makes global fees superfluous, because copy protection allows the rightholder to be paid directly for copies and that is the fairest solution of all. That is a directive for a citizens' Europe. It offers the citizen security and fair freedoms in the digital world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the House will also limit the number of amendments that are adopted and not interfere too greatly with the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a directive which I and the British Conservatives welcome because it is vital that European citizens are given proper protection of their creative rights and creative works in the digital era and this directive will deliver that to them. This is essential because, not only is there an enormous music industry and film industry, we must not forget the highly successful computer games industry which is generating a huge amount of revenue in the United Kingdom and in a number of other countries across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">But the British Conservatives also firmly uphold the rights of those who take advantage of the public interest exceptions. Groups such as the disabled, including blind people who need access to Braille copies in order to access the Internet, groups such as researchers, universities and libraries: these kinds of rightholder exceptions are vital for promoting research which is so important for our economic health. A less high profile exception that is important economically is the right of reverse engineering of computer software. We would entirely reject those amendments which are seeking to inhibit the use of those public interest exceptions. We therefore accept the need to tighten up the wording of Article 6(4), to clarify its role and to restrict it to truly on-demand interactive services.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, there is another exception which is more controversial, which is ordinary private copying. We are all pleased to see the rules have been tightened up to prevent it being abused and used as a loophole for piracy; that is something that we would also support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would lastly express some reservations about Amendment No 11. If this amendment is passed, I fear that the broadcasters will have an advantage. They are getting something for nothing. I think this skews the common position a little and, unless someone can convince me otherwise, I would have grave reservations about Amendment No 11. We have a sensible and balanced position and I fear Amendment No 11 may tilt that balance in the wrong direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common position therefore regulates when third parties can copy copyright protected works such as texts, graphics, music or films. Member States are also required to protect copy protection under the law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, from the consumer's point of view, that private copies will be allowed in future. There are – and this has been addressed several times today – differing views as to what constitutes a private copy. In my view, the definition should include the family environment. That means that the proposed wording accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has my full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is also important from the consumer's point of view that new remuneration schemes, i.e. levies on equipment or media, can only be introduced if they help to achieve equal levies throughout Europe. Unilateral national action, such as the so-called PC levy, which keeps cropping up in discussions in the Member States, would only make equipment even more expensive. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also tabled proposals here and I call on Parliament to support them tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the directive also regulates when broadcasting organisations are entitled to use their archive productions for on-demand services and when they must first sign a contract with all the rightholders involved in the TV production giving them the right to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The rights, the archives of broadcasting organisations are of immeasurable cultural and historical value. We must therefore do everything we can to make these archives accessible, including for online use. I therefore urge the House to support Article 11 and I agree here with my fellow Member, Mrs Villiers. I think that there is every reason to offer a separate regulation for public radio. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, my first words are words of thanks, and I can also add my thanks as Chair of the committee, for the work carried out by the rapporteur. I say this sincerely. I believe that it would be hard to find a more complex issue, on which pressure has been unleashed from all the interest groups, which have legitimately fought to have their positions adopted by the various political groups. There are few issues on which we have received so many, if not tonnes then at least metres of faxes and e-mails as we have on this one. The rapporteur has been masterly in his navigation of these turbulent waters; he has always remembered that a rapporteur is rapporteur for a committee, not for any group or any position: he is rapporteur for a committee and he is duty-bound to reflect the majority position of that committee. I am pleased to say that the amendments put forward by the rapporteur were supported by a huge majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, please allow me now to make some comments which are going to reiterate what has already been said, because at this point in the debate everything has really been said already. This is a much-criticised directive, and it is worthy of criticism; but this is a case, as is so often the case in European integration, in which what is best and what is feasible are not the same thing. As has already been said, we are starting from a situation in which there is complete divergence between the laws of the various Member States, where in reality the concept of copyright, the whole gamut of obligations and rights which this concept is represented by in our different laws, is not even similar. It is not simply that are not the same, but that they are not even similar. To try to harmonise them is an heroic quest.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is a first step, but Parliament accepted this gamble on first reading and therefore it has to be consistent and continue in this vein on second reading. At first reading we could have adopted disruptive positions; that was not Parliament's approach, and we accepted a directive full of exceptions. At the moment, the amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs, added to certain other notable amendments which deserve to be supported, improve this directive on certain substantial points, such as private copying. I refer to what has already been said. And in summary they improve the directive by making it a first step in a system of harmonisation which will have to be carried out over time, a first step which furthermore will enable us to fulfil our international commitments, since until this directive sees the light of day, the two WIPO Treaties will not be able to enter into force. That is also an important responsibility at a time when we talk so much about globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this important subject. I should like to begin by saying that the discussion on this subject has taken a long time, as Mr Boselli indicated a little while ago – I think he said three years. That indicates the importance, as well as the controversial nature, of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">After long discussions, in which this Parliament played a very constructive role, we are meeting today to consider what I hope will be a balanced compromise. We now need to agree as rapidly as possible on a set of rules on copyright and related rights in the information society at European level, in order to increase the competitiveness of the Community and to implement our obligations at international level. This directive will be a cornerstone in the establishment of a harmonised legal framework on copyright, in a digital environment in particular. As such, it belongs to those measures for which the Lisbon Summit at the end of last year set us a clear deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community needs such a framework if it is not to lag behind its major trading partners and, as was remarked this afternoon, we are already lagging behind the United States. Furthermore, without such a framework in place, rightholders and users cannot respond to the challenges posed by technology in the market place.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption and implementation of this directive is also a precondition for the European Union to ratify rapidly the two WIPO treaties which were adopted in 1996. Here we carry an important responsibility as the coming into force of the WIPO treaties depends largely on this directive and therefore on us. The formal decision to ratify the treaties was adopted by the Council on 16 March 2000. Parliament has already endorsed that decision, but without this directive neither we nor the Member States could move towards ratification of those treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the legislative process, Parliament has played a significant role. The important changes to this directive introduced after the first reading clearly reflect the influence of this Parliament. We welcome the constructive approach of the rapporteur, Mr Boselli, and of the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio – whom it is a particular pleasure to see again today – and also the members of the committee which Mrs Palacio chairs. They have shown a keen sense of appreciation of the issues at stake in this directive, reducing the number of amendments to 15. Most of those amendments were, in fact, compromise amendments, also on crucial issues. The Commission appreciates the efforts made by the rapporteur on private copying and by the Committee on Legal Affairs when it voted not to amend the technical copies exception.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in a position to accept all of the compromise amendments. We have, however, concerns about some of the other amendments which have been voted. I shall now say something about each of those amendments, although very briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Amendment No 2. It deals with remuneration schemes and the products to which they apply, even though such schemes are outside the scope of the directive. This directive requires fair compensation for certain of the exceptions, one of which is private copying. The system of fair compensation envisages flexibility for Member States, rightholders and users to establish the basis on which those exceptions apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 does not respect the principle of proportionality because it seeks to lay down conditions for the granting of injunctions. But the issue of sanctions is already adequately dealt with in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11, about which I shall be speaking in reply to some remarks made a little while ago, adds a further exception for broadcasters, framed in terms which were rejected by Parliament itself at first reading. The exception proposed goes too far and risks putting the Community in breach of its international obligations under the WIPO treaties, for which this directive is meant to be the instrument of ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 12 as currently drafted risks undermining the Commission's own powers to take measures when Member States take action that affects the functioning of the internal market. For this reason the Commission cannot see its way to accepting it.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 13 adds nothing to the text of Article 6(4) which already provides for fair compensation for private copying. In the light of the above, we support the compromise amendments by the rapporteur and the Legal Affairs Committee but not Amendments Nos 2, 4, 11, 12 and 13. Moreover, a series of further amendments, namely Amendments Nos 16 to 45, have also been tabled in Parliament. The majority of those amendments have been rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee. Three amendments, however, namely Amendments Nos 26, 27 and 28, are new.</p>
<p class="contents">In all cases, however, the issues raised by those amendments have been thoroughly considered, not just in the course of this second reading, but throughout the history of this directive – considered by my services but also by Member States. None of those further amendments are acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to address some of the questions and comments made this afternoon more specifically. First of all, there are the questions and remarks made by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Manders and Mr Echerer on private copying and on the use of the words "for private use". The question is should or should not the Commission support Amendment No 5 and if so, why? In reply to that question, I should like to say that the Commission is of the view that Amendment No 5 provides greater security for rightholders while at the same time allowing legitimate private copying in a manner which is enforceable both by Member States and by rightholders and it clarifies what is commercial by including ends that are both direct and indirect.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several safeguards built into this directive which qualify the extent to which private copying may take place and thereby act as a deterrent to piracy. That is particularly the case in relation to the protection of technological measures. The Commission is of the opinion that the reference to "private use" is too narrow a formulation and would give rise to difficulties in enforcement especially in the private domain.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question and a comment made by Mr Manders on Article 5 and in particular on the words "transient" and "incidental". On that point, Article 5(1) has been at the centre of attention in all institutions. There have been many amendments tabled both in the Legal Affairs Committee and again here in Parliament which propose changing the text of the common position. The Legal Affairs Committee very wisely rejected all those amendments when it voted on 6 February 2001 and the Commission accepted the text of the common position which states that the acts of copying, in order to be exempted, must be transient <span class="bold">or</span> incidental and that they should form an essential part of a technological process. The Commission prefers "or" to "and" in this context because making the conditions cumulative by adding "and" may make the whole exception too narrow and less operational. In addition, including "essential" seems to make sense, as it would be difficult to justify why the exception should privilege acts of reproduction which are not an "essential" part of a technological process.</p>
<p class="contents">The current text of Article 5(1) together with the interpretative guidance provided in recital 33 ensures – in the Commission's opinion – a satisfactory balance between the rights of rightholders and the legitimate interests of other parties involved such as telecom operators, users, consumers and other parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with Article 8 on remedies and sanctions, Article 5(1) will help to provide for effective copyright protection against piracy whilst at the same time promoting the smooth operation of networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, it gives service and access providers the necessary legal certainty for their activities on the networks. Responding to comments made by Mrs Fraisse, Mrs Villiers and a number of others on Amendment No 11, may I say the following. There is already an exception for broadcasters based on an amendment adopted by this Parliament at first reading. It introduced a new exception for broadcasters relating to so-called ephemeral reproductions. To introduce a further exception would not only disturb the balance of rights achieved, but could also lead to a violation of Member States' international obligations. In relation to Amendment No 11, a similar amendment was proposed at first reading. The Commission could not accept that amendment as it disturbed the balance between the parties concerned and might have caused considerable damage to authors, performing artists or other holders of the rights concerned. The Commission is in agreement with Mrs Fraisse, Mrs Villiers and almost all speakers in rejecting this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mrs Palacio for her support throughout the history of this proposal. If it had not been for her leadership and guidance in the Legal Affairs Committee, it would not have been possible to steer our way through both the first reading and now the second reading, and the Commission is duly grateful to her. The Commission would also like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament in general for the excellent work performed. The common position represents the views of an entire cross-section of diverging interests: the creative and artistic communities, the academic, educational and scientific communities and also consumer groups and bodies representing socially disadvantaged users. Nonetheless, in spite of the complexity of the groups whose interests have to be taken into account, the directive ensures a sufficiently high degree of copyright harmonisation and it should be possible to reach a final agreement today. We have gone very far in meeting the concerns of everyone so, as Mr Boselli put it earlier this afternoon, I hope that this proposal will be approved tomorrow and that it will be adopted with as little change as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
