<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacek Dominik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(PL) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, at today’s sitting of the European Parliament I have the pleasure of presenting to you the position of the Council adopted on 25 July relating to the draft budget for 2012. For the second time, the budget is being accepted in accordance with the procedure outlined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and I hope that this time we will use the experience we gained during the debate on the budget for 2011. Preparing a satisfactory agreement on the matter of the budget for 2012 will require an open and constructive dialogue between both our institutions. I hope in particular that we will be able to avoid any references to issues which are not directly linked to the annual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, I noted with particular satisfaction the fact that the first round of tripartite talks regarding the budget, which took place on 11 July, was conducted in an atmosphere of fruitful cooperation. I hope this favourable atmosphere will continue to prevail and help us to adopt a realistic and balanced budget for 2012. Please allow me now to present four factors which guided the Council during its analysis of the draft budget presented by the Commission. It is a certain philosophy which was worked out during discussion of the draft budget by the Ministers of Finance, and it reflects the method of assessment and approach to certain expenses which were proposed by the European Commission. I hope that it will enable you to understand the Council’s position better, rather than just presenting you with dry numbers describing the level of expenses in individual areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the growth of the European Union budget must reflect the situation in the Member States, which are going through a period of weak economic growth and are struggling with serious budgetary restrictions. Special attention should be paid to controlling administrative expenses, so that what we do accords with the efforts of the Member States made in this respect at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, within the European Union budget, priority should be given to those programmes and measures which help to lift us out of the current crisis, support competitiveness and convergence, give real EU added value, create opportunities for employment and accelerate economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, increasing funds for commitments and payments must be realistic. We should primarily take into account current and future indicators of budget performance and also absorption capacity in order to avoid any overestimates, which would only put unnecessary pressure on national budgets and increase outstanding commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the current levels of the Multiannual Financial Framework should be adhered to in the budget. The budget should also be flexible, thanks to its having the appropriate margins to enable reaction to unforeseen situations or the incorporation of new policy priorities during the budgetary year.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it gives me pleasure to inform you that in relation to the 2011 budget, the Council’s position on the draft budget for 2012 anticipates an increase of 2.9% in funds for commitments and of 2.02% in funds for payments. I am convinced that this budget will provide an appropriate balance between fiscal consolidation on the one hand and support for those European Union programmes and projects which can be most effective in helping to bring the Union’s economy to life on the other hand. It will also be sufficient to meet financial commitments resulting from current and planned programmes and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to this, I think we are definitely able to explain such a budget to our citizens, who have been hit by the effects of the economic and financial crisis, and in particular that we are able to explain the far-reaching measures for fiscal consolidation in Member States and to demonstrate the legitimacy of such a budget. The Council has agreed specific reductions in funds in many particular budget lines within all budget areas. These reductions have been introduced based on a detailed analysis of budget implementation in previous years, whilst also taking into account the latest budget forecasts. I believe that these reductions are completely justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in order to assess the actual capability of the Commission and the Member States to realise programmes and actions in a timely manner and make use of appropriate funds during the course of the budgetary year, information available in the descriptions of the work of the Commission was used. Special attention was given to administrative expenses and the level of employment within the institutions. This includes administrative expenses related to operational programmes and executive agencies, as well as funds paid from the European Union budget to decentralised agencies. The Council is of the opinion that in accordance with the direction of measures being put in place at national level, the efficiency of EU administration should be increased. Additional funds and employment plans, both for European Union institutions and for decentralised agencies, were approved only in the case of new bodies and bodies which have been given new responsibilities. The resulting position of the Council, based on a clear method and an objective approach, constitutes a balanced, fair and justified solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by stressing the issue I raised at the very beginning of my speech, which is the need to achieve the correct balance between taking into account the difficult economic situation in which the Member States find themselves and providing sufficient means in the budget to support in particular those programmes and measures which can aid economic growth. I am convinced that the budget for 2012, set at the level proposed by the Council, will enable the European Union to fulfil its obligations, and will also be a signal to Europe’s taxpayers that we are acting responsibly and that we are serving the interests of those we represent. I should also like to add that in accepting this draft budget, the Council has also accepted an obligation and adopted a declaration that if during the 2012 budgetary year there is a lack of funds in one of the budget areas and no redeployments can be made, then in that case, on the basis of a proposal made by the European Commission, additional funds will be guaranteed by the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, our budgetary trialogue in July was the first opportunity to react to the Council’s position. Developments in the summer confirmed that these are very difficult times. It is even more important, therefore, to strike a balance between budgetary self-restraint and necessary investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European budget should be seen as supplementing national efforts to reinforce investment in growth and jobs. That has determined the structure of the draft budget proposed by the Commission. To avoid falling into a deflationary vicious circle, we must use all the instruments we have at our disposal. The European budget is one of them. So our budget proposals target increases in the area of competitiveness and cohesion as well as the phasing-in of agricultural payments – which, of course, is obligatory. The other budget headings came in below inflation, however, with clear self-restraint in administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has decided to cut payments by EUR 3.7 billion and adjust the increase of the payment level to the 2011 inflation rate forecast. At the present time, I cannot agree that this is the right way to strike a balance between smart investment and self-restraint in this time of austerity, especially when it comes to the EUR 1 billion cut in the area of competitiveness, which is conducive to growth and jobs. I cannot reassure the two arms of the budgetary authority that what is in the cohesion budget after the Council reading is enough, as our proposal was EUR 18 billion below the forecast from the Member States. The same Member States are now cutting the figures that they were proposing, and on which our draft proposal was based.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that we have outstanding commitments. We are proposing to raise the co-financing rate of the structural funds to 95% in order to help six Member States that need to be helped at the present time. Therefore, the inflation rate cannot be seen as the only parameter that needs to be taken into account when framing the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I will deal only briefly with the other aspects of the Council proposals. With regard to the heading ‘Europe as a global player’, we acknowledge that the Neighbourhood proposals have been taken into account, but at the expense of pre-accession assistance and development aid. Having seen the humanitarian consequences of the drought in the Horn of Africa, I am not in favour of cutting development aid to the poorest parts of the world. Under Heading 3a we have cuts in the European Return Fund, FRONTEX and the External Borders Fund, although we clearly need much more budgetary funding to underpin immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The further cuts to the administration budget fail to acknowledge or assist the Commission’s efforts to freeze its administrative budget. This will not help us to persuade our administration to exercise self restraint. I acknowledge the very focused, positive approach of Parliament’s Committee on Budgets. Our role now is to provide updated information in the expectation of compromise over the 2012 budget. We promise to provide updated information and monitor trends in budgetary payments so as to provide realistic data as a basis of conciliation. This would make a valuable contribution to the achievement of a timely, reasonable budget in response to all the challenges with which we are currently confronted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These positions are apparently very different, and often far removed from each other – I am thinking in particular of payments and research funding – but there are also points of convergence, and we must concentrate our efforts on these areas of agreement if we are to reach a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has an extremely difficult task, as it must also look to the future and play a proactive role. This is the most challenging area for elected institutions: they must operate with their feet firmly in the present, and hence be acutely aware of the tough times we are experiencing, the consolidation being carried out by Member States and the sacrifices being demanded of our fellow citizens, while always working to ensure investment, economic recovery and a more prosperous future.</p>
<p class="contents">This year especially, the budget should strike a delicate balance between opposing desires: to maintain the stability of the present, but also to continue to look forward and start laying the foundations for the future straight away. This Parliament will make strong calls for funding for the 2020 strategy, starting with the creation of quality employment, but there are also new areas of responsibility, some of which are sensitive: I am thinking of the new responsibilities granted to us by the Treaty of Lisbon, and of the European Securities and Markets Authority. Then we have the level of payments, which should be correct from the outset, from the time of budget approval, and also undeniable emergencies such as migratory pressures and the situation in North Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, with regard to the documents on priorities, on which we have already voted, we will continue, in a consistent and transparent manner, to develop and create instruments that will enable us to implement our policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In light of this, it should be noted that the expenditure of all the European Union institutions represents only 5.6% of the EU’s overall budget. I do not know of any institution or organisation in the EU or any Member State that performs like that. The idea that some are trying to put across, that administrative and operating costs are too high, is therefore wrong and unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the institutions’ spending has been managed rigorously over the years. In fact, the expectations of spending by Parliament, the Commission and the Council on operating costs are currently being exceeded. Indeed, following tabling of the budgets for all the institutions, a margin, or surplus, of over EUR 500 million will be left over in 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that, despite the increase in new jobs, the new powers resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon, and new institutions such as the European External Action Service (EEAS), the institutions have managed to table rigorous budgets, surpassing even the expectations of the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is neither correct nor sensible to compare the updating of Parliament’s budget for 2012 with the 2011 budget. Indeed, the inclusion of 18 new Members as a result of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, means the additional expenditure of about EUR 10.6 million. Croatia’s accession also has practical implications for this figure. I mention only these two situations, which arise from expenses that are impossible to reduce or eliminate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that Parliament’s forecasts have already been adopted by this House; that the proposal for updating the administration was 5.2% and we reached agreement on 2.3%. We have made an effort but we want to go even further, as far as we can go with possible cuts. Of course, the additional sacrifices that we will impose on ourselves must be legal and must have a prompt effect.</p>
<p class="contents">As for institutions other than Parliament, I regret the blind cuts that the Council has made. There must be money to pay wages, to meet commitments and cover current expenditure. We need strong institutions with the necessary resources to face the current challenges, and that is what the public expects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to highlight a few significant elements relating to the Council’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Council is not questioning the European Union’s priorities. Please note that in relation to expenses for the Europe 2020 agenda, the Council has not restricted any funds earmarked as commitment appropriations. Secondly, the cuts proposed by the Council are not short-sighted and are not the result of Member States’ lack of awareness of the challenges faced by the European Union. They are, first and foremost, the result of the very difficult budgetary situation in which the Member States find themselves and the necessity of striking a balance and finding the lowest level of funding necessary to finance all the European Union’s priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware of the fact that for many Member States finding an additional EUR 100 million or EUR 200 million from their national budgets is very difficult at the moment. They have large deficits and are having problems financing debt in the market, so we are not just talking about imaginary problems which are getting in the way of real discussion on the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this year we will manage to conduct a debate on the budget which will focus on the problem of the 2012 budget, and that we will all have learnt lessons from the negative aspects of the previous debate a year ago and avoid them on this occasion. I hope that we will work well with Commissioner Lewandowski and I hope that, as always, the European Commission will, first and foremost, play the role of an honest mediator and suggest solutions to all sides which will be beneficial for the entire European Union. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In effect, we are running the risk that strategic European objectives will not be achieved.

It looks at the EU budget through the eyes of an accountant, as a budget of net spending. However, in the midst of the economic and social crisis which has brought Europe to its knees and forced the Member States to apply harsh austerity policies, we must defend the importance of the EU budget in strengthening investments. It must be made clear that the EU budget, which accounts for a mere 1.01% of EU GDP, finances actions which either cannot be financed by the Member States or the financing of which at European rather than at national level brings about exponential – mainly economic – gains. This is its added value. It enhances the efficacy of national financing and helps to reduce overall spending through economies of scale, by concentrating and coordinating resources and services. An excellent example is customs union, where every EUR one spent at EU level is equivalent to EUR four saved by the Member States. Today more than ever, we must seek support for sectors which strengthen economic growth, such as political cohesion, research and innovation, thereby supporting efforts to save national resources and apply fiscal restructuring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
