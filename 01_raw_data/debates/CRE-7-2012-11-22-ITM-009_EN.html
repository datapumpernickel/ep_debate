I am quoting the Directorate-General for Trade. China has quickly become the world’s second largest economy and biggest exporter in the global economy. It therefore offers huge opportunities, but also significant challenges to the European economy. In just two decades we have gone from a situation where our commercial ties were virtually non-existent to the current situation of forming the second largest economic partnership in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Our businesses can take advantage of the incredible business opportunities offered by the growing Chinese market. However, access to this market continues to be difficult in many ways, even though it has improved in recent years. Foreign businesses face a series of commercial barriers in China, which do not exist in the European Union. Conversely, Chinese exporters have benefited hugely from the European Union’s open market. The successful Chinese penetration is particularly due to low prices. At times the prices are abnormally low, which cannot be explained solely by equally low wages and environmental standards in China.</p>
<p class="contents">The state subsidisation of exporting industries, extensive infringement of industrial property rights and dumping are surely part of the explanation, as apparent from the report adopted in this Parliament last May entitled ‘EU and China: Unbalanced Trade?’ Obviously, that report by Marielle de Sarnez answered that question with a ‘yes’.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the European Union and China clearly have much to gain from intensifying their trade relations, provided that this occurs in accordance with the rules of the game, under conditions of fair trade and reciprocal treatment. However, concerns about China’s less fair trade practices have been on the increase and have resulted in the European Union adopting anti-dumping measures, as recently happened in the ceramics sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the issue of abnormally low prices does not exist solely in those sectors regarded as traditional. On the contrary, the devastating Chinese competition is also affecting some of the European Union’s most innovative industries, including the solar panel industry, which has seen a huge rise in imports of Chinese products, leading to serious concerns about the economic sustainability of that European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, the Committee on International Trade, which I chair, decided to ask an oral question about China, which it is my job to convey to this House and to the Commission. I must therefore ask, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade:</p>
<p class="contents">First, is the EU prepared to respond in an appropriate and timely fashion to these concerns?</p>
<p class="contents">Second, can the Commission confirm that the number of cases of imports from China being sold at abnormally low prices is increasing? Which cases have been brought to the Commission’s attention?</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the European Union and the United States are the main markets for photovoltaic applications due to public support schemes for renewable energies. Is it likely that United States anti-dumping measures will have consequences for the European Union market, that is through a diversion of exports to the European Union? Can the Commission provide statistics on the mutual ownership of companies based respectively in the European Union, the United States and China in the solar sector?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, what is the Commission’s assessment of the situation of the photovoltaic sector and of the polysilicon exporting sector in the European Union? Does it think increased imports from China could injure industry in the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, can the Commission explain how it intends to adapt the instruments at its disposal to an EU-wide strategy to develop the renewable energy sector and European Union exports in this sector?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, moreover, how does the Commission intend to develop a common industrial strategy with Member States in order to maintain the competitiveness of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the questions that my committee approved. These are the questions on which I await an answer from the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is in Brussels for negotiations with his Canadian counterpart in what we hope will be a conclusive set of talks.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the oral question at hand, allegations of Chinese unfair trade have been around for a long time, as we know. It is a fact that China accounts for the largest proportion of EU trade defence investigations and of measures imposed. China is Europe’s largest trading partner. Some of the increase in Chinese export volume has been achieved through the use of unfair trade practices such as dumping and subsidisation. As a result, it is not surprising that there should be a relatively large number of trade defence cases involving China.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the reason why the spotlight is increasingly on this issue is the size and strategic nature of the sectors now being affected by low-priced Chinese imports. Sectors in which Europe has so far had the upper hand in terms of technological advancement and sophistication are now increasingly facing Chinese competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the most open market in the world and we welcome competition for its potential to stimulate technological improvements and lower consumer prices. Where competition is unfair, as happens to European companies either because of foreign exports on the EU market, or market access restrictions for EU exports to foreign markets, the Commission has a role to play in accordance with internationally agreed trade rules. So, if European industry brings forward evidence of unfair trade, the Commission will investigate the matter, whether this concerns China or any other trading partner. We have both a duty and a legal obligation to restore the level playing field so that European industry can compete on fair terms, provided that measures are in the overall interest of the Union. This includes an assessment of the possible impact of measures on downstream and upstream industry.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 September this year, the Commission initiated an anti-dumping investigation into imports of solar panels from China following a complaint by the European solar panel industry. Two months later, the Commission also initiated an anti-subsidy investigation in relation to the same product. The initial evidence presented by the European industry indicates that Chinese exports of solar panels are sold at dumped and subsidised prices, and imports have increased dramatically at prices which appear to heavily undercut those of EU manufacturers. These investigations cover solar panel imports with a value of more than EUR 20 billion annually – a record value in the history of EU trade defence. The alleged dumping and subsidies will be investigated in line with our legal procedures, in accordance with our WTO obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European solar panel industry is facing difficult times. To establish to what extent this situation is due to Chinese unfair competition is the very purpose of the ongoing investigations. The oral question put to the Commission by Professor Moreira refers to the fact that the United States imposed definitive anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on imports of solar panels from China on 7 November – just a few weeks ago. In our investigation, we will examine whether US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures will lead to a diversion of Chinese exports to the European market. But it has to be borne in mind that US imports from China are around USD 3 billion per year, far lower than the EU’s.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission will thoroughly investigate all of the relevant aspects of the case and will, at the latest by June next year, issue its provisional findings. As always, interested parties will be given the opportunity to comment before a definitive conclusion is drawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Overcapacity has now reached such a dramatic scale that in 2011, according to Goldman Sachs, production capacity stood at 45 gigawatts in China alone, compared with only 28 gigawatts of new installations worldwide. I am firmly opposed to protectionism, but in this instance, the dumping is obvious. </p>
<p class="contents">My first request to the Commission is this: we should do our utmost to ensure that the maximum nine-month period for the preliminary investigations is not utilised to the full. The Commission should do everything in its power to speed up the investigations so that they can be concluded well before the maximum nine-month period expires. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are signs that at present, the warehouses are being emptied at a very rapid pace in China, with shiploads of solar modules now already being transported to the European Union. I therefore request the Commission to look at the issue of pre-registration as well. We must do our utmost to ensure that this anti-dumping instrument, should it enter into force, can achieve at least a modicum of effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings us to the issue at hand. I have serious doubts that we can solve the problem by means of the anti-dumping instrument and negotiations. What the Chinese have done here, particularly in recent months, is unbelievable! My greatest concern is that the Chinese Government is clearly exerting massive pressure on many companies in the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot have a situation in which companies – and not just a few, but large numbers – come to us in Parliament and say: ‘Please do everything you can to ensure that this anti-dumping case does not go ahead. Please help us, because if it does go ahead, we must expect massive restrictions in the Chinese market’. For that very reason, it is time we sent a clear signal to China at long last that the situation that has prevailed over recent years cannot continue. We have sheathed our claws for far too long in these dumping cases. It is time to stop knuckling under!</p>
<p class="contents">My problem is as follows. Companies are coming to me and saying that this case should not be taken forward, there is nothing more that can be salvaged, and we would do better to focus on the next case. However, when the next case comes around, it will be the same scenario and we will hear exactly the same arguments being put forward. I would be very grateful if the Commission could investigate this anti-dumping case swiftly and then act fast to take effective measures, if there is clear evidence that dumping is indeed taking place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing with an issue which concerns fair trade. This is not about protectionism for European products. There is one issue, and one issue alone, at stake, namely ensuring that our trade relations are based on fairness. I therefore believe that the threat scenario that China is now creating is completely inappropriate. Let me make it very clear: we want transparency in the investigations, and we do not welcome attempts by China to obstruct these investigations by creating threat scenarios, in which European companies are put under pressure with the threat of countermeasures that are supposedly in the pipeline. No, that is not part of the discussion! We intend to investigate the matter. In reality, however, it is about the following issue. Under what kind of working conditions are the solar panels produced in China? Which direct and indirect subsidies go towards supporting their production? What about the value chain as a whole? There are many different aspects which need to be investigated very carefully. </p>
<p class="contents">There is undoubtedly overcapacity. We cannot have a situation in which dumping is used to reduce overcapacity, at the expense of European jobs and industry. That is why we need to achieve transparency here. Hence my question, and this is also addressed to the Commission: does this transparency exist on the Chinese side as well? Does the Commission have the opportunity to look at all of the relevant facts? That should have been China’s immediate reaction: instead of making threatening gestures, it should have created transparency. Secondly, are you willing to pursue this process to the end, even if China were to yield at the last moment? We do not want a situation like the ethanol case with the United States, when the procedure was shelved at the last minute! I urge you to pursue it right to the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These products – photovoltaic panels from China – account for EUR 21 billion of imports a year, which represents 10 % of total Chinese exports to Europe. Obviously, with such a large volume, Beijing’s unfair practice of subsidisation puts the entire European photovoltaic industry in peril.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my report on relations between the European Union and China, Europe should not hesitate to use trade defence instruments whenever the principle of fair trading is not respected, and must obviously do so in accordance with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, other major players in international trade, such as the United States, have got to grips with the issue. They recently imposed import tariffs of 24 to 36 % on Chinese solar panels sold at abnormally low prices in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about Europe starting a trade war with China: it is simply about stopping being naïve, enforcing our rights, and preserving our industry and jobs. Our new relationship with China must be one based on reciprocity. This principle must govern all areas, within the framework of a real and balanced partnership, but this will require Europe to adopt not only trade defence measures, but also an offensive industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The renewable energy sector is of particular strategic importance, as it can be a source of growth for the future. If we so decide, we have the capacity to put Europe in the vanguard. We have the technology, the know-how, and, vitally, the human capital. What we are lacking is the will to do this together. It really is a matter of urgency, so let us decide to do it now! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We spend our time, in our constituencies and our countries, defending Europe, saying: ‘There will be no way out of the crisis without Europe!’. Europe is complicated: it is made up of 27 states, soon to be 28, and it is always extremely difficult to come to and implement European decisions quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Forgive me, Commissioner, but when I listen to you, I think: ‘I hope workers in the photovoltaic sector are not watching the video of your speech!’, because they are going to say to themselves: ‘Is this the Europe that is supposed to be protecting me?’. For years, we have been told that the fight against climate change, renewable energy objectives, green industry and the green economy would be pillars of European growth and the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, what are we seeing? We are seeing European institutions that are, in part, petrified by China, and which are taking months and months to potentially react or take provisional measures. How can we justify to these workers, and to all those who are fighting for Europe to protect industry and protect workers, the fact that the United States have, in the space of a few weeks, taken strong measures, imposing import tariffs of up to 250 %, while in Europe, we finally got around to opening an investigation in September and may have provisional measures by July, or failing that, by the end of the year?</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that <span class="italic">First Solar</span> has already closed its sites in Germany; it is true that the news about <span class="italic">Q Cells</span> is now history. How many small and medium-sized enterprises are in difficulty today, however? Even if they do not make it into the news, they are in difficulty. Thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs are under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee, we urge you to accelerate the process of introducing provisional measures. Europe was a leader, with ambitious goals on renewable energy and a strong renewable energy industry working alongside it. Today, we are losing that industry, while a real trade war is taking place between the United States and China in the strategic sector of renewable energy, which is so crucial to our competitiveness and our future energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that today, the European Union has once again opted to wait indefinitely. At this rate, the decision will be taken by default. When there is no European photovoltaic industry left, there will no longer be any point in taking measures: you will be able to rest at ease!</p>

The problem lies in the excessive public support for the purchase of electricity produced by these renewable sources. On the one hand, state support has brought about incredibly rapid growth in photovoltaic equipment and, on the other hand, this has meant an increase in the production of components by enterprises in Member States. However, in Europe, these have been squeezed out by cheaper imports from China. Some existing companies manufacturing panels have even been closed down, resulting in an increase in unemployment in some regions. As can be seen, there has been a distortion of market principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for artificially induced demand on the market and the constantly falling price of imported photovoltaic panels with an increase in the price of electrical energy for the population has created a need to resolve this situation and the realisation that the solution needs to be very quick. The dispute between the European Union and China in trade relations with respect to imported panels should therefore be resolved by agreement and cooperation so that there are no market problems and this is a really important matter with high time pressure for a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in danger of taking a very short-sighted view of complex economic and social developments and, with populist actions, unleashing a trade war with China. That is the last thing the European Union needs at present!</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we need fair trade and fair production, but what has actually happened? As a result of cutbacks in the support schemes in Germany and other countries, the photovoltaic market was artificially constricted, resulting in increased competition. If this triggers a major dispute at the political level, we jeopardise the trade links of manufacturers of polysilicon, as well as putting exports in other sectors at risk. We also jeopardise the global supply of technologies that we urgently need for the transformation of our energy systems. Mr Jadot has already highlighted the challenges associated with renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussions about the EU budget and the positions of the EU Member States on drastic budget cuts also have implications for the issue that is the subject of this debate. We cannot achieve a solution through confrontation. We can only do so through cooperation. I would therefore urge the Commission to make arrangements as soon as possible, as time is really pressing, for a joint forum for European, US and Chinese manufacturers and to support networking between developers, producers and distributors in these three key regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, we are debating, on the one hand, the investigations initiated by the Commission on possible anti-dumping measures, and on the other hand, the reaction from China, which has initiated similar investigations. Action is long overdue. The European solar industry is undoubtedly an important and growing high-tech sector in Europe. In Austria, too, there are leading manufacturers who are safeguarding key jobs in this future-oriented industry and creating new ones. </p>
<p class="contents">These companies have a crucial role to play in the attainment of our renewable energy targets and must certainly be protected. I have a general suggestion to make about trade relations between the EU and China, for although the feud between the EU and the Chinese solar industry has triggered this ongoing and simmering conflict, it is not the fundamental problem.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may say so, the solar industry is merely the tip of the iceberg. The main question that I would therefore address to the Commission today is this: to what extent is China generally willing to view Europe as a partner in future? From my perspective, it is clear that the European Union and China must in future be strategic partners who meet on equal terms. It must be a strategic partnership, built on mutual respect and trust. What I believe is missing at present is this mutual respect, and without mutual respect, there can be no trust!</p>
<p class="contents">Resolute action is needed here at long last. Of course, other questions arise in this context as well: what approach will the Commission pursue in future in order to develop this mutual trust? How can we give more effective protection and support, more generally, to European industries that lead the field globally? No one wants protectionism, but we do need protection and fairness. The photovoltaic industry is vitally important to Europe and, as Daniel Caspary has already said, the industry is now in dire straits. Even so, it is still creating thousands of jobs directly and indirectly and embodies European know-how. That is why we must ensure that the rights steps are taken. Europe must show its strength here at last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say this because the last thing I would like in the present case is to find myself agreeing with Mr Salvini.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware of the situation we face: we know that China represents a great opportunity, and not simply great problem. It represents an opportunity for those enterprises that export EUR 170 billion worth of goods to China each year, although we also import EUR 250 billion and are only too aware that this represents a trade deficit. However, if we do not introduce strict and exact rules on fair trade, we will end up by fuelling and increasing the wave of anti-European sentiment against the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">What else do we need to say or do to make you understand in that ivory tower that is the European Commission what kind of situation we are facing? These continuous sermons on innovation and development mean very little to the sector we are dealing with here, which is at the cutting edge in terms of innovation and development! So all of you, and all of the gnomes that live inside the offices of the Commission, cannot but be aware that the timetables that you are proposing do not do justice to Europe and the problems we are facing!</p>
<p class="contents">I think that you should make an effort to understand that for the largest economic power in the world to impose the rules of fair trade simply means enhancing its own dignity, showing that it understands how to live within the great global village of the present with a sense of dignity.</p>

The debate has become quite heated but that is because the industrial and employment situation in our countries is extremely difficult. This is an important decision in both real and symbolic terms, since we are dealing with a matter of principle. We must send out a sign of legality and respect in view of the all of the efforts being made by our business world. When I say ‘our world’, I do not mean it in a protectionist sense; I mean that the business community looks to the decision-making in Strasburg and Brussels with a feeling of belonging, searching for guarantees that only the Commission, Parliament, our institutions, can provide for fairer trade.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must tread cautiously: this is also a business world that looks at China as a great export opportunity, and that in certain sectors is actually managing to stay afloat precisely because of the market it has managed to develop in China. Thus we are not attempting to be protectionist and raise barricades. We simply do not want to be deceived, especially in an area such as photovoltaics, so crucial for our sustainable future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner, we must try to speed up this investigation so that any compensation can be estimated and claimed much sooner than planned. Moreover, since all of this debate is really about what to do in the wake of something that has already happened, we must also work on prevention. We should therefore strengthen the bilateral agreements to avoid any repeat of this kind of situation with China or other countries in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the areas where Chinese production is clearly provoking fear among competing manufacturers in the US and Europe is the production of solar panels, which Chinese manufacturers are able to sell at a substantially better price than our companies. Instead of using the better prices of Chinese solar panels for a massive expansion of this photovoltaic source of green energy in Europe, we are allowing lobbyists from the Solarvol AG company to push for the introduction of tariff barriers, the result of which will simply be that this technology once again becomes inaccessible due to price. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that in this case we must decide whether we wish to meet our ecological targets set out in the Strategy 2020 and encourage the most rapid and effective expansion of renewable sources of energy or to protect the profits and economic interests of companies which are unable to compete honestly with the substantially cheaper and more accessible Chinese products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Generally speaking, there is agreement across party lines, as is already apparent. There are merely differences on points of detail. In principle, I welcome the existence of our trade defence instruments. That goes without saying. However, we must ensure that these measures are proportionate.</p>
<p class="contents">The technical anti-dumping procedures that we have available should not be misused for political ends or deployed for protectionist purposes. We all understand that Europe’s success depends on open markets. That is nothing new, but it is a principle which continues to hold good in times of crisis. The anti-dumping procedure against China in respect of solar cells has the potential to escalate into a fully fledged trade war, and that is something which we avoid as a matter of urgency, for this cannot be in our interests. Indeed, since the end of October, the Chinese have initiated an anti-dumping procedure in another sector and our industry will suffer as a result of that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission to take action as a matter of urgency, through bilateral talks, to resolve this impending trade war and find a global solution for the industry as a whole. I ask you this: has the Commission – as called for by Chancellor Merkel – already attempted to make a direct approach to the Chinese Government in order to defend the interests of Europe’s solar industry at the highest level? Dialogue could also be a way forward here. </p>
<p class="contents">As my last point, I would like, if I may, to draw your attention to points 4 and 5 of our oral question. At a time of crisis, we need a common industrial strategy and that, if I may so say, is an area where policy initiatives and impetus do not appear to be forthcoming from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Currently, trade between the two partners is worth approximately EUR 1 billion a day, the second largest amount in the world. </p>
<p class="contents">Despite China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001, its commercial relations with the European Union are still characterised by barriers to trade in goods and services, such as difficult market access for economic operators, restrictions on exports of raw materials, and the use of subsidies and dumping. </p>
<p class="contents">As highlighted by the Commissioner, the Commission has begun to respond to complaints by European companies, and two investigations regarding the sale of photovoltaic panels sold at artificially low prices are now in progress. Estimates show that these products are sold at up to 80 % less than the production price. The European Union gains considerably from its relationship with China; however, this type of behaviour affects the competitiveness of European companies in a climate in which the European Union must promote and support employment within its own industries. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s relations with China must be strengthened, but they also must be based on reciprocity and respect for trade laws.

<p class="contents">Yes, it is clear that China is flooding the European photovoltaic market with cut-price products, taking advantage of our incentive policies. However, what will happen once all our businesses have gone bust, no longer able to cope with this particularly aggressive competition? I will tell you: the Chinese have a particularly aggressive trade policy which involves annihilating all of their competitors through low prices and then, once they have a monopoly, imposing outrageous price hikes.</p>
<p class="contents">At this rate, in three or four years’ time, we will no longer have any European producers of photovoltaic panels and the prices of the Chinese panels will be at least 50 % higher than those offered by our industries at present. In short, we have everything to lose by failing to react to behaviour like this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my fears, Commissioner, about the reaction of our Chinese friends. No sooner had they learned that the European Commission was going to investigate allegations of subsidy dumping in the photovoltaic sector than they themselves launched an anti-dumping procedure on European silicone, lodging several complaints with the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p class="contents">Should we see this as a form of intimidation? The Chinese investigation will most probably return its results before the Commission, as their legal time limits are shorter, and I join Daniel Caspary and Vincent Jadot in asking the question: what are we going to do if the Chinese authorities conclude that dumping has occurred?</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are thinking about the possible modernisation of our trade defence instruments, I think that this situation is a good illustration of the fact that, whatever else we do, we must not reduce them.

It is very good that we are having this discussion in Parliament and I underline that everyone must play fair and we should make sure the playing field is not tilted towards either side. The Chinese export of solar panels to the European Union clearly showed dumping characteristics and the EU must react promptly. Our friends across the Atlantic, the United States, have already reacted. I fully agree with Commissioner Rehn that we have a duty and a legal obligation to act. We must act without any unnecessary delays. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the problem lies with ourselves, or rather with yourselves – addicted to neo-liberalism and the economic and political ideology of globalism.</p>
<p class="contents">I will let you into a secret. China might have transformed itself into a capitalist economy and country but it is not neo-liberal. It competes with us with artificially depressed wage levels, which not only reduce costs, but also prevent the development of a market for imports from the West. Flagrant patent violations, 19th century working conditions, cheap state loans and subsidies and a grossly under-valued currency. In the meanwhile, they are stock-piling resources and Western currencies.</p>
<p class="contents">If you think that global companies originating in the West are on our side, remember they are eagerly relocating where the costs are lowest and the conditions worst. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The standards applied by the Commission in trade defence matters are among the highest in the world. We practise a fact-based trade policy in defence of European economic and social interests, and in the interests of the competitiveness and sustainability of the European economy and European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As in all cases, the Commission will thoroughly and objectively assess the facts presented by all economic operators concerned, in order to come to an impartial assessment of the need for trade defence remedies.</p>
<p class="contents">With specific reference to registration, the complainants have formally asked for the registration of imports before the adoption of provisional measures. The Commission is currently considering whether this request meets the legal conditions enshrined in the basic anti-dumping regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the speed of the procedure, the Commission formally received a complaint from the industry at the end of July 2012 and took the next steps as early as September 2012. That was done rapidly and expediently. We are bound by legal deadlines imposed by the WTO and by EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The speed of a case is determined by its complexity and size, as well as by the need to carry out investigations properly and accurately, in order to ensure the maximum effectiveness of further measures. Rest assured that my colleague, Commissioner Karel De Gucht, is fully aware of your concerns. I will pass them on to him, and he will recommend appropriate action to the Commission with the best interests of EU industry firmly in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade defence instruments are part and parcel of the Commission’s toolkit to keep international trade fair and, where necessary, to improve market access abroad for EU exports. We can use WTO channels, as we have done, including during the present Commission mandate. I will pass on other specific concerns as well to Commissioner De Gucht.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as for the renewable energy sector, the European Union will continue to pursue fair and liberalised trade globally. While you would prefer this to happen under the WTO framework, the Commission is also open to a multilateral agreement on renewable energies, such as the proposed sustainable energy trade agreement. I am referring to many interventions in today’s debate. You also see that our bilateral trade agreements will also tackle both tariff and non-tariff barriers in the renewable energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also working specifically on the promotion of this relatively new sector through the Renewable Energy Directive, which was adopted in 2009. This directive has established a regulatory framework that has been conducive to technological development, cost reductions and innovation through economies of scale. Europe must indeed be in the front line of developing this very important sector as regards the greening of our industries and as regards our being in the leadership role in the next and current industrial revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you called for a joint industrial strategy. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that just a few weeks ago, in October 2012, the Commission adopted a communication on an integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era which focuses on competitiveness and sustainability of European industry. It outlines a very important policy debate, which I trust will also be conducted in this House. We have to do everything we can in order to ensure competitiveness and a strong future for European industry, for European workers and for European Union citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No matter what anti-dumping measures the European Commission decides upon, in practice, these measures are regularly circumvented by Chinese exporters, which, for example, route their goods through Taiwan in order to avoid import tariffs. The case of solar panels is a particularly symbolic one, but since the start of 2012 I have on several occasions supported French businesses from different sectors, all confronted with the same problem. I call upon the European Commission to further intensify its relations with the Chinese authorities, because our companies can no longer be satisfied with partial measures and sector-specific agreements. The Commission must establish a real strategy, set trade goals and make progress very quickly, as the situation is grave and requires an urgent response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
