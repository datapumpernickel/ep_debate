<p>(EN) Reform of the management of external assistance is a key priority for this Commission and for the Commissioner in charge of external relations personally. A very visible aspect of the Commission’s wider reform efforts, making a success of its external assistance is vital for the effectiveness of the Union’s external action and its international standing more generally. The Commission knows that this is well understood in the Parliament and its sustained support for Commission’s efforts has been hugely important and much appreciated.</p>
<p>The Commission has been able to implement the main elements of the reform in line with the Commission’s communication of 16 May 2000. EuropeAid was created on 1 January 2001 with a clear mandate for all stages in the delivery of projects while Directorate General Relex (DG) and DG Development have made impressive progress in improving the strategic programming. The Commission has advanced well with a vast programme of devolution of management responsibilities to nearly 50 delegations – the remaining largely ACP delegations should follow later this year provided that the necessary resources from the EDF can be secured. At the same time, the Commission has dismantled the notorious technical assistance offices in the Relex sector and brought the related activities in-house. Budgetary rules and Information Technologies systems have been overhauled and Commission’s new contracting and tendering procedures are generating positive feedback.</p>
<p>There are already encouraging signs that the reform is having an impact. honourable Members are aware of our success stories for example in the Balkans and Afghanistan. Improvements are seen in the general picture of budget execution as well as significant reductions in the backlog of old and dormant commitments. However a reform on this scale inevitably takes time and it will be some time before the full results are in place. In particular, the Commissioner in charge of external relations is concerned that a lot remains to be done to address the deep-seated problems with the European Development Fund.</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring progress carefully and has been providing the Parliament and the Council with regular reports. It is taking action to take advantage of synergies and to improve the new financial systems, in line with recommendations from a recent review by the Commission’s Internal Audit Service. As for the possibility of further structural change - this may not be the right moment to make any such attempt (when the reform is still taking root, and the Commission is in any case going to have to restructure in less than two years, when the next Commission takes office). But the College of Commissioners is examining the options.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0861"></a>

<p>A year ago, at the end of the war in Afghanistan, a number of individuals were taken prisoner. The reason for their imprisonment was alleged collaboration with Al-Qaida.

The US Administration has refused to grant him and his fellow prisoners, several of whom are from EU Member States, the status of prisoners of war. They have not been allowed contact with lawyers or to receive visits from relatives. Previous suspicions of involvement in murder in connection with a convoy of prisoners in Pakistan have now been dismissed by the authorities. Despite that, Ghezali is being refused a trial in a court of law to examine the accusations against him. Throughout the whole of this year, the US authorities have allowed Ghezali to send only one single letter to his family.</p>

<p>(EN) The Union – including the Commission - continues to be concerned at the three areas in question (as well as the Middle East issue), something that has been underlined by the Council on repeated occasions. Since 1998, following the election of reform-oriented President Khatami in 1997, the Union has opted to pursue a Comprehensive Dialogue with Iran, an approach that includes semi-annual dialogue meetings in which issues of concern are addressed.</p>
<p>On Human Rights, the Commission has just managed to open a specific Human Rights dialogue with Iran (Council conclusions 21 October 2002). A first roundtable meeting in which the Troika and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) took part was organised in Teheran 16-17 December 2002, with the help of financing from the Commission. It proved sufficiently fruitful to warrant a continuation during the current Greek presidency (another roundtable envisaged).</p>
<p>Concerning the fight against terrorism, the Union’s view of Iran’s role is somewhat more balanced than the United States view the honourable Member refers to. The Commission mainly remains concerned at the Iranian support to certain Palestinian groups, which it has stressed repeatedly to its Iranian counterparts. On the other hand, Iran was very early in its official condemnation of the 11 September attacks, it has expressed a desire to participate in the global fight against terrorism, and has played a positive role in the fragile reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>While noting with satisfaction that Iran has adhered to the Non-proliferation Treaty, the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions, the Union continues to encourage Iran to join the International Atomic Energy Agency Additional Protocol for Nuclear Material Safeguards. It appears that Iran in general has been complying, including accepting inspections of its nuclear sites. Our energy dialogue with Iran is not directly related to these issues, it is a matter of a gradually evolving, non-nuclear cooperation.</p>
<p>Thus, while the situation in Iran still remains far from satisfactory on many fronts, the Commission continues to support the Union’s global approach towards that country, aiming to support the reformists. The Commission has been given the mandate to pursue negotiations for a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, negotiations that are linked to parallel negotiations on political dialogue and counter-terrorism (Council conclusions of 17 June 2002). These negotiations provide the Commission with an additional forum and give it added leverage as – even if there are no direct, explicit conditions - they are linked to expectations of progress in the areas of concern.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0885"></a>

<p>(EN) There was an extensive discussion at the EU-Russia Summit last November on Chechnya, including the political context of the conflict, Human Rights violations and humanitarian assistance. It is unfortunately hard to point at any tangible improvement regarding the situation in Chechnya ever since. On the contrary, many lives have been lost since, notably due to the recent deadly terrorist attack against the main building of the Chechen government in Grozny, which killed over eighty and badly wounded many more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, pressure from the Russian and Ingush authorities has led to the closure of the Aki Yurt tent camp for displaced Chechens in Ingushetia, which the Union deemed not in compliance with the international humanitarian principle that the return of internally displaced persons to Chechnya must take place exclusively on voluntary basis.</p>
<p>As regards international presence in Chechnya, the mandate of the OSCE Assistance Group has not been renewed upon expiry due to Russia’s determination to deprive its mandate from any political role.</p>
<p>Finally, no improvement has been reported concerning Human Rights violations, the prosecution of which remains, at best, scarce.</p>
<p>As at the Summit, the Union has continued to express its concerns to Russian authorities regarding all these issues and will continue to do so within the framework of our bilateral political dialogue with the Russian Federation, including at the coming Ministerial on 24 January in Athens. Whereas the closure of the Aki Yurt camp could not be reversed, one could argue that Union diplomatic activity on this matter has so far prevented further closures of other tent camps in Ingushetia. In addition, the Union is holding ongoing discussions on the issue of the OSCE Assistance Group with a view to finding a solution so that it can remain in Chechnya with a meaningful mandate.</p>
<p>As concerns the question of whether the Union will table a resolution on Chechnya at the forthcoming 59<span class="sup">th</span> session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, it cannot be answered at this stage since the Council has only started discussions on the matter, in which the Commission is actively involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0834"></a>

<p>(FR) First of all, the Commission acknowledges the need to pay more attention to variations in regional and local situations, in particular at the stage of policy-making and implementation. The Commission highlighted this in its communication of 4 December 2002 on the institutional architecture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is aware of the diversity of the infra-national authorities, which requires a flexible approach. The Commission, however, is not in favour of special status for regional and local authorities which have legislative powers. We must avoid any discrimination between bodies which have legislative power and those which do not, in particular when the latter often carry out similar administrative functions. We must also take care not to interfere in the internal organisation of the Member States and to safeguard the institutional balance, in particular the concept of a Union of States and of peoples.</p>
<p>Consequently, we must ask ourselves whether the right of the regional and local authorities which have legislative powers to bring proceedings before the Court of Justice in order to protect their rights might not lead to a genuine split between infra-national authorities which have legislative powers and those which do not. We must also consider the implications of this right to bring proceedings for the effectiveness of the Union’s legal system.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like the role that the Committee of the Regions could play in legislative protection for the prerogatives of these local and regional authorities to be examined in greater depth.</p>
<p>These questions, however, are part of a broader debate. The Commission does not, however, wish to make value judgments, even indirectly, on the varying constitutional situations that exist within the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0835"></a>

<p>(EN) The Community-Nickel Directive refers to objects that come into direct and prolonged contact with the human skin, such as jewellery or wristwatch cases. This Directive does not cover coins and therefore the limit stipulated by the Community Directive 94/27/EC is not applicable.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, the normal use of euro coins does not represent a risk for European citizens. The Commission is not aware of any particular cases of patients suffering from nickel allergy which can be traced back to the handling or use of one and two euro coins (the six other coins do not contain any nickel at all). Additionally, the Commission is not aware of any scientific evidence of a recent increase in nickel allergies among European citizens.</p>
<p>Moreover, a recent independent study, conducted under the authority of Prof. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, winner of the Nobel Prize of Physics, showed that the amount of nickel released from the one- and two euro coins under normal conditions is significantly lower than the limit stipulated by the Community-Nickel Directive for objects that remain in prolonged contact with the human skin.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission does not intend to propose an amendment of Council Regulation (EC) 975/98 of 3 May 1998, in which among others the technical specifications of the euro coins are laid down.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This Council regulation establishes exceptional support measures for persons and enterprises active in the fisheries sector, in shellfish farming and aquaculture in the Spanish coastal areas affected by the oil slick caused by the Prestige oil tanker.</p>
<p>These support measures are intended to provide:</p>
<p>financial compensation for persons or owners of enterprises as a result of temporary halts in their activities,</p>
<p>aid for the replacement of fishing apparatus,</p>
<p>aid for the cleaning, repair and reconstruction of shellfish and fish farming sites,</p>
<p>financial compensation for the replacement of crustacean stocks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this Council regulation provides for certain derogations from criteria which must be met by spending in order to benefit from co-funding from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance (FIFG) within the framework of Council Regulation (EC) 2792/99<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in order to facilitate and speed up aid for the victims of pollution.</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission agrees with the honourable Member on the need to implement a European prevention policy aimed at combating the risks of maritime accidents and serious pollution. This has been the objective of specific proposals by the Commission following the Erika accident in December 1999.</p>
<p>Firstly, the implementation of an effective policy on the prevention of maritime accidents at Community level largely relies on better knowledge of maritime traffic in European waters, particularly by means of the development of networks for the exchange of information between the Member States. To this end, Directive 2002/59/EC<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> was adopted by Parliament and the Council on 27 June 2002, aimed at establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system.</p>
<p>This new text requires vessels visiting European ports to use automatic identification systems (or AIS) as well as black boxes similar to those used in aviation. The Member States will have to set up coastal stations capable of receiving, utilising and exchanging the information gathered on the movements of vessels and their cargoes.</p>
<p>Without awaiting the deadline for the application of this directive, the Commission has begun the necessary work to establish a European database and a data communication network amongst the Member States, known as SafeSeaNet, integrating the information provided in real time by the AISs of ships and allowing the operational authorities to be aware at all times of the identity, position and cargo of ships sailing European waters.</p>
<p>SafeSeaNet, the only example of a common maritime management system covering all the Member States – and open to other States with coasts on the seas bordering the Union – will allow for improved monitoring of navigation, better detection of situations putting the environment at risk, including those involving ships in transit, and increased effectiveness of actions in the event of maritime accidents.</p>
<p>Secondly, Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, adopted on 27 June 2002, will provide the Union with a European maritime safety agency, benefiting from the collaboration and combination of the existing expertise in the Member States in the field of maritime safety. The main objective of the agency is to provide the Member States with the technical assistance necessary for the implementation of the Community’s maritime safety legislation, to develop databases and exchanges of information between the Member States and to constantly assess the conditions of application of maritime safety rules within the Community.</p>
<p>Following the Prestige accident, the Commission has speeded up the implementation of the agency: following the appointment of its Director in January 2003, the agency, provisionally set up on Commission premises in Brussels (pending the Member States’ decision on the location of its headquarters), will be operational from the middle of 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Directive 2001/42/EC<a href="#defann_13_5" name="refann_13_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> applies only to plans and programmes as defined in the relevant provision dealing with the definitions (article 2). This Directive however is not yet implemented in the Member States as the date of transposition has been set by 21<span class="sup">st</span> July 2004. Therefore any reference to this Directive cannot be made in this stage.</p>
<p>As regards Directive 85/337/EEC (environmental impact assessment (EIA) Directive) as amended by Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_13_6" name="refann_13_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, and taking into account the information provided, the Commission is not in the position to identify if this is a project that falls into the scope of the EIA Directive and if this project will lead to an important increase of the maritime traffic having negative effects on the environment and the health of the population.</p>
<p>The EIA Directive covers projects which are listed in its annexes I and II and which require a development consent. The EIA Directive does not cover dredging activities but would cover any extension of the port with an increase in traffic. So, if, in the future, any such extension is planned then the EIA Directive is applicable and in particular Annex II point 13 insofar as any change or extension may have significant adverse effects on the environment.<a href="#defann_13_7" name="refann_13_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> In this case the Member States shall determine through a case by case examination or thresholds or criteria whether the project shall be made subject to an assessment taking into account the relevant selection criteria set out in the Directive.</p>
<p>For what concerns Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_13_8" name="refann_13_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> the Gulf of La Spezia itself is not a proposed Site of Community Importance (pSCI). There are, however, several pSCIs around the Gulf, and according to Art. 6.3 of the Directive any plans or projects which are likely to have a significant impact on the values for which those sites were designated have to be subjected to an assessment of their implications for the sites in terms of their conservation objectives. From the information provided by the honourable Member, it is not clear whether a significant impact on any of this sites is likely.</p>
<p>On the basis of the information provided by the honourable Member, the Commission has no basis to assume that community legislation is not being correctly applied. If that would be the case, the Commission would take the necessary measures, including infringement procedures under Art. 226 of the EC Treaty to ensure compliance with community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) During the year 2002, the Commission increased its efforts concerning initiatives to be taken in order to prevent and fight the illegal trade in cultural goods. On 9 December 2002, as part of the European Forum for the prevention of organised crime, the second workshop on illicit trafficking in cultural goods took place in Brussels, organised by the Directorate-General for Justice and Home Affairs in collaboration with the Directorate-General for Education and Culture. One hundred and ten people took part as representatives of heritage owners, Ministries of Culture, insurers, art dealers, Unesco, the Council of Europe, police and customs services of the Member States, Interpol and Europol.</p>
<p>Following the conclusions of the workshop, Europol, in collaboration with the Commission and certain Member States, is to commence, at the beginning of this year, a working party and feasibility study for the creation of a European database or network between existing databases on stolen cultural goods. The feasibility study could be funded by the AGIS programme run by the Commission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Directorate-General for Education and Culture, in association with the Directorates-General for Justice and Home Affairs, the Internal Market, Enterprise and Taxation and the Customs Union, has requested support within the framework of the IDA (Interchange of data between administrations) programme in order to be able to create a website dedicated to the movement of cultural goods which should act as a link between the various databases at European level.</p>
<p>In order to assess the state of progress of these initiatives and continue the discussion on this criminal phenomenon, the Commission plans to organise a third workshop towards the end of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware that transport of animals is a very complex issue associating both animal welfare and animal health concerns. At the same time it is known that maintaining the status quo is not acceptable and weaknesses in the current legislation must be addressed.</p>
<p>The question of animal transport and in particular the maximum duration of the journey was debated at the Agriculture Council of September. On travelling times the debate was controversial, but the Member of the Commission in charge of Health and Consumer protection believes that this single issue should not deflect attention from other key issues, which also have a major bearing on animal transport.</p>
<p>Following the Council debate the Commission consulted both European citizens and relevant organisations on the issue.</p>
<p>Both initiatives have proved to be successful. The Commission’s desire to improve the protection of animals during transport received very strong backing.</p>
<p>Over the Web, more than 4000 citizens from all over Europe expressed their agreement to the broad measures that the Commission intends to propose.</p>
<p>Citizens and major stakeholders have also made clear how they would like matters to proceed from here.</p>
<p>A vast majority demand better regulation of the standards of transportation and on space allowances. At the same time, stricter conditions for the approval of transporters are called for – as well as a harmonised licensing system for drivers.</p>
<p>The proposal is now in an advanced stage of preparation and its adoption by the Commission is foreseen during the first semester of 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0853"></a>

<p>(EN) The Parliament and the Council adopted the new directive on public access to environmental information on 18 December 2002. This Directive gives the public the right of access to environmental information held by or for public authorities. Radioactive discharges fall within the definition of 'environmental information' and, when held by or for public authorities, the public could have access to that environmental information.</p>
<p>In fact, radioactive discharges are reported to the Commission under the terms of Article 8 (b) of Recommendation 1999/829/EURATOM relating to the implementation of Article 37 of the EURATOM Treaty. The Commission then publishes the information. <a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>As regards the question of public access to contracts it should be observed that contracts as such are not per definition 'environmental information' as defined in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the new directive. Whether or not a contract or part of a contract is to be qualified as 'environmental information' depends on its contents. Regardless of the legal or physical form in which the information is contained, a case-by-case assessment of the contents needs to be made in order to decide whether the contract in its entirety or whether part of the contract falls within the definition of 'environmental information'.</p>
<p>When the information is held by or for public authorities, total (i.e. if the contract as such qualifies as 'environmental information) or partial access to the contract (i.e. access to the 'environmental information' contained in the contract) could therefore be given, unless one of the exceptions foreseen in the directive would apply.</p>
<p>The exceptions are listed exhaustively in the directive and relate, e.g. to confidentiality of commercial or industrial information, intellectual property rights, confidentiality of personal data, international relations, and public security. Exceptions can only be invoked unless there is an overriding public interest in disclosure. Whether or not access will be given or an exception can effectively be invoked, depends equally on a case by case assessment of the facts and the circumstances.</p>
<p>As regards the question of access to contracts signed by nuclear companies raised by the honourable Member, it should be noted that these contracts, as defined in Article 60 (1) if the Euratom Treaty, contain only purely commercial information and therefore fall outside the scope of the Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The importance attached to the issue of the steel sector and enlargement by the honourable Members is fully shared by the Commission. The Commission has consistently taken the view that steel restructuring without delay is crucial in candidate countries so that their steel industries will be able to withstand the competitive pressures of the internal market when they enter the Union.</p>
<p>In the course of the past year, the Commission took a number of initiatives in the context of the Europe Agreements and of the Accession Negotiations in order to move forward the steel restructuring in the candidates.</p>
<p>In May 2002, the Commission adopted proposals to extend the period, foreseen in Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement, during which some candidate countries may, exceptionally, grant State Aid for restructuring the steel industry. These proposals concerned candidates that had not completed the steel restructuring and had not met in full their obligations under Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania). The Commission proposals, which have been adopted by the Council on 22 July 2002, are strictly based on the principles set out in Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement. State Aid to restructure the steel sector may only be granted if the countries concerned provide a restructuring plan and business plans, linked to a global rationalisation and reduction of capacity in the country, and which leads to the viability of the benefiting firms. Moreover the amount and intensity of such Aid have to be strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to restore viability and are progressively reduced. The above-mentioned extension will, therefore, come into effect only when the Council decides, on the basis of the Commission's assessment, whether the plans adopted by the candidates are in compliance with the requirements of Protocol 2.</p>
<p>On 10 December 2002 the Council decided that the plans adopted by the Czech Republic were acceptable and thereby agreed to the extension under the Europe Agreement. The Commission services are currently completing the final assessment of the restructuring plans submitted by Poland. No restructuring plans have been requested from Hungary, Latvia and Slovakia as these countries did not request and the Union did not agree to restructuring aid to the steel sector.</p>
<p>As for transparency of aid granted, the Commission has requested a full picture of all state aid, both aid already granted in the past and that which will be needed in the period before accession to achieve the necessary restructuring. This inventory of State Aid is an important element in the Council's decision on whether to agree to the extension of the period during which the countries in question may grant State Aid for steel restructuring.</p>
<p>As concerns the Accession Negotiations, State Aid for the steel restructuring is treated in the framework of the 'Competition' chapter. In this framework, the Commission put forward proposals which ensure the continued smooth operation of the internal market whilst taking into account the specific circumstances in the candidate countries where appropriate. This approach allowed the closure of the negotiations on the competition chapter with the Czech Republic in October 2002 and with Poland in December 2002 both countries where the restructuring of the steel sector still needs to be finalized. With regard to Slovakia, the Union has agreed conditions (including restrictions on sales and production) under which an exceptional aid for keeping a high employment level could be accepted. Furthermore the Commission made proposals for a detailed monitoring programme of the restructuring and related State Aids of candidate countries’ steel industries after accession. These provisions will be enshrined in the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p>Bulgaria and Romania have engaged themselves to submit their steel restructuring plans in the course of 2003 and these plans will then be assessed in the same way as those of the countries of the first round of Accession Negotiations and on the basis of which the Commission will be able to propose its conditions for the closure of the 'Competition' chapter for these two candidates within the framework of the Accession Negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0856"></a>

<p>(EN) The importance attached to the issue of the steel sector and enlargement by the honourable Members is fully shared by the Commission. The Commission has consistently taken the view that steel restructuring without delay is crucial in candidate countries so that their steel industries will be able to withstand the competitive pressures of the internal market when they enter the EU.</p>
<p>In the course of the past year, the Commission took a number of initiatives in the context of the Europe Agreements and of the Accession Negotiations in order to move forward the steel restructuring in the candidates.</p>
<p>In May 2002, the Commission adopted proposals to extend the period, foreseen in Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement, during which some candidate countries may, exceptionally, grant State Aid for restructuring the steel industry. These proposals concerned candidates that had not completed the steel restructuring and had not met in full their obligations under Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania). The Commission proposals, which have been adopted by the Council on 22 July 2002, are strictly based on the principles set out in Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement. State Aid to restructure the steel sector may only be granted if the countries concerned provide a restructuring plan and business plans, linked to a global rationalisation and reduction of capacity in the country, and which leads to the viability of the benefiting firms. Moreover the amount and intensity of such Aid have to be strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to restore viability and are progressively reduced. The above-mentioned extension will, therefore, come into effect only when the Council decides, on the basis of the Commission's assessment, whether the plans adopted by the candidates are in compliance with the requirements of Protocol 2.</p>
<p>On 10 December 2002 the Council decided that the plans adopted by the Czech Republic were acceptable and thereby agreed to the extension under the Europe Agreement. The Commission services are currently completing the final assessment of the restructuring plans submitted by Poland. No restructuring plans have been requested from Hungary, Latvia and Slovakia as these countries did not request and the EU did not agree to restructuring aid to the steel sector.</p>
<p>As for transparency of aid granted, the Commission has requested a full picture of all state aid, both aid already granted in the past and that which will be needed in the period before accession to achieve the necessary restructuring. This inventory of State Aid is an important element in the Council's decision on whether to agree to the extension of the period during which the countries in question may grant State Aid for steel restructuring.</p>
<p>As concerns the Accession Negotiations, State Aid for the steel restructuring is treated in the framework of the 'Competition' chapter. In this framework, the Commission put forward proposals which ensure the continued smooth operation of the internal market whilst taking into account the specific circumstances in the candidate countries where appropriate. This approach allowed the closure of the negotiations on the competition chapter with the Czech Republic in October 2002 and with Poland in December 2002 both countries where the restructuring of the steel sector still needs to be finalized. With regard to Slovakia, the EU has agreed conditions (including restrictions on sales and production) under which an exceptional aid for keeping a high employment level could be accepted. Furthermore the Commission made proposals for a detailed monitoring programme of the restructuring and related State Aids of candidate countries’ steel industries after accession. These provisions will be enshrined in the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p>Bulgaria and Romania have engaged themselves to submit their steel restructuring plans in the course of 2003 and these plans will then be assessed in the same way as those of the countries of the first round of Accession Negotiations and on the basis of which the Commission will be able to propose its conditions for the closure of the 'Competition' chapter for these two candidates within the framework of the Accession Negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0862"></a>

<p>(FR) This question refers to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2204/2002 of 12 December 2002 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid for employment (OJ L 337 of 13 December 2002, p.3). This regulation exempts aid granted under an aid system that fulfils the conditions laid down by the regulation in question from the notification obligation laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The distinction between ‘general measures’ and ‘selective measures’ arises from the case-law of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>In current case-law, measures which apply to just part of a Member State constitute selective measures that could fall within the scope of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The definition of the concept of ‘selective measures’ as used in the report on the European Employment Guidelines 1995/1999, as cited by Mrs Van Lancker, is the application of the above-mentioned Community case-law.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the definitions of ‘general measures’ and ‘selective measures’ are not contrary to the European employment strategy. In fact, although classifying a measure as ‘selective’ means that it falls within the scope of rules on State aid, this does not mean that this measure constitutes incompatible aid. Community law, and in particular the above-mentioned exemption regulation on employment aid, allows the Member States to grant several kinds of State aid which fall within the European employment strategy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission, in its role as guardian of the Treaties, must ensure that Article 87 is applied. This Article stipulates that State aid affecting trade between Member States of the Community is incompatible with the common market, except in certain cases where a derogation is or may be granted.</p>
<p>In the case in point, the Commission took its decision on 11 December 2002, following a lengthy enquiry. Furthermore, it should be noted that two complaints were received in October 2000 and July 2001. All the elements of this dossier were examined in light of the rules of the EC Treaty and applicable legislation.</p>
<p>First of all, the Commission concluded that the aid previously granted by the Greek State and authorised by the Commission in 1998 had been misused<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in particular with regard to the restructuring plan and compliance with certain conditions that accompanied this aid. Secondly, the Commission observed that Olympic Airways also received further illegal aid that was not notified. This aid gave Olympic Airways an unfair advantage over its competitors. That is why the Commission is asking Greece to recover this aid. The Commission has taken the fairest step it could take given its obligations under the EC Treaty and the distortions of competition created by the misuse of the aid received in the past by Olympic Airways and the illegal granting of aid by the Greek Government.</p>
<p>With regard to passengers wishing to travel to the islands, many island connections are classified as an obligatory public service and will retain this status. Air transport operators will be able to provide this service. The Greek authorities are able to supplement and increase these public service obligations in order to maintain and develop connections to the most remote areas and the islands.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The responsibility for ensuring adequate and sustainable pensions remains with the Member States. The latest report by the Commission does not intend to change this. The report was prepared in accordance with the open method of coordination the aim of which is to support national policy makers in their efforts to achieve the common objectives that were presented in December 2001 to the Laeken European Council.</p>
<p>It is left to national policy makers to determine how they achieve those common objectives. The Commission has no intention of prescribing by legislation how national governments should reform their pension systems. The Commission may propose policy recommendations to the Member States in the framework of the Employment Guidelines or the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, but this is not foreseen within the open method of coordination in the field of pensions which nevertheless allows key policy issues for individual Member States which may deserve further policy efforts to be highlighted.</p>
<p>Community legislation relating to pension systems has very limited scope and mainly seeks to ensure that the fundamental freedoms of the Internal Market are respected. This concerns the portability of pension rights for migrant workers and, regarding supplementary pension schemes, the freedom to provide services and to invest. Community law also requires Member States to ensure that private, employer-provided pensions are safe in the event of bankruptcy of the employer.<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The proposal for a directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, currently under discussion in the Council and the Parliament, will further enhance the protection of the rights of future pensioners and require pension funds to invest in a prudent manner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Each year, 42 000 people lose their lives on the EU's roads. Many road accidents, in all countries, occur because the driver is under the influence of alcohol. We must use advances in technology to prevent drink-driving. Several trials with alcohol locks are being conducted in Sweden and 90% of the population says that they are in favour of them. The locks are a technical device which can test the driver's alcohol level and block the vehicle if the level is over the limit.</p>

<p>(EN) The purpose of alcohol locks is to block ignition if the driver’s alcohol level when breathalysed is over the limit laid down by national legislation. Legislation in some North American and Canadian States, Australia and Sweden allows these locks to be fitted to the vehicles of drivers found guilty of infringing the law prohibiting drink-driving. This measure is generally proposed as an alternative to withdrawing driving licences.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Commission carried out a study in order to assemble and analyse the results of the measures taken by these countries. The study showed encouraging results.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the work enabling conditions for the use of these locks to be better defined at national level is worth pursuing. It has encouraged the Member States to carry out demonstration projects, where necessary by granting subsidies to the bodies responsible for such experiments, as of 2003.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that these alcohol locks cannot be fitted to all vehicles. How they are used actually depends on national legislation concerning drivers’ alcohol levels, and in particular penalties in case of excessive alcohol levels. Where appropriate, it will be the responsibility of the Member States to establish how they are used.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0892"></a>
