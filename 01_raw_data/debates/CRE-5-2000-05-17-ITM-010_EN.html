The situation has been growing worse despite considerable international efforts, particularly by the European Union, to persuade President Mugabe to order the so-called ‘veterans’ to leave the farmers’ properties that they have invaded immediately, so as to guarantee the safety of all citizens, and in particular foreign nationals resident in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is deeply concerned at the situation in Zimbabwe and the Council has published two Presidency statements, on 13 March and on 7 May, in which it expressed its grave concern at the situation. All of the European Union’s candidate countries, as well as the countries of the European Economic Area, have given their backing to these statements. Various meetings have also been held with the government of Zimbabwe, at the Council’s initiative. As for the fundamental issue behind the current crisis – land – the European Union has continued to state its willingness to help Zimbabwe to implement a redistribution of farmland which is compatible with respect for property rights and, in particular, with the principles and conclusions of the Donors Conference on Land Reform and Resettlement in Zimbabwe, held in Harare in 1998. With regard to the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe, which have been set for 24 and 25 June, it is more vital than ever for them to be held in a free, fair and transparent way and within the deadline that has been set. International observers should be present at these elections so that they can observe how the elections proceed and vouch for the final result of the vote and for the legitimacy that the elections need, and guarantee that the result is accepted by the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the European Union is prepared to send a mission of election observers, but must, of course, warn the Zimbabwean authorities of the need for satisfactory guarantees that the observers will be safe and that they will have freedom of access to all relevant premises. The Troika of European Union Heads of Mission in Harare will personally convey this message to the Zimbabwean authorities. The Commission representatives will travel there on Friday 19 May to prepare for the mission of election observers in order to verify that the appropriate conditions have been met. Next Monday, the General Affairs Council will consider the Commission representatives’ report on their visit. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you that Zimbabwe is a partner of the European Union under the Lomé Convention, and that Zimbabwe must respect the principles enshrined in that convention, which form the basis of the European Union's cooperation policy. The European Union will continue to follow developments in that country in the light of these principles and will not fail to draw the necessary conclusions in the event that these principles are not adhered to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – The Commission is concerned about the evolving situation in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe, for decades a stable country, is now going through an increasingly severe economic and political crisis. Parliamentary elections have now been announced by the government for 24 and 25 June. This is a good sign.</p>
<p class="contents">The pursuance of illegal farm occupations, continued violence, death, injuring and intimidation of the opposition are being interpreted as part of the ruling party’s electoral campaign. Recent weeks have witnessed a series of international initiatives to facilitate the holding of free and fair elections. The General Affairs Council of 10 April urged the government of Zimbabwe to create the conditions to hold free and fair elections. The Commission continues to urge the government of Zimbabwe to hold elections, free of intimidation. I had a very direct conversation with President Mugabe at the EU-Africa Summit. I followed this up with a letter to him this week.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the EU Member States’ agreement in the Azores on 6 and 7 May, the Commission this week has a mission in Zimbabwe to look at necessary arrangements for an EU observer team and to coordinate with other election observation initiatives by SADC, the Commonwealth and the US. The Commission has already provided EUR 220 000 for the training of 1 440 Zimbabwean election observers and has made available another EUR 6 million to support initiatives from civil society, including on good governance and democratisation. The Commission electoral assessment mission now in Zimbabwe is discussing with Member States arrangements to deal with the logistical and operational aspects of this exercise, in particular, funding, freedom of movement and security of service.</p>
<p class="contents">EU observers are not being sent to legitimise an electoral process so far marked by intimidation and violence. However, international observers could play an important role in deterring violence and building confidence, especially in the rural areas. A preliminary EU proposal currently being developed would see the deployment of 150 observers, 100 of whom would be deployed in the first week of June to observe the electoral campaign and the rest to augment the EU’s observation of the vote and the count. Consultations with the government, coordination with other international observer missions, such as the Commonwealth, US and Norway, and with local observation initiatives are on-going. Acknowledging the long experience of the European Parliament in election observation, we invite representatives to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to development cooperation, the Commission is maintaining its European Development Fund poverty alleviation aid directed through the social sectors of health, education and rural development and, in particular, to combat the HIV/Aids epidemic. These poverty alleviation programmes facilitate the pursuance of dialogue with civil society and provide an appropriate political signal. The international community, while condemning certain governmental actions, still supports the people of Zimbabwe. Given the government’s poor macroeconomic performance, the EU, like the IMF and the World Bank, has already frozen structural adjustment support.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the possible suspension of Zimbabwe's privileges under the Lomé Convention, there could be grounds for suspension if the Commission considers, after consulting thoroughly with Member States, that this would not be counterproductive at this stage before the elections. We fear it would be manipulated and interpreted as a collective reaction orchestrated by what are polemically called ‘former colonial powers’ against Zimbabwe and its government.</p>
<p class="contents">In the worst scenario, if respect for the rule of law further deteriorates or if the elections were to be flawed, the Commission would have to consider whether Zimbabwe merits the privileges accorded under the Lomé Convention. Suspension of these privileges would be economically crippling for Zimbabwe and would aggravate the crisis. But so far I believe we have followed the right course.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But on the down side, he is increasing all the army and civil servants’ pay as a straight bribe. I sincerely hope that Members of this Parliament will have the chance to act as observers, as these elections must be seen to have been free, fair and transparent in the atmosphere of fear that President Mugabe has created.</p>
<p class="contents">Only last month we passed a resolution in this Chamber condemning violence, calling for the return to full democracy and for free and fair elections to be held. Some of these demands have now hopefully been implemented, but not before another white farmer had been murdered. We all accept that there must be a redistribution of the best land in Zimbabwe, but this must be done through round table negotiations, and not with the violent acts we have seen over the last few months.</p>
<p class="contents">President Mugabe has now set up a committee of white farmers and Mugabe supporters, hopefully to reach a sensible agreement on land redistribution. President Mugabe should never forget the economic damage that will be done to Zimbabwe’s economy if land redistribution simply means the land goes back to subsistence farming in small blocks. There are few people in the rabble we have seen invading farms who could afford the employees, the machinery, seeds and fertilisers to farm these units to give a potential export output.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen some of the farms that were reclaimed some years ago by Mr Mugabe and most of the fertile productive land has reverted to bush and the buildings and farmhouses are now crumbling ruins. What a waste in a country dependent on agricultural exports!</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years, there has been a move to persuade political leaders in African regions to carry more responsibility for conflict prevention. It was, therefore, gratifying to hear Nelson Mandela criticising the policies of the Zimbabwe president who is destroying his country. I am sorry that President Mbeki, his successor, who is probably the most powerful leader in Africa, has not in public condemned the violence in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament are right to call on the Commission to review its development cooperation with Zimbabwe if transparent elections are not held or if the opposition wins and the violence continues. The use of Article 366 should be considered. The World Bank has now cut funding because of debt arrears and Zimbabwe, as a country, is in liquidation. We can but live and hope that a peaceful conclusion can be reached in Zimbabwe as it is the people themselves who are suffering most in this unstable situation the country finds itself in.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, Glenys (PSE).</span></span>   – I have to say at the outset that I am extremely encouraged by the fact that the Commission has worked out such a very clear strategy for dealing with these very critical weeks before the election takes place. I particularly welcome the fact that we are training domestic observers – I think that is very important and will offset the likelihood of Mugabe criticising us for coming in in a neo-colonialist way to interfere in his election. I also welcome the fact that we will be supporting civil society’s objectives in these next few weeks. I very much hope, Commissioner, that we will disseminate this kind of information in Zimbabwe because those people trying to mount an opposition campaign will be heartened by the kind of information that we have had from you today and I think that would be important.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things I want to talk about briefly is the role of the state-controlled media in the run-up before the election. The Commissioner did not mention this, but it would be sensible to do so because TV, radio and state-owned newspapers in Zimbabwe are acting now as if they were the agents of Zanu-PF. All reporting of opposition parties is negative, with the MDC a particular target. I would really like to know what we can do from the European Union to try to ensure that the opposition groups – and there are 26 parties standing in the election – have some access to the media. State-controlled media, Commissioner, is refusing to take paid advertising even from the main NGOs who are just working to support the electoral process and democracy in Zimbabwe, or from any opposition parties. Only three independent newspapers are carrying any kind of adverts from parties other than Zanu-PF so that only the claims of the government are being read or seen by the people and that has to be a contradiction if we are talking about providing democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the independent press does not have the print capacity to deal with demand. People in Zimbabwe are afraid. The deaths and injuries in the rural areas and increasingly in the towns are deeply worrying. Zanu-PF has the government resources, and the MDC supporters are too afraid to donate money. I even read in the British press that Kabila and Qadhafi are giving money now to Mugabe’s campaign, which is a bit frightening.</p>
<p class="contents">It is deeply worrying that the opposition are fighting their campaign on Zanu-PF grounds. They have no control over the electoral roll, they have no control over the polling stations that will be run by government civil servants. This is wrong because the role of these government civil servants in the last referendum was very dubious indeed. The people understand that and are aware of it. There is evidence also of this Fifth Brigade being involved in pre-election crackdowns. The Fifth Brigade were responsible for the brutality that Mugabe perpetuated in Matabeleland in the 80s. That also is something that worries me and I would like the EU to look into it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, President, let us be sure that we work as a European Union to create the conditions which will allow the people of Zimbabwe to express their choices in this election in June and express their choices in secret and without fear.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why have so few former colonies turned into constitutional states? Where anarchy and lawlessness rule, the law of the most brutal party applies. In Zimbabwe, this takes the form of Mr Mugabe. Where this country used to be a model for the Third World of how things should be done, it has now degenerated into its own opposite. It is ruled by a dictator who deems his own power and privileges more important than the lack of stability of his country and the suffering of his own people. Land reform is necessary, of course. The possession of land in Zimbabwe still reflects the old colonial relations and this will, needless to say, cause tension. But for years, Mr Mugabe himself had the opportunity to carry out this land reform, even with foreign help. The question is therefore: what mala fide reasons are behind Mr Mugabe’s doing nothing initially and then, just before the elections, getting his cronies to cause havoc in the farms of the white people? </p>
<p class="contents">According to the Zimbabwean election monitors, the incessant violence renders free and fair elections impossible. As long as this is the case, the election date has to be postponed. A situation whereby Mr Mugabe legitimises his position through violence and intimidation must be avoided at all costs. It would be a positive step if MEPs acted as observers during these elections and included Mugabe’s pre-electoral machinery in their assessment. </p>
<p class="contents">If the elections are not conducted fairly, European aid will need to be postponed. But the cooperation according to Lomé cannot continue if Mugabe also renders elections impossible. </p>
<p class="contents">A further deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe could have far-reaching effects on the African continent in general, and on South Africa in particular. The Zimbabwean population deserves a far better government than it has at the moment. It is high time that the European Union spoke very clear language. Our patience with African leaders whose heroic deeds only take the form of abuse of power is running out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The black people of Zimbabwe are still suffering under the legacy of colonialism. Cecil Rhodes, one of Britain's most successful colonists, said the purpose of colonialism was: “To find new lands in which we can easily obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap labour that is available from the natives of the colonies”. The legacy of this barbarically successful strategy can be seen in the chaos that is happening in Zimbabwe today.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, just 4 000 white farmers still own over 70% of the arable land while more than seven million black Zimbabweans scratch a living from overcrowded communal areas. We condemn the violence but we also see that black Zimbabweans have a compelling case. This makes President Mugabe’s refusal to proceed with the lawful land redistribution programme even more deplorable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fearsomely difficult problem when Mugabe will not negotiate. But I call on the UK Government to do all they can to persuade Zimbabwe to set up an independent arbitration board fully representative of the landless people and, once it is set up, perhaps with the assistance of the Commonwealth, to resume financial aid as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Government must recognise the moral debt owed for crimes of slavery and colonialism and continue to do all in its power to support a peaceful and progressive settlement to the land issues in Zimbabwe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have undoubtedly been problems in the past, but the problems of colonialism were resolved with independence. The image portrayed here by Mrs Lucas is a distorted one, which is bound to encourage the continuation of Mr Mugabe’s despotic rule and lead to greater suffering for the Zimbabwean people, which is really what is at stake. In the previous debate I drew attention to what I felt was a significant point here: one of the main protagonists in this crisis, the leader of the ‘veterans’, Mr Mugabe’s armed supporters, chose to change his surname to ‘Hitler’, and that says it all. We must not be under any illusions about what is really happening here. The facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we supported it, and although it was a step in the right direction, I rather feel that the April resolution that has already been mentioned was rather anodyne given the obvious seriousness of the situation. We should not forget this. The European Parliament recommended that the date of the elections should be set as quickly as possible, but certainly for no later than 1 June. They have now been announced, but for 24 and 25 June. We shall see what happens between now and then. </p>
<p class="contents">We subsequently called upon the Zimbabwean authorities to respect human rights, including minority rights, as well as international electoral law. We know that none of this is being done. What we are witnessing is a country being held hostage, and we ourselves are finding it difficult to define a fair position given the dramatic nature of the situation, because the appeals for help that are reaching us from Zimbabwe, from the MDC and from the democratic forces, say that it is a bad thing that the elections are being held, because they will probably be unfair, such is the scale of intimidation; yet not holding them would be worse. We are therefore witnessing a country being held hostage before our very eyes and before the eyes of the whole world, which seems to be paralysed and incapable of coming up with any more incisive action.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also make our position very clear. It is not just whites who are in danger. We have already been reminded here, and rightly so, of the atrocities committed in the past in Matabeleland and…</p>

It is a truly remarkable achievement and a case study of mismanagement in recent history. I am sure Mr Mugabe’s place in history books is now secured for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the country is suffering from 50% unemployment and 60% inflation; he is spending USD 1 million a day on a foreign adventure in the Congo; the foreign exchange reserves have gone and the World Bank has suspended funding on projects. I was astonished to hear the speech just given by my colleague from the Greens. Yet out of despair comes resolution, determination and hope. The country is one of the most educated in Africa and the European Union should be proud of its role in helping to set up that educational support structure in the past 20 years. It has a functioning civic institution and culture. Elections are due and voter rolls are being prepared but those voter rolls must be verified before the election. The opposition parties want more transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty people have been killed and more than 1 200 farms illegally occupied. Mr Mugabe has lost control of the country, presiding over lawlessness and corruption. On 24 June elections are going to be held. Yesterday, the Commonwealth Secretary-General said that it is still possible to have free elections. The future of the country lies with the young people of Zimbabwe. They demand the elections. They must be given a chance. It is their future. One thing we must do is to change the culture that is prevalent in Africa today that the winner takes all. We must stop this winner-takes-all culture that every African country has, and I mean every country. We must be seen to have free and fair elections and to demonstrate that they have been fair and free.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with all speakers who said that we need to ensure that those elections are held as fairly as possible, which will not be easy. I found the words of Commissioner Nielson encouraging when he said that, as early as the beginning of July, observers will be sent to Zimbabwe. I think that this is vital because those who are not kindly disposed towards the Mugabe regime, those in opposition, will clearly need protection. I would therefore like to back up the Commission in this opinion. Observers need to be sent to Zimbabwe at the earliest opportunity, today if possible, rather than tomorrow. </p>
<p class="contents">Another worrying development is the reaction of the neighbouring countries. From Europe, we have fought for years to establish racial equality, equal opportunities, democracy, etc. in Southern Africa. At the moment, there is a deadly silence in the neighbouring countries which, in my opinion, is a very ominous development. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hold the view that, if the elections in Zimbabwe were not fair, for whatever reason, the Commission should continue with the course it set a moment ago. If there are clear signs of large-scale fraud and Mugabe remains in power illegally, then, according to the provisions of the Lomé Convention, aid must be halted. If the Commission were not to do this, the illegal dispossessions of land could spread to the rest of Southern Africa and this would be a disaster, not only for the area concerned, but also for the rest of Africa. We must avoid this at all costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hatred, President Mugabe, is not something upon which a society can be built. Threats can never create confidence and social harmony. Lawlessness can never create security and human solidarity. Violence and murder can never be reconciled with the Christian view of human beings which I know that you, President Mugabe, have grown up with and embraced. The churches of Zimbabwe, the Lutheran World Federation and the World Council of Churches appeal to your conscience. </p>
<p class="contents">My home country of Sweden has supported Zimbabwe very persistently and in very concrete ways, both in developing its economy and in its struggle to be a free and democratic country founded upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of human life, irrespective of the colour of a person’s skin. Since independence in 1980, Sweden has provided a total of SEK 2 billion in aid, corresponding to USD 220 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty years ago, the Church of Sweden’s youth movement, which I myself was active in, embarked upon a special venture which we called ‘Be a Friend of Zimbabwe’. Enthusiastic young people from our two countries met. We believed in you, President Mugabe, and in your country’s future because you wanted to uphold the Christian view of human beings in Zimbabwe. We want to believe in you again, even though a lot of bad things have happened. Put away hatred. Do it for the sake of your own reputation, both now and in the future. Do it for the sake of Zimbabwe’s citizens, and do it for the sake of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the action taken by the European Union on this matter and the attention it has paid to it are still very much an issue, and I can guarantee, on behalf of the Council – and, of course, also on behalf of the Commission, which has already adopted a very precise course of action for the forthcoming elections – that this matter will continue to feature on our agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council will certainly consider the possibility of deploying the consultation mechanisms laid down in the Lomé Convention if the situation following the elections is less encouraging than we might hope. As you will be aware, this issue was examined at the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers held at the beginning of May. We shall be watching this issue closely in the General Affairs Council and we will, of course, pay considerable attention to the way the election campaign and the elections proceed. We hope that the Zimbabwean authorities realise that the way these elections are run will, of course, have a bearing on the credibility of the government itself in the eyes of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Ribeiro e Castro said, we feel that it is extremely important to monitor developments in this matter between now and the elections. We know that so far more than 20 people have been killed as a result of the violent situation over the last few weeks and we are also aware – and this is a very important point, bearing in mind what has been said about the effects of the situation on southern Africa – that an unstable situation in Zimbabwe could have the effect of dragging other parts of southern African into this affair, and that is an issue that should be of concern to us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hope we can solve the problems of funding of the observer mission. I have to tell Parliament that this once again demonstrates the inadequacy of our system. We cannot just push a button somewhere in our system and the funds appear. It is highly complicated to find the money for this in time. This is the kind of system we have. Yesterday’s discussion about the external relations reform is even today relevant. At least we have excellent coordination on the ground in Zimbabwe with the Member States, which is very helpful.</p>
