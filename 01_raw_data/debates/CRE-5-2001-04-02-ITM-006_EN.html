<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sacconi (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the Green Paper before us today on the environmental problems of PVC was presented by the Commission in July 2000, in line with the provisions of the directive on end-of-life vehicles, which introduces a new method making manufacturers responsible for the entire life cycle of a product, from its design to its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach, which is intended to encourage manufacturers to design products and materials which are safer and, in particular, easier to recycle, is also the basis of the Green Paper on PVC. Indeed, although the Green Paper does not deal directly with either the production or the use of PVC, it poses a clear set of questions regarding waste disposal which ultimately have a direct bearing on the product itself. I would like to make this quite clear. Although PVC has been the focus of an intense debate in recent years, and although some of the product's properties, such as its high chlorine content, make it particularly difficult to manage in waste form, my report does not seek to penalise it in favour of other plastics. Quite the contrary: the report explicitly calls upon the Commission to tackle the specific problems of this material as part of a broader strategy for plastics and to deal with the issue of differentiated collection as soon as possible from a Europe-wide perspective. I have requested that this measure's provisions on marking be extended to include all plastics as well, so as to avoid any ecomarketing.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, with regard to the PVC industry voluntary commitment, I honestly believe that this is an important step. However, it is not enough, firstly, because, in its resolution of July 1997, Parliament stated that it was no longer prepared to accept any voluntary agreement which was not part of the Community legal framework, and, secondly, because the objectives set out in the agreement are, quite frankly, insufficient, difficult to measure and therefore difficult to monitor. However, there is one extremely important thing about this agreement, namely that it has gathered the vast majority of players involved in the process of production, processing and recycling and the trade union representatives around a table to develop common strategies and draw up proposals to change the current situation. This will of industry is a positive factor and we must not waste it in our enthusiasm to regulate everything. This is why I have called upon the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal that can serve as a reference for all future voluntary agreements as soon as possible. This is why I have also proposed a different form of legislation laying down the adoption of legislative measures which, however, would only enter into force when companies fail to achieve pre-established objectives. I am absolutely certain that genuinely sustainable development cannot be implemented without dialogue and cooperation with industry.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other points in my report that I would like to mention, but I will limit myself to two: the disposal of the hazardous substances cadmium, lead and phthalates, in the first place, and then the multifaceted strategy for PVC disposal. With regard to the first point, I would just like to stress how important the gradual disposal of these substances is, in the immediate term, for the health of European citizens, and that it may be even more important in terms of environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of waste disposal, I would like to say that the property of PVC that gives it its strength, its durability, is also something that makes its disposal an extremely complicated matter. My suggestion was to tackle the problem from several different angles: firstly, to increase the recycling quotas, starting with certain applications such as window frames, large tubes and roofing membranes, introducing 'closed cycles' recovery systems; secondly, to limit PVC incineration to new generation plant, which respect the latest Community legislation and apply the ‘polluter pays’ principle; and thirdly, to dump what is left at refuse disposal sites, taking into account, in this case, the new legislation that will enter into force as of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by thanking all the Members who have contributed to the improvement of my report by tabling amendments in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I feel that the text adopted in committee is genuinely well balanced and that, should the amendments rejected in committee and put forward again for the vote in Parliament be adopted now, this balance could be seriously upset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy firmly believes in self-monitoring in the PVC industry and its ability to take responsibility for the adverse effects of PVC throughout the material’s entire life cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion, I would like to say that the PVC industry has been very aggressive in its lobbying activity. It neither sees nor admits to there being much of a problem at all. In that respect their views are in conflict with the spirit of the Commission’s Green Paper. The PVC industry does not want additional studies conducted by outsiders to support their views. Industry criticises the fact that the Green Paper focuses on a study of the far end of the life cycle of PVC products. It is nevertheless justified, as problems start to appear at the stage when responsibility for the product has moved away from industry itself towards society. Governments, which must be responsible for the disposal and final storage of products, must have an interest in the possible adverse effects of PVC. Industry, on the other hand, fears these problems, as they might have an impact on the use of products and alternatives in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has made an evaluation of the Green Paper, which, in my opinion, has been greatly influenced by the industry’s aggressive line. A majority in the Committee voted in favour of an opinion in which concern for the environment and for health is linked to a strategy of voluntary commitments on the part of industry. The EU’s current regulations on product labelling, waste incineration, and sorting at landfill sites are adequate for the majority in the Committee. As draftsman of the opinion, I would like to say that I supported the minority opinion. The problems at the far end of PVC’s life cycle have to be resolved, and industry cannot do that on its own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has certainly made every effort to see whether a compromise could be struck. However, this has taken us away from a specific line of thought, so much so that the report is merely portraying all sides of the argument, and that is not the fault of Mr Sacconi alone, but of the entire Commission. I would in any event like to thank him for the consultations on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">PVC has often been at the centre of a controversial debate of late. The opinions on PVC and its effects on health and the environment are very diverse. A number of Member States have already taken measures regarding specific aspects of the life cycle of PVC. Those measures are not the same across the board and can thus have implications for the internal market too. We, as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, welcome the Green Paper and are in favour of an integrated approach which, on the one hand, protects the environment and health, and, on the other, guarantees the smooth operation of the internal market, whilst also very much taking into account the interests of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">PVC is different from other plastics in that a large quantity of chlorine has been added, namely 25% to 50%, and that many other additives are also used in PVC. In terms of application, PVC is inherently a sound material, something which we very nearly overlook in the discussion as a whole. Pure PVC is a rigid material, which is mechanically strong, weather resistant, waterproof and chemical resistant. We are thus fortunate, especially in the medical sphere, to have PVC. Consequently, the environmental and health issues surrounding PVC mainly gravitate towards the presence of the additives and the way in which PVC waste is handled.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to list a few of these additives. There are the plasticisers to start with. In the case of soft PVC, up to 60% of plasticisers, mostly in the form of phthalates, are added to render the material flexible. As phthalates are rarely used in other plastics, their primary application is in soft PVC. There is an ongoing debate whether or not phthalates have an impact on living organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The second additive is cadmium. I believe that industry has already entered into a large number of effective commitments voluntarily. Cadmium is being phased out. In this respect, the Green Paper is in fact outdated. The case of lead is quite different. Lead stabilisers, in other words organotin and lead compounds, are the most relevant ones and the environmental risks are higher, especially in the case of lead stabilisers. After all, once waste has been incinerated, lead additives from PVC account for approximately 10% of the unwanted high lead content in residues of waste plants, which necessitates a more stringent policy in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to production and incineration in general. In terms of production, industry has signed a large number of voluntary commitments in order to introduce very strict restrictions with regard to chlorine which may be released. Furthermore, research has shown that these self-imposed emission values have been achieved comfortably.</p>
<p class="contents">Insofar as PVC is not reused, it is generally incinerated in a waste incineration plant. An important aspect in this connection is the high chlorine content. There are two sources of chlorine in waste incineration plants: firstly vegetable, fruit and garden waste, which contains a large amount of chlorine too, and then there is PVC. That means that that waste in those waste incineration plants, and the possible release of dioxins, must be very closely monitored. The elimination of PVC from waste plants is thus important. In fact, incineration and the emissions released in the process are not the only concerns: chlorine also impacts on the recovery of energy in the waste incineration plant. This should therefore be closely monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we would like the Commission and industry to join forces and to examine how we, in the framework of self-regulation, can make effective and clear commitments in the very short term. Industry is prepared to do this, and I would also ask the Commission to examine this issue closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The health and environmental problems associated with PVC are due to released chlorine, stabilisers and softeners. These products’ life cycles are long and they remain in the ecosystem for a long time, which means the extent of the problems for the environment can at present only be guessed at.</p>
<p class="contents">The volume of PVC waste continues to grow, however. We need to undertake a study as quickly as possible, and, as Mr Seppänen quite rightly pointed out, one that is not just industry’s own investigation. We need an impartial study to be undertaken on the adverse effects of PVC, in order to be able to prevent a strain on the ecosystems and a deterioration in people’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems that exist with disposal have been mentioned here. The size of the problem is seen in the fact that the incineration of PVC can produce even more hazardous waste than that represented by the original quantity of waste, and, because it remains in the ecosystem so long, a landfill site is also a poor option for the disposal of this sort of waste. We therefore need a proper investigation into the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think we can simply put our trust in industry’s own voluntary agreements. As we have already observed, measures must be put in place after studies have been carried out, resulting in a ban on hazardous substances. For this we shall need legislation at European level. As European legislators we must bear in mind the importance of the health of our citizens and the protection of the diversity of nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some people are trying to make out that this material is public enemy number one. We find this hard to grasp. The extent to which PVC entails environmental and health risks that do not outweigh the benefits, remains to be seen. This might well be the case. It appears that PVC also has certain advantages as a material. Blood transfusion bags are often cited in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians need not judge these benefits. What we should do, however, is to ask ourselves how we will deal with PVC if it appears that aspects of its use are unsafe or harmful to the environment. What measures will we be taking? In our opinion, this is where the Green Paper leaves something to be desired, particularly since the alternatives for PVC are kept out of the picture. It is a murky discussion, which is held almost as a religious debate between those for and those against. Like Mr Sacconi, we do not wish to base our choices on myths which are being presented to us by those for and against, and which failed to convince any of us, but rather on proper research and usable comparative materials. As long as we do not have that, we can hardly be expected to move on to the field of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we do not wish to place PVC under a ban, but we do want to handle it with care. The precautionary principle requires us to do this. The industry’s initiative to phase out cadmium stabilisers can only be applauded. We believe that similar action should be taken with regard to lead and organotin. In general, we welcome the industry’s voluntary commitments, and believe these should be supported by a legal European framework, thus creating the scope for sanctions whilst adhering to what is possible in terms of content.</p>
<p class="contents">The risks at the waste stage are considerable because we cannot dispose of the harmful substances in PVC. One of the few options that are left to us then is reuse, whereby the harmful substances simply remain inside the product. However, the current level of reuse is so modest that it hardly contributes to a solution. In this respect, industry could indeed make an extra effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would be exaggerating if I said that we cannot wait for the Commission’s legislative proposals. In this connection, the Green Paper gives in actual fact insufficient cause for this. There is a lot of explaining to be done before that happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It poses significant environment and health problems over its entire life cycle. Those problems always go back to the same two causes: PVC contains chlorine, and requires the addition of a wide variety of hazardous additives in large quantities if it is to be functional.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific studies commissioned by the Commission highlighted a number of key hazards relating to PVC, in particular during disposal. Landfilling is a ticking time-bomb due to the release of hazardous PVC additives and the potential for dioxin formation during landfill fires. Incineration of PVC makes the problem even worse, as apart from the risk of dioxin formation the hazardous residues resulting from PVC incineration may even exceed the quantities of PVC put into incineration. Recycling cannot solve the problem as potential recycling rates under ecological criteria are projected to reach only 5% by 2020. The problem is set to get worse, as waste quantities will increase significantly over the next decades.</p>
<p class="contents">At a public hearing organised by the European Commission last October there was a very strong and clear call for substitution of PVC. This call did not just come from environmentalists. It included a coalition of industry, waste-management, local and national authorities, environmental, health and consumer interests. There was very clear and strong support for the substitution of PVC. There is an obligation on the Commission and the EU to respect the wishes of the vast majority of the public. It seems to me that there is a huge amount of support for substitution, while only the PVC industry is reluctant. Whose interests come first? It has to be the interests of all those people that attended the Commission hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">The report on substitution calls for the introduction of substitution policies for certain product categories. We think this is a very good starting point, but it should not end there. We would like to see it extended to all categories, not just to some. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is strong and hard-wearing, which makes it suitable for use in a number of areas. However, PVC also has other qualities, being the source of unusually hazardous waste. Chlorine is one of its main components. Lead and cadmium are used as stabilisers, and phthalates are added to make the material more supple. This creates very major environmental problems when it comes to disposing of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We find it an encouraging sign that we have been given a Green Paper in this area, but we hope that this will soon be followed up by a more comprehensive legislative initiative. I believe that the Sacconi report can make very valuable contributions to such an initiative on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that voluntary agreements are not enough and that genuine legislation is required instead. What ought to be done, then? Well, first of all, there must be a reduction in total use, at the same time as substitute materials are promoted. That is the only way of reducing the quantity of waste. Secondly, a system must be introduced whereby manufacturers are made responsible for recycling and bear the costs of this. Hazardous stabilisers in the form of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium must be banned as soon as possible. It is important for this to be combined with an import ban, so that the measure is comprehensive in scope. The issue of voluntary agreements arises in this connection. A voluntary agreement cannot, of course, involve a ban on imports. The fact is that an import ban and legislation in this area would benefit the most modern industries in that they would obtain protection for their more environmentally friendly products. Legislation would be more effective and more environmentally friendly than a voluntary agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the use of phthalates to be monitored and preferably reduced. That applies particularly to their use in certain types of medical equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to see more done to promote recycling. That means an efficient labelling system, however, and it has to be realised that much of the recycling done at present is a failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we are very satisfied with Mr Sacconi’s report. We have therefore tabled only a few amendments. We think it only reasonable to specify a year after which cadmium is no longer to be used, just as has been done in the case of lead. As I said before, the reason for this is that if there is no legislation and if the latter is not combined with an import ban, there is a risk of the measure’s not being effective enough. It would therefore be consistent to specify a deadline for cadmium, just as the report does in the case of lead.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also joined with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in drafting an amendment dealing with the substitution principle whereby chemicals are to be replaced by less hazardous substances. I believe it is important to incorporate this as one of the basic principles of the whole of the European Union’s policy on chemicals. That is why it is appropriate to mention the substitution principle in this context too.</p>

The main applications are in the building sector (57% of total use), packaging, household appliances and cars. The industry comprises more than 21 000 firms providing 530 000 jobs, with a turnover in excess of EUR 72 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission's Green Paper, no full assessment of the risks connected with the use of lead-based products – which include PVC stabilisers – has been completed. For this reason, contamination of the environment is possible during the production phase, and during the waste phase once PVC has been used. Specific preventive and protective measures must therefore be taken so as to reduce workers' exposure to PVC. No data are available on the state of landfill waste containing large amounts of PVC. I am calling on the Commission, under the auspices of the European directive, to carry out a broader study of the possible public health consequences of PVC products consigned to landfill dumps in Europe. The next 20 years will probably see an increase of around 80% in the quantities of PVC waste because of the increase in the average lifespan of certain PVC products such as window frames.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must centralise the information concerning the effects of PVC in our society so that appropriate measures can be taken at national and European level to reduce any possible public health consequences from its use. The European PVC industry has signed a voluntary commitment concerning the sustainable development of PVC and this programme is to be implemented this year. While I support voluntary commitments in general, if they are not seen to be effective then the European Union governments and institutions will have no option other than to legislate on this matter. The Commission should ensure that no public health side effects arise from the uncontrolled recycling of PVC products. Finally, it is important to support the use of alternatives to PVC products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an early indicator of how difficult and confusing the entire discussion surrounding PVC is. We are dealing with different points of view, which range from promoting the PVC industry right through to banning PVC.</p>
<p class="contents">PVC is a very important material in our society. It is processed in many products because PVC is cheap, strong and is also durable. When we consider a replacement policy, we must give serious consideration to the ideal characteristics of the product for which there might not be an alternative. In the comparative life cycle analysis, a balance must be sought between environmental protection and the product’s life. In this connection, the differences between hard and soft PVC must also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The production of PVC is justified if strict emission requirements are met. In most cases, the addition of stabilisers, especially heavy metals, does not pose a problem at the user stage, since these additives are safely embedded in the structure of the material. The problems involving PVC start at the waste stage and are mainly due to the emissions of heavy metals and chlorine compounds, as well as large quantities of residues. The resolution hits the nail on the head by calling for reinforcement of European waste strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, since the recycling of PVC has been very slow to take off, incentives are needed. In this connection, we should start with the simplest task, namely to focus on PVC which is easy to collect in large quantities. This is what we call bulk PVC, and includes pipework, tubes, construction profiles, window and door frames, eaves and other waste from the building trade. In order to recycle, however, the problem of heavy metals must be remedied and the emissions kept within bounds.</p>
<p class="contents">When phasing out cadmium, we need to give the industry’s voluntary commitment a fair chance. The reduction in lead is laudable too, but for the phasing out process, we need to wait for the results of the study. In my opinion, the phasing out of organotin compounds is too premature at this stage. Organotin compounds are needed for the production of PVC film as long as there is no equivalent alternative available. In addition, I am still not convinced that phasing out is justified, given the possible harm this may cause. The same applies to phthalates in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be useful if we could separate plastics, but whether this is possible must be further examined; that is why we ought to wait until after the publication of the study to decide on compulsory labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what causes me real concern is Paragraph 31 of the resolution, which more or less concludes that PVC should be dumped. The solution should, however, be found in separate storage, in anticipation of the recycling capacity expanding at some later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission communication planned for this year will appear soon after the European Parliament has given its opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly wrong to confine ourselves solely to the problems of disposing of PVC. Instead, the entire lifecycle of PVC needs to be assessed from various points of view, namely the production of the raw material, its manufacture, use and processing, recycling and finally disposal. PVC is impressive above all because of the diversity of its applications and its long lifespan and thus has a wide variety of uses in particular in the building sector, as well as in many other sectors including medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission Green Paper and Mr Sacconi's report put particular emphasis on additives, especially the cadmium and lead-based stabilisers. Industry already voluntarily refrains from using cadmium in PVC products today. The use of lead is also becoming less common. In certain product groups, for example, window frames, many firms are already using calcium-zinc compounds as a substitute for this stabiliser today.</p>
<p class="contents">We should reward this willingness of industry to innovate and protect the environment by continuing to pursue and promote the system of voluntary commitments. Binding legislative measures should only be contemplated if industry falls well short of agreed targets to reduce heavy metals or increase the percentage of PVC which is recycled. A general ban on PVC products would be nothing short of fatal for 530,000 employees in the PVC sector throughout Europe, 170,000 in Germany alone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is particularly important for socio-economic factors to be taken into account when alternatives to PVC are developed. Against this background it would be irresponsible to call for a moratorium on PVC. Compulsory marking of PVC products would also lead to considerable distortions of competition. This would neither apply equally to all products nor would it deliver a noticeable environmental benefit. The introduction of a PVC levy, the separation of hard and soft PVC and a ban on PVC in the building sector would be a particular burden on small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe. In the European Union alone, 21,000 small and medium-sized companies are affected.</p>
<p class="contents">PVC as a material needs to undergo a thorough assessment of its entire life-cycle. The problems and advantages need to be weighed up with a critical eye. As things currently stand, a general ban on PVC is neither possible nor sensible and should not therefore be advocated in this Green Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will show that PVC windows and window frames, for example, or PVC water pipes are products which we want to use because of their characteristics. The same is true of blood bags, for example. Although this is a non-durable PVC product, it is the most suitable because of the product's properties. However, contrary to you, I do think that, because of the dangerous characteristics of PVC, we really should ensure that we do all we can to prevent it from being disposed of in an uncontrolled manner. In this respect we need to step up our efforts to introduce recycling – both mechanical recycling and melting for reuse – for all PVC products. It is certainly possible to find a sensible recycling solution. Here we need to show, however, much more determination and exert much more pressure so that true closed cycles develop.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this, Mrs Müller, we also need labelling, not so that the products are marked ‘Danger PVC!’, but so that they can be collected separately and be properly recycled. At the end of the day, alongside attempting to carry out a lifecycle analysis, this is about guaranteeing that people can use PVC. That is why we need differentiated collection and distinctive labelling of PVC.</p>
<p class="contents">When making any decisions about the future of PVC we also need to guarantee that employees' representatives are involved. We need to improve this aspect of the Green Paper a little more and ensure that the PVC strategy is also implemented in the applicant countries as soon as possible.</p>

There is no other product which is manufactured from chlorine and which produces such large quantities of additives with highly dubious environmental and health-related effects. There are certainly alternatives. What I find completely irresponsible is the panic-mongering about jobs. As a legislator, our job is to ensure that the environment and public health are protected. It really is not up to us to repeat industry's panic-inducing arguments about jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be clear that 96% of jobs in the PVC sector are in conversion. This means that these manufacturers could just as easily use other materials. After all, we know that the leading PVC manufacturers are just as capable of producing the alternatives. That is why I do not think that we should be taken in by these mendacious arguments. We need to remind ourselves of the risks. The five Commission studies have made it clear that the problems are simply huge, in particular with waste incineration, which produces yet more hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to comment on the argument that industry should have a system of self-regulation. Industry has had decades to develop a strategy of self-regulation here. In fact it has actually become clear that it only brought in self-regulation when it realised that we, in our capacity as legislator, finally intended to introduce a strategy to replace PVC. In actual fact industry does not propose any alternatives either; for example it does not indicate any solution to the landfill problem and does not call into question incineration, which is so fraught with problems. I find it nothing short of dishonest that it makes the percentage of waste recycled dependent on the amounts collected, but does not wish to take part in collecting the waste itself. Surely this shows that this is complete rubbish, a smokescreen. We should not be taken in by this. Instead our responsibility must surely be to propose an alternative solution and not to genuflect to industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even natural products like the leather of these desks or wood are treated with chemicals; and of course we put chemicals in our bodies, both as food additives and as residues from pesticides; and we use cosmetics, some of us more than others, which come into intimate contact with our bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">PVC has received a lot of attention and despite the fact that it has been around for over 40 years with no apparent health risks, the spectre of the risk of PVC has been raised. I wonder if it is maybe being unnecessarily demonised, to provide an enemy that the Greens can use in their campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has already discussed the problems of phthalates, the substance used to soften plastics, in the context of children's toys. The problem we faced there was determining how much of the chemical gets into people's bodies. No migration testing is available to test how much of these chemicals enters people's bodies. Of course that will also be relevant in the application of PVC to medical goods. Although I am sure I would not like a blood bag used for a transfusion I am getting, or a piece of pipe that has been put in my body, to contain poisons, similarly, I would not want a product which did not perform as well to be used in that application.</p>
<p class="contents">Other PVCs are treated with stabilisers to prevent them being broken down by heat and light. In particular, window frames have been mentioned. Cadmium, which is being phased out, and lead have also been mentioned in this context. Lead is toxic when ingested as a compound, but no one would suggest that it is risky to be in a room which has PVC windows, this is an inert substance. It is when we get to the end of the life of the PVC that we have a problem, as Ms McKenna said. We must certainly try to recycle more PVC. PVC windows have a long life – in fact, none have been recycled yet because they have reached the end of their useful life, but only because buildings have been demolished or because fashion has changed. We are looking at a 60-year life cycle. If we ban the use of lead in new windows, we will not be able to recycle the old windows when they come into the waste stream. Technology is available to ensure that windows made of old lead-containing PVC are overlaid with new PVC so people do not come into contact with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we ban something we should look at the whole picture. What are the real risks, in particular the risk of absorption when we use these products; and what are the risks of alternative products? My house has wooden windows and we have to paint those every three years, so there are risks even with wood, and of course some companies marketing alternative products will play up the risks. Lastly, we should be very careful how we use the precautionary principle because that can be dangerous: used correctly, it is a good thing but if it is used to justify actions for which there is no scientific basis, in politically motivated campaigns, it is a very dangerous principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has worked very hard to bring us together on this issue and I would commend the work he has done to the House. He really has tried very hard to get us to the situation where this House will give a great deal of support to his ideas tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that there is widespread concern about PVC within our society. We have, however, to bear in mind that it is a cheap plastic made from salt and natural gas. Where there have been problems they have been where it has been pressed into service for uses for where it is not best suited, e.g. packaging or children's toys. Where it is best used, where its natural properties are best used and need not be modified, e.g. in construction products and in specialist products like blood bags, it is an extremely useful, very important plastic and very difficult to replace.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, have a problem in terms of its disposal where harm to the environment can be caused by inappropriate disposal and we need to take sensible action with regard to that. Much of the Sacconi report I entirely endorse. I support the phase out of dangerous and unnecessary additives. I believe the voluntary recycling commitments must be reinforced and turned into legally binding agreements. But I believe that the proper route for disposal is incineration in a high temperature incinerator. Suggestions that it should go into a landfill are a serious mistake and a very bad error and I am very glad that Ms McKenna, speaking on behalf of the Green Group earlier tonight, agreed with me about that.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the beginning of a very long debate before we reach the stage of legislation. It must be a wide-ranging and broad-based debate. It must reach conclusions that are satisfactory to the public, because of the concerns they have expressed, but also to the industrial needs of society. I welcome Mr Sacconi's report as the first step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been quite perceptible here today. I should like to say to Mr Sacconi that he has tried to put a few things straight and he has succeeded in doing so in parts, but not everywhere. I think that we have a great deal more to do here. We must, I believe, take note of one thing: if we are discussing how to phase out or replace PVC then we are on the wrong track. PVC is a material which we encounter every day, which we need and can use in many areas of our lives. In my opinion this is also how it will stay in the near future. The fact that this requires us to solve problems is something that is also true in any other sector and with any other material.</p>
<p class="contents">The weak points of the Green Paper are that it mentions products, such as cadmium and lead, which industry actually uses only very rarely in the PVC production process even now. I have seen for myself how the measures under the voluntary commitments are being introduced in companies. I, myself, am no friend of self-regulation; I have always campaigned hard against it. After all, we need laws to achieve something. In this case, however, it was not the lobbying trap to which someone at the front referred a few minutes ago: I satisfied myself of its effectiveness. We should appropriate industry's findings and not randomly back or call for substitutes which we ourselves have not yet investigated, and about which we ourselves do not know the full facts.</p>
<p class="contents">These are points, therefore, which certainly need to be taken into consideration, and the Green Paper needs to be altered to reflect them. Where legislation is concerned we always say that we need to make progress quickly and that we need to know what's what. The entire body of legislation on the use of PVC – the incineration directive, the landfill directive – provides legislative foundations on which we can build when we want to use and dispose of this particular material. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of the stakeholders – the Commission, Parliament, the companies and associations – have held in-depth discussions in the last few months about the advantages and disadvantages of PVC as a material. Industry's repeated request to exclude certain options from the process of reflection – such as, for example, substituting PVC with alternatives or finding replacements for the stabilisers cadmium and lead – must be refused. In my opinion, in a Green Paper nothing must be off-limits and no possibilities must be ignored if we wish to have a sound basis for deciding on a comprehensive strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sacconi's report remedies the deficiencies in the Green Paper in a balanced way. Thus, it is not only the critical waste-related issues which are assessed, but the entire lifecycle of PVC and possible alternatives. I also believe that it is important for the social dimension, the impact on jobs, to be integrated into the reflection process alongside the ecological and economic aspects. Because of its long lifespan PVC certainly presents advantages in some products, but these are reduced by the stabilisers used. Urgent efforts should therefore be made to find substitutes for these two toxic substances. In addition the percentage of material recycled must be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate about phthalates, which we have already had in connection with toys, must be urgently concluded with an independent scientific risk assessment. I hope that the last outstanding report will be included in the assessment of soft PVC in the Green Paper. Overall I think that if we make the right decision tomorrow we will have a good basis for a comprehensive PVC strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The main purpose of the Green Paper was to initiate a broad public debate at European level that would be all-embracing and multi-sectoral in nature. The aim was to get all interest groups involved in the decision-making process at an early stage, in order to ensure that the preparatory work with regard to the issue was transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I, along with my colleague, Margot Wallström, organised a public hearing in October 2000. It was attended by representatives from all interest groups. The Green Paper had also asked for written opinions on the questions put forward. There was a huge number of responses. We received more than 30 000 e-mails, faxes and letters. Most came from employees in the PVC industry and companies in the sector, but many were also received from NGOs and their supporters. In addition, the Commission received official opinions from the majority of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft opinion presented to the European Parliament covers all the essential matters and will be an important guide when the Commission prepares its communication proposing a Commission strategy on PVC. In its assessment, the Commission will mainly concentrate on the use of certain PVC additives, lead, cadmium and phthalates, as well as the treatment of PVC waste in accordance with the commitment the Commission made in its proposal for a directive on end-of-life vehicles. These are two environmental questions requiring action, and the position on them expressed in the Committee’s report is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes the view expressed in the report that the use of PVC should be studied thoroughly by assessing with equal precision the life cycle of products made from PVC and alternative materials. The Commission notes with satisfaction the Committee’s proposal that a combination of both legislative and voluntary remedies should be used in any future strategy. Of interest too is the proposal for drafting legislation on PVC that would only enter into force if the players concerned are unable to meet the set objectives through voluntary agreements. This safety mechanism and other methods are to be examined more closely in a communication on voluntary agreements that the Commission is at present drafting.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to emphasise that the Commission works on the basis of sustainable development in all three dimensions of society, the economy, and the environment. The European Parliament is kept very much up to date on developments, and in the months to come the Commission will be issuing a communication based on the Green Paper and the opinions received during the consultation procedure, which will spell out the Community’s strategy on environmental issues connected with PVC. This strategy will serve as a framework for future initiatives on PVC. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
