His report seeks to give renewed momentum to relations between the European Union and the ACP states.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the content of this report contains a real political challenge for the future of our relations with the ACP states. This is clearly highlighted in the title of the document the Commission has submitted to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lomé IV Convention already had one innovative aspect in that it referred to the respect for and promotion of human rights in the actual body of the Convention. The review of the Lomé IV Convention in 1995 introduced an explicit reference to the recognition and application of democratic principles in Article 5, and to the consolidation of the rule of law and good governance in Article 366a. Article 224 goes into more detail on these issues. What we must now do is move beyond the theoretical debate of concepts that are full of good intentions and move towards defining specific measures that will facilitate the transition from theory to practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make our friends in the ACP states aware that, to a certain extent, these guidelines should be seen as an attempt to participate in matters that come under their competences, responsibilities and sovereignty. I must say that many of the guidelines and measures we advocate in this report would not have any effect and would be inefficient if they were not adopted by the various ACP actors, and especially by civil society in the ACP states, as civil society is the ultimate beneficiary of such measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also add that the Union must remain vigilant and must adopt exemplary sanctions to deal with some of the problems we must address. One such problem is corruption where, for example, infringements involve natural or legal persons or European companies. As one of the most brilliant European thinkers of the end of this century said, corruption is the cancer that corrodes democracy. Corruption, in whatever form it takes, inevitably leads to an economic system that smiles on immediate profit, arbitrary acts and individual interests and is opposed to any concept of transparency, fairness and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the reports by Mr Martens and Mr Rocard, the European Parliament is demanding a new political dimension in European Union‐ACP relations, based on the promotion of democratic principles and on respect for human rights. In this field, education is an essential environment for political action seeking to encourage the strengthening of a strong and healthy civil society. It is vital that such action pays special attention to the specific role of women and to protecting the rights of minors, who in some cases are victims of forms of indigenous slavery that is humiliating and that insults the dignity of human beings. Strengthening the rule of law and democracy must include developing the conditions in which the courts of justice, the police and the army operate. It must encourage support for the media who seek to provide true information and remain independent of the public authorities. Society must be strengthened through citizens" associations, professional organisations and trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">We realise that these objectives, which, although ambitious are no less urgent or utopian, cannot be achieved without working on dialogue both between the European Union and the ACP countries and among the ACP states themselves. This dialogue must be as broad and as intense as possible, covering all issues and areas affected. In addition, it must include not only representatives from each state, but, in particular, members and organisations from the political opposition, representatives of the legislature and judiciary, as well as representatives from civil society and from non‐governmental organisations. For this purpose, we support the strengthening of the ACP‐EU Joint Assembly"s role as the preferred forum for developing such a dialogue.</p>

This is the view of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, whose opinion I have drawn up for the Committee on Development and Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy had certain comments which it has tabled as amendments, such as the fact that the communication does not take sufficient account of the unique existing EU‐ACP structure, which enables both sides to consult each other about human rights, democracy and good governance through the EU‐ACP Council and the EU‐ACP Assembly. Instead of introducing a lot of new structures, we feel that the existing structures should be put to optimum use.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, where a certain ACP country has violated human rights or there is a serious lack of good governance or democracy, the EU‐ACP Assembly can send delegations, draw up reports for discussion in the Assembly and take measures on that basis. Instead of introducing a great many official reports, we feel it would always be better to give preference to and to make better use of this route via the Assembly. This would avoid duplication of effort and place the emphasis on a political approach rather than an official one, which is generally more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, most ACP countries have signed international conventions in the field of human rights and democracy. This means that these countries are themselves obliged to report on a regular basis and to evaluate the reports in their parliaments. If the European Union intends to take action, then account must be taken of the fact that these countries have their own responsibilities here.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these points are set out in amendments which have been incorporated by Mr Fernández Martín. We are therefore very happy with his report and we hope that the Commission will react favourably to it and to our amendments.</p>

Physical and spiritual development is possible only in circumstances where there is general protection under the law and equality of social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The hustle and bustle of finance requires clear legislation for its protection. A major task of the European Union is to promote democracy, respect for human rights and the adoption of the principles of the rule of law. It has already done much to further this cause, and will continue to do so. Money has been set aside for this purpose in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The cultivation of democracy has to begin at the beginning. The birth and growth of political parties have to be encouraged. We must support openness, honesty and legality in government. Local traditions and customs often hamper developments. Corruption and the custom of favouring relatives are fairly common and, worst of all, widely accepted and tolerated. In such circumstances it is difficult to use European Union funds wisely, because that can also easily lead to abuse. That is why the implementation of democracy programmes is difficult and demands an enormous sense of responsibility on the part of the authorities concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">When it was preparing last year"s budget Parliament decided that an interinstitutional working party, including a representative from the European Parliament, should be set up to decide on funds – how to spend them and follow them up – to promote democracy, respect for human rights, and the furtherance of the rule of law. The purpose of this working party would be to aid the implementation and follow‐up phase of these programmes. It is to be hoped that this system of coordination will get off the ground as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">What is the main thrust of the Commission's communication and the parliamentary report we are examining?</p>
<p class="contents">It is nothing less than the recognition that democracy, the affirmation of the state of law, respect for and promotion of human rights, the fight against corruption and the implementation of good governance are not just universal principles and aims which should obviously be promoted all over the world, they are also, and above all, essential conditions for success in implementing policies for healthy, balanced and genuine development.</p>
<p class="contents">In short we do not want to ‘export" models to our partners in the third world, and the ACP countries in particular. We do not want to impose the principles and practices of the world"s most developed countries, but we do want to affirm what is now recognised objectively: that democracy and human rights are the foundations on which a modern society can develop, and not the end result of development.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we know a close correlation exists between democracy and development, but that can never be used as an excuse to justify anti‐democratic regimes and violations of the most elementary human rights, to deny the right to participate in decision‐making, to tolerate widespread corruption, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the last few years we have been able to witness, in many ACP countries, the turbulent, and even sometimes contradictory, emergence of civil society, which is demanding space, guarantees and rules, calling for the reorganisation of the authorities, and demanding that the authorities gear their action to the collective interest and the welfare of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on that basis that a start has been made on new processes of democratisation on the continent of Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union's approach has evolved a great deal over the years and since the start of the 1990s the focus has been on the issue of democracy as an aim of all development cooperation. Of course it is still useful to calibrate the instruments according to the two main types of possible measures. First there are measures of ‘negative discrimination" whereby sanctions are applied to countries responsible for human rights violations, involving active intervention. This makes the negative approach ‘expensive" and ‘inconvenient". The problem is that this approach, while necessary, often fails to secure the agreed participation of all those involved in international cooperation with a country, often rendering the measures useless.</p>
<p class="contents">However the accent is now being rightly placed on the need for ‘positive measures", that is, measures which, through direct cooperation, create conditions for effectively implementing the commitments set out in Article 5 of the Lomé Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that I agree with everything contained in both the Commission's communication and Mr Fernández Martín"s report, I do not want to go into the substance of the various initiatives proposed. I would just emphasise that, almost inevitably, there is a risk of an omission. We need to consider whether, in some cases, the rules and procedures set out in the current Lomé Convention relating to contracts, the allocation and management of financial resources, and respect for commercial rules of origin, may not be the subject of mismanagement and even corruption in some ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To be more specific, the problem is that the lack of transparency and knowledge about the instruments of the Convention, which concentrates enormous power in the hands of the national organisers in ACP countries, can certainly give rise to problems of mismanagement, corruption or misuse of the resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is a point to be looked at carefully when it comes to renegotiating the rules for the next Convention.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Corrie </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report and being brave enough to highlight such issues as corruption and the lack of pluralism in some States. We are all aware that many developing nations are in a serious financial situation because corruption is adding to the debt problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, in many ways, democracy – or the lack of it – go hand in hand with corruption. Having used democracy to gain power, some do not wish to relinquish that power. For that reason, we need good governance as well as democracy if we are to combat corruption. The whole structure of our Lomé agreement is based on democracy, human rights and good governance. I should like to tell the Commissioner that fine words are not enough. We cannot force nations to abide by these principles but we can use incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole thrust of any new arrangement after 2000 will have a much more political dimension, and we must insist on political pluralism in countries receiving aid programmes. It is up to nations themselves to develop this. As our rapporteur says, measures should be put in place to assist those ACP nations struggling towards democracy. Regional cooperation should help in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally support that but we must strike the right balance. There are a growing number of applicant States which are altering their constitutions in such a way that political pluralism will be impossible and opposition parties will never have the chance to come to power. We should not tolerate that. What incentive is there for responsible nations struggling to stay within the rules if other nations which flout those rules of democracy continue to receive support?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fassa </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to endorse the praise that has been showered on the rapporteur, Mr Fernández Martín. I must say he has worked with uncommon speed. In fact few reports have been put together so fast since the Committee on Development and Cooperation came into being.</p>
<p class="contents">The picture he paints of relations between the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the countries of the European Union is very interesting. He is quite right to highlight the move from a purely economic approach to a form of cooperation which instead puts the accent strongly on human rights, evolution towards democracy, and aid from the European Union countries to establish the rule of law in the developing countries, not just in form but also, and above all, in substance. We should not forget that simply affirming the rules and principles of modern western constitutions is not enough to make democracy exist automatically, nor is establishing democracy enough to create conditions of genuine development automatically.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Fernández Martín report wisely puts the accent on specific local characteristics as well. We cannot assume that our institutional models are universal, eternal and incontestable, nor can we think of superimposing them uncritically on the situation in countries with very different histories from our own. But one thing is certain: the battle against corruption, embezzlement and bad governance must be fiercely fought, both in Europe and in the developing countries.</p>

I must mention the Commission"s initiative because I regard this as extremely opportune. As the Convention will soon be renewed, I believe that this is the time to clarify how the European Union interprets the contents of this Convention on human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago in this House, Commissioner Deus Pinheiro threw down the challenge involving the need to consider how the European Union cooperates with the ACP countries and with developing countries. This related, in particular, to those countries that have violent regimes in which fundamental rights are not respected, those where corruption forms part of daily life, and, above all, those where the existence of conflicts may result in cooperation funds being diverted to the war effort.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is refreshing to note that, in recent years, many ACP countries have implemented significant institutional reforms, often under very difficult socioeconomic and political conditions. And the fundamental values of the rule of law, the participation of the people, good governance and the protection of human rights have formed the structural objectives of these governments. Anyone participating in the ACP assemblies can confirm this concern on the part of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The new ACP‐EU partnership must be given a strong political dimension based on the promotion of the values of democracy, as only a democratic state can guarantee full respect for human rights. Furthermore, the Convention must include detailed and very clear provisions on measures to combat corruption, accompanied by very specific sanctions that can be applied to the ACP country, to the Member States or to the economic operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also believe that the appropriate institutional framework for the debate on the new concepts of the Convention and the pursuit of this policy is a new ACP‐EU Joint Assembly that has been adapted and restructured.</p>

We have spent many years debating democracy, the rule of law, human rights and good governance in developing countries and in the ACP countries. Negotiating the Lomé IV Convention played an important role, and this report is the next step.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to create the necessary infrastructure to bring about the separation of powers. To achieve this, however, many countries need support, which we should provide in the areas of development policy and cooperation with the ACP countries. It is vital that the Joint Assembly is itself pluralistic, and that it is a body which is representative of the various parties and not of authoritarian regimes. We must act together to ensure this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also act together regarding the allocation of funds. If we in the EU wish to combat corruption – which was the subject of yesterday"s debate – then this also applies to cooperation with the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also look into the areas where, by means of infrastructure measures, human rights are being violated by the present international economic system – as Mr Fernández Martín points out in paragraph 7 of his report – that is, due to the debt burden issue, structural adjustment measures or the fact that European companies force the indigenous population to submit to structural adjustment measures, which is often an obstacle to the introduction of the rule of law and the separation of powers.</p>

If we replace the word ‘country" by ‘European Union", then we can clearly see that we have no right at all to be paternalistic towards the ACP countries. I have the impression that we are using the term political dialogue to conceal the fact that what we are really trying to do is to impose a western political system on the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The poor results of the Lomé Convention as revealed in the Commission"s 1997 Green Paper led to a wide‐ranging discussion about whether the Convention should be continued. If there was to be a new convention in 2000, then its substance would have to be completely different, and we now appear to have decided that this new substance should be political. The failures of the past are all put down to inadequate government structures, corruption and other practices, in an attempt to find political solutions for economic problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I have serious doubts as to whether this is the right approach. I also think that the European Union is not the right place for this sort of political dialogue. We would do better to channel our efforts into promoting the genuine involvement of the developing countries in the world economy, even if this could work against our own economic interests.</p>

I consider it important to give special emphasis to the fight against corruption, which is an evil that is all too present in many ACP countries. Without wishing to polemicise over this issue I would however like to say that the EU must in future set a good example. We cannot preach water and drink whiskey.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a matter of priority to give urgent attention to the situation of children and to protecting the rights of children in the context of dialogue between the European Union and the ACP countries. The only effective way to achieve a lasting improvement in the fate of socially deprived or sexually abused children in some of the countries involved is to convey an unmistakably clear message and impose certain conditions within the framework of development policy. If the ‘democracy and human rights" dimension is to become an essential component of the Community"s foreign and development policy, children must be the focus of our attention. We must not permit the growing phenomenon of child labour and the sexual abuse of children, which is taking place on an enormous scale, in any of our partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though worrying developments in the environment sector are not necessarily taking place on our own doorstep, we must also, in view of the significant global interdependencies that are being created, integrate environmental aspects into our relations with the ACP countries.</p>

I naturally attach great importance to this report and to the Commission report, because the ever‐recurring conflicts between the United States of America and Europe can be attributed not least to the fact that we have particularly close economic ties with 70 countries throughout the world and that great mutual support exists. I believe that it is quite natural that we, as Europeans, should attempt to introduce and support, in these 70 countries with which we cooperate, certain principles which we have recognised as being correct, and that we look upon them practically as a basic condition in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, however, to make a slight criticism of this report that seems to me to be very important. It relates to the fact that, once national rights have been established, we naturally place a great deal of emphasis on human rights and thus on the individual. The fact that there are certain groups which also have rights is unfortunately being ignored. The groups I am specifically referring to are the minority groups and the various ethnic groups which live in these countries and which unfortunately are not mentioned in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We see only too often that it is these very minority groups which are treated abominably and have no rights whatsoever. In this connection I have in mind certain African countries, for example in the Great Lakes region. If we look at what is happening in Rwanda and Burundi, it is my belief that it is enormously important for us, as a European Parliament that continually supports not only individual human rights but also the rights of ethnic groups, to ensure that the rights of these groups are guaranteed at an international level, which is not the case at the moment.</p>

If it is to have maximum effect a human rights policy must be clear, transparent, fair and consistent. Various proposals are put forward in this document, some of them good, some of them not so good. I agree with some of what the previous speaker, Mr Habsburg‐Lothringen, said about this. In its communication, the Commission rightly proposes to extend dialogue with the ACP countries with the aim of promoting democracy and human rights there. It also suggests a combination of positive and negative instruments in order to achieve this, and this balance is vital for success, in my view. The rapporteur, Mr Fernández Martín, is therefore right to point out that Parliament must have a say in any decision on suspending ACP cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would urge the Commission to prepare a similar communication on the implementation of democracy and human rights policy in other regions. The Union"s policy on this in all areas of the world must be based on clear criteria. You know what they are, I have already listed them: fairness, clarity, transparency, consistency and making allowance for the fact that not everyone in the world has managed to come as far as we have. Nevertheless, in this case I entirely agree with my colleague, friend and fellow countryman Mr Blokland that once in a while we need to put our own house in order here.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cushnahan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, in September 1998 negotiations started between the EU and the ACP to agree the successor to the Lomé Convention. I welcome the fact that a fundamental basis for this negotiation is a strengthening and deepening of political dialogue, an element which had been largely missing in the previous discussions. One of the major components of the political dialogue is the subject of this report, namely democratisation, the protection of human rights and the operation of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The report considers these issues thoroughly and I support its recommendations to include stronger provisions on the human rights front and to tackle corruption, and particularly important, its recommendations for the use of sanctions. I support the strategy outlined in this report, I congratulate the rapporteur and I hope Parliament overwhelmingly approves it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Parliament for its proposal for a resolution on the Commission"s communication entitled ‘Democratisation, the rule of law, respect for human rights and good governance: the challenges of the partnership between the European Union and the ACP States". And I should particularly like to thank the author of this report, Mr Fernández Martín, for the quality of his work, as well as Mr Pomés who spoke on his behalf. I should also like to thank all those speakers who participated in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of including human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles in EU policy in general, and in its external relations in particular, has grown over the last decade. This is mainly due to the belief that there can be no lasting human development without an institutional and political environment that respects these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, each country must decide upon the political and economic model around which it will organise its communal life, whilst respecting the general principles of human rights as well as the conventions and international and regional legal instruments on such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication follows the same lines as previous communications from the Commission on these issues, particular that of May 1995 on the inclusion and respect for democratic principles in agreements between the Community and third countries. It is also along the same lines as the November 1995 communication on the European Union and the external dimension of its human rights policy entitled ‘From Rome to Maastricht and beyond", as well as the March 1996 communication on the European Union and the issue of conflicts in Africa: ‘Peace‐building, conflict prevention and beyond".</p>
<p class="contents">This communication responds to three requirements: the need to clarify for ACP members how the European Commission interprets these principles; the need to contribute in terms of stepping up the debate in the ACP states; and the need to prepare and facilitate the debate on the future relations between the ACP states and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission believes that it is necessary to draw up a specific communication on the ACP states. The aims of this communication will be to clarify the concepts that appear in Article 5 of the revised Lomé IV Convention, to draw up an action plan for coordinating dialogue with ACP countries, to strengthen the debate on such matters in these countries, and to give special emphasis to a series of specific measures and priority actions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards principles and objectives, the Commission welcomes Parliament"s approval and the fact that it responds to the guidelines from the reports by Mr Rocard and Mr Martens. The Commission once again stresses the principle that the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles forms an integral part of the European Union"s development policy and constitutes an essential element of the Lomé Convention. The Commission also shares Parliament"s concern that good governance be added to this with an explicit reference to combating corruption, as stipulated in the negotiating mandate for the ACP states and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the action programme, the Commission is delighted that Parliament supports the positive approach in these matters, the suggestion to the ACP states that they propose criteria relating to the promotion of human rights, and the recognition of the specific social, economic, political and cultural situation of each ACP state. As a result, they will be able to define objectives, priority actions and the pace of development, as well as assessing what has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to stress that it is only through dialogue between the Community and the ACP states on such issues that the political and institutional dimensions of cooperation will be able to flourish, as will respect for the sovereignty and distinct characteristics of the countries in question. We therefore support the proposals in the current resolution on how to forge ahead on these matters, with a view to negotiating the ACP‐European Union Convention. We also support the need to define and institutionalise the process and the arrangements for this dialogue in the next ACP‐European Union Convention – as defined in the negotiating mandate – as well as the importance of developing and extending this dialogue by including the various actors from civil society. Advantages are to be gained by developing this dialogue to negotiate national and regional indicative programmes. Finally, we share Parliament"s view on the need to make the most of, and strengthen, the joint institutions, including the Assembly, in order to promote and develop this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of determining specific measures and priority actions that will have to be taken, we do, of course, agree with the proposals in the resolution on the importance of supporting actions to help vulnerable groups, particularly the rights of children and of army and police personnel. These have been implemented over recent years through projects financed by budgetary headings from Chapter B−7, European initiatives for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me repeat what Mr Fernández Martín said in his report and welcome the laudable efforts and progress made in many ACP states over the last few years in spite of the difficult economic conditions they face.</p>

<p class="contents">It can never be stressed enough how the efforts made in these areas by developing countries must not only be welcomed but also encouraged, and, above all, they should be supported as they are more often than not made under difficult socioeconomic conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another priority to be added to the next ACP‐EU Convention must be the promotion of good governance and the fight against corruption, together with the instruments and specific measures needed to implement these.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not actually possible to have a socially balanced policy on economic development as long as most of a country"s resources are being diverted into the pockets of a few people.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, another condition that I feel is essential to any sustainable development is that the new Convention should pay particular attention to our partners" respect for and implementation of the minimum international standards of the ILO. This Convention must also ensure that the economic and social partners become stronger in the ACP countries and that a permanent and constructive dialogue is established between them. In more general terms, it is once again important to support and extend the role of civil society in drawing up and implementing development and democratisation programmes among our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would also highlight the essential role played by women in all stable development processes and I would emphasise, together with our rapporteur, the need to constantly ensure that greater consideration is given to their legal and social rights as well as to their increased participation in political life.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
