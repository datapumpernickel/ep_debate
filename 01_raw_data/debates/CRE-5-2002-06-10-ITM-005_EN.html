<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">MacCormick (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I am greatly relieved as rapporteur in this case to finally have the opportunity of presenting this report before the House, whether it be rejected or accepted in the end. I have been a Member of the House for just under three years and for nearly all that time I have been honoured to be one of the rapporteurs on parliamentary privilege and immunity for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. One of the earliest tasks assigned to me was a bundle of requests from Members from Italy, or from their lawyers, concerning their concern that prosecutions or other legal actions were taking place in Italy which violated their immunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Rules of Procedure which will I hope be amended in the light of the Duff report make elaborate provision for the steps Parliament should take in order to decide whether or not to waive immunity on receipt of a request from the proper authorities of the Member State. The problem in the Italian cases was that no request had been received other than from the Members themselves and this gave rise to concern. If it were the case that privileges or immunities enjoyed by Members of this House were being ignored by a Member State that would be a serious matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The point that I would make, and the Duff report makes here, is that the privileges and immunities of this House exist not to expand the rights of Members as citizens beyond those of other citizens. They exist solely to protect the dignity of this assembly as a European legislature and to protect the conditions of effective and free democratic debate in it.</p>
<p class="contents">If it were case that Members could show that their position as Members of this House, as legislators on the European scene, was being prejudiced by conduct of a Member State and there was no way to bring this before the House solely because no appropriate authority in a Member State had sought to have the immunity waived, this would in itself be clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The House possesses immunity under two different provisions. Under Article 9 of the Protocol of 1965, Members enjoy immunity from any form of enquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties. There are other immunities which arise in other circumstances where the immunity a Member enjoys is equivalent to that of a Member of a Member State parliament in their own Member State and in other Member States, an immunity from prosecution except with the agreement of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">After a great deal of study, it became clear that what was at issue in all the cases before us was only an issue concerning Article 9 of the Protocol. It was the issue of whether prosecutions taken against Members for opinions they were expressing or had expressed violated the immunity they enjoy under Article 9. Our Rules of Procedure are silent on what we should do in that case. It seems to me that as a democratic legislative assembly, we must have some inherent power to draw it to the attention of Member States if the conditions of free debate are being violated in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking that view of the matter, the Committee looked over the cases and in all respects save one accepted the recommendations which I was minded to put forward. Looking at the cases as clearly and candidly as possible, it seems to me that Mr Speroni's was one where because matters were asked concerning an explanation of votes in the House he was clearly being called to account for an opinion expressed in the exercise of his functions. Mr Marra's case was one in which documents published by Mr Marra is his capacity as a Member had, in a complex way, given rise to prosecutions or judicial allegations.</p>
<p class="contents">These seem to be clear cases where Article 9 was in issue. The Committee thought, but I do not think, that Mr Dell'Utri's case was the same. The reason why I differed from the Committee is that in Mr Dell'Utri's case, the statements made, whatever their truth and whatever their legal character, were made several years before Mr Dell'Utri became a Member of the House. I cannot see any sensible reading of a provision concerning opinions expressed or votes cast by us in the performance of our duties which relates to statements we make before we become Members. You cannot equate a candidate for office with a holder of office. This goes for ourselves in our capacities as candidates, by the way.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore recommend to the House that we take the action suggested in my report and that we draw these cases to the attention of the Italian authorities. My own Parliamentary group has moved an amendment to take the name of Mr Dell'Utri out of the report and I personally believe that it is the right course to take. I hope I have given an account to colleagues of why I think it is right course to take and that it is simply a matter of an objective and fair-minded reading of the Protocol rather than an attempt to engage in a political judgement either way about the state of affairs in the Italian Republic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The competence of the Spanish judges to file the application was challenged by Spanish ministers. This put the European Parliament into a quandary, not of its own making but one that was exacerbated by the weaknesses of its own rules and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals before us, passed after long deliberation by a large majority of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, have several ingredients. Firstly, we include a short clear statement of what privileges and immunities are in the modern context. That is to say, not to say to protect MEPs inclined to a life of crime but primarily, as Mr MacCormick has said, to ensure the dignity of the legislature as a place of independent and pluralistic debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we concede that there might be more than a single competent authority in some Member States and we permit the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market not only to give a reasoned opinion upon the matter of competence but also to prepare an indicative non-definitive list of such authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the duties of the President of Parliament are more clearly delineated from those of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Fourthly, the procedures of the committee and the criteria that it will use to formulate its opinions are set out in some detail for the benefit of Members' courts and the public. Fifthly, provision is made for the rare occasions when a Member is obliged to assert a privilege or immunity before a court.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that all these provisions will equip Parliament to cope with privilege cases at the federal level coordinate with, but not subordinate to, national parliamentary regimes. The reforms comprise a clarification, as well as a formalisation, of the privileges and immunities system, thereby meeting the requirements of the Court of First Instance in a separate related case. More radical reform will depend on whether the Convention approaches an amendment of the 1965 Protocol, the formulation of a Members' Statute and, finally, the matter of improving Parliament's access to the court on the question of sanctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the PPE-DE Group concur with Mr Duff's approach and the analysis contained in the report's explanatory statement. As is clear, not only from the debate earlier this evening, but also from the discussion in this House and in its committees over the last weeks and months, the whole issue of immunities is arcane, incoherent and muddled.</p>
<p class="contents">In Mr Duff's explanatory statement, it is rightly stated, although perhaps in not quite these words, that MEPs are not merely national MPs who happen to go abroad. In fact, MEPs are now something distinct from national MPs who might happen to go abroad. They are people who are similar but, nevertheless, qualitatively different.</p>
<p class="contents">That has significant implications for the whole question of immunities and it explains why we are in the present muddle. He is absolutely right in the report to point out, as he has done in his remarks this evening, that in order to tidy this up and create something sensible and understandable to Europe's citizens, it is necessary for changes to come both from the forthcoming Convention and from recommendations to the IGC that might be accepted. In addition, provisions with regard to this ought to be contained in the forthcoming Member's Statute. If we do that, we may be able to introduce a degree of sense and coherence into our Rules which is currently missing and will remain missing to our detriment if we do not manage to do it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Duff took a difficult report on a subject that was triggered by a particular case of high controversy and which remains a particular case of high controversy and where my side of the House still differs substantially in its views from many of those on the other side of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in taking on that case, Mr Duff managed to produce consensus by focusing on the procedures and not on the particular case, and he did this with considerable skill. If I may return a compliment to him that he paid me earlier this evening, every parliament needs an Andrew Duff.</p>
<p class="contents">My group can therefore support what he has done: the clarity with which he has drafted these new Rules and the innovations therein – the innovation that opens the door for us, as a parliament, to assert the immunity of a Member where no request has been forwarded to us to waive it, but proceedings have been started in a Member State, or may be started, and the innovation that there may indeed be more than one national authority that is competent to request the waiver of immunity.</p>
<p class="contents">All that, in my opinion, is to the good. My group will, therefore, be voting for his report but we are still debating paragraph 8 of amendment 2, where we do have a fear that, in essence, it contradicts the previous paragraphs in the report, and where it opens the door to Parliament becoming involved in the substance of a case rather than in whether or not there should be a waiver of immunity. That wording is one on which we may request a split vote and vote against. But we are still open to dialogue with the rapporteur on this because we know what an excellent job he has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that immunity exists to protect Parliament, not the Member. The second is that on no account can the European Parliament arrogate to itself the right to pass judgment on the allegations themselves in the manner of a sort of court.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe – and, quite frankly, it pains me to say so – that, on both counts, the Duff report’s changes are negative and dangerous, for example where it mentions defending immunities with regard to Rule 6.1(a). In a situation in which we are asking the Europeans to accept measures such as the European arrest warrant, and therefore to agree to the possibility of being arrested on the basis of forms of evidence and procedures customary in a different State from their own, I feel that it is truly absurd to allow Members to effectively block prosecution proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that a Member’s scope for action should be limited to the cases of absolute immunity laid down in Rule 9 and that the competent Parliamentary committee should then decide whether the Member’s request is acceptable. However, quite frankly, Mr Duff’s text does not make this distinction between Rule 9 and Rule 10, and the fact that the competent committee would, if necessary, be able to make a decision does not convince me. Indeed, I find the vote which took place on the immunity of Mr Dell’Utri, a gentlemen who was not even a Member of Parliament at the time of the alleged offence, wholly unconvincing, for the votes cast in a parliament are always politically motivated.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure proposed is therefore too complex: it leaves the door open to totally unscrupulous behaviour which, although certainly unthinkable in Mr MacCormick and Mr Duff’s country, I regret to say is much more common in other countries. That is why I will vote against the Duff report and I will call upon my group to do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In our view, however, it provides a poor response to the specific technical question which sparked off deliberation on this issue, namely how to determine which is the competent national body for forwarding to the European Parliament the request for the waiver of immunity of one of its Members. Political common sense tells us that it is up to the Member State in question to appoint this body. Furthermore, the Lamassoure report, which was only adopted at our last sitting, states that when a competence has not been explicitly attributed to the European institutions, it is assumed that the responsibility falls to the Member States. Paragraph 13 of Article 6(a) of the Duff report, however, confuses the problem and manages to complicate further this otherwise simple rule. We are, of course, unable to allow this, Mr President, as I shall state in my explanation of vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They must therefore be preserved – and it is our duty to do this – from the attempts coming from a number of quarters to place conditions upon Parliament’s exercising of its functions. In the institutions of absolute immunity and immunity laid down by the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities, the European Parliament has the – albeit limited – tools to defend itself against attacks on its independence or autonomy by other public or private authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not so in the case of the Members of the European Parliament elected in Italy. Indeed, very often, the judicial authorities do not take into account the absolute immunity of the Member in question – the European Parliament must understand that – in carrying out the processes laid down in Article 68(2) of the Constitution, particularly where the – albeit indirect – interception of telephone communications is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There is controversy in Italy at this very time regarding the indirect interception of telephone communications carried out in contempt of the principle of this guarantee. It is apparent that interchanges are taking place which are actually sometimes quite unpleasant between the parliament and certain judges, who are inevitably and, at times, unconsciously, biased. They use the independence and lack of institutional accountability they enjoy as a shield for what are, in fact, political actions. The judges themselves, moreover, are raising this issue<span class="bold"> </span>in conventions and seminars and even in official debates.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this Italian idiosyncrasy, the European Parliament must defend its independence resolutely, particularly when its Members are accused of offences because of opinions they have expressed in the course of their duties. In other words, the European Parliament must be able to intervene to confirm cases of absolute immunity and immunity at the request of the accused Member too, provided, of course, that the requisite conditions and assumptions are fulfilled, as happens in the Italian Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr MacCormick and Mr Duff’s reports lay down procedures for making these guarantees effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by thanking both Mr MacCormick and Mr Duff, who, in the report on the adoption of the Members’ Statute, have endorsed our work on it, which I hope will be adopted by the House without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The MacCormick report, as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has already adopted a position on some of the cases mentioned and feels that the cases of the Members or former Members of Parliament, Mr Marras, Mr Speroni and Mr Dell’Utri, are, <span class="italic">prima facie</span> and in this case, covered by absolute immunity. In any event, the competent judge – the Italian judge, that is – must send Parliament the necessary documentation and establish whether the case in question fulfils the conditions for absolute immunity laid down in Article 9 of the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I can only fully support this approach and recommend that Mr MacCormick and Mr Duff’s reports be adopted without any amendment. I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their valuable work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paciotti (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I too, like Mr Corbett, welcome the way our rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr MacCormick, have tackled the shortcomings of the procedures for deciding the immunity of the Members of the European Parliament. The European Parliament must, in the future, have its own system of immunity which ensures equal treatment for all its Members, irrespective of which country they belong to. This could be one of the many tasks of the Convention on the Future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, however, it is necessary to resolve a number of issues which have emerged during this legislature, particularly with regard to the case of the Spanish investigations regarding Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell’Utri. In that case, the Presidency of Parliament interpreted the Rules of Procedure in such a way that the request from the Spanish judicial authorities was considered not to be appropriate and was therefore not referred to the competent committee or examined in the European Parliament until the person in question was no longer a Member of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The request was considered in that case as being made by a foreign authority and having to be communicated through the government and its diplomatic representations. However, in the European Community, the judicial authorities of the Member States cannot be considered to be the authorities of foreign countries and as having to be represented solely by their respective governments. The proposal to amend Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure on the need for every request for defence or waiver of immunity made by any authority of the Member States to be announced immediately to Parliament and referred to the committee responsible is therefore appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue addressed by Mr MacCormick’s report also arose in relation to the cases of the Italian Members. Article 9 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities<span class="bold"> </span>states that, as happens in all democratic countries, the Members of the European Parliament cannot be prosecuted in respect of opinions expressed by them in the performance of their duties. This is not a relative immunity which can be waived by Parliament but an absolute immunity. It is laid down by a European rule, which it is the responsibility of the judges of the Member States to interpret and enforce. However, in Italy, it has become customary for Members of the national parliament to be able to invoke their parliament’s protection in cases in which they feel their privilege has been unjustly denied or misinterpreted, and it was therefore considered that, by analogy with the provisions of Article 10 of the Protocol, this national custom should also be adopted at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">This interpretation has now been included in the Duff report as a general solution, and it is therefore proposed to amend the Rules of Procedure to give Members the right to request that their immunity and privileges be defended, thus affording greater protection of privileges and immunity.</p>
<p class="contents">To support these proposals is to assert our faith in the dignity of politics, in its capacity and in its will to guarantee democracy in the general interest and not to preserve the privileges of a few against the principle of the equality of all the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a faith that I persist in wanting to preserve, although it has too often been disappointed, as in the case of one of the specific proposals contained in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market’s report, which goes so far as to classify the opinions expressed by Mr Dell’Utri before he became a Member as opinions expressed during the performance of his duties.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I will be voting for the amendment proposed by Mr MacCormick.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have discussed every aspect of this issue during the debate, so I shall simply make two or three comments. The first comment is that we must, in a situation of this kind, always strive to disregard all political considerations, in any case, as far as this is possible, and to give a verdict based on law. The second comment, which is also an idea underlying this report, relates to the concern for equity, balance and equality between MEPs. I think that we attach great importance to this, as well as to the desire to affirm, by adopting this type of position and this type of report, the prerogatives of Parliament and its Members. This is also a point to which we cannot fail to attach great importance, especially since it seeks to harmonise criminal law, something I am hoping and praying for. I would hope that this harmonisation aims to achieve greater freedom, not only for the Members but for all the citizens of the European Union. In this area, however, there is unfortunately still a great deal to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two final comments. The first is that it is always regrettable, in matters relating to freedom of individuals, to favour a collective approach over a personal approach. But the rapporteur is not without good reason. The procedure states that things should be thus and I think that, in relation to issues which concern individuals and their freedom, their situation under the law, we must ensure that the procedures provide for an assessment of each individual case. This avoids a collective approach or a political approach to the problem, even if this has not worked in the case before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">My second and final comment concerns the case of Mr Dell’Utri and I echo the calls that have been made to differentiate this case from others for the reasons that have, quite rightly, been outlined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
