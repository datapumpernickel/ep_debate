<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kindermann </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, this Commission proposal is intended to replace, from 1 January 1999, the existing directive 88/166/EEC on battery cages with a directive on the protection of laying hens kept in a variety of rearing systems. These are only minimum standards. The Commission"s proposal implements the revision clause in Article 9 of the existing directive, whereby, on the basis of a report by the Scientific Veterinary Committee, it must put forward proposals for adaptation to take account of advances in our knowledge. All new rearing systems will have to have nests, perches and litter. Conventional cages without nests and litter may continue, exceptionally, to be permitted by Member States, but they must allow at least 800 cm<span class="sup">2</span> floor area per bird and be at least 50 cm high at all points. Under certain circumstances, old systems may continue in use until 31 December 2008 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee welcomed the Commission proposal because it is a step in the right direction, in other words it seeks to improve the conditions in which laying hens are kept. In the first place, there is the increasing of the minimum floor area per bird from 450 to 800 cm<span class="sup">2</span> , a measure which we particularly welcome, since the widely held view is that the current rules do not allow birds to follow their natural behaviour patterns, with the result that they are not kept in a manner appropriate to their species.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, in formulating minium requirements for other rearing systems, the Commission only went half way. The rules for non‐cage systems in enclosed premises are incomplete, and above all there are no provisions on stocking density. On free‐range farming, there are no provisions at all. We find that unfortunate, since the new directive will mean greater competition between the different rearing systems. We therefore call on the Commission to bring forward a proposal on this shortly. Also regrettable in the committee"s view is the fact that the new ‘enriched" cage with a nestbox, perches and litter, which in future is to be the standard cage, is not defined in detail. I think we have helped to remedy that.</p>
<p class="contents">We also suggested that the date on which the new directive comes into force should be put back by two years, because the timetable envisaged by the Commission is totally unrealistic. By the deadline it is setting, there will not be any cages on the market in the form specified for commercial use. We also want a tighter definition of the Commission"s monitoring activity. This is because if the Commission merely tightens up the conditions for farming and changes the obligation to conduct on‐the‐spot inspections into an option, it is not carrying out its duty to ensure that the directive is complied with throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall move on now to the socio‐economic considerations. In addition to the option of cofinanced investment aids under the efficiency Regulation 950/97/EC, the committee is proposing the introduction of a system of aid which is independent of production, limited in time and paid on a reducing scale. We think this tax mechanism will encourage reluctant Member States to adopt higher standards of animal welfare, and we urge the Council and Commission to consider this proposal closely.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also wants care to be taken to ensure that Community producers are not disadvantaged vis‐à‐vis imports from non‐Union countries. In particular, this means that imports must meet the same animal welfare, veterinary and hygiene standards as EU products. At this point, I should like to add a few words on the demand for a total ban on battery cages, made primarily by animal welfare groups. The committee did not use the term ‘battery cage" in connection with the new proposal for a directive, because it is inadequate and misleading. There are at least three types of cage and each one, including the so‐called ‘enriched" cage, can be used as part of a battery. So the term ‘battery cage" only tells us how the cage is used, but nothing about its dimensions and properties. Our committee therefore suggests that the term ‘conventional cages" should be used to describe the cages defined in the current directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the October 1996 report of the Scientific Veterinary Committee concludes that ‘because of its small size and barrenness, the battery cage as used at present has inherent severe disadvantages for the welfare of hens." But the key words here are ‘at present", because the Veterinary Committee also says that alternative farming systems have serious disadvantages due to the risk of pecking and cannibalism ...</p>

<p class="contents">The life‐sized photograph I have brought with me tonight from a national newspaper showing the realities of space that are allowed by a conventional or battery cage says more than many hours of debate here possibly could. Sadly, my committee is of the opinion that without financial measures in Member States to assist producers to move to alternative methods, it is unlikely the welcome aims of the directive will be effectively met. They meet neither the aspirations of those seeking to achieve the best possible welfare standards, nor provide a realistic framework for EU egg producers to remain competitive or change rearing methods and retain sustainable employment levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In those circumstance, the committee gave priority to tackling the inherent severe disadvantages as quoted in the report of the battery system and therefore calls for an EU‐wide ban on the use of such cages to be implemented as soon as possible but together with appropriate financial measures to be put in place by Member States with support from the Commission for alternative systems and relevant studies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also urged to take a strong negotiating position at the forthcoming WTO negotiations on equal welfare conditions for imported eggs, and particularly egg products, in line with the recommendation of the Commission Egg and Poultry Advisory Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in conclusion, I hope that tomorrow Parliament will adopt amendments such as Nos 50 and 92 tabled by my colleague Mr Watts and others and that the passage of Mr Kindermann's good report, thus amended, will be seen as a positive step towards the end of these cages – however we describe them – in the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Watts </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his report and for the constructive and comprehensive way in which he has tackled this very sensitive and controversial issue. Like him, I welcome the Commission proposal to reform the battery cage system. There appears to be recognition across the board that the existing battery cage system has got to go. Whilst the proposal, from my point of view, does not go far enough, it signals the end of the existing battery cage system of production. And about time too!</p>
<p class="contents">According to the European Commission's own Scientific Veterinary Committee, the battery cage system has – and my colleague Clive Needle just referred to this – ’inherent severe disadvantages for the welfare of hens". Only yesterday a new report highlighted the pitiful plight of the battery hen, crammed into a cage at just 18 weeks, no room to flap its wings, not enough room to stand fully upright, not able to scratch, doze or bathe. After a year, at the end of their working lives, the scrawny near‐naked birds are slaughtered and turned into pies, soup or petfood. One in three of these birds sent for slaughter have fresh broken bones and almost all birds suffer from osteoporosis. The cage is factory farming at its very worst.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we believe the cage system to be cruel we should ban it completely. My amendments and those of other colleagues seek to do just that. By 2009 the battery cage system of egg production will be no more. A ten‐year phase‐out is the best way of promoting the welfare of laying hens. A ten‐year phase‐out is fair on the industry with a clear and certain future to plan for. That future is free‐range production. In Britain it works. It protects the welfare of the hen; it is profitable and it is popular. 89 % of the British public believe keeping hens in small cages in cruel. Almost half of all Britain's households now buy barn or free‐range eggs. Some supermarkets like Marks &amp; Spencers have banned battery cage eggs completely and now only sell free‐range eggs. This is the cruelty‐free future we should all plan for and I hope we will all vote for tomorrow.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sonneveld </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the new directive on battery cages is a political issue of the first rank. We get a great many reactions on this from the public. But it is also relevant to the farming operations from which many EU poultry farmers derive their living.</p>
<p class="contents">This latter fact means that we must take care over our legislative work and give producers a powerful incentive to review their systems of production in such a way as to ensure a higher level of animal welfare in farms which are economically viable in the European Union. That must never mean an approach which forces all EU poultry farmers to switch to free‐range egg production, even though this method is set to become increasingly important. An alternative must remain in place, whereby birds are kept in greatly improved cages. Tests on systems of this kind show that their quality of life is much better. The Scientific Veterinary Committee will have to give a ruling on this too, and other aspects will have to be considered such as environmental considerations and the working conditions of poultry farmers. If we want these greatly improved systems to take off in the very near future, we must make it more expensive to keep laying hens in conventional battery cages by significantly increasing the statutory number of square centimetres required per bird.</p>
<p class="contents">Whichever of the two production methods the European poultry farmer opts for in the next few years, in the interests of fair competition we shall also have to take full account of the conditions in which imported eggs are produced, whether fresh or as egg products. What we must resist is any threat of a total ban, from a given date onwards, on the whole system of keeping hens in cages, even greatly improved cages.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the PPE Group will be supporting the line of the Kindermann report. We do so with grateful thanks to the rapporteur. We greatly appreciated his expert guidance as we tackled this subject.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mulder </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, to start with I must compliment Mr Kindermann on his report and on all his hard work. I think he has produced a good report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group believes, in the first place, that in this case we should have not a directive, but a regulation. We think it is most important to have this proposal acted on in the same way in all the countries of the European Union. We cannot have certain countries falling short of the requirements. So that is one important argument which the Liberals wish to express.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I have rarely received as much post as I have in recent weeks on this matter. My group has always been in favour of consumers deciding what they want to eat, and if they want to eat eggs from cages with a larger floor area, then we are very much in favour of that. In this respect, we therefore support the Kindermann report"s advocacy of 800 cm<span class="sup">2</span> , rather than the 450 cm<span class="sup">2</span> which are the rule at present.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that as much research as possible is needed in the meantime into alternative systems. We shall look with great interest at the Commission"s reports on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing we do not like. In the USA, a major exporter to Europe, the area for laying hens is 350 cm<span class="sup">2</span> . And no one in America is making any fuss about it. It is of course totally unfair competition if American eggs are imported free of any restriction under the WTO rules, and we strongly urge the Commission to raise this issue forcefully at the WTO talks. We have to have fair conditions of competition. We are very much in favour of mandatory labelling. The customer has to be able to make a choice. We hope that they will do exactly what they tell us in their letters.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, my group will be divided in its vote on Mr Watts"s amendment seeking to have all battery hens banned from 2009.</p>

And Mr Kindermann"s honest and well‐intentioned report will certainly do nothing to change that, because all it achieves is better cages and then only in ten years" time. What we want is no cages at all, and I therefore hope that the amendments tabled by my honourable friend Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf will be approved tomorrow, because until we stop thinking of animals just as commodities with a sell‐by date, supplying us with products as cheaply as possible, we shall not have decent and appropriate methods of animal husbandry. We really must start seeing animals as they really are, namely living creatures, and not commodities to be used and then discarded at will.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the House to vote for our amendments tomorrow. It would also be very beneficial to consumers if we do so, in the interests of health. Only decent and appropriate methods of livestock management will produce healthy products.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Nicholson </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – Mr President, I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. It is a subject that causes great concern to many people. It is extremely difficult to achieve the necessary balance between all the elements involved and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development amendments are just about as good as we can achieve at this moment in time. I know some will want to go further and much faster. But I do not believe that we are in the right position to do so at present. In the long term we must aim to achieve the ultimate. This can only be achieved in cooperation with the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that the industry is in a profitable position for these new regulations and others that will be required in the future which are extremely expensive to implement and to carry through. The industry is in no fit position at this present moment in time to take on board the challenge that has been presented to it. Profit margins are low. I would support the amendment to provide assistance to modernise but with no expansion through increased numbers of birds within the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be very conscious as we burden our industry with extra costs that other world producers will not have the same criteria or pressures. We have witnessed this in the pig industry, the beef industry and the milk industry. I know it is a hobby‐horse of mine but I firmly believe that if we in the European Union are going to set down such strict criteria and tie the hands of our producers so tightly then we must not allow imports into the European Union that fall below the criteria under which are expected to produce. That must be the bottom line.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commissioner to stand firmly behind the producers in the European Union because, while we will respond to him and the producers will respond to him, he must defend them against the world when it tries to take over our markets.</p>

Naturally, I welcome the Commission"s initiative to improve things and draw up a new directive, but that is not enough. Even the Scientific Veterinary Committee agrees that the current method of keeping birds in cages is particularly problematic. I think it is an especially cruel form of livestock management which should be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course perches, litter, baths and nestboxes are an improvement, but are we not once again encouraging producers to invest money which will very soon prove to have been wasted? The fact is that more and more consumers throughout Europe are calling for a blanket ban on cages. This will come, the only question is when.</p>
<p class="contents">We have 250 million hens in conventional cages, and only eight million free‐range hens. Certainly we cannot change that overnight, but we can change it in maybe eight, nine or ten years, and the amendments tabled by Mr Ebner, Mr Watts and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf are all aimed at achieving that. Europe"s farmers have enough land to make the change, and the extra jobs will no doubt be easy to fill! And battery farming cannot be healthy. These poor hens usually die after a year, they last no longer than that, whereas a normal chicken usually lives for four to five years.</p>
<p class="contents">The extra cost to the consumer of an appropriate system of poultry management is estimated by the Commission – and for this too we thank them – at two euros per person per year. Anyone who has ever seen a battery cage operation goes right off eggs for a very long time! But the enlightened, informed consumer is perfectly willing to pay a little more and – once again I quote the Commission here – wants to see cages scrapped. Please vote tomorrow in favour of Amendments Nos 52, 62 and 67. You will all find that your breakfast egg tastes a little better!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Tamino </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, it is as well to bear in mind that the current legislation on laying hens goes back to 1988 and should have been revised in 1993. So this debate is taking place at least five years late, and yet the revision proposed by the Commission, which ought to guarantee both the welfare of the animals and the quality of the product, is not at all satisfactory. The extraordinary logic underlying the rearing of laying hens in batteries will be recalled: they are no longer regarded as living creatures but as objects, industrial machines, parts of a production line. Unfortunately, 93 % of eggs are produced like this in Europe, but the consumer does not know that the eggs he buys come from egg factories, where the hens are kept in narrow cages, piled up to ten storeys, like a sort of concentration camp. There are four or five hens in each cage, they cannot spread their wings or scratch the ground or perform any of the activities typical of their natural behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">But a few extra square centimetres do not solve the problem. That is why the Greens urge all colleagues to support the amendments tabled with a view to eliminating cages over the next few years and proposing free range rearing at a density compatible with the characteristics of these birds, a law which is, moreover, already in force in Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally we support the request to the Commission to make it compulsory, as soon as possible, to label eggs so that the consumer will know how the hens laying them are reared.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sandbæk </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I find it deeply depressing when animal welfare is only taken really seriously in this Parliament when it is a question of fox trapping or seal hunting and when it is indigenous populations who have to pay the price with their own welfare, which is sometimes even more precarious than that of the animals. We have 70 amendments to a report on chickens, seeking to improve conditions for laying hens, in particular by imposing requirements for more space and stimulus. This is somewhat illogical when what really disrupts the welfare of the hens is that they cannot satisfy the particular egg‐laying needs which are natural to them. And that will not be altered by giving the hens more space, which will only help to legitimise the situation for many years to come. We should be more ambitious than that. We should of course in the long term ban battery cages for laying hens. In order to minimise the disadvantages for the egg producers, we could pay transitional premiums for a switch to alternative production systems. Neither the Commission paper nor the Kindermann report contained proposals for such a ban. I can therefore only urge everyone to support the amendments which seek to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU wants to speak up in the forthcoming WTO negotiations for including animal welfare in world trade, a domestic ban on battery cages would undeniably strengthen the EU's credibility and hence its negotiating position. As a next‐best solution, the Commission's proposal for compulsory labelling of the production system used should be welcomed. All the indications are that a great many consumers are willing to pay extra and choose alternatively produced eggs. But that is only possible if the market is transparent. For example, the designation ‘fresh eggs' is confusing. All eggs should be fresh. Besides, these eggs do not come from free‐range hens, as some may be tempted to believe. In Denmark, a labelling scheme of this kind specifying the production system was recently introduced, and there was a marked shift in consumer choice, since it was then clear which eggs were from battery hens. Politically aware consumers are generally far more responsible than politicians. The committee's proposal that labelling should also include egg products is a good step in the direction of better consumer information, and the proposal that the new minimum requirements should also apply to imports from third countries needs to be supported.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pinel </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should not just improve battery rearing, we should ban it. If we look at battery rearing in general, we can see that firstly it destroys biodiversity, secondly it destroys jobs and rural employment in particular and thirdly it constitutes a real hell on earth for these poor birds.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally cannot accept billions of hens spending their unfortunate lives in a space smaller than a shoebox. These birds also have to live through having their beaks being cut, their decalcified skeletons fracturing repeatedly and the skin being burnt from their feet and abdomen by the ammonia from their droppings. How can we talk about quality after that? Finally, at about the age of one year when their production drops, they are gathered together in scandalous conditions and piled up for their final journey. On arriving at the abattoir, one in three have broken feet. As with sows, their sorry state means that their flesh cannot be sold, even in pieces. They will end up as the filling for ravioli or in stock cubes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a fourth aspect which should be decisive in this dossier and which should result – if we are fortunate enough to live in an intelligent economic and social system – in a total and definitive ban on this type of rearing. This fourth aspect is the health of consumers. Here are birds which eat flavourless food with no consistency but which is loaded with hormones, if only natural hormones resulting from the animal"s stress, and antibiotics whose improper use has significantly contributed, through a process of habituation, to penicillin‐based antibiotics becoming ineffective in humans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that these diabolical methods and this gigantic‐scale production do not benefit consumers, who are entitled to expect more than poor quality food full of water and medicines, or producers, who can only watch as prices crash with the resulting risks of bankruptcy, or of course the animals who are the first victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is obvious but it goes against the interests of the large multinationals. Priority must be given to a system which is healthy, which creates jobs and which is capable of revitalising the rural environment. Basically, priority must be given to everything which is contrary to the concept of meat factories. We need free range rearing where the hens can wander across grass and gravel. We need quality products which obviously are a little more expensive, by say two euros per person per year, but which will reduce the social burden and medical costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should not forget that one of the basic elements at stake in this type of dossier is quite simply the future of the rural environment.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Dam </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we should ‘go to work on an egg", as the advert has it. For many Europeans, a hen"s egg is a welcome part of their breakfast. But increasingly, they have cause to wonder about the conditions in which that egg is produced. Animal welfare organisations have enlightened us on the subject. Thousands of laying hens, shut up in iron coops with no freedom to move, that is an appalling thought.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, consumers" purchasing behaviour does not change to reflect their concern. Because more humanely produced eggs cost slightly more, many people continue to buy eggs from battery hens. In our relatively prosperous Europe, it is all the more surprising, since the price of eggs in the last few decades has risen very little and they have thus effectively become cheaper. Ten or so eggs will cost you just one euro, a price by weight which few foods can rival. That exceptionally low price is only possible thanks to mass production on as small a surface area as possible. I am convinced that the economic motive is out of place here. Animals are part of God"s creation; they may be subordinate to man, but they still deserve a decent and appropriate quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996, the Scientific Veterinary Committee reported on the welfare of laying hens. On the basis of that report, the European Commission has proposed new minimum standards. I agree with the rapporteur that this proposal is a step in the right direction, but no more than that. Battery cages must be got rid of entirely, and the sooner the better.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing a lengthy transitional period, so that existing batteries may remain in use for a further ten years. But there are amendments seeking to stretch that period further, and even to allow new battery cages to be introduced for a further two years. Given that producers have known for years that new standards were coming, I think that is an ill‐judged concession.</p>
<p class="contents">Imports from countries whose systems are even less kind to animals must not lead to distortions of competition. Producers who switch to animal‐friendly systems must not suffer financially as a result. Getting rid of battery cages is a matter of civilised behaviour. And we must make sure that once they are scrapped in the European Union, they are not then reassembled in countries outside the Union. I therefore urge the Commission to consider, as part of its interim reporting, the possibility of a scheme for dismantling battery cages, tied to the provision of aid for systems of production which allow the birds their proper dignity.</p>

As long as cages continue to be used, even if they are bigger and fitted with a perch, we cannot really speak of appropriate methods of keeping these birds. The European Parliament ought to prove that it wants no half‐hearted compromises in matters of animal welfare, and it should vote for those amendments which seek to have the cage system done away with altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that 93 % of eggs produced for consumption in the EU come from battery cages must not stand in the way of a ban on this shameful form of mass animal torment. Rather, this figure proves that the European consumer is not sufficiently aware of animal welfare issues, or of questions of product quality.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fischler, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must thank Mr Kindermann for his extremely competent and detailed report. I am happy to see that Parliament"s basic position on the protection of laying hens kept in various systems of rearing is the same as that of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What objective is the Commission pursuing with the proposal we are debating here today? Firstly, a real improvement in the welfare of laying hens on the basis of scientific knowledge. The present system of battery cages is very much a candidate for being improved or replaced. Secondly, in order to facilitate the switch to methods of rearing which are more appropriate to the basic needs of laying hens, we wish to ensure that the minimum standards result in production costs which are comparable for the various alternative methods of rearing and the improved battery cage system.</p>
<p class="contents">Acceptable systems are non‐cage systems and so‐called ‘enriched" cages. These are enriched in the sense that they have not only perches, as already mentioned, but above all nestboxes and scratching areas. Thirdly, a ten‐year transitional period is envisaged for existing barns, but new and converted barns will have to meet the new standards straight away.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the directive will be revised after seven years to take account of any further scientific progress. Egg labelling will be mandatory. Let me comment now on the amendments which have been tabled. In drafting its proposal, the Commission took due account of jobs, the environment, health and the economy. Amendment No 1 is therefore consistent with the Commission"s thinking and we accept it. This does not apply, however, to Amendments Nos 20, 21, 45, 51 and 61. Amendment No 10 represents an improvement in the wording and seeks better protection for poultry. So this amendment too is acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal amounts to the same thing as Parliament"s Amendment No 13, but this amendment can also be accepted as it makes the text clearer. Amendment No 15 is acceptable, since the provisions on feed and water systems in the Commission proposal relate to cages. In systems other than cages, however, the space per hen can be reduced. The distinction between single‐floor cages and multi‐floor systems is perfectly acceptable. So Amendments Nos 16 to 19 can also be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 22, 23 and 29 are also acceptable. These are improvements to the Commission proposal. The remaining amendments are not acceptable to the Commission for the following reasons: Amendments Nos 2, 37(3) and 36, 42, 59, 69 and 70 are not consistent with Community policy. As for Amendments Nos 5, 38 and 55, current WTO rules do not allow the Community to use animal welfare provisions as an instrument of trade. As you know, however, the Commission is considering whether, at the forthcoming round of WTO negotiations, animal welfare provisions might be introduced as a new element in the WTO"s terms of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 4, 54, 57 and 68 are superfluous to this proposal. Amendments Nos 6, 12, 43, 44, 45, 51, 58, 63, 64 and 65 have no scientific basis, and our proposals have to be constructed on a scientific basis. Amendment No 8 is linked to Amendments Nos 24 to 28, 30, 32 and 33. These, together with Amendments Nos 9, 14, 46, 49 and 56, do not constitute improvements of any kind and therefore cannot be accepted. Amendment No 7 clearly concerns a linguistic problem, because this amendment corresponds exactly to the English text of the Commission"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 50, 52, 60, 62, 66 and 67 are premature in the Commission"s view, since the matter concerned is still under discussion. It is therefore a good idea to postpone the date of the directive"s entry into force. This then makes Amendment No 11 and the related Amendments Nos 31, 34, 35, 39, 40, 41, 47 and 48 perfectly acceptable. Finally, I agree with the view that a directive is preferable to a regulation, and consequently I cannot accept Amendment No 53.</p>
