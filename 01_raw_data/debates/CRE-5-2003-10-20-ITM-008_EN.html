<p class="contents">The Commission will, of course, write to the United Kingdom authorities as a matter of urgency to check whether there are any problems of compatibility with Community law. Let me assure Parliament at the outset that, as European Commissioner for the Environment, I simply do not believe that it makes sense to tow these contaminated ships across the Atlantic to the United Kingdom. Facilities for recycling them already exist in the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned by information from third parties that suggest that the ships may leak oil, PCBs and asbestos. Four ships have already left the United States and nine more are to follow. Two ships left two weeks ago and two ships left last week. An American court has issued a temporary restraining order regarding the nine remaining ships, and a final decision is awaited.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the US authorities have voluntarily agreed not to send these remaining nine ships until March next year. If this is confirmed, I welcome the postponement, but I believe it should be more than just a postponement. All of the ships should remain in the US for environmentally sound dismantling, according to the proximity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, and quite apart from this specific case, I am also concerned about the environmental and human health problems related to ship breaking, in particular the implications for non-OECD countries. Our estimate suggests that around 2 200 ships will be phased out altogether and scrapped as a result of the follow-up to the Prestige disaster and the phasing- out of single-hulled ships. We cannot dump this environmental problem on developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Dismantling of ships is often undertaken under operating conditions that, from an environmental, health and safety perspective, cannot be considered sound. Unfortunately, it is the case that EU-owned and/or -flagged ships are also dismantled under such conditions. The parties to the Basel Convention, which deals with the control and management of hazardous waste including old ships, are meeting this week in Geneva to discuss this issue among others. I met with the secretariat of the Basel Convention this week to discuss the issue, and I am reassured that we will make progress there in addressing the issues before us.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are committed to developing an ambitious new European strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment, I do not believe that we should run the risks associated with transporting these ships across the Atlantic. In the light of the Erika and Prestige disasters, we need a precautionary approach to protecting this most fragile resource.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I put to Parliament the question I put to the UK authorities last week. Would it not make more sense to send British expertise in the other direction, across the Atlantic? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you ask the intelligence services about the current state of play, a whole load of questions are raised. Let me say at the outset that – unlike you, Commissioner – I am not fundamentally opposed to European shipyards, which are undergoing a major crisis, specialising in scrapping thousands of ships from throughout the world, and doing so under strict environmental constraints, a situation utterly different from that which currently – and lamentably – prevails in India, where the worst conceivable environmental dumping is going on and endangering people’s health to a substantial degree. We certainly do not want that. It naturally follows that we have a lot of questions to put to the British government, but, in its absence, I will use you as my mouthpiece and ask whether these are actually warships. The reason I ask this is that I have had widely divergent information. I am given to understand that warships can be scrapped only in the United States. Or are they vessels used for transport and commercial purposes? How was the transaction conducted? Did one government deal directly with the other, or were international middlemen involved? What we need to know is why the work was not done in the United States. Moving ships across the North Atlantic costs money, of course, and there are enormous risks involved. Was it factored in to the calculations that one or other ship might sink? That would have been a catastrophe of the sort that one would rather not talk about.</p>
<p class="contents">Without wishing to tread on anyone’s toes, my second question is whether the country for which the ships were destined possesses the necessary infrastructures. Does it have the infrastructures for putting a ship in dry dock, and so on? These, Commissioner, are questions for you to answer; questions that you, as you have just mentioned, should concern yourself with. Is all this in accordance with the Basel Convention on the Export of Waste? We know, of course, that the Americans did not sign it. These questions all call for serious scrutiny before we can come to a conclusion, but, all things considered, I would not want to exclude the possibility of Europeans offering such services to a very high environmental standard. Whether or not a ship is towed across the Atlantic, whether or not it is possible to do that – these are questions to be considered by the experts. Our approach to this topic should be highly critical, but very much in our interests as an industrialised continent, and we cannot of course accept it being confused with other matters. All this I have said in order to drop a hint, and I hope that the interpreters understand what I mean by that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My reasons for taking a decidedly sceptical view of the whole business have to do with considerations of environmental policy. As Commissioner Wallström said, this is where it is enormously important that the proximity principle should apply. Surely, I would think, a country such as the USA must be able to lay its hands on the know-how and the technology to dismantle old ships – whether they be warships or mercantile vessels. Mr Bowe is shaking his head, but I believe that a country that calls itself the best democracy in the world must be able to deal with its own problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like you to tell me, Commissioner, whether this discussion included any reference to the possibility of involving the non-OECD countries, where there is, of course, a great danger of enormous damage to health and the environment. The ‘polluter pays’ principle should also apply here. I would like to conclude by re-emphasising that I am very satisfied with your statement, and that I believe that the proximity principle must apply in such a serious case as this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also very pleased with the statement that the Commissioner has made here, which has filled us with hope.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear, however, that the steaming of the two ships to the United Kingdom is part of a bigger plan to set up a larger waste merry-go-round to countries such as India and Bangladesh. If these ships are allowed to cross the Atlantic, then this opens up the floodgates and sets a precedent. After that, it will be legally possible, against the spirit of the Basel Convention, to ship waste to countries that do not have a sound social or environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, all kinds of attempts have been made to prevent the export of waste and achieve a system whereby waste is processed as close to source as possible. Having ships cross the sea in this way is diametrically contrary to this. This is a very negative message from the United States, which has already put a few environmental treaties on ice. Surely that country has sufficient capacity and expertise at its disposal to scrap these ships itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not point the finger only at the United States. It does, of course, have the cooperation of an EU Member State, which thus becomes, at the very least, an accessory to the enfeeblement of the Basel Convention. Moreover, that country has mapped out a course for these high-risk ships, as a result of which other Member States are put at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look for yet other accomplices, we end up once again with the International Maritime Organisation, which offers little in the way of cooperation when it comes to enforcing compliance with the Basel Convention. It is high time this changed. For this, the EU must adopt a united stance.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, too, exports old ships to the South for scrap, without their dangerous waste being processed first. A list is currently circulating of 144 ships that are ready for scrapping in the South.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore relying on the Commission to create a legal framework as soon as possible in order to put a stop to this. We would thus ask for a maintenance policy for European end-of-life vessels. On 27 October, the Council of Environment Ministers will be holding a meeting. This is, therefore, a good opportunity to give a warning shot and take a legislative initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that the United Kingdom is acting in an extraordinarily irresponsible way in undertaking contracts to have ships of this kind brought across the Atlantic to be allegedly recycled in British ports.</p>
<p class="contents">One has to ask what will happen to the hazardous waste that we are told makes up a significant proportion of these ships. We are led to believe that something like over 300 tonnes of PCBs and 600 tonnes of asbestos are contained in the four ships that are currently on their way to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">There are questions as to whether in fact the United Kingdom is in breach of EU regulations. The Commissioner has also already indicated that she has requested the UK authorities to indicate whether or not they believe they are still in compliance with EU laws. My understanding from the briefings I have received is that there is a requirement to have such ships dealt with within a period of 180 days. There is a requirement to have a dry dock basin available for the dismantling of these ships, but it is unlikely that they can be dealt with in 180 days and indeed there is no dry dock basin available for the recycling of these ships.</p>
<p class="contents">There are very serious questions here, Commissioner, and I do not consider it sufficient for you to say simply that you have asked the UK authorities. When will they reply? When will action be taken to protect the citizens of the UK, as well as the citizens of Ireland and elsewhere?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are going to have arguments here about jobs in the UK. If we look back over history we have heard arguments that we could not abolish slavery or the sending of children up chimneys because we would lose jobs if we ended those practices. The environment is more important at this stage than a few hundred jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely appalling that the United Kingdom is allowing itself to be a dumping ground for something that the United States did not want to deal with. The authorities there deemed these vessels to be too dangerous to break up in the US and it seems to me quite incredible that they would then be transported 4 500 miles across the Atlantic and through EU waters to be disposed of in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">Originally the plan was for the vessels to pass through Irish waters but at the moment it seems that is not the case. We are not sure whether we can be guaranteed that the routes will not change, but irrespective of that we have to look at our commitment, and the UK has to look at its commitment, to EU legislation – in particular the waste shipment regulation. I would like to ask the Commission whether the UK's action is in breach of Article 19(3) of the waste shipment regulation and Article 4 of the waste framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Natura 2000, the Teesmouth and Cleveland coasts have been classified as special protection areas under that programme. This means, for the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna, that any plan or project not directly connected with, or necessary for the management of, the site, but which is likely to have a significant effect thereon – either individually or in combination with other plans or projects – shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implications on the site.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission to investigate – or maybe it has already done this – whether the transportation and treatment of these ships is in breach of Natura 2000 legislation. What the UK is doing in relation not only to the UK coast but also in relation to the EU as a whole is completely unacceptable. We have just debated the bathing water directive and it is quite incredible to think that we are talking here about a Member State of the EU irresponsibly posing a major threat to our bathing waters and also to our fishing industry. What will happen, who will compensate people if there is an accident, if there is a disaster involving fisheries, tourism or any other issue?</p>
<p class="contents">This is actually about protecting jobs that already exist and about protecting our environment and indeed our fishing industry. I am very glad to see that the Commission is on our side on this, but it needs to put much more pressure on the British Government to behave in a responsible manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very difficult to work out whether there are any facts amongst all that fiction. There has been a complete cloud of confusion, and indeed a cloud of confusion that now has an odour of hypocrisy about it that I cannot believe.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the facts. Those ships are dry cargo ships, they are not war vessels. Those ships do not contain any more toxic materials than any other normal cargo ship. The only asbestos on them is the asbestos you would find around any engine on any ship. The only oil on them is the oil you would find in the tanks that fuel them – they are not petrol tankers. They have very little in the way of PCBs and other hazardous substances. They have a seaworthiness certificate which was granted to them before they left harbour – and they would not have left harbour unless they had it.</p>
<p class="contents">The States whose waters they pass through on the way have been consulted and their views taken into account. We are doing this properly and we are doing it because we decided ten years ago not to dump our oil rigs into the North Sea, but to bring them back to Teesside and other places and recycle them. We have the capacities. We have the knowledge. We have the capabilities to do what the Americans cannot do, because they dump their oil rigs into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner should be asking what is going to happen to the 100 and more ships that are leaving EU waters this year to be dumped and destroyed in the Third World in a totally unacceptable manner, rather than making remarks about things being done properly by the British. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I put this in the bigger context of the responsibility we have under the Basel Convention – we have to be able to fulfil the requirements of that Convention. This is part of the much bigger picture.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right to point out the need for accurate information. That is why I have written to both the UK Government and authorities and also to the US, in order to gather the correct information. What I have been able to find out so far is that these 13 vessels are part of the national defence reserve fleet administered by the Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD). I also understand that all these ships were built between 1945 and 1967, so are between 36 and 58 years old. They are estimated to contain in total 698 tonnes of PCBs and more than 3 300 tonnes of fuel oil, as well as substantial amounts of lead, cadmium and asbestos. These ships are owned by the United States military administration and are no longer in operation. MARAD has reported many of the ships to be in a deteriorating condition. Eleven of the 13 ships figure on their priority list of the 40 ships in the worst condition. That is what I have been able to find out so far. Let us wait until we have all the information.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I am not against the shipment of waste for the purpose of recycling. This is part of the existing legislation. But, at a time when we have fought so hard to clean up after the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and <span class="italic">Erika</span> accidents, along with other pollution accidents at sea, and when we are struggling to protect the marine environment, I do not see that this is the best way forward, when, apparently, there are recycling facilities in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I have asked for. We should make sure that this is an absolutely safe operation before we embark on it. Is this wise overall? Is it common sense to do this, with the risks involved in towing these old ships – the oldest ships they have – containing so many dangerous substances?</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, we do not have a legal case against the United Kingdom. It is important to say that. We are looking at compliance with the existing directives that relate to Natura 2000, the Water Framework Directive and a number of other directives. Of course we will follow up the complaint we have received.</p>
<p class="contents">I am responding as the Environment Commissioner. Is this the best thing we can do at a time when we are trying to protect our seas, waters and marine environment? If we know that facilities exist, according to the proximity principle, in the United States, then why not send experts in the other direction. That seems less dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">As yet we do not have a legal case. We have asked for more information. But I cannot hide my own views on this particular issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
