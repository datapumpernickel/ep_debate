<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, you wanted us once again to review the progress of negotiations in the WTO on what is known as the Doha Development Agenda following the period of reflection, work and consultation that the Commission undertook after the collapse of the talks in Cancún. It is clear that since we last debated this, just after Cancún on 24 September, the situation has changed, both in the Union and in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">I will address three aspects of the post-Cancún process: our policy following the Commission’s November communication and the General Affairs Council; the situation in the WTO since 15 December and, finally, the prospects for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us first turn our attention to our own policy. As you are aware, after Cancún, the Commission embarked on a phase of in-depth reflection and consultation of Parliament, the Member States, the social partners and civil society. All of this led, in mid-November, to a communication on relaunching the negotiating process, which we still believe to be of the utmost importance for the European Union. You received that communication. It has been debated in your committee that deals with external trade issues and has been discussed bilaterally with a number of your political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me sum up this policy as it stands today. It is clear. Above all, we remain firmly attached to multilateralism. This remains the top priority of the Union’s trade policy and we want negotiations to resume as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substance, we have adopted a more flexible position on the so-called Singapore issues, which will please a number of the groups in this Parliament. We have also adopted a more flexible approach towards geographical indications and even the environment, so as to facilitate the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">On agriculture, we have reiterated our desire to inject momentum into these long, drawn-out negotiations, if only because since implementing our own reforms we have the means to make an active contribution to them. At long last, the European Union is no longer on the defensive here.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now say a word on the state of play in the WTO, in particular since work resumed on 15 December. The good news is that although Cancún had revealed slight differences of opinion, indeed even some substantial ones, on the need to pursue these negotiations, now everyone in the WTO agrees that it is important to resume them. We all agree that the world will probably be a worse place without a negotiated outcome than with one, which is an important political motivation. That is the good news! Nevertheless, will this mean that negotiations will proceed at a pace that will, in our view, make it possible for ambitious objectives to be achieved in 2004? It is still too early to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me move on to the third point, the prospects for the negotiations in 2004. The real challenge is not, I believe, to restart the discussions. There is agreement on this point and the process is underway. The real challenge is to make them proceed at a good pace and with the necessary energy and ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to spend a month or two on technical issues in Geneva. It is absolutely essential that this technical phase leads as soon as possible to a political phase, which will enable the various ministers to reiterate their positions on the timetable and the content of the final negotiations. The European Union has been working hard on this since mid-December.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased to have been joined since the end of last week by the Americans, because my American counterpart has stated that he wishes to see a definite relaunch of the work in Geneva and has indicated, as we had done in our turn, that there is room for flexibility on some points. This is, I believe, a welcome initiative. It means that we can correct an increasingly widespread impression that, because 2004 is an election year in the United States, these negotiations would be, as it were, put on the backburner for the duration. Fortunately, my American counterpart has disabused us of this pessimistic notion.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we going to be doing in the coming weeks? Firstly, we are going to continue our dialogue with the developing countries, and in particular with countries in the G20 and G90. I myself took the initiative by travelling to Latin America in mid-December and we are going to pursue the dialogue that was, I think, begun to good effect on that occasion. The same goes for the G90. Next week I will be in Bangladesh, India and Indonesia to work on these various issues with countries that are clearly crucial negotiating partners.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said a moment ago, what is vital now is to see whether we can move forward quickly on agriculture, industrial tariffs, services and the Singapore issues that we consider to be priorities, that is trade facilitation and the transparency of public procurement. My feeling is that everyone, at least the United States and Europe, has sufficient room for manoeuvre. We now need to ensure that Brazil, South Africa, India, China and our Japanese friends invest as much energy in these negotiations as we are prepared to.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the message on which I would like to hear your views, the Commission’s message, is that we hope that in 2004 we will be able to make up for a large part of what we were unable to achieve in 2003 in Cancún, and we think we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have heard about the steps that the Commission has taken to relaunch the negotiations, and I am sure you were disappointed to learn that the members of the WTO, as long ago as December, were unable to resume negotiations on the development agenda. What went on in the run-up to the Geneva meeting on 15 December gave me the impression that this failure had to do, among other things, with the nature of the proceedings. The WTO members did not negotiate directly with one another, but everything was done through the mediation of the chairman of the WTO’s General Council, and this way of going about things was certainly not particularly conducive to agreement. I became all the more convinced of this when, shortly afterwards, in the margins of the FAO Conference in Rome, I met many ministers who also regretted the absence of any direct contact, which they said they would have expected.</p>
<p class="contents">I have come to the conclusion that, if there is to be agreement, there is in any case an absolute need for more dialogue and for more intensive efforts among the members of the WTO. As Mr Lamy has already said, we will, for our part, be doing everything possible to ensure that 2004 is not a wasted year. We will be playing a particularly active part in this.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the subject matter of the negotiations, I have to say that we cannot accept any and every framework for negotiation modalities at any price. We see it as a fundamental condition that such a framework should reflect the spirit and content of the Doha Declaration. Among other things, one primary requirement is that there should be tighter restrictions on ‘amber box’ measures than on ‘blue box’ measures, which distort trade to a lesser extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when considering export competition, all forms of export subsidy must be tackled in parallel. You will be aware that we have gone on the offensive in the debate about export subsidies, by proposing that all forms of export subsidy for a range of products important to developing countries be allowed to expire. We are still waiting for a response to this offer. At the same time, we cannot but note the continuing lack of willingness to make comparable commitments in respect of other forms of export subsidy; as far as I am aware, for example, the Canadian Wheat Board was compensated for its latest losses by the Canadian Government. Another example is Argentina, which uses differentiated export duties on soya beans and soya bean flour as a means of indirectly subsidising the building of its largest soya mill. The USA continues to use supplies of food aid as a means of reducing its surpluses. From the very outset, we have made it plain that all measures to deal with export competition must be dealt with simultaneously and that they must all exercise discipline to the same degree. This is something on which we will continue to work.</p>

The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats greatly appreciates your commitment and your efforts, which must be aimed at making 2004 a greater success than 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the Commissioner’s view that we need to give the Member States more information with regard to the offer made by the European Union in the field of agriculture. It was already evident in Cancún that people did not believe it, and I think that it is useful and necessary to go further towards explaining that offer. It strikes me that, whilst it is true that Mr Zoellick is making a great gesture, it is still unclear what exactly he is proposing. We do of course welcome the increased flexibility on this point that is now being shown by the US Government, but the question that I should like to ask both Commissioners is as follows: does that also apply to cotton, for example? I ask this because, as far as I know, the position of the United States regarding cotton is still fairly rigid. Perhaps you could tell us a little more about this?</p>
<p class="contents">I am also wondering to what extent Japan is currently prepared to relax its policy with regard to rice, because, as you know, the subject of rice was another of the obstacles in Cancún. Perhaps you would also like to give us some further details on this?</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes that the offer we have made in the field of agriculture, which even includes the possibility of reducing export subsidies to virtually zero, and now also an increased flexibility regarding geographical indications, is sufficient for us to go into the negotiations. We also welcome the fact that the offer is being seen in a wider perspective and that we are not only looking at agriculture, but also at services and the Singapore issues. Unfortunately, we shall also have to accept that there is an inherent degree of flexibility, but I think that the package now before us should offer sufficient scope to get the negotiations off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that is tending to fall by the wayside is the whole debate on a kind of reform of the WTO. We all know that Cancún also revealed that the organisation cannot carry on functioning the way it is now doing. I hope that this is also included in the package, therefore. The question that Commissioner Lamy asked us was whether we would give him free rein to enter into the negotiations with the package as he proposed it. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I can give him a straightforward answer: yes, we believe he can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Restarting the Doha Development Agenda promptly is in the interests of economic recovery in Europe. Restarting it promptly is in the interests of all parts of the world. We must fulfil our development promises: stop the agricultural subsidies that have shot up and instead use them for the environment, consumers, and agriculture that is beneficial to the developing world. The European trade agenda must be brought closer to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists wants to see a higher priority accorded to a citizens’ agenda. This would read as follows: counterforce. Citizens want protection against unfair competition at work: this is a tribute to your efforts against the US in the steel dispute and South Korea’s unfair shipyard aid. Citizens also want respect for nature and the environment, and consumer-friendly agriculture: no animal transports, quality over quantity and respect for nature. They want social power. They do not want any products that have been manufactured by exploiting women or using child labour. They want support for fair trade products and for free trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our additional GSP approach would enable extra support for countries that take education, health care and free trade unions seriously, but we would want a multilateral approach to this. As far as we are concerned, that approach would require dropping the Singapore issues: removing them from the single undertaking. Now is the right time to do that. The truth is, however, that many developing countries think that we, like the US, do not genuinely want this. In the field of agriculture, in particular, and with regard to the Singapore issues, the message has not got through clearly. We hope that we shall be generous to the new alliance, that is to say, stop export subsidies for products sensitive to them, open up our markets, and give them help in marketing their products in their own region and on our market.</p>
<p class="contents">As you yourself say, we have to be clear about the G-21. We need this new, emerging world power as a multilateral player, but the G-21 must also be aware that, if they make requirements of us, they themselves must also make their contribution. They must guarantee their citizens the right to a free trade-union movement, and put an end to child labour and the exploitation of women. Why should they not be the first to give that new alliance a chance, just as we did with Everything But Arms, and permit their countries to import goods? That would make Lula’s agenda credible.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s commitment to cheap AIDS drugs has finally borne fruit. This point demonstrates that Europe is not focusing on short-term gain for itself, but on the bigger picture. This approach to the global free market, with fair rules, will make us a great deal more credible. I believe that prompt implementation of this approach in the Member States and the European Union is the right course to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Netherlands is pre-eminently a trading nation, after all.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in September, during the debate in this Parliament on the failure of the Cancún negotiating round, I made Commissioners Lamy and Fischler aware of the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and myself for restarting promptly while the momentum was still there. In this regard, multilateralism remains the best route to global free trade, and the conclusion of bilateral agreements is detrimental to smaller countries and developing countries. Indeed, these countries benefit from general standards applying worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission sees reform of the WTO as another priority, and I agree with Commissioner Lamy on this point, because there is room for improvement in the way in which the organisation is currently functioning, which is no longer appropriate in 2004. He must bear in mind, however, that it was the members that were to blame for the failure of the negotiations. The most important thing, therefore, is to obtain constructive support among WTO members for the continuation of the Doha Development Round. That will not be easy, however, in view of the US presidential elections this year, because the campaigns will probably be full of protectionist rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">An enhanced role for the Secretariat in Geneva and for the Director-General would be a step in the right direction, in my opinion. The Director-General must be given the right of initiative in order to generate more support and increased commitment on the part of the Member States to putting the negotiations back on track; and also in order to hold the members to the agreements they have made. This enhanced mandate for the Director-General would then have to be set against democratic control by a parliamentary assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">In Cancún, we gave this another firm push by means of a parliamentary conference. That must continue, because this democratic control really cannot be left in the hands of the NGOs. Firstly, they lack democratic legitimacy and, secondly, Cancún showed once more that these organisations are not exactly striving for the success of the negotiating round.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject matter of the present agenda should stay the same, in my view, and the Singapore issues and market access play a key role in this. It is precisely developing countries that stand to benefit from a favourable investment climate, reduction in import levies and transparent legislation. The southern countries would profit from trade facilitation; indeed, 80% of all import levies are paid by the developing countries combined. The European Union must also provide other members with better information, however, as my colleague Mr van Velzen has already said. Finally, the ELDR Group gives Commissioners Lamy and Fischler a clear field for promoting their strategy and the proposed package in this sphere, and for continuing on this path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The failure to reach an agreement at the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Cancún confirms the need to halt and reverse current trade liberalisation policies. We need to implement policies that promote fair and equitable trading systems, geared towards the sustainable development of each country’s true potential, without imposing relationships of dominance and dependence and also geared towards improving the living conditions of the various peoples of the world as a matter of urgency and towards reinforcing their rights and social <span class="italic">acquis</span>. The Commission’s current mandate, however, obstructs this need. The great acts of social mobilisation that have taken place throughout the world, specifically at the European Social Forum, against the WTO and its various proposals, specifically the agreement on services, which jeopardises high-quality public services, prove the need for us to review the Commission’s mandate. We cannot allow the European Union to continue to align itself with the United States of America on fundamental areas of negotiation, specifically farming, the liberalisation of services, what are known as the ‘new Singapore issues’, investment, competition, and public procurement. Account must also be taken of areas that are important to the textiles and clothing industries, especially those in the countries of southern Europe such as Portugal, in order to safeguard employment and development in huge areas to which these industries are crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we reiterate the need to review the current mandate in order to avoid the disastrous social and environmental effects of the trading systems that the WTO has put in place. We want to see fair and equitable trading, geared towards development, public health, respect for the environment and towards cultural diversity. We must grasp the opportunity provided by the failure to reach an agreement at Seattle, Cancún or recently in Geneva, to review the proposals presented by the Commission and to give consideration to this much-needed balance. Hence my question about the European Commission’s willingness to review its current mandate and to undertake negotiations in a new framework, respecting the principles that I have just referred to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given his robust remarks the day after the talks collapsed in Cancún, I was actually expecting the Commission to be thinking more along the lines of proposing a thorough overhaul of the international trading system rather than adopting a new tactical position. In fact, it is not strategic change that we are discussing today but rather a tactical repositioning. As regards the Singapore issues in particular, Commissioner Lamy is reporting greater flexibility on the part of the Commission, the kind of flexibility that emerged right at the end of the Cancún process, too late in the day in my opinion. But is flexibility still the issue today?</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, I must remind you that the Doha Declaration required a unanimous and explicit agreement on the negotiating arrangements for these issues. In fact we know that, as things currently stand, there is no chance of such an agreement. The G90 countries, which are the poorest, have restated their opposition to opening negotiations on the Singapore issues. I think it is clear that these countries have nothing to gain for their development from such negotiations: their priorities lie elsewhere, which is understandable. Both technically and in terms of human resources, these countries are ill-equipped to play an effective role in such negotiations, which would only place greater strain on a timetable that everyone recognises is already very tight. I think that by abandoning the Singapore issues for the time being, or at least putting them on the backburner, the European Union would send out a powerful and meaningful signal to the G90, showing them that we are sensitive to their concerns. This attitude might even be a smart strategic move because it would put the European Union in a more positive position on agriculture: we would have more room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the rest, on agriculture, the World Trade Organisation is not, in my opinion, an appropriate forum in which to deal with everyone’s rights and obligations. I think it is essential and urgent to relaunch a process of dialogue within a body like the FAO, where we can have a calm discussion on food safety and the protection and development of rural areas. In particular, I think that an urgent file like the cotton one, which was tabled in Cancún, should be given top priority by the European Union, and I would be grateful if the Commissioners could take this into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the collapse of the talks in Cancún, there were some worrying signs that the United States was going to abandon the multilateral rules and force a series of bilateral deals around the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the WTO talks, I am concerned primarily about agriculture. I find worrying the noises the Americans are now making in this respect and I believe they are trying to move the goalposts regarding farming. European farmers have signed up to a reform deal that involves tremendous upheaval in the sector, but at least they know where they are heading. It is totally unacceptable to suggest reopening the Luxembourg Accord of last year. Our farmers need policy stability in order to plan for the future of their businesses and the livelihood of their families. There can be no question of our going back, under pressure from the Americans, on any of the commitments we have entered into with our farmers. I call on the Commission to state clearly that it will not tolerate such pressure and that it will rigorously defend the existing agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also remind the Commission that there exists no mandate to negotiate away the current export refund regime. The Americans must not be allowed to call for an end to export refunds while they continue to operate a host of schemes which have exactly the same effect as far as American farmers are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that light, I have a number of comments on the present strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">My first relates to agriculture. The EU agreed a framework with the United States ahead of Cancún. The US Trade Representative, Mr Zoellick, recently declared himself in favour of resuming the negotiations in the current trade round. I presume that the Commissioner is holding consultations with him with a view to arriving at a framework outlining clear commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">A second element in the Doha Development Agenda is the manufacture and import of unpatented medicinal products for developing countries that are undergoing a serious health crisis. The complex import procedure for cheap medicinal products needs to be simplified. The United States is a strategic player in this, so a more workable solution must be agreed with them. I cannot find the necessary clarification on this point in the Commission document.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this trade round is a development round. The negotiations must not focus on the Singapore issues, but instead all the more on the development issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much more than the United States, Europe needs multilateral bases in order to develop international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point, Mr President, Commissioners, on which I completely disagree. Commissioner Lamy said that as far as agriculture is concerned, negotiations are being reopened and the European Union is no longer always on the defensive. I believe that, at political level, this is not entirely true. Of course, the United States also have agricultural problems, in terms of protectionism, as does Japan; but Europe remains a cornerstone of the world system of protectionism and State handouts for farmers and rich countries. The so-called reform has not made sufficient progress in this regard. One only has to look at the budgets of the European Union: we are continuing to spend 40% of the Union budget on subsidising and protecting rich farmers, who represent a declining sector in the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it possible that some people do not understand that we are discussing the future of Europe’s international trade? Do we have to discuss this with Commissioner Lamy – and that would be the last straw! – and with Commissioner Fischler? Personally, I have nothing against Commissioner Fischler, but we have the Commission or the Council representative for agriculture – and not for technology, or for industry. How is that possible?</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, agriculture remains the obstacle in key negotiations on Europe’s world trade, and agricultural protectionism is harming Europe before developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second is that our present support for the mandate given to the Commission and the Council also means that we in this European Parliament have to be consistent. It is not acceptable that, in this House, we are supporting the Commission by a large majority, at the same time as, in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, the same group and the same rapporteur prepare reports that are diametrically opposed to what we have said to the WTO. I would refer to the negotiations on the regional partnership agreements, in which the same principles must apply, including such things as the Singapore issues. What we see as of the utmost importance are the reciprocal opening-up of markets and, of course, preferential treatment for our ACP friends as well. We cannot, though, send out two conflicting messages, and we in the Group of the European People’s Party, perhaps along with other Members forming a majority in this House, will see to it that we remain coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that we in this House have to try, if we are to become active on the parliamentary front, to play a significant and leading role, which – difficult though this may be – will mean the constant involvement of our partners in the US Congress. After all, they are our principal trading partners, and we do not want to be dragged along in the wake of the Indians and the Chinese. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioners, that the most striking aspect of the communication of 26 November that you tabled in the Council was indeed the U-turn on the Singapore issues. I am glad to have been one of those Members of this House to whom Commissioner Lamy referred who told you to what extent negotiations on the Singapore issues were pointlessly weighing down the whole enterprise. Like Mr Lannoye, I do not believe that the WTO is the right forum to deal with several of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I should simply like to tell you what a shame it would be, today, to do too little too late. You had first-hand experience of this at the end of the Cancún Conference: on the last day, you wanted to indicate that you were prepared to withdraw some of these subjects, but by then the confidence had evaporated and this initiative was not enough to get the discussion back on track.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, today you are agreeing to exclude several of the Singapore issues – investment and competition – from the single undertaking, from the overall agreement, while nevertheless keeping them on the negotiating table for the multilateral agreements that you want to negotiate: in doing so, you will foster mistrust and hostility. I think that, on the contrary, every effort needs to be made to restore confidence between the European Union and the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This provides a hint of the problem that we have when reading your communication. The feeling is that you are trying to learn the lessons from the failure of Cancún, but at the same time you give the impression of only going halfway and of doing so backwards. It is as if you wanted everything to change provided that everything remains as it is, to use Lampedusa’s words. For example, you ask to keep your negotiating mandate, which dates back to before Seattle, requesting that modifications be kept to a minimum. You want to maintain your positions on agriculture. You want to keep the European Union’s initial objectives on the liberalisation of developing countries’ markets and on the liberalisation of services, with, on the latter, a very significant ambiguity on public services, as we have been reminded. You actually say that they should not be affected, but at the same time you state that you want to liberalise environmental services, which are amongst the most important public services. Obviously I am thinking of water.</p>
<p class="contents">You even make a very questionable assertion. You say, and I quote, that in your view, ‘the WTO is not a structurally unfair system that needs to be rebalanced.’ I think that by making such a statement you are turning your back on the spirit of Doha, which was precisely to recognise in relation to our partners in the developing countries that since the end of the Uruguay Round the trade system had not kept its promises, that it had not worked fairly and benefited the development of all and that it needed to be rebalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, the Commission communication is marked by positions that threaten to delay resumption of the dialogue. I am thinking, for example, of the very severe criticism of the system of preferences or the system of special and differential treatment. The year 2004 must not be a forgotten year. I am glad that you have taken up your pilgrim’s staff to revive the dialogue with the countries of the G20 and G90. It is an attitude that is in stark contrast to the speech you made in Cancún, which was perceived as very contemptuous by some of these countries. We need to set a new agenda; we need to rebuild confidence around the Doha Agenda – but an improved Doha Agenda – and around a thorough reform of the WTO, of the way it works, its rules and dogmas, so that this organisation really is at the service of development for everyone. We therefore need to rebalance this international trading system and not continue to make liberalisation and free trade our sole priority, as these can only be unfair when the various players are so very different. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good, therefore, that the European Commission now wants to take renewed action to get the current negotiations started again. The proposed development round must not fail; it must be brought to a successful conclusion. After all, a great deal is at stake. There is the potential risk of the World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system becoming completely undermined. Bilateral and regional trade agreements are not a viable alternative in an increasingly globalised world, and in a system that has contributed to stable and sustained economic growth for almost 55 years now. Therefore, it is high time that the welcome discussions on the subject matter were complemented with improvements in WTO working methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiating and taking decisions by consensus in a forum with 148 members requires procedures that are up-to-date, simple and efficient, but at present that is precisely what the WTO’s procedures are not. It remains my deep-rooted conviction that the WTO is more necessary than ever, because, particularly as far as the European Union is concerned, further liberalisation of world trade and the removal of barriers to trade are the key to increased economic growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further evidence of this is provided by the growing resistance to WTO trade policy on the part of the international social movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission plays a decisive part in the WTO’s current trade policy. Its tactical approach shows that what really matters to it is not development policy and global fair trade, but only free trade. You asked whether my group would give you a mandate to do the things you have described. To that I can only say that we will not. What would we want to give you a mandate for?</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, it is high time that we comply with the demands of many developing countries and proceed with an evaluation of what the WTO’s policies have achieved to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, agricultural export subsidies, which are ruining millions of farmers in the countries of the South, must be done away with once and for all. Instead of burying developing countries with European agricultural produce at prices that amount to dumping the stuff, the European Union must help these countries to develop sound internal markets and regional economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the GATS negotiations, which will lead to massive rounds of liberalisation in areas of general-interest service provision that have so far been spared them, must be halted. This is another instance in which, instead of signalling the beginning of new rounds of liberalisation, the Commission would do better to give more attention to the evaluation of what has been achieved so far. I will give you a prediction: there will be little on the assets side of the balance sheet where quality, security of provision or price stability are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there is no need to make changes to what we call the Singapore issues; they simply need to be swept away. Rather than endlessly extending the WTO’s competences and adding new topics for negotiation to the agenda, the outstanding tasks on the development agenda have to be dealt with. The WTO’s work must, in particular, get back to focusing on such horizontal tasks as sustainable development and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we need to subject to scrutiny the WTO’s structures and the way it works. We call for it to become democratic, with transparency in all negotiations, for all its member states to be treated as equals, and for the procedure for settling disputes to be revised. In particular, we call for the WTO to be a party to the international treaties of the UN and the ILO.</p>

No really novel proposal has been made since then to improve it substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of the agricultural issue, it would have been good to consider in particular the relevance of integrating it in a process which, in its current form, does not allow its specificities to be taken into account, despite the fact that it is a sector that determines food sovereignty and constitutes the basis for development.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance that the European countries have attached to these two parameters, one might have thought that they were the right ones to ask this key question. This is not the case, as we see. We deplore this omission because it places a severe strain on the very future of the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
