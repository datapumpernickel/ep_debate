<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Κatiforis (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the stability and convergence programmes being evaluated today by Parliament constitute the second updates of the original programmes first presented in 1999 by the 14 Member States, with the exception of Greece, which submitted its first programme this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to start with Greece’s programme, which addresses circumstances with which, as is to be expected, I am perfectly familiar. The programmes form part of the control and discipline mechanism of the stability agreement, an agreement on budgetary prudence, the two main objectives of which are to ensure that the budgetary deficit does not exceed 3% each year and, secondly, to achieve a balance or surplus over the period of a full economic cycle. If anyone had said back in 1993 that Greece would achieve these objectives in just 7 years, they would have been laughed at. Greece’s middle name was inflation – 13% in 1993 – and deficit – over 14% of GDP in 1993. It was the example to be eschewed in the European Union. Few believed that it would be able to resolve these problems. Yet, by the end of 2001, Greece – and the Council agrees with this – is expected, instead of a deficit, to have a surplus of half a percentage point of GDP, rising to 1.5% in 2002 and 2% in 2003. Also, instead of 13%, inflation is expected to be a mere 2.3%. I appreciate your allowing me to dwell on these figures a little because Greece’s espousal of the culture of price stability and budgetary stability was perhaps the jewel in the crown of this policy throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The spectacular turnround by this Member State, which succeeded in meeting the Maastricht criteria, is a typical example of the general climate of monetary and budgetary stability which has prevailed in Europe thanks to everyone’s efforts to support the single currency. The motion put to the House by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs acknowledges and commends the achievement of budgetary discipline and price stability. It points out that inflation was slightly above the ceiling set by the European Central Bank as the result of outside influences (oil prices, depreciation in the euro against the dollar), rather than internal economic weaknesses. It also points out that a balanced budgetary position, and hence monetary stability, can only be achieved in the medium-term on the basis of a robust European economy centred on a high rate of growth in production.</p>
<p class="contents">The average rate of growth was 3.3% in 2000 with Austria at 3.5%, Finland at 5.2%, Greece at 4.1%, Ireland at an astounding 10.7%, Luxembourg at 8.3%, the Netherlands at 4.5%, Portugal at exactly the European average of 3.3%, Spain at 4% and Sweden at 3.9%. Unfortunately, these rates of growth are unlikely to continue. High oil prices, high interest rates and the slowdown in the American economy have caused initial forecasts to be revised downwards to between 2.4% and 2.8%. So we cannot expect the same level of comfort or budgetary surpluses this year as we enjoyed in 2000, not that this means that there will be deficits. The main thing is to be well organised and to use public money to support growth, especially if we bear the long-term targets set in Lisbon in mind: full employment within ten years, an increase in the working population to 70%, an average rate of economic growth of 3%, reform of the social state and a European economy at the forefront of the knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability programmes presented indicate that the Member States are aware of these needs. They have used their surpluses to repay public debt, reduce taxes and increase public investment and, in the longer term, to stabilise the state pension system, which has also become an important consideration, with some resources being directed towards a reserve fund.</p>
<p class="contents">All these ways of exploiting strong fiscal positions are worthwhile and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supports them, but not to the same degree. The Council considers the reduction of public debt as the main priority; it does not object to public investment, provided that it does not interfere with reducing debt, and it appears to oppose tax reductions. We, on the contrary, consider the achievement and the manner of use of primary surpluses not as a matter of dogma but as a matter of political expediency, to be judged according to current conditions and the needs of economic management. In the current situation, characterised by the menace of a serious recession in the US economy, as well as the persistent need to raise the rate of growth in Europe, debt repayment as well as tax reductions seem to us of lesser importance than financing public investment, naturally in balanced budgets, not deficits, both for supporting flagging growth and for pushing forward those structural changes necessary for the transition to a modern, technologically pioneering, full employment economy in Europe. It should not be forgotten that the absorption of high rates of unemployment presupposes the consistent achievement of a 3% rate of growth, a target which cannot be said to have been met on a permanent basis in our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to address a request to the Commissioner, because the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is concerned about the Union’s continued failure to make available to the appropriate committee in Parliament the detailed technical evaluations of each programme and it reiterates its call for a more harmonised timetabling of submission of the programmes by the Member States in order to improve comparability, calling in this context for full and timely involvement of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What exactly is this report about? In May 1998, resolutions were passed making economic and monetary union a reality. At the time, economic and monetary union and the introduction of a European currency were irreversible. What were they based on back then? First, the independence of the European Central Bank, in order to safeguard monetary stability and, secondly, the Stability and Growth Pact, the purpose of which was to ensure that the European currency cannot be jeopardised by the budgets. Because our first objective in introducing the European currency – and this is particularly true of my Group – was a stable currency for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have before us Mr Katiforis’s report on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. We must remember what this Stability and Growth Pact calls for. It calls for balanced budgets and for countries which are still overly in debt to achieve a surplus.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, when we were discussing the Stability and Growth Pact against the backdrop of the Maastricht Treaty, the important thing was not to exceed a new net debt level of 3%, which was the entry condition at the time. Today, the important thing is to achieve a balanced budget or a surplus. So what news on this front? The first item of news is positive: in the euro zone, i.e. in the twelve countries which have introduced the currency, which we also refer to as the European home market, we have on average, I repeat on average, balanced budgets. That is one very good point.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, we must face the facts. We achieved this objective in a period of growth which we shall be unable to match next year, namely with growth of 3.4%, i.e. in a fat year for the purposes of economic policy. The Bible exhorts us to save in fat years for the lean years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there were the UMTS licences, which gave our finance ministers a windfall.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must bear in mind that we have age pyramids in store for us and that we need to make provision for the expenditure in store for us here.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that we have failed to grab this opportunity, we have failed to make proper use of this positive climate. What especially worries me is that some countries still have a very high level of overall debt and that, in some cases, these debts are still somewhat short-term in structure. We must face up to these risks. Which is why we also need to call for the consolidation efforts which have started – and which are impressive in some countries but insufficient in others – to continue. I have to say that my own country, Germany, gives me cause for concern, because our rate of growth is below the average in the euro zone. Nor have we managed to balance the budget, despite the huge windfall from UMTS licences in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to my group’s stand on the Katiforis report. We can support it, as it now stands. However, we are concerned about two proposed amendments, both on the same subject, namely that investments should be excluded when calculating the Stability and Growth Pact margins. We agree that investments are needed and that budgets should be restructured towards greater investment, but within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is why, unfortunately, we shall have to vote against the Katiforis report if these proposed amendments attract a majority in the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We see the outlines of economic policy on the one hand, but we see the stability and convergence programmes on the other. I should also like to remind the House in this context that the Stability and Growth Pact has predominantly been geared in the past towards achieving stability. It did, however, always include growth factors. From this point of view, the rapporteur’s approach is the right one, indicating as it does that it makes sense to use investments, both private and public, in order to achieve a real knowledge-based society of the future in the European Union. If these public-sector investments are used for the benefit of information technologies, other new technologies and a better, modernised infrastructure in the euro zone and the European Union, then this is the right way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view it is also very important that we restart the debate on the quality of public finances. Luckily, the Commission has presented a paper here which will need to play an important part in future discussions in connection with stability and convergence programmes. Because we must ensure when evaluating the state of public finances, which is also our job, when analysing the content of the convergence and stability programmes, that we identify the right trend, that we identify the right development, but that we do not lose sight during our discussions of the possibility of steering in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr von Wogau, you referred to possible dangers. You pointed out that advice in the Bible on lean and fat years should still be seen as relevant by financial policy-makers in the European Union. Any analysis of public finances, however, must also consider what impact expenditure may have on monetary policy. We therefore need to work with sound public finances in the euro zone because a poor financial situation could jeopardise monetary stability. Windfalls have not been spent on consumption as in past years; they have also been used to reduce debt and for investments. We must also consider how this sort of economic policy coordination can be used to guarantee social and employment policy as well as monetary stability. Here too there is both an obligation and a challenge for the countries in the euro zone, the pre-ins and future candidate countries alike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although this was generally encouraging in the year 2000, and we have enjoyed high growth rates, job creation and monetary stability, many hard questions have now to be asked concerning the development of these factors. Consequently, considerable pressure will be exerted in some countries, as is already the case in the European Union as a whole, to move towards more expansionist policies. Obviously, such a move could come into conflict with the commitments given within the stability pacts relating to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we consider that certain parts of the report we are debating today are particularly apposite. These are the sections highlighting the need to maintain budgetary discipline and to avoid undertaking to reduce taxes, a promise often given in the run-up to elections, unless corresponding balancing measures are adopted. We also endorse something Mr Katiforis is constantly stressing, namely that there should also be balancing measures for productive investments.

It is a matter of great satisfaction to everybody in Europe and in this House that this should be the caseso, although I dare say it is wise to be, as both he and Mr von Wogau are, only cautiously optimistic. Pride often comes before a fall and we had better not be too proud too soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree very much with what Mr Katiforis said about the question of public investment. The United Kingdom seems to have adopted an attitude of quite excessive horror about public investment, and I noticed that in yesterday’s <span class="italic">Guardian</span> newspaper Mr Bob Kiley, who ought to know, was predicting that the London Underground for which he is responsible, will, because of the Government’s insistance on the 'public-private investment partnership' whereby only private financiers are to come forward to invest, make the Tube worse and more expensive than it would have been under a programme of sensible public investment. I only wish that Mr Katiforis' words would be attended to in my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said in the course of the debate, there is a matter of serious concern about the future pension liabilities of all the Member States. I speak with a certain interest since my own next birthday will be my sixtieth and I would be very glad, therefore, if we were to carry Amendment No 4 recommending the creation of special funds to deal with the future overhang of pension liabilities as that is one of the troubles that may beset us. But I welcome the report on behalf of my group and give Mr Katiforis our thanks and support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the end, however, the report that we voted does not provide any real options and that is why my Group does not support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s economic policy stands out for its passivity and its dogmatism. The Council, the Commission and the Central Bank are quite content and will not move an inch and the European Parliament has not managed to take up the challenge. Our economic policy is demonstrating passivity in the face of a situation that is growing worse and in the face of the criteria that we would have to meet to ensure the sustainable development of the European Union. The Central Bank tells us that, in the short-term, it should not intervene, since it is concerned with the medium-term. With regard to the medium-term, however, it refers us to the structural reforms. To put it plainly, monetary policy and budgetary policy must serve neither regulation of the present economic situation nor sustainable development. This is clearly absurd. What, however, do we say about it? We do not manage to come up with anything significantly different, despite Mr Katiforis’s efforts for public and private investment, highlighting the current situation of under-investment.</p>
<p class="contents">In his explanatory statement and as he has repeated this morning, Mr Katiforis insists on the fact that public investment must take precedence over the concern to reduce public debt. The position we have finally adopted, however, is dogmatic with regard to public finances and to the stability pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio-Plath has spoken this morning, and not for the first time, on the quality of public finances and taxation. I think that this is the way forward. The reality of the situation, however, if you look at all of our resolutions and texts, is that they are all concerned with reducing taxation and with reducing public and social spending. We are not succeeding in implementing this line of reform, which is intended to bring about a qualitative improvement. Take, for example, our resolutions on reducing social security contributions coupled with wage moderation. Our social and public spending contributes to keeping workers poor. We are subsidising low-paid jobs and when it comes to expenditure, we know that massive public investment is needed and that public money is essential to make this investment, but we do not want to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the structural reforms that are given the most prominence, reforms that were conceived solely as a form of deregulation, as a sort of panacea, whereas in reality, the new problem, which is the new economy, is an organisation of the market designed to achieve sustainable development and social cohesion. This requires a large contribution from public funds. We talk about lifelong training, but we have no policy in place in this field and where aid for energy policy is concerned, we have made no progress at all. The same thing applies to transport policy and as for an industrial policy, we simply have none. All of this would require a real increase in investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to give economic policy its rightful place in Europe, I hope that, in addition to the first strategies that I mentioned just now, but which have not achieved success, we can prove that we are up to the task of making it a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important if the internal market, and more particularly the single currency, is to operate effectively. From an Irish perspective the stability programme is central to the budgetary process. A most recently updated programme adopted last December was framed against a prospect of strong but moderate economic growth and in the medium to long-term the Government intends to continue to run significant budgetary surpluses reflecting economic good sense and our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact. Needless to say, I fully support the policies being pursued by our Minister for Finance.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that government debt in Ireland will be reduced to around 25% of GDP by the year 2003. We are allocating at least 1% of GDP annually to build up the pension reserve fund so as to provide for our ageing population. In relation to price inflation, which is one of the issues addressed in the Council’s recommendation to Ireland, it is important that we are clear on the following key statistics: the latest figures show that inflation as measured by the harmonised European index has fallen from 6% last November to 3.9% this year. Our inflation rate is now lower than that in a number of other EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as regards the future of Ireland within the European Union, we are fully committed to the operation of the internal market and to the single currency. We want to make both these key projects a real success within the Union, and we support enlargement. I am actively canvassing for a yes-vote in the referendum which I hope will be carried. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was, however, not due to the policy adopted but rather to incidents and unexpected strokes of luck, such as stronger economic growth and the auction of UMTS.</p>
<p class="contents">The favourable economic tide should have been used to bring about reforms. There is not so much a need for new initiatives as there is for the implementation of politically-inspired objectives. The areas which require attention are clear: reforms on the labour market, fiscal reforms, liberalisation of the utility sectors and greater incentives for entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">At 2.6% in March, inflation is still far too high. Interest rates cannot be lowered as a result. Whether you like it or not, the ECB’s objective is price stability. Moreover, the real interest level is low enough to offer an incentive for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk of price increases upon the introduction of the euro is another reason for the European Central Bank to maintain interest at its current level.</p>
<p class="contents">Both growth, wrongly expected by some from the ECB, and a better functioning internal market, will need to be achieved in and by the Member States themselves. The call for more coordination of the economic policy is then not the most effective approach. The stability and convergence programmes are right to confine themselves to the monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the rapporteur’s call for an acceleration of the structural reforms receives my unqualified support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Economic growth in Europe is slowing down. The reasons include rising oil prices and higher interest rates, which are already dampening company profits. We now have a choice of several measures designed mainly to bring about higher rates of economic growth in Europe. Under no circumstances, however, should we simply increase public investment. We need more forwards on the European economy team. There are too many defenders on the playing field and too many reserves who never even see the ball, which is why I think that, first and foremost, we need to improve the framework conditions for our working population.

That we now have a stable euro for the whole of the euro zone is due both to the steady hand of the European Central Bank and the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact was the right pact.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, reducing debt means taking responsibility for the future. For me, reducing debt and reducing the deficit each year mean a radical change of policy, because for years now we have sold the future down the river in our economic and budgetary policies, using the young generation in each country as packhorses, rather than lifting the burden from their shoulders and opening up future prospects through balanced budgets and surpluses. The Stability and Growth Pact is therefore a question of responsibility for the future. On the other hand – if we are to be perfectly honest – it is a really successful binding framework to guard against covetousness and opportunism in day-to-day politics.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an important framework to guard against political misconduct in day-to-day politics and it is also an important framework for a proactive financial, budgetary and economic policy debate in our Member States. Since the euro, since the Stability and Growth Pact, budgetary policy is talked about far more openly, the deficit is talked about far more openly, the connection between budgetary, financial, economic and structural policy is talked about far more openly and the necessary reforms are being implemented proactively in order to achieve a different objective. One group is not being played off against another, which is why I am delighted – and I trust that I shall not be misunderstood now that several growth figures are back for discussion because they are being revised – that we are also debating the Stability and Growth Pact and the convergence criteria in the Chamber at the moment, because it shows our people and the public – including politicians – that changes to growth figures do not mean change to the stability and convergence criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact is not a day-to-day short-term political football and it cannot be changed as and when it becomes difficult to implement and take the next step. Nor is there any place for lassitude in making adjustments. I should like to call on everyone to put an end to the lassitude which has set in. More structural reforms are urgently needed because we need to move from one-off effects to sustainability. We need to reduce taxes, but not at the expense of the Stability and Growth Pact. We also need to ensure that lip service – and this comment is addressed to the Council – to more radical reforms in pensions and extending the three pillar model at European level is at last followed by deeds so that we can continue on this path to success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is regrettable that some aspects were deleted in committee and perhaps all those may be restored in today’s vote. I would particularly welcome the proposal for a special pension fund by Member States. It is an issue which has been addressed in Ireland over some years and has now been put in place. Substantial amounts of money are now in a fund which will guarantee pensions long into the future, and this is a very positive development. I make that positive point because I am going to be quite critical of the Irish Government’s position in relation to the broad economic policy guidelines.</p>

This was unfortunate, not because it was not necessary, but because we should not the EU find ourselves in such a position that simply feeds euro-scepticism in Europe, particularly in the country which is so reprimanded. Now the Commission has published its guidelines for 2002, all Member States, including Ireland, should openly negotiate its position, make it clear to the public at home what their position is, so that when the time comes and budgets are being implemented based around those guidelines, the public knows exactly why that is being done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has damaged the EU and EMU – not just in Ireland, as has been pointed out previously. It has put additional wind into the sails of the opponents of EMU in the countries outside the euro zone. 'That is how much the national freedom to determine one’s own financial and tax policy is worth,’ the opponents of EMU in my homeland cheerfully chuckle. You will no doubt soon hear Herman Schmid express something similar.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an alarming tendency towards complete centralisation within the Euroland countries. The relative weakness of the euro against the dollar seems to have triggered a number of excessive reactions. Obviously, there is a common monetary policy, but financial, budgetary and tax policy must not and cannot be managed in detail from Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">EMU is an instrument for increasing the economic strength of Europe and therefore a certain amount of acceptance is required of the fact that all euro zone countries do not move at exactly the same rate simultaneously.

The Commission and the IMF have revised growth forecasts from above 3% to 2.8%. The rate of inflation is 0.3 of a percentage point above the 2% ceiling. We all know why this is. Exploding oil prices, agricultural problems, the depreciation in the euro. Our export-orientated Member States in particular have been hit by the hard landing in the US economy. The own initiative report by Mr Katiforis, which has been clarified as the result of numerous amendments proposed by the PPE-DE Group, underlines the importance of controls on stability and convergence programmes to economic collaboration in Europe. There is absolutely no cause for the passivity which Mr Herzog referred to. Reducing government debt must continue to be our top priority. We also need, however, targeted investments in information networks, technology and research and development. This will bring us closer to the very ambitious objective set in Lisbon of making Europe the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, we must redirect our efforts towards education and training. For me, lifelong learning is far too often a set phrase and far too seldom a requirement, conspicuous by its absence from curricula and syllabuses. Mr von Wogau and Mr Karas have already spoken about the stability of the euro and agreed how important the steady hand of the ECB – and Wim Duisenberg – was; the euro has remained stable, all the political demands of the various camps notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am interested in is structural stability. Our Member States should make use, in their economic and social policy, of benchmarking procedures and exchanges of best practices. However, it is the opposite of this – namely poor practices – which my country is currently delivering. Germany is bringing up the rear when it comes to growth in the euro zone at under 2.2%. Chancellor Schröder’s days of talking it up and laughing it off are finally at an end! Faced with a lack of success with employment, one reason being that the programmes are not effective enough, he is trying to deflect attention from his own mistakes by slagging off the unemployed in general as good-for-nothings. Anyone who tries to lump social spongers and shirkers – and they undoubtedly exist – together with the hundreds of thousands who have been desperately looking for work for years is making criminals out of victims and that is totally irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">This example shows that, with better data networking, we know full well where the shortcomings lie in each Member State. They can no longer be swept under the carpet, they are in the spotlight of European public opinion. No country in the EU will get on without budgetary discipline, without permanently reducing debts or without substantial structural reforms and the aims – competitiveness and stability – are well worth it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, we are not using any of the expenditure for helping large employers in various ways.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Member States, as well as the European institutions, stopped giving such huge amounts to large employers, the resultant savings would enable public services to be developed and would, at the same time, reduce unemployment through the consequent taking on of staff in public hospitals, transport and public education systems, whilst maintaining a surplus budget. Clearly, however, there is no likelihood of this happening, because the European institutions and the Member States exist to serve the large employers and not the majority of the population. Many items in the report attest to this. When, for example, it dares to express satisfaction with the fact that unemployment has fallen from 9.6% to 8%, this represents around 15 million men and women forced into poverty in a region which happens to be one of the wealthiest in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the report gives its approval to anything that increases flexibility and competitiveness, especially of labour. It quite clearly acts as the spokesperson for interests of employers alone rather than for the whole of the working population.</p>

We therefore welcome paragraph 6 but we have reservations about the rest of the report, in particular paragraph 4, because we cannot agree that the 'golden rule' is a good example for Europe to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">It is merely one of the many ways in which Gordon Brown succeeds in fiddling the figures. This report and the Stability and Growth Pact in the convergent programmes are clear evidence of the link between tax-and-spend policies and monetary policy. The pact applies to all EU Member States but the legal penalties are only applicable to those states in the euro zone: that is at the heart of our reservations about this report.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons why we oppose the United Kingdom joining the euro zone is because we wish to keep the power to set taxes, budgets and spending decisions in the hands of democratically-elected national politicians. Within the euro zone it is not surprising that constraints have been imposed on public spending decisions because if you have, to all intents and purposes, a joint bank account you are affected by the spending decisions of others and you can expect to want some control over those spending decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent example of Ireland is a salutary reminder that by joining the euro a country takes on more than a single interest rate: its tax-and-spend decisions will no longer be decided solely in national capitals. It is a prospect which most people in the United Kingdom view with disquiet, the prospect of following a budget by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ecofin, the Commission or the ECB informing that Chancellor that he or she is not permitted to increase spending on schools and hospitals and those services which are of such huge value to the people of the United Kingdom. This has already happened in Ireland and it could happen in the United Kingdom. But I would urge that the real route to economic prosperity in Europe is, as Mr Karas eloquently stated, structural and economic reform which will lead to sustainable prosperity, an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In March the Ecofin Council completed its assessment of the third round of programmes we presented. Increased monitoring of budgetary policies, following implementation of the stability and growth pact, is having very positive and beneficial results. I am not sure whether, as Mr Karas stated, this is a means of establishing political stability, or simply a way of maintaining a clear commitment as regards public deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have improved budgetary consolidation though close cooperation. The latest figures show that ten of the current Member States anticipate that their public accounts will balance or show a surplus. All, apart from the United Kingdom, will have balanced their budgets by 2004. Public debt is decreasing significantly, and this year we expect it to fall below 60% in eleven of the fifteen Member States. I therefore believe we have made significant progress and, as Mr Katiforis said, I think we have achieved economic stability in Europe in budgetary terms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, although the task of restructuring public finances has enabled us to make significant progress, it poses a number of problems relating to long-term sustainability and the standard of public finances. Basically, the Commission insists that progress must be made on both counts. We must continue to strive to reduce the present deficits and to balance public budgets at the earliest opportunity. There are still a number of cases of excessively high debts. These must be reduced, above all in order to tackle future budgetary problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to highlight aspects of the matter pointed out by a number of speakers. I refer amongst others to Mrs Randzio-Plath, who mentioned the need to improve the standard of public finances. Others spoke along the same lines. When we speak of the standard of public finances, we are referring not only to problems in the short-term, but also to those in the medium- and long-term. In the short-term, these obviously relate to the fiscal reforms which will improve the administration of taxes. In the medium-term they concern all matters related to improved public expenditure. I will refer to public investment, as set out by Mr Katiforis in his report, in a moment. Of course, there is the long-term problem of our ageing population, which should obviously be one of our main concerns at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The medium-term strategies defined by the Member States in their programmes clearly indicate their priorities. This enables us to reconcile the different views so as to improve coordination of our budgetary policies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to refer in detail to some of the problems raised by Mr Katiforis in his report. I wish to make some specific comments on the very important subject of public investment, to which Mr Katiforis dedicates a substantial part of his report. Firstly, I agree absolutely with him that, during the period of budgetary consolidation in the 1990s, many Member States reduced public investment, sometimes inappropriately. Secondly, it is true that the improvement in the situation should allow priority to be given to public investment. We would then be in line with the undertakings given in Lisbon. Their underlying aim is to improve our potential for growth. My third point is that public investment is not incompatible with private investment. Different types of investment can work alongside each other and can be interlinked. There is also scope for innovative financing methods. Often, there is no reason why the public sector should act in isolation as has traditionally been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">In giving greater priority to public investment, which I fully support, we must not however forget the other side of the coin: greater public investment does not necessarily mean increased deficit. We believe that the problem should be resolved by redirecting certain types of expenditure and keeping public deficit under control. In our opinion it is crucial for the public deficit to be controlled through budgetary discipline. It is essential to balance the books in the medium-term. It is true that measures such as the golden rule implemented in the United Kingdom are useful insofar as public investment can logically be financed thorough debt or deficit. However, such debt or deficit must not exceed the agreed limits. Certain categories of spending should therefore have priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, encouraging public investment does not equate either with uncontrolled debt or with a significant increase in public expenditure. However, the Commission would obviously not endorse an increase in investment which could exceed deficit levels or current predicted expenditure levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 10 of the motion for a resolution refers to improved harmonisation of the timetable for presentation of Member States’ programmes. We agree on this and have always felt it necessary to update programmes before budgetary procedures. We have stressed this point and will continue to do so. We trust that in the future we will at least be able to ensure that the programmes in question will be updated at the same time as budgetary procedures are initiated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Katiforis also refers to the need to have the Commission’s documents available. That is a long-standing debate. We in the Commission do believe it is important for Parliament to have access to as much information as possible. Nonetheless, we also feel that the nuances or minor differences between the Commission’s proposal and the Council’s final decision are irrelevant as far as public opinion is concerned. We think the debate should focus mainly on those features eventually adopted by the Council. For that reason we feel that making earlier documents available would complicate rather than simplify the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to Paragraph 9, which deals with the Commission’s macroeconomic forecasts. As you are aware, these are prepared independently of the programme assessments. They are drawn up twice a year and published when they are ready. We have just brought out the latest ones, for the spring. They were forwarded to Parliament on 25 April. They point to a number of interesting developments which have also been mentioned today. Our position on the Irish matter is well known. Quite simply, all that happened in Ireland was that current regulations were applied. Another development worth mentioning is the reduction in growth as a result of the situation in the United States. I note that some of you, ladies and gentlemen, have floated the idea of a change in budgetary policy as a positive contribution to improving growth. As we see it, given the 2.8% predicted growth taken into account in the Commission’s forecasts, there is still plenty of scope for progress through the existing stability programmes. The Commission therefore continues to emphasise the need for the successful completion of these stability programmes. This does not mean, however, we do not believe that automatic stabilisers might prove helpful in a context of lower economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">These were the issues I wanted to bring to your attention. It only remains for me to thank Mr Katiforis for his work and to express my appreciation to all of you for your contributions, criticisms and suggestions. Thank you again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
