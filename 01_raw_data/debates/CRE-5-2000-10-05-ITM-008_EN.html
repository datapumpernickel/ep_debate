It is an important resolution because Afghanistan and its desperately suffering people, and especially its children who are blown up by mines and its women who face appalling discrimination, deserve far more attention from us. Thanks to this motion for a resolution, which has found broad consensus, Parliament is taking a firm position.</p>
<p class="contents">As the resolution states, the fundamental political challenge is to put pressure on Afghanistan’s large neighbour, Pakistan, as a means of trying to influence the situation in Afghanistan, I would also add the other large neighbour, the People’s Republic of China, with which Pakistan has excellent relations and collaborates at military and nuclear level. We also know that there is extensive cooperation between those two big countries, Pakistan and the People’s Republic of China, at the level of the political <span class="italic">nomenklatura</span> and the local mafia as regards drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">We know Afghanistan is not far away, and we know it is the world’s largest producer of opiates, so we can well imagine the role played by these political mafias, which are not necessarily simply political, in the expansion of the drug trade. We also know that the policy of the United Nations, especially that of UNDCP and Mr Arlacchi, is a disaster. Despite the millions of dollars invested in Afghanistan in the course of the last few years, production has doubled.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I think pressure needs to be exerted on Pakistan and the People’s Republic of China, all funding needs to be withdrawn from Mr Arlacchi and UNDCP so that these prohibitionist policies on drugs do not end up encouraging production and trade in drugs, because that is what is happening now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In facing a decision like this about the Taliban regime, it has to be said that it has really been a luxury, purely and simply, to discuss the other issues, when one considers what is happening in Afghanistan. Ever since I first heard about the Taliban regime, I have been appalled. I find it completely incredible that such things can still be going on in the year 2000, and not only do we not intervene, but we cannot, in reality, do a vast amount about them.</p>
<p class="contents">In war, there will clearly always be a large number of innocent people who suffer distress or die, and very often it is, of course’ women and children and old people who are totally defenceless in a wide range of situations. What is happening here, however, is in fact even worse. It is a far more systematic form of oppression than is to be seen in normal war situations. It is far more systematic and far more violent in relation to a particular group of women. It appears as if it is simply a question of groups of men who find themselves in a world in which nothing else counts but their own solidarity and their own oppression of women. I therefore also think it good that the decision should include some clear and explicit points about the position of women in particular and should draw attention to how necessary it is for us to try to help prevent the Taliban regime from continuing with its wholesale discrimination against women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How many more deaths and displaced persons do there have to be to pierce the veil of our political indifference? How many more tons of drugs injected into the veins of young people worldwide must we deplore? Must we wait until state terrorism is fully established, wait for the victory of Jihad, the application of the expansionist will of religious fanatics to the whole region, before we Members of the European Union finally agree to get involved, as is our duty?</p>
<p class="contents">The long offensive carried on by the Taliban, with quite open support from Pakistan, is now cutting off the peoples of the Northern Alliance from a supply route essential to their survival. The international community can no longer content itself with burying its head in the sand, and conducting ‘wait-and-see’ diplomacy. I think I speak for many people here when I declare our rejection of a comfortable neutrality, making a theory out of passivity and justifying blindness.</p>
<p class="contents">We protest at the sort of neutrality that tends to put the protagonists on the same level, stacking the daily atrocities of the Taliban regime on the same shelf as the armed resistance of Commander Massoud. Massoud is seen as a war leader, but how could it be otherwise after so many battles? But for those who know him and have seen him at work, he is also a man of dialogue and unification. He sees himself as the champion of a tolerant Islam. He can be a man of peace. Massoud insists that there is no military solution to the Afghan problem. He is right. We must act urgently to find political solutions which respect the values underpinning our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the thrust of the resolution drafted by all the groups, which I have the honour of defending here. Essentially it calls on the Council Presidency to bring its influence to bear to put an end to foreign interference in that country. It calls on the Commission to take stock of the humanitarian aid measures intended for the Afghan population so that this aid reaches everyone. Finally it insists, and this is the essential point, that the European Union coordinate its initiatives with those of neighbouring countries to impose a solution whereby peace, stability, and respect for international law and the most elementary human rights can be re-established.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that this will not be an easy task, but here I would like to quote the motto of a great European, William of Orange: “Hope is not necessary to engagement, nor success to perseverance.” </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The predicament of Afghan women is a particularly apt case in point. Women cannot go to work, girls cannot go to school, women cannot walk freely down the street, and they are stoned, to name but a few examples. There is not a single human rights organisation working in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the country that has the most mines. It is a country where there is no hope for the children. 75% of the boys and 90% of the girls do not go to school. It is one of the poorest countries and there is a forgotten war going on. I feel this all goes to show just how important this resolution is. On balance, it is clear that the international organisations and the UN are not doing enough as matters stand. In other words, the conflict is far more complex, there is no solution in the offing and yet, as we all agree, there is an urgent need for one.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has an important task before it in this respect. It could bring its ideas on non-military conflict management to bear. There are a few examples I could mention: the monitoring of weapons exports and small arms through to the end-user, so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there, support for non-governmental organisations and women’s organisations based there, which are courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation. In particular, in light of the above, it is absolutely imperative that the Member States grant asylum to all those who flee Afghanistan, as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="contents">It would do the EU’s image no harm at all if it were to get a political initiative off the ground in the United Nations, with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrible suffering has been caused by this conflict. I, too, support the joint resolution, of course. But I want to join previous speakers in emphasising two concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue is the position of women. It is not something we can get used to it. We must never trivialise it. They still endure appalling conditions: they are denied access to work, health care and education. They live in destitution and permanent insecurity. They are regularly victims of stonings. They are suppressed in the true sense of the word. All Afghan women, whatever their age, are faced with systematic violation of their most fundamental rights. That is why I also believe they should be entitled to the right of asylum. The European Union must renew its solidarity with all Afghan women in their struggle at home and abroad against the Taliban regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that the Taliban are clearly seeking international recognition, on the grounds that they now control virtually all of Afghanistan. So peace, stability and respect for rights can only be re-established through a political solution. Greater involvement of the European Union is definitely needed. And in that search, I believe it is vital for the Council to reinforce the restrictions it has decided on.

<p class="contents">Around a million people, most of them children, have been mutilated by anti-personnel mines. The urgent resolution to be put to the vote today calls for the concerns voiced by Parliament on many occasions to be translated into further practical initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point which I must stress in particular. There has been a budget heading for the funding of mine clearance and prevention programmes for many years now. Funding has been allocated for 2000 and will be provided for 2001 as well. We need to take immediate action to prevent thousands of children inadvertently triggering tragic explosions while they are playing in the fields, and receiving disabling wounds. We can do this. The operations have been endorsed and are viable, but the funding is being held up by bureaucracy, by the need to assess previous actions and by confusion over the responsibilities of the different departments.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, look up from your texts, find out what is going on outside the realm of documents: thousands of children are in danger. Rise above sluggishness and uncertainty. Yes, carry out all the assessments you want to, but, in the meantime, let the funds for 2000 reach their destination and you will be saving the lives and preventing the mutilation of a great many unfortunate people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Other Members have already spoken of a million displaced people, a million people mutilated by landmines, thousands of women deprived of their most basic rights, such as the right to education, health, work, or to move around freely: it must be terrible for many of these women, who are accustomed to education, to a secular way of life, to be confined to that area with no freedom. And we do need to take this into account in the European institutions, as well as the fact that drug cultivation is used to buy arms.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning – and I will shortly conclude, Mr President – a code of conduct was approved on the sale and trafficking of arms. I do not think that this code will be useful unless it is effective in preventing weapons from reaching the hands of people who are committing very serious violations against human rights, as these people are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We only have to cast our minds back to the events in Afghanistan this summer. The Taliban launched a new military attack on their northern opponents in the middle of the worst drought this poor country has had since time immemorial.</p>
<p class="contents">This drought has resulted in a drop in harvest by an estimated 2.3 million tonnes of food. This essentially renders a quarter of the total Afghan population dependent on grain supplies from the World Food Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in just such a tragic situation that the country’s radical Islamic rulers revolted against the UN’s so-called bread programme in the capital of Kabul. This was a project that was due to benefit 28 000 war widows, no less. The Taliban’s excuse? There are countless bakeries which offer employment to women.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this – at least in western eyes – inhumane policy, the Taliban is seeking international diplomatic recognition. They seize on cooperation in the return of millions of Afghan refugees, sponsored by the United Nations, as official global acceptance of their unbearable tyranny. It remains very much to be seen whether this religious barbarism is really sufficient for us to form a closed international containment front against the hosts of Jihad conspirator, Osama bin Laden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increasing numbers of people are fleeing from the fighting. Some sources put the number of displaced people at 90 000. Many of these are now seeking sanctuary in makeshift camps in the mountains in the north-east of the country. The conditions there could go badly downhill when winter sets in.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this development, ECHO, the Commission agency for humanitarian aid, is currently working hard to put together a package of emergency aid to the value of EUR 3 million, in order to support these displaced people with medical supplies, food, and the means to get through the winter. In addition, ECHO has already made EUR 5.7 million available this year for the victims of drought in Afghanistan, for mine clearance in the north of the country and for the resettlement of refugees. The victims of drought are also due to receive a further EUR 3 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity to say, in response to Mrs Paciotti’s comment, that naturally I will not hesitate to inquire within the Commission today as to what has become of the funding for mine clearance and what is going to become of it. Should I find that there are bureaucratic stumbling blocks here, as you put it, then you have my word that I will do all I can to overcome these obstacles with all speed.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Members are well aware that the Commission has a long-term commitment to the Afghan refugees and those who have been displaced within Afghanistan itself. Between 1991 and 2000, the Commission made a total of EUR 400 million available for refugee aid, humanitarian emergency aid and food aid. A significant slice of this was earmarked for mine clearance and associated information campaigns conducted by UN agencies, European or Afghan non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">With its common position on Afghanistan, the European Union is supporting the United Nations’ special mission in Afghanistan, and the efforts to achieve peace undertaken by the General Secretary’s special representatives. The Union has resolved to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the country, and it is as plain as day that this will not come about until human rights and fundamental values are given full recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the common position roundly condemns the ongoing discrimination against women in Afghanistan and other human rights violations that take place there. As long as the Taliban leadership continues to be as ambiguous in its statements on opium cultivation as it has been hitherto, the Commission refuses to support any anti-drugs projects in Afghanistan. That said, it will give staunch support to the neighbouring countries, so as to improve their chances of tackling the drugs problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
