<p class="contents">Cinematography is an art form contained on a fragile medium, which therefore requires positive, quick and effective action from the public authorities to ensure its preservation. Films bear comprehensive witness to our times. The protection of the European film heritage, including co-productions with third countries, is therefore in the interest of future generations. In order to ensure that the European film heritage is passed down to future generations, it has to be systematically collected, catalogued, preserved and restored. It should also be made accessible for educational, cultural, research or other non-commercial use; in all cases, in compliance with copyright and related rights. It is therefore the Commission’s intention to promote European standards on the cataloguing of films and we have therefore given a mandate to the European Committee for Standardisation to go ahead with preparatory work. That will facilitate the exchange of information and the interoperability of the databases that are kept by the film archives in all Member States. The Commission will also promote cooperation between film archives. One advantage of this cooperation will be the possibility of recuperating and restoring so-called ‘lost films’.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and the amendments discussed today reflect the thorough work by the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs on the one hand, and the presidency on the other. I would like to thank Mr Hegyi for his very constructive work in that respect. The Commission is grateful to all the key players who made it possible to reach a good compromise today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal, as amended by Parliament, recommends that Member States introduce an obligation to deposit cinematographic works that form part of a Member State’s audiovisual heritage and that have received public funding. Also, and in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, the text gives Member States the option as to how to implement this obligation, by law or by means of contract: we leave that up to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">A recommendation is the best-adapted instrument available for achieving the objectives of the proposed measures. They are: first, strengthening of the film industry by laying the foundations for the explanation of sleeping catalogues by rights holders; and secondly, the systematic deposit, collection and conservation of Member States’ visual heritages. The Commission is very satisfied –– and I think the citizens are, too – with the prospect of a first reading agreement. The Commission accepts Parliament’s amendments insofar as they correspond to the political agreement reached between Parliament and the presidency and confirmed by Coreper on 2 May 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gyula Hegyi (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, cinema is the beloved child of European culture. It was born in the golden age of European civilisation, together with other scientific and important technological inventions. All that happened before the Great Wars period and before the illusion of the 19th century broke into pieces. Cinema was born in Paris, the capital of art, revolution and glamour at the time. In the space of a year the first films were shown all over Europe in cafes, theatres and other public places. Films and filming became a rapidly developing activity for thousands of mostly young men and women. In the first three decades of cinema history the European silent film conquered the word thanks to its artistic merits.</p>
<p class="contents">The young American film industry was also pioneered by gifted European immigrants. The invention of the talking movie definitively changed the world of cinema. Multilingualism proved a barrier to the marketing of cinematographic products and some might have felt that the linguistic richness of Europe of which we are so proud became a disadvantage from a competition perspective. This paradoxical situation should be tackled through subsidising cinematographic products with national and European funds – not the film industry as a business but its cultural and linguistic plurality, which is the very essence of Europe, needs that funding. Every European government should do its best to defend our unique cultural richness, protecting and encouraging European cinema, which speaks to every European nation in its mother tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the strong commitment of our governments to maintaining the existing formula for subsidising cinema. Film and filming is not only art and entertainment. After the Second World War many destroyed buildings were reconstructed with the help of film sequences. The film heritage of Europe covers every aspect of our life from the end of the 19th century to the dawn of this new century. The preservation of this heritage means the preservation of the memories of our culture and history, everyday life, big events, small tragedies and common joys. If the old films are lost, younger people are hardly likely to understand their ancestors’ lives. The national film archives play an important role in preserving our film heritage. If a film is properly archived its message will be saved for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reason why I, as rapporteur, recommend the compulsory depositing of every European film made for public distribution in the archives. The national film institutes and archives of Europe should harmonise and standardise their archiving systems. In doing so we can ensure that our film heritage will really become our common and public heritage. The digitalisation of European films, the setting up of a common database and the cooperation of the national film academies and archives serve a common aim: to save our film heritage and to make it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, in the form of a recommendation, aims at ensuring a more systematic deposit and preservation of European films to safeguard Europe’s audiovisual heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that due to a very constructive approach by my Parliament colleagues, Mrs Descamps and Mrs Gibault, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, as also the inclusive and active role played by the Luxembourg presidency, a good compromise for first reading agreement has been achieved. This dossier shows the added value of codecision and serves as a good example of how Parliament and the Council can together agree on a number of important issues that can make the initial Commission proposal more comprehensive and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me point to those issues to which Parliament attached great priority and which were taken on board by the Council. As a result of Parliament’s approach, the deposit of films will, in all cases, be mandatory or compulsory, so that a systematic collection is secured throughout Europe. There is now a definite time period within which Member States have to adopt the necessary measures to ensure the preservation of the European film heritage. In order to ensure the quality of the deposited works, it is now a requirement that the deposited copy has to be of high quality. In order to make our common film heritage as comprehensive as possible it is stipulated that after a transitional period every film must be deposited and not only those that receive public funding. In order to know what collection each Member State has, the report proposes a network of databases, where already functioning Council of Europe institutions such as the European Observatory in Strasbourg can play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a good compromise has been found. I ask you to support the report to enable the first reading agreement, which would be in the interests of our common film heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the kind words of Commissioner Reding, from Luxembourg. We both started our careers as young journalists, as film or theatre critics. It is good that we can cooperate on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My Opinion on film heritage and the competitiveness of related industrial activities allowed me to investigate the functioning of the European film industry, an industry that produces films accounting for 25% of the European market. Unfortunately, approximately 65% of the films produced are commercial productions outside the European Union, mostly in the United States. Obviously, the European film industry does not have a competitive advantage in this case. Frankly, this is not good enough. While I have no problem with American culture or with the American film industry, I believe it is important that we protect European culture and improve the European film industry in any way we can. If one looks at the success of the industry in India, Bollywood is a case in point of where it can be done and has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">One means of tackling this problem is through the provision of state aid. I welcome the fact that the Commission cinema communication identified the importance of state aid to the film industry as a means of promoting culture. Also, the extension of the validity period of this specific state aid to June 2007 is evidence that it provides a high degree of stability and much-needed legal certainty to the industry. For the end users, this ensures the continuation of vital support schemes such as the Irish Film Board.</p>
<p class="contents">I have stipulated to the Commission that higher levels of state aid should be considered in the areas of culture and difficult films. Any reduction in state aid to the film industry would be unwarranted and undesirable. State aid as a means of promoting culture is important because it means national films are shot nationally and not offshore. This helps to maintain nationally specialised skills and expertise required for audio-visual creations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all film-making should be determined a cultural activity, thereby exempting it from the notion that it is an obstacle to the single market. I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has indicated a willingness to consider high levels of aid in the next review of the cinema communication. I hope this indication will soon be turned into application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has an identity that has been shaped by an exceptional accumulation of cultural heritage, including film, which has contributed both to shaping this identity and to safeguarding and developing cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hegyi’s report therefore aims, on the one hand, to ensure the preservation and conservation of our national and European film heritage and, on the other hand, to improve the conditions required for the competitiveness of industrial activities related to this heritage. In order to achieve these results, it is advisable that the cinematographic works making up this heritage are systematically collected, catalogued, preserved and restored, whilst respecting copyright issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential point in this report concerns the nature of the deposit of cinematographic works within organisations commissioned by the Member States, which should carry a legal or contractual obligation. In terms of the material deposited, moreover, the copy should be of a high technical quality to enable good use to be made of the film at a later date. It is furthermore specified that this film heritage should include the production, but also the co-production of films between Member States or between a Member State and a third country. An idea has been proposed, moreover, that I find interesting, namely the implementation of a database network for European audiovisual heritage, in collaboration with the Council of Europe and, more specifically, with Eurimage and with the European Audiovisual Observatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a point appears in this report that, in my view, is crucial: the aim for film to be taught at every educational level, and for younger generations to also learn a little about history, everyday life and sociology, thanks to the richness of European film heritage. I should also like to congratulate, in particular, the rapporteur for his excellent, and above all useful, work, that will contribute, I hope, thanks to this effort to preserve cinematographic works, to the development and spread of film culture in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like, in particular, to point out three crucial points that appear in the report. Firstly, it is clear that the cataloguing, preservation and restoration of works are essential to safeguarding cultural diversity in Europe. Secondly, the report rightly points out the importance of undertaking a systematic collection of cinematographic works thanks to the legal obligation for a system of deposit. Finally, emphasis must be placed on the extent to which the development of new technologies is fundamental to ensuring the cataloguing, preservation and restoration of cinematographic works in order that they be of the highest quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to point out the links between this report and the discussions taking place on European programmes in the field of education and Media 2007. This report demands a more active approach on the part of the Member States in the field of visual education, particularly of professional training and media literacy. As the author of the report on the role of education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process – a report that I will shortly be presenting to the Committee on Culture and Education – I fully support this excellent proposal. Our societies have become more tolerant with the development of literacy. We must henceforth all learn to better read images, which have become the essential vehicle for communication between mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to point out that, whilst European cinema is already a fine heritage, it must continue to form part of our future. To this end, I should like to alert my fellow Members to the necessity of integrating financing terms suitable for European film production into the Media 2007 programme. Examples of this exist: the Institute for the financing of film and cultural industries was set up more than 20 years ago in France, precisely to help producers and independent distributors gain access to credit. Access to bank loans is crucial for independent producers, given the way films are financed. I hope that the discussions on the 2007 programme will allow us to find solutions so that the spirit of European cinema is preserved in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also pleased that it has been possible to reach a compromise with the Council, thanks to which, I hope, this report may be adopted at first reading, thus allowing European film heritage to benefit as soon as possible from all the guarantees that this recommendation is going to provide. I am extremely pleased that all the amendments I had tabled have been supported and adopted both by my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education and by those from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe; I would like to thank them very warmly for their confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">This recommendation will undoubtedly give new impetus to European film production and help to drive the development of cinema in the new Member States. I have followed the drawing up of this document very closely, which is of very special interest to us, the French, since we invented the cinema. The Lumière brothers, in Lyon, were the first to perfect the technique of cinema and they inspired its documentary strand.</p>
<p class="contents">A few decades later, Georges Méliès invented the cinema of spectacle and of the imagination. All of the films by the Lumière brothers have been restored by the French Film Archive and have recently been released on DVD. This is why I am convinced that, in order to ensure that nothing is lost, we should emphasise the requirement for the original prints of films to be deposited with a European body and for a database to be created at the European Audiovisual Observatory. What a joy it would be to be able, in that way, to relive the magic moments of L’Arroseur Arrosé; that is what I had in mind when I was working on this Council recommendation. I would also like to stress the role played by film criticism, a French speciality whose writings have encouraged works to be preserved. I am thinking of André Bazin, François Truffaut and Henri Langlois. I am therefore entirely satisfied with this report, which I would ask you to support. Cinema deserves a heritage policy, in the same way as buildings, pictures or books. The same goes for preserving that heritage, piecing together that history and making the link between the past and the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would stress the importance of such ambition from the European level for the European film industry. By way of example of how not to do it and why we need this package, look at Scotland. We have a high-quality film infrastructure, talented technicians and actors and stunning locations, yet we are not known for our film industry. With good reason: our government does not adequately support it. A film about Mary, Queen of Scots, is about to be made in Ireland; a new film version of Macbeth - the Scottish play - will be shot on the Isle of Man. Government support for film is crucial in the global market of the film industry. This report demonstrates why we need a European framework that is ambitious and has a soul to it that we can push forward from a European dimension.</p>

It should also be made accessible to all for the purposes of cultural research, training and enjoyment, a principle that should of course be applied to all other manifestations of cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Policies and practical measures of this nature – involving preserving and maintaining memory within a state that is a fertile breeding ground for all art forms – can help to promote the plurality of the culture of Member States, along with the extraordinary spiritual and material wealth that that brings. They can also help to achieve and encourage the essential European added value that should characterise the cultural projects supported by EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">European culture can only stand its ground in the face of third country cultures by emphasising its own value, thereby making the citizens who identify with it become ever more demanding in terms of quality, as regards both what they create and what they consume. Europe does not have to defend itself against culturally high quality output from elsewhere, which mirrors human dignity; Europe needs such output, too. The important thing is for Europe to compete with them, on a level of quality that is at least comparable.</p>
<p class="contents">Defending Europe is also about protecting us from the potential invasion of dubious products. Nor is it about politically correct conventions that claim to protect cultural diversity, but that actually build barriers on behalf of interests that are to a greater or lesser extent corporate or parochial.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation, although I have my doubts as to its legal effectiveness, given that, whilst it is being referred to as a recommendation, it is in fact a case of harmonisation, which is prohibited by the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe is the cradle of the cinema. Our film heritage must be protected, because it contains a significant proportion of our memory, it expresses our cultural identity and illustrates the diversity of our peoples; as the rapporteur points out, it deals with all aspects of our lives since the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an economic asset the protection of which can contribute to growth and employment, as well as the promotion of the innovation, research and technological development policies that promote general industrial competitiveness. That is the view that the Commission has taken, quite rightly, when basing the recommendation on Article 157 of the Treaty, on the competitiveness of related industrial activities, thereby making codecision possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The domination of the European market by American films — with a share of around 75% — the difficulties faced by European films in transcending the market of their country of origin — they only reach 10% of the Community market — and the lethargy of film production, demand a thorough response. I am therefore very much looking forward to seeing the results of the study announced by the Commission on the economic and cultural impact of the existing State aid and I welcome the Commission's extension of the validity of the criteria for aid to film and television production until 2007, and I am pleased that this has been taken up in Mr Hegyi’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the importance of the public broadcasting bodies in terms of protecting our film heritage, extending its scope to television productions and satisfying public service demands. I believe that they must be taken into account in order to make progress on the development of audiovisual heritage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Film heritage, through its ability to represent diverse national and local cultural realities and to spread Europe’s historical memory – not to mention its educational role – is a useful tool for strengthening Europe’s cultural dimension and common historical identity. It is no coincidence that, in some Member States, film production is already recognised as a cultural asset in law. It is therefore crucial to harmonise legislation with regard to the deposit, conservation and distribution of European films, by appealing to the exchange of best practice in the first instance.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of new technologies, moreover, represents an inevitable shift towards the rationalisation of the costs and resultant competitiveness not only of film production in the strictest sense, but also of all related activities, such as collection, cataloguing and restoration.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, moreover, with the rapporteur both on the focus on disabled people – ensuring better access to deposited works – and on the need to preserve all cinematographic works, and therefore not just those benefiting from public funding, as laid down in the Commission proposal: all of these works have contributed to the history of European cinema, giving an insight into the various trends and influences of different periods.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to make a proposal to Mrs Reding, which takes on a symbolic meaning today, 9 May, Festival of Europe Day: the creation of a European themed film archive that preserves a careful selection of films relating to historical events and episodes concerning the development of the Community project. Film, therefore, acting as an instrument of mediation to promote a more responsive approach from citizens to information and knowledge about Europe and its institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore welcome the report on the film heritage, for I believe that proper and timely storage enables the preservation of the film heritage for later generations, too. </p>
<p class="contents">At a time of rapid development and change it is essential for each nation to preserve its identity and national heritage, and this applies especially to small nations such as Slovenia. For this reason Member States need to support their film industries, national film academies and film projects, or a gap will appear in the film records of parts of the history, life and culture of the nation. </p>
<p class="contents">Since modern people spend a large amount of time watching films, there is also an urgent need for education in this area, and this applies especially to young people. Greater familiarity will afford a more prominent place for high-quality films which may not necessarily be made to attract the broad mass of viewers, but whose mission is nevertheless diminished if the viewer is not capable of recognising quality. I therefore support proposed Amendment 10, in which the proposer recommends to Member States that they promote visual education and media literacy within national education systems and professional training programmes. Indeed the point of preserving the film heritage lies in the accessibility of these archives for the needs of education, research and cultural links. And since our age is also the age of sound films, film is also a good and effective medium for the more rapid learning of languages, so I believe that for the preservation of authenticity, subtitles are generally more appropriate than dubbing.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like today in plenary to congratulate Mr Hegyi, on his excellent report on the protection of film heritage which is the result, as we have heard, of his knowledge of the cinema.</p>
<p class="contents">European cinema, the cherished offspring of European culture, has produced thousands of cinematographic works over the last 100 years which are a unique memorial to its culture. The proper preservation, the rescuing of these works, is equivalent to the preservation of the culture of the image and of our history. These films make it much easier for us to understand the development and the progress of life on our continent and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important that the European Union is taking an initiative today, albeit in the form of a recommendation to the Member States, in which preserving the film heritage is raised to a priority objective while, at the same time, specific and realistic measures are proposed to make it feasible. This report rightly emphasises the important role which the national film archives have in preserving European films.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must give serious consideration to the application of a system of mandatory deposit of new film productions in their film archives. The Member States should take suitable measures to ensure that this heritage is collected, catalogued, preserved, restored and made accessible. This will result not only in the preservation of old films, but also in the creation of jobs. I believe that the present recommendation is just the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is most encouraging that the views of Parliament and of the Council are identical on this subject and it is interesting that two journalists – Mrs Reding and Mr Hegyi – have the leading roles. The decision to approve the proposal for a recommendation at first reading brings us one step closer to its application, so that substantial measures can start to be taken as quickly as possible in order to preserve the film heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">The 20th century was defined as the century of the culture of the image. I trust and believe that the 21st century can be the century of the knowledge of history through the image of culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament, the Commission and the Council are on the same wavelength, and that is a good thing, because we are talking here about nothing more or less than preserving our common heritage, building upon our roots and ensuring that not only our rich film heritage of over a century is preserved for future generations but also, and in the same way, the cinema created today and in the future, since this is our future heritage. This is a duty we owe to our cultures, and it is good that all our energies should be combined in taking action along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with the rapporteur and with the honourable Members who said that accessibility was important. It is not just the heritage that is important, but also public access to that heritage. This is why the Commission is investing in search engines and in research in general in order to ensure that old films are better preserved. Access is, however, also needed to this heritage that has been made available, and, in this respect too, I am in agreement with Parliament, which wants our young generations to be taught to read images. Indeed, it makes no sense for young people to learn to decipher words and to understand figures but not to have access to the images that make up almost everything that surrounds them and only to experience them in a passive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">My theory is as follows. European films require an active response. One cannot remain passive when watching a European film or simply allow oneself to be carried along by it. It needs to be read, and reading skills need to be acquired for that purpose. We must therefore ensure that our younger generation learns to read the language of our cinema. We have already had several pilot projects in schools, but that is not sufficient. Such projects must be launched across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">I am genuinely happy to see such wonderful harmony within this Chamber on a 9 May. This is a good sign, a sign that Europe is moving forward and realises that we have a common history and a common future. With regard to this common future, I would like to add a word on state aid. Even though what I am saying may be entirely superfluous, I wish to say it since questions are constantly addressed to me on this issue, and I believe I must respond to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is no danger at all of the Commission interfering with the state aid aimed at promoting the cinema. So please do not worry each time the Commission carries out its work of analysing the situation on the ground, and do not imagine that this work is aimed at removing whatever has been provided until now. We have so far analysed many national systems of aid for the cinema, if not all of them. We have always offered our support and we will continue to do so. Everybody must play their role. I am convinced, however - and I make this commitment to you - that European cinema needs assistance and that we shall continue to offer it help.</p>
