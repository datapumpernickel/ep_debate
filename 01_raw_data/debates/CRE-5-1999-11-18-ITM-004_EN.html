Now, I would inform you that the last amendments to the Giannakou-Koutsikou report were distributed yesterday evening. The last translated amendment, the French version of amendment No 20, was distributed at 9.52 p.m. yesterday evening. Therefore, the requisite 24 hours laid down in the Rules of Procedure have not passed, either for the debate or for the vote, so I would like to ask the President whether we are going to enforce an urgency that completely violates the Rules this time as well, because, in that case, we can throw the Rules of Procedure away and decide that we can do everything that is urgent as long as we establish that it is urgent. I do not believe that there have even been any proposals tabled on the urgency of this report. I would therefore like to know whether this debate and the vote will take place in exactly the same way as the debate on the Napolitano report, in contravention of our Rules of Procedure. This is the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To tell the truth, given that the issue is considered very sensitive by many, I regret the fact that the debate and what I am about to say on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is not being broadcast in any way. </p>
<p class="contents">What I am about to say is quite important. The text, which did not obtain the required qualified majority during October’s part-session in this Chamber, has been amended on the initiative of the largest political group, which at the time expressed reservations and demanded further clarification. </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has, in fact, adopted three amendments by Mr Méndez de Vigo, which, for the purposes of the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement within Parliament, give a special role to Parliament’s President herself, to whom all information regarding the Members will be sent. In addition, the Committee has adopted an amendment by Mr Nassauer and Mr Brok, that is the new Article 4 of the model decision, and I shall quote the amendment word for word – "Rules governing Members’ parliamentary immunity and the right to refuse to testify shall remain unchanged”. </p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we have further strengthened the guarantee, which was already present in several parts of the text, of full compliance with the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities – and, in particular, I want to mention Article 10 of the Protocol, which is very precise and exhaustive – and full compliance with the related Rules, in particular, Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure, which, in implementation of the provisions of article 10 of the Protocol to the Article I have just mentioned, regulates Members’ immunities even more closely. </p>
<p class="contents">So allow me to say to those Members who have expressed doubts and concerns that, thanks to these amendments tabled by Members from the European People’s Party, they can vote for this text with peace of mind. </p>
<p class="contents">However, I must immediately recall and reaffirm what the mandate given to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was – President Fontaine reminded us too – and the subject of the decision that Parliament has to take. The mandate was, and still is, simply the following – the decision to be taken is this: to include the interinstitutional agreement in the Rules of Procedure, i.e. our internal regulations, so that it can be applied within Parliament, on the basis of an opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control; to amend the Rules of Procedure by introducing a new Rule 9b and not to amend the interinstitutional agreement. I would point this out, in particular, to those Members who were not Members of the previous Parliament. Personally, I am in the same situation: Parliament gave its President the mandate to sign this interinstitutional agreement on 6 May last year, and it was signed on 25 May.</p>
<p class="contents">I respect the opinion of those Members – newly elected or already Members of Parliament – who have expressed reservations and concerns about this Agreement, but I had to consider those amendments that seek to change the interinstitutional agreement, which we are simply required to implement as it is, to be inadmissible in committee. What you perhaps consider worrying, what you will read, is not a Parliamentary decision; it is the model decision that is part of the interinstitutional agreement, already published – with the identical wording – in the Official Journal of 31 May last year. We have limited ourselves to introducing technical adjustments to allow proper implementation within Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by pointing out that, if the experience of implementing this interinstitutional agreement suggests that that some of its aspects need to be discussed with the other institutions again, this can easily be done in the future. Nevertheless, today, I think that we have the duty not to deny the signature with which we confirmed our commitment to implementing the interinstitutional agreement. </p>

The first question is: is the proposal in accordance with the rules of the OLAF European Parliament and Council Regulation of 25 May 1999? And the second question is: is the proposal in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to the first question is an obvious “yes”. The proposal is in accordance with the Regulation. The answer to the second question is not so easy. It was the intention of the agreement to find a solution to the<span class="italic"> </span>whistle-blower problem, that is to say, to the question of what an official should do if he obtains knowledge of fraud or clues suggesting corruption but – for whatever reason – does not want to confide in his superiors. We have said that he should then approach OLAF directly. This possibility is now excluded in the proposal before us in the case of Members of this House. That is justified because the Members are protected in a special way by the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities in the performance of their duties. This protection goes further than the protection enjoyed by the Members of the EU Commission through this Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is only that the proposal that officials should approach the President of the Parliament directly, will create more problems than it solves. It is foreseeable that the press will then regularly ask: How many cases are there and which ones? If there are none, they will say that they have intimidated their officials to such an extent that nobody trusts himself or herself any more. If there are some, then they will try to drag each of these cases into the spotlight. I would have preferred to take up the original proposal by the Committee on Budgetary Control in its opinion for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in which this whole series of questions is ignored and only the rights and obligations of the Members is covered. That would have left us time to consider other questions in peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, nevertheless, that given the difficult circumstances, Mr Napolitano has drawn up a very good report and I should like to support him in the vote this lunchtime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe he is right, that this is an issue that was difficult to incorporate into our Rules of Procedure and that, in the end, it has been resolved satisfactorily. Of course, there were perhaps other possibilities, but in this Parliament there was, above all, one concern: to fulfil the objectives which we had set. That is to say, fight fraud, corruption and any illegal activity which harms our Community.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are a political Assembly and politicians – as we know well – are subject to all kinds of influences. We have tried to prevent a healthy, specific political objective from being misinterpreted and misused. That discussion which we held in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the means by which any possible illegal activity could be brought to the knowledge of OLAF, I believe has led us to a suitable means, because a political body must have a filter which can examine whether this information is well-founded or not and whether or not it contravenes the immunity and inviolability of Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I believe that the amendments which we have introduced in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs fulfil the objective of reconciling the decision of the three institutions with the characteristics of our own decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to congratulate two people in particular. One is the President of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, who is in a way the mother of OLAF and of all these regulations. The other, who I consider to be the father of the current regulation, is Mr Napolitano, who has shown great moderation, intelligence and, above all, courage, in the quest for this difficult solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report applies within Parliament a text that was agreed by the last Parliament, was approved in principle in plenary when we authorised our President to sign it, signed by all the institutions and now applies within each of them except, until today, within Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament it met with unanimous support in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs the first time it was discussed and the first time we debated it here, every single one of the major political groups said that it supported the proposal. At the last minute there were some difficulties and the matter was reconsidered in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but I believe that the difficulties and concerns that were raised have been adequately dealt with. May I remind you that the provisions which would apply to Members of the Parliament are, to quote the text itself, "without prejudice to the provisions of the Treaties and in particular the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities". There is a specific reference also in the preamble to the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities and there is a reference to the fact that the relevant article is without prejudice to the confidentiality requirements that may be laid down for Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position as Members of the European Parliament is safeguarded in this respect, and Members who had genuine fears that this would be some sort of snoopers' charter or some sort of a new right given to officials to report confidentially on MEPs with wild allegations can rest assured that this is not the case. The reports would go to OLAF, be properly investigated and would protect the position of MEPs. If we failed to approve this today, we would be in the untenable situation that only MEPs would be above the law in this respect: a text that applies within the Council to politicians and officials alike, in the Commission to politicians and officials alike, would apply in Parliament only to our officials and not to Members of the European Parliament. That would be totally unacceptable and would destroy the credibility of this Parliament. It is essential that this report be adopted today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Serious cultural problems have emerged inside this Parliament as we have debated the issues involved. My group has considered it very carefully and we conclude that it is a technical putting into effect of the agreement that the Parliament has signed on parliamentary immunity, and privileges will not be removed without due process. All the points expressed in the various amendments are already sensibly covered. Parliament's assent to this agreement is already five months late, and the public simply would not appreciate a further refusal to make progress and to create a strict but fair regime for the Parliament as for the other bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would be good, as we have fought for it. However, what we have not fought for and are most resolutely against and where we see the position of Parliament and of the independent mandate jeopardised to a great extent, is if investigations can be initiated against freely elected Members of Parliament, not only on suspicion but on mere supposition if a system of compulsory informing is set up here, if not for fraud and corruption but for overall authorisation, and I quote, “to intervene in serious incidents in the performance of one’s duty".</p>
<p class="contents">Just imagine, that investigations against Members of Parliament for serious incidents in the performance of their duties – a completely fabricated undefined legal concept that contradicts the constitutional tradition of each of the fifteen Member States – could be introduced, that investigations could be initiated if Members of Parliament contravene duties comparable with the disciplinary law for career public servants, a disciplinary law we do not have and comparable duties that do not exist! That is an overall authorisation of an authority that not only exposes the Members of Parliament to all kinds of informing but which opens a system of informing and political agitation that makes a mockery of an independent mandate and a free Parliament. That has nothing to do with combating fraud. The Council has attacked the position of the Parliament at its core and damaged it!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to say to Mr Corbett that a Member of the European Parliament has never been above the law, even if these Rules of Procedure are not changed. We are always subject to the law and also to criminal law. That must be stressed quite clearly, independently of our internal Rules here.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with here is the method by which the controls, checks and investigations are carried out. I am of the opinion that we must ensure that the freedom of the individual Members of Parliament, including those who belong to a minority, must be protected from political pressure from outside and from within, so that they are not overrun with proceedings so that they are in the end so involved that they cannot deal with the situation any more. That is the classic principle of the independence of the mandate that has been fought for over many centuries, particularly as protection from the executive. Only in this way is the Member of Parliament able to exercise control. He must have the right to refuse to bear witness, without any ‘ifs’ or ‘buts’. This already applies to us but the ways in which it applies partially negate it. A Member of Parliament can then only if he has this right to refuse to bear witness, keep information to himself and only then will people come to him and tell him something if they know that he must not inform on them. Only then can we exercise control within the meaning of Parliament vis--vis the executive and we should not ruin this by linking everything – whether officials, the executive or the Members of Parliament in one and the same Article.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is adopted here today and the anger dies down, we would perhaps then again have the strength to check whether with a proper goal the inclusion of the Members of Parliament in control mechanisms can protect this independent mandate and perhaps lead to some other phrasing. This is not possible just now in the heat of the moment and I would ask my colleagues to remember this if it comes up again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
