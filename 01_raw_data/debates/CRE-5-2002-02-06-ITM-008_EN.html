<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napolitano (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the forthcoming Convention will only fulfil its mandate if it provides convincing responses on a key point: how to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of the process of European integration. This is the starting point for the report which has been adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and is now before the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, all aware that the Convention has to redefine the Union’s missions, its role on the world stage, in global development and in working for peace, its growth and cohesion policies and its policy of security in freedom and justice. However, it would be a mistake to dismiss all the rest as pure institutional technicalities, as abstract exercises in institutional engineering of no interest whatsoever to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason why the European cause has lost the citizens’ support is because the difficulty of influencing or even understanding the Union’s decisions makes them feel removed from too many of them. To regain support, it is vital to make it absolutely clear who is taking the decisions in the Union, how the decisions can be made transparent and comprehensible and how they can be monitored, and by which institutions the citizens can be effectively represented in Europe. All these points are questions precisely of democracy, indeed they are questions which are crucial to democracy. The role of the parliamentary institution with regard to these issues is vital, although not decisive in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore take a firm decision to strengthen the role of the parliamentary institution in the Union’s structure, to further parliamentarise the Union, supplementing the progress achieved during the 90s. Parliamentarisation must occur in two areas: the European Parliament and the national parliaments. Both contribute equally to the democratic legitimisation of the European Union as a Union of citizens and peoples rather than just States. To spell it out, if, as the European Parliament, we have been guilty of a certain exclusivism, we must change our attitude. We need to eliminate any mutual mistrust between the European Parliament and national parliaments; we need to understand the concerns of national parliaments and propose appropriate solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report I am presenting to you sets forth three paths for action: Firstly, national parliaments should have greater guidance and supervisory powers over their respective governments and should be able to exercise these powers effectively. Secondly, there needs to be increasingly close, systematic cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments, including through interparliamentary agreements signed by the respective leaders. This is an innovative idea whose development I entrust chiefly to the initiative of the President of the European Parliament. Thirdly, both national and European Members of Parliament should be endowed with a constituent power, to be shared with the governments and the Commission – as in the Convention, which is about to start work – to work on revising the Treaties with a view, we can now say, to producing a genuine European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the appropriate solutions to pursue, not those which would lead to confusion of the roles of the European Parliament and national parliaments and add to the unwieldiness of the Union’s institutional structure and decision-making mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, as a House of Lords report has regretfully shown, a second Chamber made up of members of national parliaments ‘would be an unreal solution to some real problems’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my firm hope that the spirit of this report will be properly interpreted and welcomed and that, with your support, the Convention will have the benefit of our contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hence the timeliness of the debate on this report tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which includes the opinion of the Committee on External Affairs for which I had the honour of drafting its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In my personal view, Mr Napolitano’s report has many merits, and on this I congratulate him, but it also advocates some options that can be criticised from a political point of view. In the capacity in which I am speaking today, however, I must limit myself to listing the objectives pursued in the opinion delivered by my Committee, which have been partially echoed in the motions for resolutions we are now discussing, specifically in Nos 13, 14 and 15.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external policy and common security, including defence, which, as is well known, remains essentially in the intergovernmental sphere, listing the issues is relatively simple: on the one hand, the European Parliament currently performs its supervisory role by means of the right to be informed and the right to be consulted conferred on it by Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union and by means of its budgetary powers to approve operational expenditure on civilian crisis management and on associated administrative tasks; on the other, national parliaments do not enjoy genuine participation in the drafting of such policy, although they do have decisive powers over the military expenditure of their respective countries, which then have a major influence on the operational resources made available to the CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions of Title V of the Treaty on European Union require the Member States to observe the principles of coordination and mutual solidarity when defining and implementing the CFSP, so this democratic and parliamentary deficit must be corrected. Because of its significance and importance, I would highlight the proposal for a Parliamentary Conference on the CFSP to be held on a regular basis, to be convened jointly by the parliament of the Member State holding the presidency and by the European Parliament, in which Members of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments would participate, with the specific intention of improving the essential exchange of information in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the current institutional framework, this conference would enable the various Parliaments to undertake their work more effectively in accordance with their respective competences. What is more, however, with this proposal we are also giving form to the principle that both the European Parliament and the national parliaments represent the peoples of the European Union, since both are directly elected by the citizens and both provide full guarantees of the exercise of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are few differences between the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and his report. In particular we want to endorse firmly the point in his conclusion that the so-called second chamber of the European legislature would be an unworkable third chamber and we are very glad that the suggestion has been so carefully refuted from inside one of the countries from which it emerged, namely the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">On the report itself, the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs were largely adopted by the rapporteur in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Our paragraph 1, dealing with collaboration among the parliaments of the Union, is well covered in his paragraph 10; our paragraph 2, on the importance of participation of representatives of the European Parliament and national parliaments in the future Convention, has been adopted by Mr Napolitano.</p>
<p class="contents">This is very important because it speaks of the need for vigorous debate in the Convention to see whether we can produce a consensus. Some rumours emanating from the direction of Mr Giscard d'Estaing suggest that his idea is that there need not be a debate because all will be clear from the presidency. If that is so, we must disabuse him of that notion. This has to be a Convention that will debate. In paragraph 4, that reappears as paragraph 12 in the Napolitano report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the one point of difference between the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mr Napolitano was whether there ought to be articulate and express mention of the role of regional parliaments with legislative power in this report. I think strongly there ought to be. The Committee on Legal Affairs voted for it clearly and my own group has tabled some amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Napolitano said to me privately that he thinks this could be taken up on a different occasion through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. If he were able to make an assurance to that effect tomorrow, it might be possible for us to reconsider things. I shall speak to him privately about that. It would be good if we could go forward with maximum agreement. I ask, in the mean time, that Parliament concentrate on this paragraph 3 and the parallel amendments tabled by myself and colleagues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as colleagues know, today across Europe there is popular discontent with regard to Europe's apparent disconnection from ordinary life. The European political process is widely seen as an elite preoccupation of little or no relevance to many outside the political classes. Quite rightly concern about this crosses national boundaries and the ideological divide. It is a wish to try to remedy this discontent that lies behind Mr Napolitano's report, which we in the PPE-DE Group support.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a number of responses to this unhappy and unacceptable state of affairs, one of which included the suggestion of establishing a second European parliamentary chamber comprising national parliamentarians. The conclusions of this report, as the rapporteur has already mentioned, echo a recently published report from the House of Lords in my own country. They recognise the important role of national parliaments, but reject the argument for a further second chamber. Rather than further encumbering the European political process, this report recognises that it is for the European Parliament in its sphere, and national parliaments in theirs, in accordance with their own national traditions, to scrutinise their own governments' conduct of European business and activities in the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Consensus has rightly emerged that an important component of the way to reconnect Europe with national political life, and through that with European citizens, is through an alliance between the European Parliament and national parliaments and national politics, which at present seem to give insufficient weight to thorough and comprehensive scrutiny of European matters. In this report Mr Napolitano, as befits the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and rapporteur, has most skilfully woven together an approach to improving relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments and to strengthening cooperation between them.</p>
<p class="contents">The pedantic constitutional purist from any one Member State might cavil at some of the detail, but this report provides a template for action which cannot be carried out by any single parliament. Changes must take place in a wider framework of change and democratic openness on all sides. If political and democratic openness and acceptability matter – and no political group in this House believes in them more than we in the PPE-DE Group do – the Napolitano report represents an important starting point. But we must not complacently rest on our laurels now. This report represents words; we must now see action. Change, in line with the thrust of the report's conclusions and catalysed by the Laeken Convention as the rapporteur himself pointed out, is needed to start to remedy these democratic deficiencies in the European political system which, if left unattended, could be so damaging. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, judging by the results of the latest Eurobarometer, the people of Europe have more trust in their police force than in their parliaments. This is an alarming sign, which should compel the people’s elected representatives to work together to eliminate the reasons for this. The legitimacy of democratic regimes is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to the MPs of each Member State to reduce the democratic deficits that are appearing at national level, and which also exist at this level. In the report before us today, MEPs are being called on to examine how the role played by the national parliaments in European integration could be strengthened. Not to the detriment of the role of the European Parliament, but to complement it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Napolitano, the rapporteur, is proposing a number of specific measures which have been approved by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and which could, in my view, easily receive the unanimous approval of the Convention. Mr Napolitano quite rightly calls for the powers of the national parliament vis-à-vis their respective governments to be strengthened, prior to decisions being taken in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In some of our Member States, the procedure of influencing decisions is well organised. In other States, it does not even exist in embryonic form. To put it simply, the national parliaments let their government get on with things and complain afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, quite rightly, also rules out the idea of a second or even a third legislative chamber. A new institution such as this falls at the stumbling block posed by the question ‘why set up a new institution?’</p>
<p class="contents">If we ‘institutionalise’ the Convention with the participation of the national parliaments, this is another way of exerting a much-needed influence at the preparatory stage of the extensive reforms. It is clear that the method advocated by the European Parliament must henceforth be used to reform the Treaty and it could even go beyond constitutional matters. For example, why not call a convention to prepare the next European Union multi-annual financial programme? If this financial envelope must incorporate a new specific resource in the form of a European tax, I think it is essential that the representatives of the national parliaments deliberate it from the outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But they ought to focus on what they do best and not tread upon the prerogatives of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">What national parliaments must improve on doing is to scrutinise and check the executive power of the Council. What they do worst is to second-guess the legislative powers of the European Parliament. That is why we firmly reject the British proposals to insert a third legislative chamber composed of national MPs, whose function would be "to police subsidiarity". Such a national cuckoo inside the federal nest would shatter the codecision procedure, which is the key formula in the Union's own march towards becoming a mature post-national parliamentary democracy. Such a chamber would be stuffed with dutiful poodles of the Council, making a mockery of parliamentary involvement in European affairs at the national level. I trust the British government will listen to the debate on this question in the Convention and then withdraw its dangerous and obscurantist proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an excellent report, explaining without ambiguity the national parliaments' tasks and role in the area of legitimising and monitoring national governments' legislative activities in the Council, in intergovernmental cooperation, where this monitoring function is not at all adequate, but also in the involvement of the national parliaments in the development of a European constitution, summed up in the word ‘Convention’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note, in this context, how this issue keeps appearing on the agenda, for there is no conflict between Parliament and national parliaments, nor is their task unclear. It occurs to me that this conflict is always engendered when the Council and the national governments want to resist Parliament's claim that it should become a fully-developed legislature. It is then that the impression is conveyed that parliamentary democracy at European level would be to the detriment of the national parliaments. It is a false argument, but a systematic one and a deception in the true sense of the word. This discord between the parliaments is intended to maintain the Council's position of power.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliamentarianism in Europe is, however, indivisible. The commitment to parliamentary democracy is made at the European level. Parliament should therefore give a serious but wary reception to certain announcements made in advance by the Convention's president-designate, who has for weeks, via the press rather than by direct contact, and without yet being confirmed in office by the Convention, been giving voice to ideas about this constituent assembly which bear little relation to what Parliament demands or to the development of European democracy and parliamentarianism. I strongly appeal to this House to play its part in making the Convention a working, parliamentary and public convention and not, as it has been to date, a legitimising façade for the Council.</p>

Deficient monitoring facilities and the governments’ failure to supply appropriate briefings often make it impossible for the national parliaments to perform their function. This development must be brought to a halt, and the authority of national parliaments to keep tabs on their governments must be reinforced. That is why I particularly support the statements in item 1 of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Improved cooperation between the national parliaments and our own is indeed necessary, especially in areas such as policy on the EU, which are founded on collaboration between one State and another. There is one statement in the report which I, as a member of the Constitutional Convention, would like to emphatically underline, and that is item 17. Proposals such as that made by the German Foreign Minister get no support from me. The problem is the preponderance of the executive. We need the European Union to be made, in a far-reaching way, more democratic and parliamentary, we need definite constitutional reinforcement of the existing parliaments, but we do not need another chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the concern at the imbalance between the powers conferred on the executive institutions and the scope afforded to the parliaments as a whole, he has found a key factor on which to base his report.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, Mr President, the European Parliament has been expressing its concern for years. Mr Napolitano’s report proposes an initial, effective solution which is perfectly in line and in harmony with the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key element of the report concerns the matter I had occasion to highlight months<span class="bold"> </span>ago to the Italian Ambassador himself, even before anyone else, for it is primarily an Italian issue: the incompatibility between holding the office of Member of the European Parliament, on the one hand, and that of member of a national parliament, regional councillor or – I would add <span class="italic">sotto voce, </span>calling on Mr Napolitano to take note of the fact – mayor of a big city, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, if the European Parliament is to regain its political role, there will have to be an increase not only in the quality of the debates but also in MEPs’ attendance in Brussels and Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">The third element which I have to mention is the report’s wise, categorical refusal of a Chamber composed of representatives of national parliaments, thus avoiding making the decision-making process more unwieldy and, most importantly, preserving the distinction between the competences of national and European parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Our goal is therefore an institutional agreement, and we hope that President Cox will respond to Mr Napolitano’s call to initiate it. We are moving towards a process of strengthening the institutional role of the parliaments, which are elected to play a political and governing role, rejecting any decidedly antiquated element of concentration of executive power in the hands of institutions which are not at all legitimised by the people’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Napolitano for his excellent, brilliant work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The best evidence of this lack of legitimacy is that the people of Europe, when they are consulted, send this Europe back to the drawing board, as the people of Denmark and Ireland forcefully, and on successive occasions, did not long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Chairman Napolitano, whom I would like thank, seeks the answer to this existential question that we occasionally deliberate (and that we could term ‘democratic remorse’) in a sort of hybrid parliamentarisation, a risky experiment where the national parliaments and the European Parliament bargain between them in a sort of democratic no man’s land that is both vague and opaque. Mr President, Commissioner, legitimacy can only be conferred by the people themselves, when they are directly consulted, and cannot descend in the manner of the Holy Spirit out of such a distinguished Areopagus as our future Convention and, even more so, its praesidium, the most recent embodiment of what used to be called out-and-out despotism. European integration must involve the people and not the institutions. If it fails to do so, what we are continuing to call Europe will remain an increasingly foreign abstraction to Europeans, as the latest Eurobarometer has just demonstrated in a compelling manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report concludes, again quite rightly, that there is a risk of a growing democratic deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do, therefore, to correct this deficit? Although Mr Napolitano has shown some openness in relation to the traditional positions of the European Parliament, I do not think that his report has yet reached the correct balance in its demands for the extension of the powers of the House, and that it confines the national parliaments to an indirect and, in most cases, illusory role, by placing everything under the vague term of ‘parliamentarisation’.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, this lack of balance is a result of an omission. The report does not mention that the European Parliament is merely an assembly with implementing powers and that the national parliaments alone have full sovereignty. On a more serious note, it does not mention that this legal inequality is increased two-fold by unequal political legitimacy in the eyes of the citizens. We cannot undertake any worthwhile reforms in the European Union if we hide from such huge realities.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I added a minority opinion to the Napolitano report in order to explain that there will not be any true democratisation of the Union unless we reassess the value of the national parliaments, and unless they acquire direct power in the European decision-making process. I described how this could be done in a report submitted to the Intergroup SOS Democracy, which will be assessed at the next Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report starts by making it very clear that the European Parliament and the national parliaments, in their own contexts, fully represent the peoples of the European Union who are, Mr Berthu, sovereign peoples, as stated, amongst other things, in their constitutions for more than a century.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to thank Mr Napolitano for accepting my amendment, with which I wanted to highlight this extreme situation, which is almost always invoked by those who want to strengthen a particular institution at the expense of others. At the end of the day, this approach is, frankly, ridiculous.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens need a European Parliament, in the same way that they need their national parliaments, and the relationship between these should not be based on rivalry but on cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report not only reaffirms the need for this cooperation, but also, in my opinion, very realistically calls for it to be organised through an interparliamentary agreement in order to make better use of resources. It deals with improving the exchange of information and avoiding overlapping between various activities for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">It also recognises the competences of the national parliaments, not only with regard to the governments of the Member States, but in the application of Community Law. It shows that these powers are much greater than those which are often known or spoken about. If the national parliaments do not want to exercise these powers, that is their own business.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the national parliaments and the European Parliament have to cooperate, not compete with one other. Mr Napolitano’s report, as we would say in Spain, ‘gets things straight’. From the point of view of cordiality and solidarity with the national parliaments it makes things very clear and lends support to deep, solid and substantial cooperation. Let us support it with our vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the gap between the institutions and our citizens gets any wider, the time will come, sooner rather than later, when they turn their backs on us.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the national parliaments is predicated on the philosophy that the European Union is a union of states and a union of nations. As a union of nations, it expresses itself through the European Parliament and, as a union of states, it expresses itself through the national executives, which in turn rely on the trust placed in them by their national parliaments. A strong European Parliament and strong national parliaments. The involvement of the national parliaments in the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers must be visible, subject to control and sanctioned by the national parliaments. It is the national parliaments which will keep their citizens in touch with developments in the European Union and make them feel that they are European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What all this means is that we urgently need national constitutional reforms, as Giorgio Napolitano explains in his exceptional report, so that the Member States' European policy can be constantly baptised in the waters of the national parliaments. This in turn means that we need new mechanisms for information to flow from the Union to the national parliaments and to ensure that, institutionally, they are up to scratch.</p>
<p class="contents">The high profile of the national parliaments at the Convention convened to prepare the next round of Treaty reforms is, I think, of historic importance. And even if the proposals made by the Convention will not be legally binding on the next Intergovernmental Conference, its democratic credentials will be such that they will be hard to ignore. However, what we do not need is for the national parliaments to be represented in a new European institution which gets bogged down in what is, whichever way you look at it, a lot of European red tape. Upgrading the role of the national parliaments in giving credence to European decisions will strengthen the procedure in question; at the same time, however, it honours the role of the nation states as the legal and cultural expression of their people in this exciting unifying structure. Once again, my warmest thanks to Giorgio Napolitano for his excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A good report has been drawn up, providing a sound basis partly for continued dialogue with the national parliaments but also for an influential role for the committee in cooperating with the Convention. That is because there will be a real need for everyone of first-rate ability, whether they be in the European Parliament’s delegation to the Convention or on the committee. I therefore very much hope that this can continue. These are, of course, years in which we are, in actual fact, involved in an incredibly exciting project aimed at developing an international democracy that is also supported by the people for, despite our having been cooperating for 50 years, we have of course to acknowledge, firstly, that we are only at the development phase and, secondly, that we still do not have full support and understanding for the project. This is, of course, something that we have experienced many times in Denmark, where it has been difficult to obtain people’s acceptance of new treaties, and it has now also been experienced in Ireland. I believe that the referendums are merely symptomatic of what is happening in Europe as a whole, and that is what we must take seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not perhaps attach too much importance to what has happened in those two countries. It is up to the national authorities to be serious in their response, but I believe we must acknowledge that what is at issue here is more than just isolated Danish/Irish scepticism. There is nothing strange about the fact that acceptance is difficult to obtain, for we have been accustomed to using the national parliaments as the basis for our democracy, and now we suddenly have to demonstrate that there is nothing to stop our having both the national democracies and an international democracy and, above all, that they can operate in tandem. That is what the challenge is and, in a certain sense, I think we can tell ourselves that we have perhaps been ahead of our time. If we did not have the EU that we know today, we should have had to prepare something as a response to the global challenge. In reality, it might have been simpler if we had started from scratch, but I now think we must proceed on the basis we already have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, honourable members, there is to be a Convention, the involvement of the national parliaments in which is of historic importance. But that is not enough. They need clear guidelines on the issues which the Convention will address and which are tantamount to drafting a European constitution. In-depth debates are needed, either in plenary or in special parliamentary committees, so that delegates come here to state not just their own personal opinions but the more general line of thinking of their parliaments. This is something I have yet to see in the parliaments of the Member States of the European Union, in Greece at least. If those responsible for national parliamentary work are not interested in organising this sort of debate, I fear that our debate here will be of limited interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When important speeches are made to this House – even when they are made to better-attended sittings than this one – I often regret the fact that they do not evoke the interest they deserve on the part of the public, and that we tend to be talking to each other. What matters, though, is that we should evoke this interest, and, moreover, give the EU democratic legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">We will only succeed in this, though, if we can get the public to understand that what is happening in Europe is not just any old thing, but that their future is affected, in real terms, by whether those to whom they have given a mandate can share in decisions about the future and whether their national parliaments can resist it when the EU oversteps the bounds of its competence. This report could play an essential part in bringing this about. Let me congratulate the rapporteur and, therefore, express my support for him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an unfortunate fact that the competences ceded by the national parliaments to Europe have not all as yet arrived at the European Parliament, the only European institution to be legitimised by elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for this must be borne by all the Member States that have to date refused to pass on these competences to the co-legislator, Parliament, in the form of codecision in the legislative sphere. The governments have thus gained for themselves at European level legislative and executive powers that would have been inconceivable in their national legal system. That is the real scandal of the democratic deficit in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we then to commend the Heads of State and Government for, at the Nice Summit, setting out relations between the European Parliament and the national parliaments as being one of the four topics for the forthcoming Convention and the new Intergovernmental Conference? That would be to put off the governments' lack of capacity and willingness for yet another day. This is the fundamental misunderstanding that Mr Berthu has described in his minority opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must indeed seek to stand shoulder to shoulder with the national parliaments in order together to compel the governments to act in a democratic way. Parliament's two great groups are very much as one in this demand, and I am grateful to our group's Mr Gil Robles for his contribution to the Napolitano report, and to our rapporteur for his Amendment No 21. These show the right way ahead into the future. That which is feasible and appropriate must be done at every level. The national parliaments can and must monitor their national governments better and more effectively than before. We wish to encourage them to do so, both as regards the governments' conduct when European legislation is drafted in Council and in terms of the financial management and monitoring of funds granted by the EU. The European Parliament must monitor legislation at European level and play a part in shaping it.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I can only say that we are grateful for the report and hope that it will also be taken seriously by the Convention.</p>

Our objective is, in my judgement, the creation of a parliamentary democracy in the European Union. Only then will these issues of legitimisation, transparency and monitoring be able to be satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Parliamentarising’ the EU means reinforcing all elected assemblies in their relations with their executives at both national and European level. Intellectual and political clarity is needed for the debate on their respective roles. Some in this House have got all this a bit mixed up together. We need to separate the levels at which the national parliaments and the European Parliament will have their roles to play.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliaments have a joint role in the introduction of a constitution, which is a primary role of parliaments rather than of governments. Because of this too, we are glad that we have the Convention, and can rejoice that over two-thirds of the Convention's members will be coming from the parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">For secondary legislation and for the enactment of laws, on the other hand, we have the institutions – the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. I also say that we do not need a third chamber, something that would bring no added value and would only make the decision-making arrangements as a whole more complicated. That popular trust is at all likely to be increased by such ideas is something I simply doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is the strengthening of the national parliaments in their dealings with their national governments. Much can be done in this area and there is much still to do, so I believe we should come to an agreement and work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Napolitano for bringing clarity with his report and also for achieving, in the hearings we have had here, greater understanding between the parliaments. Congratulations on this report, which I hope will be adopted by a large majority!</p>

The issue of relations between the national Parliaments and the European Parliament is one of the central issues of the European debate and will be one of the key aspects of the work of the Convention and it is absolutely crucial that, apart from any delays that might occur and the normal diversity of opinions, this House addresses the issue calmly and intelligently.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in sweeping the difficulties arising from the construction of a democratic Europe under the carpet, especially at an historic moment when, even at national level, it is crucial to reinvent and strengthen representative democracy. At this stage on the path we have been following together for many years and which we wish to continue to follow with equal commitment on many others, we have an obligation to understand, not to shirk and to claim a special responsibility that comes from the fact that we, the members of the national and European parliaments, are the representatives elected directly by the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, crucial that we move towards the national Parliaments and the European Parliament having greater participation and control, both in drafting legislative decisions and in establishing the political guidelines of the European Union. As this report clearly acknowledges, none of these parliamentary institutions has exclusive rights to represent Europe’s citizens. And hence the need for greater cooperation from the institutions, in an organised and if possible involved way, whilst due respect is given to their autonomy and their specific responsibilities. In order to achieve this, we do not need to complicate the decision-making process, to impose competences or to continue to foster suspicion. We are simply asking each of the institutions to play their own role better and better. We also hope to see greater involvement by the national Parliaments in the political and legislative process of the European Union, and we are, therefore, committed to helping establish conditions for the effective national monitoring of each government in their capacity as a Member of the Council of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the assessment and the ways forward indicated in this report offer good prospects for the joint work that we will be undertaking in the Convention being able to make this new Europe more democratic, easier to understand and closer to all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will try to do so even though I only have one and a half minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Voggenhuber spoke about how the issue of the national parliaments was brought into play again and again, and I think one must add in the factor that there is of course understandable jealousy and frustration in the national parliaments, which leads to those who come to us joining in an artificial protest. A clear delimitation of competences would help there. The Convention is also urged to ensure that the parliamentarians are not played off against each other, but that in what is done they should follow the lead we have consistently given.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Abitbol, who is constantly lamenting the democratic deficit in the EU, I would like to say that there the argument is being turned around precisely the wrong way. The fact that we have this democratic deficit does not mean that we have to bring the national aspect more into play, but that we need all the things we are demanding in this House, such as more democratic institutions, or else we will come to utterly false conclusions and hand Europe's citizens over to precisely those things that the European democracies and the people who care about diversity do not want, that is, being ruled unilaterally by powers subject to no control, in this instance economic forces.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that that it is remarkable that the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has not entered any objection to item 17 of the report. That shows that there is something we agree on. But the amendments tabled by the Greens, which one feels are about regional institutions as much as national parliaments, merit your consideration and, in my view, your vote as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This topic is sensitive because national parliaments increasingly have the impression that competences are being taken away from them and given to the European Parliament. And if we are being honest, that is true to a certain extent. Since the transfer of a number of tasks of the Member States to the European Union, especially in the last ten to twenty years, and since the introduction of the codecision procedure – in other words since co-legislative powers were granted to Parliament – competences have indeed been transferred. However, this does not mean that national parliaments no longer have any important tasks to fulfil. Paragraph 1 of the resolution is explicit on this score. National parliaments must guide their Ministers in the Council. In addition, they must check up on their Ministers when they leave the Council, they must ensure that the European directives and regulations are implemented correctly, and they must also ensure that European programmes are executed correctly, both in terms of content and in terms of finance. If this is not done properly – as we see it is not in my country in the European Social Fund, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> – the European Commission will be claiming back hundreds of millions of guilders. In that case, national parliaments have not carried out their work properly either.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the distribution of the competences between national parliaments and the European Parliament should not become the most important point of discussion in the Convention. As Mrs Schleicher has already indicated, particular attention must be paid to the points on which national parliaments have lost competences which have not been passed on to the European Parliament. After all, that is where the democratic loophole is, and this is where we should mainly focus our activities in the Convention. We must check this very carefully, and we must ensure once again that these competences are returned either to national parliaments or to the European Parliament. Indeed, this translates, in my view, into the parliamentarisation and democratisation of the European Union, rather than to a situation in which matters which really belong with the parliaments are left to the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competence in the legislative and budgetary fields, and in the area of national control, belongs to national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the supranational context, these competences can only be exercised by a supranational parliament, whatever structure the Convention or the next Intergovernmental Conference may give to this body.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Napolitano has emphasised the importance of maintaining this difference in powers, and most importantly has underlined the real danger of certain powers bypassing the competence of the national parliaments, in the field of foreign affairs and within the third pillar, for example, which should not be entrusted to a supranational Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another, much more subtle, way of eroding parliamentary power, which we are now considering, the so-called open method of coordination that is commitology, which is used, for example, in the Lamfalussy report, with few opportunities for parliamentary control, self-regulation or co-regulation.

<p class="contents">It is clear that we need to give the EU a constitution, that we need to put an end to the current democratic deficit, and that we need to set up a division of powers that has its own characteristics, and that this, naturally, will result in the parliamentarisation of the Union, increasing the competences of the European Parliament and the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">But in what fields? The competences of the European Parliament, logically, in the field of control and legislation on Community affairs, and the national parliaments in the field of control of their own governments.</p>
<p class="contents">This control is certainly absent in many Member States and this is a hindrance to the participation of the national parliaments in active control and in the proposal of European issues in each State.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is also another issue: in the debate on the Convention on the future of Europe, I believe that the role of the autonomous communities with legislative powers should also be discussed, in order to produce a coherent and constructive definition of their role within the Union, with the aim, amongst other things, of bringing the process of European integration closer to its citizens and increasing its efficiency.</p>

I would even go as far to say that a new frame of mind has taken hold. Mr Napolitano, I would like to thank you and congratulate you on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of national parliaments, of the role that they must play, that they can be asked to play, in the future architecture of the Union, is related to the question of subsidiarity. It is also related to the question of shared legitimacy which goes hand in hand with shared sovereignty. In this respect, through the question of national parliaments and through the delimitation of competences on which your fellow Member, Mr Lamassoure, is working, it is essentially the problem of subsidiarity which is raised and this will be one of the key issues for the Convention to deal with via the constitutional process that will be launched in a few days’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore from this very useful perspective, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that we now have the extremely high quality findings of the European Parliament, which are telling us why and how we must take better account of the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Why must we do this? Perhaps because the European Union has not taken proper account of this question, from both its national and regional angles, nor has it taken this question seriously enough in the past. I say this with the benefit of hindsight and with the benefit of my experience, given that I have been a member of a national parliament for some 22 years. I can testify, as several of you can too, I am sure, to feeling a sense of helplessness as a national politician, when faced with so many texts from Brussels, which are merely to be implemented rather than discussed. Due to this feeling of <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, the frustration of national politicians – a word that one of you used – is not only directed at the Commission, but also at the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s desire, as you stressed, Mr Napolitano, to embark upon a new stage in its relations with the national parliaments, is demonstrated by what I would call significant and courageous action. This action has been apparent, for some time already, through the active role that the House plays within COSAC, in the many formal and informal contacts between MEPs and national politicians – I can testify to this during the preparation of the Treaty of Nice – and in increased administrative cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is naturally in favour of this new phase, because it is aware of the contribution that the national parliaments can make to the Union’s integration. The further we move forward with integration – and we hope that it does progress, in the sensitive areas of national sovereignty, and particularly the second and third pillars – the more pressing the question of the legitimacy of the whole system will be.</p>
<p class="contents">From an objective point of view, there is, for example, a shared interest in having better control of what happens under the third pillar, which is of so much interest to the citizens, and this control could be strengthened by the communitarisation that both the Commission and Parliament desire.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the approach of the Union institutions must respect two broad principles. First of all, it must not bring their legitimacies into conflict, as universal suffrage runs through European integration in several ways; in a direct way for this House and in an indirect way for the Council and the European Council. I think that this is one of our assets. Then, it must take into account the division of powers which is specific to each State, as well as the prerogatives and the requirements of each individual country’s national parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">You are reflecting on how to better involve the national parliaments. The imminent launch of the Convention, which most of you have mentioned, is in itself an initial response to the desires expressed by the national parliaments. As I said, the Convention is a result of the effort made by both Parliament and the Commission and the will expressed by the 23rd COSAC meeting in Versailles in October 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, although no one is questioning the importance or the nature of the contribution of the national parliaments, there is – at least, not yet – no consensus on the form that this could take. The recent report by Mr Chevalier and Mr Mahou, which was presented to the Laeken European Council, states this quite clearly. We now know that we may have two options: either indirectly, by improving the prerogatives of each national parliament in each of the Member States, or directly, by introducing new procedures to enable the national parliaments to intervene more directly in the European decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we must underline and strengthen the national and indirect option and it is also obvious that this is the majority’s preferred option. The Commission does not have to judge the value of each institutional system. On the other hand, it can state its interest in favour of disseminating all the good practices – and we are well aware that some practices in some Member States are better than in others – in terms of information and consultation. The Commission can state whether it is willing to examine amending the protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, in order to take into account these good practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The European option is more direct and certainly the more difficult to take, because, at the moment, the national parliaments themselves do not agree on specific issues. However, ladies and gentlemen, we will have to consider the more direct European option when we discuss, for example, the clarification of legislative tasks of the Council, or when we assess the experiments which have already been carried out collectively as part of the work with the European Parliament and the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, and like the House, the Commission does not support the idea of a new chamber, which would, in reality, be a third chamber. The European decision-making process is already sufficiently complicated, not to mention, of course, the risks of institutional conflicts that might arise between the third chamber and this House, with which the Commission has, for many years, shared and defended a certain vision and ambition for the Community model.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, and as you put it so well, Mr Napolitano, the Convention, which has not yet begun, will deal, in particular, with this key question, which is the subject of your report. Some subjects may therefore be raised immediately and, although I do not imagine that we will issue a specific opinion on subjects as closely related to the institutional autonomy of each Member State, Mr Vitorino and myself, who will represent the Commission at the Convention, would like to say that we are ready and willing to provide our ideas and our support to this in-depth examination. This may well be what we will do, for example, as regards the role of the constituent power of the national parliaments or even their role in interpreting the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, almost all of you have mentioned the Convention, which will take up a great deal of our attention as of 28 February. Be that as it may, I repeat, one of the key issues that will determine the success of the Convention, to bring it up to the highest possible level of ambition, will be our common ability to convince, to lead, to work openly with the national parliaments and from this perspective, Mr Napolitano, I believe that your report is not only courageous but that it will also be very useful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
