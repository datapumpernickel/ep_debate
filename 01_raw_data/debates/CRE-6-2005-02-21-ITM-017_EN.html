The EU Treaty contains two objectives that are important to this report. The first one is that on the one hand, we have state aid rules which must ensure that the internal market operates effectively, and on the other hand, the Treaty also states that those rules must not hinder the proper functioning of public services. The internal market has brought us many benefits, in the area of public services as elsewhere. We also find that we are all very much attached to the so-called European social economic model with good public services, which has, moreover, provided us with a high level of competitiveness. The Commission’s proposals are very welcome and I am pleased to hear that Mrs Kroes’ words do no more than underline what we have written in our report, namely that we aim to reduce state aid on the one hand, and do away with unnecessary red tape, on the other, and that we are focusing on those things that really distort the internal market, which are, after all, detrimental to our economy and also, therefore, to the foundation on which public services rest.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to outline a few key points. First of all, I should like to underline once again that the focus must be on the citizen as user of the services and as taxpayer. This may seem a little bit like stating the obvious, but all too often in reality, what takes priority are political interests, corporate interests, institutional interests and all kinds of other interests, to which, quite often, the interests of the individual have to give way.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the definition of what we term small services of general interest. The Commission has proposed granting those small services exemption from the obligation of prior notification for state aid and has, more or less, suggested that we use the same threshold of EUR 50 million maximum by way of annual turnover as we do for medium and small enterprises. Although the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has, at my proposal, followed this suggestion in the first instance, I do think that we should review the practical implications in a few years’ time, because we have no idea of how many businesses, how much state aid in total, and how many applications for state aid are involved. I should therefore like to know the exact impact of that threshold. Another important point for me is evidence-based policy making. For years, we in this House have been waging traditional trench warfare between Left and Right about the liberalisation of public services. I think it is important that we should finally have the facts on the table. In the report, we therefore urge the Commission to present an up-to-date and detailed report on public services every four years, when this regulation is up for renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a minor, slightly technical point. One paragraph in the report was included after we had adopted an amendment, and that paragraph seems to suggest that this House proposes that the task of offering a certain service must, in all cases, be assigned via a tendering procedure. That is not, of course, what is intended. I think that there are many people – maybe not all, but many – who will agree with me that that is, in itself, a sound procedure, and one that, in many cases, leads to sound results, but I would like to do away with the misconception that as of today, this House will decide that all services must be assigned via such a procedure. It is unfortunate that no amendments have been tabled to do away with that misconception, but I would in any event like to make this clear to the Commission in today’s plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kroes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, many thanks for the clear explanation of Mrs in ‘t Veld’s report; the problems that are raised in it are extremely important, because certainly now that we will, based on the state aid review, examine the best way of achieving the most effective result, it is the observations that have been made here that matter and therefore very much apply here.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said before further to the discussion on Mr Jonathan Evans’ report, I agree that we must cover all the angles in order to proceed in a more transparent and more effective way, thereby cutting down on bureaucracy and red tape, which does not benefit anybody, is too time-consuming, and, as Mrs in ‘t Veld put it very graphically, ultimately, what matters is the public, the consumers and taxpayers, who want to know what happens with their money and to what effect.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, when talking about definitions, and particularly about how to define small services of general interest, it is appropriate in any event not to jump the gun and to say that we know what is to be understood by it for all eternity. This is an area in which we have to gain experience, to see how things pan out, what the turnover would be in which situations and where, and what level of state aid would be involved. What is ultimately the extent of state aid that you do not only entertain, but also must take into consideration?</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Mrs in 't Veld stated very clearly that she favours evidence-based policy-making. We must finally put this into practice and ask ourselves whether it would not be a good idea – I, for one, think it is one, and it is one that I am glad to adopt – to submit a report in four years or so to demonstrate the impact of it all, and check whether it has the desired effect or whether there are maybe better methods for achieving our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">If we talk about state aid, then it is not the intention, certainly in our discussion, for that to be a permanent arrangement. The intention is to use state aid as a way of setting in motion a process that will, eventually, lead to self-sufficiency. To quote a well-known Chinese saying, it is the intention that, eventually, fish are caught with the fishing rod you give, rather than fish only being handed out to those who need them at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that this is a sound, experience-based report and explores whether state aid works, how it works and whether this is the best way of going about things. However, we do come up against the Court ruling in the Altmark case, which brings us to the fourth criterion. I assume that the first three criteria are clear, and with regard to the fourth criterion, we have to establish that tendering is possible in all situations. In those cases where tendering is possible, it is obvious that we need to apply the four criteria, but in other cases, people need to take the best possible decision under the given circumstances, and we have to conclude that we need to gain some experience in that area in order to formulate the best methodology.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to echo the rapporteur in this and say that we can indeed gain the experience together and submit it in a report. Four years are a good timeframe within which we can make some valid statements on this score and hopefully reach some conclusions again in a future debate. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They will also best produce the economic benefits that we need if we are to reach the Lisbon objectives and if we are to pay for our social and environmental ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important consideration in our Group is subsidiarity: the decision should be taken at a level as close as possible to the citizen, which is compatible with a properly functioning single market. There is no need for Europe to step in where a decision is best taken at national or local level. We are therefore pleased that Mrs in't Veld's excellent report succeeds in accommodating these two priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall thrust is to call for fair competition in free markets. Like her, we would always prefer a transparent tendering process. However, if local authorities, in their wisdom, feel they can do better for their citizens, they can so do without having to notify the Commission, as long as they keep within the rules, which ensure that potential competitors are not harmed and, most specifically, that they are small in scale and very local in nature.</p>
<p class="contents">A clear decision was achieved in committee that gives the Commission a strong steer. We are happy with this and we will support this same line tomorrow. We wish Mrs in't Veld well with her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me start by congratulating Mrs in 't Veld on her report, which I see as representing another step towards the abandonment, by the members of this Union, of the attempt at squeezing everyone into one size, which, in the long run, does not fit anyone. Instead we are moving towards the principle of subsidiarity, which involves us in recognising the needs of the countries and regions and of localities. I think that whoever believes in balance, recognises that the market economy has several advantages, although we must, at the same time, recognise that intolerable shortcomings keep occurring, and those who are entrusted with power and leadership do not budge. Without any doubt, there are cases of abuses, but there are several other cases, where, if properly regulated, State aid will be the social soul that arrives where the cold calculations of the market's reasoning do not. The ultimate success of this Europe and of its Member States cannot be measured only through the economy’s statistics. A healthy economy must be the means whereby we are led towards the real ultimate purpose, that of giving our families a decent life and dignified work in a better environment. Obviously, every type of aid that is given must be given within an agreed framework that takes into account the realities of different countries. Planning this framework must involve everyone, and here I emphasise ‘everyone’ – the social partners, trade unions, the consumers and the private sector, and, while we are on the subject of consumers, it would be appropriate to also remember the minorities among consumers and the taxpayers. I will give an example: an amendment I tabled, and that I am pleased to note was accepted in this report, makes it easier to supply aid from the air, as well through sea routes between islands. Let me give you an example why this is so. Currently, in order for the citizens of the island of Gozo to cross over to the main island of my country, Malta, using a 12-minute helicopter trip, the market economy requires them to pay much more than they would pay for an airline ticket for a trip between London and Brussels. Imagine how such a region can develop without some aid from the State. We must move even further forward than we have done to date. I only have to look at the shipyards in my country, which the government is trying to close down, while blaming European Union regulations for the need to do so. Despite the demonisation of the shipyard workers, these sectors and enterprises have a huge load of work and a large commitment to give in terms of an era of greater technical capacity.

We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe regard it as self-evident that the public sector must safeguard the provision of certain services. There is a need, though, for great care to be exercised when using taxpayers’ money, and it must be used only in cases where it provides consumers with genuine added value. It is for that reason that clear rules are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle we welcome the Commission’s attempts to lay down a framework to make sure that funds are used in a transparent, objective and easy-to-understand way. What we want is a solution that ensures that competition is effective and that the rules on services of general interest are not used to distort competition. Completion of the internal market must not be slowed down by an unchecked and indiscriminate distribution of State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is quite the opposite, namely to lend our support to a solution that makes it possible to achieve a number of goals. These include the drawing up by the Member States of a definition of services of general interest; even if these definitions are not identical, they will be comparable, and we do not regard this as violating the principle of subsidiarity. In addition, State aid must be used in a targeted and focused manner in instances where it helps to safeguard the future, with its future use being somewhat more restricted than has been the case to date, and the rules on such aid must not interfere with the further implementation of the internal market. We are opposed to the prevention of a possible liberalisation of services of general interest by means of derogations to the directive on services, such as has been attempted by the Federal Minister for the Economy in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to call on the Commission to provide further explanatory documents to ensure that the rules are made easier to apply. It should develop benchmarks and examples of best practice as points of reference, for the best practice approach can act as a source of good ideas, derived from other Member States’ successes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been done to give Members the opportunity to ensure that the report clearly favours public service providers, particularly in the fields of health and social housing provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The report affirms our belief in the importance of high-quality services of general interest that are accessible to all. It also recognises the right of local authorities to self-government. So far, so good. However, recital E contends that 'the internal market, liberalisation and compliance with the rules on competition have on the whole led to improved access to SGIs, new services with more choice, better quality and lower costs for consumers'. In our view this is questionable to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also asserts that no distinction should be made between public and private enterprises and that all SGIs should be put out to tender. The rapporteur seemed to suggest that there was some misunderstanding about this, but that is how it comes across. This would cause problems for in-house services within public bodies such as local housing authorities and health boards.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group cannot accept a lack of clarity on this point. On the contrary, we would support an approach that clearly exempts from the prior notification requirement the kinds of local services that do not affect the development of trade, and do not conflict with the interests of the European Union. State-aid rules have frequently led to difficulties and uncertainty for local authorities and other public service providers. We ought to have certainty, and we hope the House votes in favour of that tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a widespread feeling that practices that used to be well-established are being called into question, in particular in the case of services of general interest and possible compensation for the provision of public services, and this has left a great many people fearing that they will be left with nothing at all. I particularly agree with the comments made by the penultimate speaker, Mr Klinz of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, namely that the priority for Brussels must be greater transparency in order to resolve this problem, and that there is a risk that the smaller Member States will continue to use subsidiarity to their own advantage, either by imposing artificially high prices or by helping their friends. I am also firmly convinced that unless the Commission speeds up the procedures for assessing internationally comparable best practice models, we run the risk of having to submit a negative final or interim report in four years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The one additional point I should like to make is that I cannot understand why such far-reaching exemptions have been granted to public service broadcasters. The latter increasingly resemble private broadcasters in terms of their working methods and the way they market themselves, and I believe that their activities in many fields, for example online services, mean that what we are seeing amounts to additional subsidies.</p>

It has not always been obvious to decision-makers in local authorities at city, municipality or district level whether compensation for special expenses connected with these services comes within the scope of State aid regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The dilemma these decision-makers face is whether these payments have to be declared to the Commission or approved by it. There are serious legal consequences if compensation is not declared when it should have been, yet if declarations are submitted unnecessarily in cases of doubt valuable time is lost during this procedure. Steps will now be taken to reduce this legal uncertainty, and this is something I wholeheartedly welcome and support.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, the ruling by the European Court of Justice on the Altmark case is the legal basis that the Commission has used to put forward its proposal for an exemption decision. This proposal complies with the demand Parliament made in its resolution of 14 January 2004 on the Green Paper on services of general interest, and it is a sign that support exists for a control policy that focuses on cases that are key to effective competition in the internal market. Under this proposal, compensation that only has a very minor impact on the internal market will be exempt from State aid control procedures, which will mean a great deal more legal certainty for local stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">Compensation for services of general economic interest that have only a minor impact on the internal market is frequently granted on a strictly limited and local basis, and is therefore a good example of an instance where exemption would be decided on. Provided that other criteria are complied with, such as providing a clear statement of responsibilities and adherence to the principle of transparency, such compensation will also benefit from the planned increase in legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has submitted an outstanding report, and ensured that it expressed the majority view by putting it to a vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I hope that the House as a whole will view it in the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, though, as an MEP, I have discovered an inextricably linked market bureaucracy: State aid. I believe that the proposal put to us today constitutes real progress, namely – as you just said during the previous debate, Commissioner – the exemption from the notification requirement of minor aid that is not considered to have an impact on the single market. In my opinion, this is a considerable step forwards. We need to consolidate this, and it would also be worthwhile to definitively rename it public service compensation, rather than State aid. This is a new legal category that could be created.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report that has been presented to us, I am one of those who believe that there are things that need to be stabilised. In particular, I do not think that we can vote again as we did in committee: hospitals and social housing must be clearly integrated in the scope. This, though, is probably not enough. I am one of those who suggest that there should also be autonomous services within local communities, which other texts are in the process of recognising, in particular the regulation on the public service obligation in transport. We will probably have to wait for the Commission's communication on social services in order to be able, maybe tomorrow, to include these in this text.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think we need to consider the issue of the fourth criterion from the Altmark ruling. This criterion is so complicated that it would introduce to this document – which is a simplifying document – new complications for local communities. As you know, it involves comparison with the reasonable profit of a comparable undertaking at EU level. This is absolutely impracticable. Consequently, perhaps this fourth criterion could at some point be abandoned, even at the risk of slight overcompensation, so that your aim of simplification can finally be pursued and achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Services of general economic interest are essential for improving the quality of life for all citizens, and these services are often central in helping to attract investment to less-favoured areas and rural areas, thus boosting their competitiveness and leading to greater cohesion within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">At a national level within Ireland, the post office network is under threat, particularly the smaller rural post offices that are not computerised and cannot, therefore, offer an adequate level of service to citizens. The post office network will require a public service obligation in order to remain viable, and this proposal to exempt small-scale public funding such as this from the obligation of prior notification to the Commission makes absolute sense in that it allows sufficient flexibility at national and regional level without distorting the internal market. Indeed, as the rapporteur and the Commissioner have both said, it also cuts down on red tape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The legal uncertainty is too great at present for the local players. At the moment, we are leaving it up to the Court of Justice to decide what exactly should be done about state aid. While that is a first step, we see it as too insubstantial. Exempting compensation paid to hospitals and social housing is a first step, but we think that others should be added to the list. Commissioner, we would add care homes and employment agencies, which should be exempt from notification. As for the fourth criterion in the Altmark judgment, that is totally unacceptable to us and also not feasible in practical terms. After all, what is the definition of the average well-run private undertaking? What if there is no private equivalent? Does making reference to the average private undertaking not oversimplify the task assigned to the public service? Pretending to be a well-run private undertaking can also impact on redundancies and cause social upsets. I would therefore ask for this criterion to be deleted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With this ‘Monti package’ and the proposal for a directive on services, however, the Commission is dealing with the issue of public services. With one small stroke after another, it is painting a sort of Impressionist picture representing its own vision of public services. Unfortunately, Mr Barroso is no Manet or Renoir.</p>
<p class="contents">According to this picture, any financing of public services is necessarily State aid, and thus by implication contravenes the principle of free and fair competition, an aberration that must be stamped out. The right of this Parliament goes even further, moreover: Mrs in 't Veld's report rejects the Commission's proposal to exempt the social housing and hospital sectors from the notification requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, if Parliament assents to the requirement for a tendering process prior to any award of public service compensation, it will weaken all the small local public services that are directly and indirectly managed by the public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we are observing, following the dismantling of the great national public services, the weakening of local public services. This report is in fact deceptive: it claims to make consumers happier, while eroding their citizen's rights with regard to public services.

Following the harsh words which have also been spoken from our side of the House, I will also try to congratulate Mrs in 't Veld and look at how we can, after all, reach compromises on this issue. I am told that she has indicated a willingness to take some of our amendments into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the first point is the in-house provision of services, in which respect, we would like to stand by what we said in last year’s Herzog report. Therefore, if she could support amendments in that respect, that would help us a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is public procurement and transparent tendering, which is covered in a number of amendments tabled by Mr Purvis, and also in an amendment by Mrs Wagenknecht, who states that this tendering should not take place unless required by law. This may be a bridging provision to clarify something that has, as you yourself indicate, not been incorporated well. Based on this, we can subsequently bring the different texts – there are always four different texts – into line with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the issue about exempting hospitals and social housing, which we, too, regard as a rather random selection. We too would like to see this examined transparently and would like to see what the implications are, but would also like to indicate that much more is yet to be done and much more thought should be given to the way in which the criteria are determined. That is something that we believe should happen, not in four years’ time, but now, at a time when the services directive is up for discussion, to enable us to draft clear criteria based on a framework directive and services of general interest, precisely where the combination of private and public tendering is concerned. I would like to continue this discussion with the Commissioner in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know it was a difficult job, but the result has been worth it. The contribution this report has made to the debate is really important, so I congratulate her.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key motives behind the Commission's proposal is to increase legal certainty and predictability. One of the remarks made this evening referred to the need for predictability for those who have to deal with public services and public service financing schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already mentioned, we also want to reduce the administrative burden: to get rid of red tape and a lot of bureaucracy not only at European level but also at national and regional level. That is why timing is so essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the efficient functioning of services of general economic interest is of great importance for the Commission, and for Parliament, the Member States and for the consumer – the European Union citizen. Contrary to what is sometimes said, Community competition rules do not hinder the proper functioning of these services. They do not affect the prerogatives and responsibilities of national, regional or local authorities to define, organise, finance and monitor public services.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much agree with the idea that we should occasionally review what we are doing. When we consider the Altmark court case, it is not that difficult to make a clear decision on three of the four criteria. Therefore, I do not agree with the Member who said that it is difficult to define a true public service. Nor is it difficult to define a contract or to identify the parameters of compensation. As Mrs van den Burg said, there could be difficulties when tendering is a possibility. When difficulties arise, you need to calculate the costs on the basis of a well-run company. Therefore, as far as the fourth criteria is concerned, having implemented this court case ruling for four years we can take our experience into account. We know that in reality tenders are not widely used for small services of general economic interest. Under Altmark, the compensation paid is therefore state aid and needs to be notified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's established policy is not to restrict the financing of companies in charge of public service obligations. However, we ensure that this financing is really necessary and does not lead to undue distortions of competition. The current proposals respond to the new environment arising from the Altmark case. The Commission's draft decision seeks to reduce the notification burden as concerns small services of general economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty establishes that the efficient functioning of services of general interest is a shared responsibility between the Union and Member States. The proposals before you today form a part of the Commission's efforts to play its role in achieving this. I welcome the fact that you support the reduction of unnecessary red tape and I will take that into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft decision excludes small public services from the notification burden, thereby matching the thresholds set for small- and medium-sized enterprises. As Mrs in 't Veld's report suggests, the Commission considers this to be the most appropriate approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The hospital and social housing sectors will also be exempt from notification. This is made quite clear, and is justified by the high amounts of compensation necessitated by the nature of these public services.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much agree with the idea that the Commission should review the application of new rules after a certain period, and after carrying out an impact assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with other state-aid frameworks, such as the regional aid guidelines and the block exemptions, we suggest that the framework should apply for six years and be renewed, on the basis of a review, for four years in this case. For reasons of legal certainty, the validity of the decision should not be limited in time, but I very much agree with the need to hold a review.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also suggested that there is a necessity to consult widely on the definition of the public service obligations, particularly where this concerns users. The Commission agrees in principle, but it is up to Member States and their regional or local authorities to define public services in practice. The Commission can only recommend that Member States consult widely on that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I have consulted my colleague, Mr Barrot, on the suggestion of expanding the scope of the decision concerning transport. There are several sector regulations in this field, which make extending the scope of the current package difficult. However, I understand that a separate package is being prepared, and your comments on land and air transport links certainly constitute interesting input for that package.</p>
<p class="contents">A benchmarking exercise, especially the benchmarking of public services and services of general economic interest, would be difficult to carry out. It might not be technically feasible, since public services are structured in different ways in different EU countries. Considering the costs – and, perhaps, the limited usefulness – of such a study, I do not think it is a good idea.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the problem involving existing compensation when the conditions applicable are not met. I understand that Member States need a certain period of time to modify their existing schemes. We will consider ways of granting legal certainty for a transitional period. The criteria for the Altmark ruling need further work and clarification. In its White Paper on Services of General Interest, adopted in May 2004, the Commission announced that it would adopt a text on this issue in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Vits asked about social health and care services, and these are already covered by the draft decision. In the light of the amount of public service compensation generally granted to care services, most should fall within the thresholds for compensation defined in the decision and should therefore benefit from the exemption from notification.</p>
<p class="contents">On the points raised by Mrs De Vits, the Commission supports the recommendation that tendering processes should be used wherever possible, and in most cases in which the Altmark criteria have been met there will be no state aid. But we know that, in reality, tenders are not widely used, particularly for small services of general economic interest. I agree with Mrs van den Burg that we need to take experience into account. In the light of experience, we will have a better and clearer view of how to handle this. If there is no way of tendering, then the cost basis of a well-run company – in this case, a public service company – should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mrs in 't Veld again. We will certainly return to these matters once we have had more experience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
