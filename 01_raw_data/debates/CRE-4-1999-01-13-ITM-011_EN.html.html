<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Larive </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, this report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on cross‐border commercial communications also considers that the Commission is failing to do its duty. As the guardian of the Treaties, the fact that it regularly flouts Article 169 – the infringement procedure – is a major democratic failing that cannot be tolerated in a democratic constitutional system. The public, businesses and organisations are often rightly furious when their complaints take years to be dealt with, such as on France"s Evin law and Greece"s ban on the television advertising of toys.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also not exactly pleased to be handed just two minutes ago Commissioner Monti"s reply to the letter that Mr Cox and I wrote to him about the infringement procedure. All I have been able to read of it is the last sentence, which says ‘I am nevertheless interested in the suggestions made by Mrs Larive in her draft report on commercial communications and will take them into consideration when they will be adopted by Parliament". I have not had time to read the rest, but I will hold him to his word.</p>
<p class="contents">In his eight‐point plan last Monday, President Santer promised the European Parliament greater transparency and more information. If he is to remain – or become – credible, therefore, the demands made in our resolutions must be met. This means that the Article 169 procedure must be applied scrupulously and transparently, with time‐limits for decisions to be reached and the compulsory proportionality assessment of all pending and new complaints. Complainants must also be able to appeal against negative decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is also calling for a public register of complaints accessible via the Internet, with the complainants" agreement, naturally, giving all the relevant information on the progress of the cases, or lack of it. Parliament must be informed on a very regular basis, perhaps through its Committee on Legal Affairs, and I would propose that the committee should set up a working party to monitor infringement procedures, and not just those relating to commercial communications, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can no longer be allowed to put unverifiable political considerations before legal arguments behind closed doors and without being answerable to anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Commercial communications are a very delicate area. On the one hand, they too should be able to take optimum advantage of the European single market, an extremely important consideration for this rapidly expanding, new technology‐led sector which already employs more than one million people. On the other hand, we naturally have great respect for national values and cultures. This is why, Commissioner Monti, we are extremely happy with your proposals to liberalise the European market for commercial communications too, first in the Green Paper and now in the follow‐up communication.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the proportionality assessment you propose. Objective criteria can be applied in each case to determine whether a national restricting measure is in the public interest, or whether the intended public health or consumer policy objective, say, could be guaranteed by less drastic measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the Commission, however, we would like to see all new infringement cases subject to this assessment with clear time‐limits, not just upon request, because then we would be back to the situation that I just described.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the Commission"s proposals for a central contact point, a website and a database, along with the expert group. In this group too, the watchwords must be transparency and accessibility, so the agenda, minutes and minority opinions must all be made public.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel it is very important, as you know, Commissioner, that other people concerned should be included in the group alongside national officials. I know you are a brave man, so try to persuade your colleagues to introduce what I call the ‘European polder model" for the first time. By this I mean participation on an equal footing, with one representative from the government, industry and consumer organisations in each country. It is time to stop civil servants from having absolute power here.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the principle of mutual recognition and the country of origin principle must be the keynotes for commercial communications too. Only if the proportionality assessment establishes that a national restricting measure is justified can these principles be overridden. The industry must be given the chance to solve problems through self‐regulation and a European code of conduct. In my view we should set to work on this now, and only as a last resort should we consider harmonisation legislation to supplement the dozen or so directives that already apply to this sector.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Paasilinna </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, commercial communications should certainly be broadened further. They are a source of employment and are going through immense changes. Advertising has also made progress as far as content goes, but not necessarily only for the better. Commercial communications are becoming increasingly image‐orientated. They are more and more often manipulative and carry value‐related messages. This is the basis of my own viewpoint here.</p>
<p class="contents">Today advertising creates society"s opinions. The consumer is not always able to resist the image of the world created in advertising, which is often a very unrealistic one. A good example is a certain brown drink made from a plant extract. The drink is no longer advertised as a drink in itself, especially on television, but the lifestyle that goes with it is: youth, beaches, freedom and beauty. This means that we have gone from advertising the product to advertising the image, and the social issues that go along with it. Some things are regarded as desirable, others not.</p>
<p class="contents">Problems are caused by advertising which is targeted at children and others who are vulnerable. We have to protect the weak. The rapid spread of sponsorship, for example, in schools, is a good example of this. Similarly, sports sponsorship and its sometimes negative associations, including the business of the Olympics, show what can happen when there is inadequate control and a criminally‐inclined element.</p>
<p class="contents">A key aim of the Union is that the workings of the internal market should remain untarnished. By making it easier to market goods and services we are giving support to our own objectives and, at the same time, providing opportunities for growth and, obviously, employment. Good, flexible advertising is therefore an important goal. Commercial cross‐border communications must be founded on recognising the importance of reciprocal action. The rapporteur suggests that if this is not going to be possible, we will have to resort to self‐regulation. I do not believe, however, that that would be a satisfactory approach.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mather </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Larive on her report and welcome it on behalf of the European People's Party. For some time Mrs Larive has steered the opinion of Parliament in this area on liberal economic principles and the fact that there is a lack of amendments to her report testifies to the hard work she has done and the support she has received.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise four points which arise from her report. The first is the emphasis on mutual recognition in this area. The second is the approach based on emphasising self‐regulation as the first resort and, as Mrs Larive said, the addition of further directives only as a last resort. The third point which strikes me as arising from this report is the importance of a mandatory system to assess the proportionality of further legislative initiatives. This is a constraint on legislators, but it seems to me a proper constraint. We must fasten rules around ourselves. If I may associate myself with Mrs Larive's broader points, the Community prospers the greater the more it is a Community of law, rules and of predictability.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads to the fourth point I should like to mention, which is about complaints. The Commission has built constructively on its Green Paper, but if there is one obvious area where it might usefully make some further vigorous progress, it is in the area of handling complaints. Strict time‐limits would clearly be very useful here. Also, the idea of a complaints register accessible on the Internet links the last debate with this one rather nicely and empowers those who have difficulties in this area. It makes the Community systems more accessible to them. That is something I believe we can all support.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Larive emphasises the importance of the expert group and the need to bring in true outside experts to it at an early stage. We in the EPP would support that too.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by encouraging Commissioner Monti to continue his work in this area. It is a rather messy and confused one. Not all the directives which currently exist promote the aims which we would support together in this Parliament. Perhaps Mr Monti might be able to apply his skills in bringing order and synthesis to a number of subjects to this particular area.</p>

Huge amounts of money are being deployed by the advertising industry, affecting the behaviour of ordinary people and conditioning their needs. Through sponsorship, product placement and image transfer, the influence of advertising and marketing has long been felt throughout the world of communication and interpersonal contact – in feature films and schools, for example. The net result is <span class="italic">de facto</span> dominance of the mighty and powerful over the smaller and weaker. This applies at both state and company level. The report is basically very sound, but it could be more explicit in advocating protection of those traditions and customs which are rooted in our historical psyche and form part of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">More emphasis could also have been placed on protecting human rights and the interests of minors. These are important elements – and not all parts of Europe are necessarily on the same wavelength in this respect.</p>

Thanks to the Commission"s Green Paper and Mrs Larive"s report, however, we can appreciate the true range of the subject. At issue are all forms of communication where suppliers – in order to enhance their product"s image or promote sales – set about targeting consumers. The scope is that wide.</p>
<p class="contents">The term commercial communications therefore covers advertising, direct marketing and sponsorship, as well as sales promotion and – significantly – public relations. The sector already provides over a million jobs, and that figure is constantly increasing. More importantly, we are dealing with a market of the future, which will eventually employ even greater numbers in other areas. Since the single market will have a special role to play here, we need to ensure that its completion in this sector is speeded up. To my mind, the section in the report on mutual recognition is therefore of paramount importance. One of the cornerstones of a common market is that once an activity has been authorised in one Member State, transfrontier communication must be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings to mind the directive on buses, as dealt with by Mr Murphy in his celebrated report. Buses are not our topic today, but we did give priority to the principle of mutual recognition when considering that report. Let us then hope that the Commission and the Council will rise to the challenge when pursuing their legislative agenda.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Larive for her comprehensive and detailed motion for a resolution on the Commission's communication, as well as for her interest in our policy on commercial communications in the single market. Thanks to your commitment, Mrs Larive, the European Parliament supported the Commission's proposals its Green Paper on commercial communications, thereby enabling the Commission to activate this policy through the communication now under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the rapporteur's positive attitude to our policy in this area, and I willingly take up her constructive criticism concerning further possible improvements. In addition to making suggestions on the policy as such, Mrs Larive's report also proposes various ways of streamlining the Article 169 infringement procedure. Since I have competence in both fields, I should like to give a brief preliminary reply to the main suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin with our internal policy on commercial communications. The suggestions here focus on the need to improve the methodology for assessing proportionality, on the one hand guaranteeing that none of the proportionality criteria are used as a pretext for retaining protectionist barriers and, on the other, making this method for assessing proportionality mandatory in every infringement procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I agree with both proposals and shall attempt to ensure that this instrument is applied effectively. Concerning the suggestions on greater transparency in the work of the expert group, we are already taking steps to place the group's opinions and meeting agendas in the public domain. I can inform Mrs Larive that the group's first opinion, on rules governing discounts in the Member States, should be adopted and made public in February. Moreover, the names of the national representatives have been made known, and several Member States have established working groups with the relevant national organisations to inform them about discussions held in the expert group.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that all the Member States will eventually proceed in this fashion, so that the organisations concerned are kept fully informed and can contribute to the debate. The members of the expert group also consider that it would be useful for the organisations concerned to be able to submit their observations to the group, but that their permanent presence could detract from the frank and constructive deliberations enabling the group itself to comply with the six‐month time limit laid down for its opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, since we are expecting two opinions per year on average, we hope to be in a position to present these to Parliament on a regular basis, together with the initiatives proposed by the Commission in response to these opinions. I therefore believe, Mrs Larive, that we shall be able to follow through most of your specific suggestions concerning our policy on commercial communications.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the innovations proposed in the resolution concerning the Article 169 infringement procedure, I am particularly grateful for these contributions because I attach considerable importance to infringement procedures. We have in fact attempted – perhaps not to the extent desired by Mr Mather, given his kind words – to bring order to this area, accelerate matters and lend greater transparency to the practices followed under the infringement procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that this aspect is of crucial importance, since complaints of violations enable us to identify areas where problems still exist for the internal market. I admit that the complexity and slowness of the infringement procedure may sometimes dissuade market operators from lodging complaints. This means that the infringement procedure is not properly fulfilling its important role of identifying barriers, consequently making it more difficult to achieve our aim – and yours – of a single market which operates seamlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards more specifically the frequency and time limits of decisions, I have done everything in my power to comply with the time limits, as suggested by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the two proposals on a public register of complaints and on access for complainants to the Commission's analysis prior to the reaching of a decision are worthy of more in‐depth examination. The register could only include cases in which the complainants had agreed to forego the right to confidentiality under the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the second proposal, the fact of asking the complainant's opinion on our analysis before the Commission reaches its collective decision would inevitably cause further delay. I do however agree that there are good – very good – reasons for telling a complainant why, for example, his case has been closed.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have managed, at least to some extent, to convince you that the Commission intends to attach considerable importance to this resolution, and I would conclude with a very brief remark on transparency. I am very keen on transparency and, as you know, one essential instrument of transparency in terms of compliance with Community single market legislation is proving very useful: the so‐called scoreboard, which is putting pressure on the Member States to be more rigorous in enforcing the rules of the single market. With regard to transparency in the infringement procedure in particular, I would point out that since 1996 we have been abiding by our decision of that year to inform the press systematically of every decision concerning a reasoned opinion or the referral of a case to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">This, I must say, is a very useful means of exerting peer pressure to encourage the Member States to eliminate more effectively and more rapidly the infringements which trigger the procedure.</p>

It offered reassurance on a number of points, but it was also disappointing on certain others, particularly the composition of the expert group. There were another two questions of mine that you did not answer. Are you prepared to allow complainants to appeal against negative decisions? And are you prepared to apply the time‐limits referred to in the resolution for the infringement procedure?</p>

As regards the first aspect – complaints – I believe that a modification of the Treaty would be needed there. I would recall that, at the Intergovernmental Conference leading to the Amsterdam Treaty, both I myself and the Commission as a whole supported the proposal from certain Member States to strengthen these powers in order to streamline the appropriate procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">As for compliance with time limits, I think I said before that we are doing our utmost to comply with these time limits; I can stress this once again. As you will in fact have noted, in some cases I have hesitated to take up your proposals immediately for the very reason that, although they seem good in themselves, they could slow down the procedure to some extent.</p>
