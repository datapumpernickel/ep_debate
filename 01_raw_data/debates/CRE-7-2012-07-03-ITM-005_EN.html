<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  – The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the conclusions of the European Council meeting (28-29 June 2012).</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, ladies and gentlemen, at the informal summit on 23 May 2012, I proposed a growth pact to the European Council which involves all three EU institutions working closely together in order to take all the measures necessary to overcome the crisis in the coming six to twelve months.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who took up this idea in the form of an interinstitutional agreement and put this to Parliament at its last sitting. Parliament then mandated me, by a broad majority, to present this idea to the European Council jointly with Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the European Council did not accept our joint proposal for an interinstitutional agreement. I feel it is appropriate to comment on this. I make no secret of the fact that there was overwhelming support for our proposal in the European Council. By far the majority of the Heads of Government of the European Union advocated this interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, it became apparent that the European Council has a structural weakness, and that is its unanimity principle. In my opinion, we will not emerge from the crisis while this unanimity principle exists.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission for its support. I should like to propose to you that the two institutions, the Commission and Parliament, stick with the idea of working in close, constructive cooperation towards expedited legislation – if that is what is desired – while completely safeguarding the rights of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the compromise reached in the area of the European patent, for example, does not set a good example of how to proceed. We are firmly convinced that together, in the interests of the people of Europe, we should do everything we can to emerge from this crisis swiftly and stronger than before.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pass on one piece of positive news. The European Council has accepted the human rights pact and the associated action plan, for which we as Parliament have fought long and hard. I believe that as the European Parliament, we should very much welcome this decision, since this package declares human rights and democracy to be a central element of European external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us here are convinced that the human rights package provides an extraordinarily good basis for making more effective, more coherent human rights and democratisation policy. We are looking forward to making the public aware of this human rights package through a formal interinstitutional declaration and documenting the support that this has from all three institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herman Van Rompuy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Council. </span>– Mr President, last week’s European Council was about combining short-term action to stabilise the markets and medium-term action to stimulate growth, together with a longer-term vision on the way forward to strengthen our Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a sometimes difficult but in the end fruitful meeting. It was another step on the long road to overcoming the financial and economic crisis and correcting the structural flaws of the euro area framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The steps we took last week were important on a number of fronts. First, we put together and decided on a Compact for Growth and Jobs. It will mobilise EUR 120 billion for immediate investment, which will boost the financing of the economy and help create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">A EUR 10 billion increase in the capital of the European Investment Bank will increase the bank’s overall lending capacity by EUR 60 billion. The other EUR 60 billion comes, first, from the Structural Funds which will be devoted to growth-enhancing measures in the current period (EUR 55 billion) and, second, from the pilot phase of project bonds that will be launched this summer and will go to key initiatives such as energy, transport and broadband infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Compact for Growth is not just about injecting money. It contains a number of elements: work to be done individually by the Member States, which have already undertaken a number of commitments in that respect, and work to be done together as a Union, including deepening the single market, negotiating good trade agreements, working together on tax matters, and strengthening the European Research Area. Several Member States will launch a request for enhanced cooperation regarding a financial transaction tax with a view to its adoption by December 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said before, the European Council has not suddenly discovered the virtues of economic growth. Relaunching growth and creating jobs has been a constant concern, from the very first meeting under my Presidency in February 2010 right up until now. I am happy that this European Council has been able to give it a real push.</p>
<p class="contents">The growth and jobs agenda requires a structural approach, but also short-term actions for financial stability. A return of confidence for consumers and investors will itself lead to more demand and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">My second main point is that, as eurozone leaders, we reaffirmed our strong commitment to do what is necessary to ensure the financial stability of the euro area. In particular, we affirmed that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, and we reached a number of important agreements to this effect among the eurozone Member States, the 17.</p>
<p class="contents">We urged the rapid conclusion of the Memorandum of Understanding attached to the financial support to Spain for recapitalisation of its banking sector. We agreed that the financial assistance to Spain will be provided by the EFSF until the ESM becomes available, and that it will then be transferred to the ESM, without gaining seniority status.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will shortly present proposals for a single supervisory mechanism for the financial sector, on the basis of Article 127 of the Treaty, so involving the European Central Bank. We ask the Council and Parliament to consider these proposals, as a matter of urgency, before the end of the year. When an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, the ESM would, for banks in the euro area and following a regular decision, be able to recapitalise banks directly, of course under certain conditions and in certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is clearly to avoid this recapitalisation impacting upon public debt. This single supervisory mechanism was a key proposal in our recent report ‘Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union’. It is a breakthrough. It also shows a clear link between the longer-term measures we are proposing and the short-term actions we are taking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro Group will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector, with a view to further improving the sustainability of Ireland’s well-performing adjustment programme.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure the financial stability of the euro area, we agreed to the possible use of existing EFSF/ESM instruments in a flexible and efficient manner, in order to stabilise markets for Member States which are complying with our common rules, recommendations and timetables. The short-term measures in both areas respect the fundamental approach of the eurozone’s policies ever since the start of the crisis: responsibility and solidarity. We need both. We tasked the Euro Group to implement these decisions. </p>
<p class="contents">The third important point concerns further deepening our Economic and Monetary Union. At their informal dinner of 23 May, the Heads of State or Government asked me to prepare, in close cooperation with the Presidents of the Commission, the Euro Group and the European Central Bank, a report on the future of the Economic and Monetary Union. The financial and debt crisis has exposed structural weaknesses in the EMU’s original design, which must be addressed. The stakes are high.</p>
<p class="contents">My report was not a final blueprint or master plan but offered a perspective on how to strengthen the EMU. It provided the main building blocks and a working method. It proposed an architecture based on more integrated frameworks for the financial sector, for budgetary matters, and for economic policy. It underlined the importance of strengthening, at the same time, the democratic legitimacy and accountability of decision making within the EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has asked me to continue this work, again in close cooperation with the Presidents of the Commission, the Euro Group and the European Central Bank, and associating the governments in this process. It will also ensure that our Parliament’s views are taken into account, and I look forward to working with you on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we first need to exhaust all possibilities under the current treaties, then explore which avenues could require treaty change. The October report will focus on the first type of proposal. Some solutions will be tailor-made to the members of the eurozone and those who are expected one day to join the euro. But the actions will matter for all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Council also discussed other matters. We had our first discussion during a European Council on the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020, a discussion to which your own President made a significant contribution. Under the Treaty, this is a matter for the Council of Ministers and for your Parliament. However, we all know from past experience that this is one of the areas in which the European Council will inevitably be called on to fulfil its role, under Article 15 of the Treaty, of defining ‘the general political directions and priorities’.</p>
<p class="contents">In having a discussion on the principles and priorities without specific figures, it was my intention to focus attention not on national advantages and disadvantages but on the strategic priorities for the Union as a whole. The European Council agreed that the MFF needs to be at the service of a strategy: jobs and growth throughout the Union. Hopefully, we will finalise the work before the end of the year at the level of the Council. Your Parliament, which adopted an important resolution on the MFF, will, of course, be involved in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council found – finally – a solution to the question of the European patent. The last outstanding point, the seat of the Unified Patent Court, was solved. After decades of unsuccessful attempts, this is a truly historic agreement. I call on your Parliament to finalise the agreement with the Council. I thank the Danish Prime Minister for the close cooperation we had in this respect, which led to our joint appeal to our colleagues’ sense of compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorsed the decision to open accession negotiations with Montenegro – a signal to the Western Balkans as a whole that they may have a European future if reform processes are maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">This concludes my report on a European Council meeting that achieved some significant results and took us a few more steps down our journey towards economic recovery. We dealt with short-, medium- and long-term problems. We found a balance between responsibility and solidarity. We worked on growth and jobs, on the one hand, and on financial stability, on the other hand. We need reforms in our Member States and collective action at the level of the EU and the eurozone. All this has to go hand in hand. It takes time. It demands courage. It will be implemented step by step. The agreements of Thursday and Friday are steps in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has done this at a very difficult moment. As I have said before, this is a defining moment for Europe, and indeed the sense of urgency was very present throughout the European Council, even if different governments were under pressure for different reasons. And as the causes of the pressure differ, so do preferences for potential solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, despite those difficulties, this European Council and euro area summit has, for the first time, tackled all the elements of a comprehensive response in one and the same meeting: namely, by agreeing on measures to boost growth and jobs, by setting out the next steps for further deepening of Economic and Monetary Union and by deciding on short-term stabilisation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as you know, has always argued that consolidation must be accompanied by sustainable growth created by structural reforms combined with targeted investment. It was therefore important that Heads of State or Government decided on the Compact for Growth and Jobs. This compact is based, very largely, on proposals put forward by the Commission and on ideas defended by this House, some of them since last year or even some years before. It turns intentions into concrete action with financing commitments, and sets out the levers for mobilising policies and funds – both at European level and at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that elements I have long been advocating at EU level are now becoming reality, namely: boosting the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank – you will remember, when I mentioned this here in the State of the Union address in September last year, Member States opposed this, but now they have agreed; launching the first phase of project bonds – this Commission proposal that was initially received with great scepticism has now been approved; and redirecting a certain amount of Structural Funds towards supporting, in particular, SMEs and young unemployed people. Indeed, the unemployment situation in Europe is by far the most worrying and urgent issue we should be able to address.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is the recognition that we have important work to do to realise the full potential of the Single Market, particularly in digital and network industries. Following the Single Market Act, the Commission will bring forward a further package of measures in the autumn, the Single Market Act II, so that this work can continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p class="contents">This, of course, is not the end of the efforts that need to be made. Legislation needs to be proposed, adopted and implemented. Action will be needed not from one institution on its own; all of us, Commission, Parliament and Council, need to work together, and work together fast.</p>
<p class="contents">This was recognised last week, and the conclusions acknowledge the need to improve cooperation to ensure the timely implementation of the Growth Compact. This will hopefully allow us to move towards an interinstitutional agreement to prioritise and speed up the relevant pieces of legislation, as I proposed in this House some weeks ago and as the European Parliament President made very clear in his offer to the European Council. I really expect such an agreement to be swiftly concluded. It would be an additional element of commitment and credibility on the delivery of our policy plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also generally endorsed the country-specific recommendations effectively closing the 2012 European Semester. This year, the semester has come of age with a real multilateral discussion. It is only natural that on some issues, there was a vigorous discussion, even when the evidence of loss of competitiveness inside the single market and internationally makes a clear case for action in the interest of our citizens and their jobs. The debate shows that the exercise is not just a technical and economic one. It is truly political.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the debate in the European Council, the awareness among many Heads of State or Government that we cannot separate the debate on growth from the debate on the European Union budget has also increased. The EU budget is our most important instrument for targeted investment and is an indispensable tool for growth and jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A long and complex negotiation is still ahead of us, but there is now momentum for a substantial outcome in reasonable time. This House has a full and vital role to play in this process, and the Commission will continue to work very closely with you.</p>
<p class="contents">It would indeed be a strong political and economic signal if we could reach agreement on the MFF by the end of this year. I am aware that this Parliament will want to work not only on the expenditure side, but also on the revenue side. I have already spoken about the overall developments on the financial transaction tax in the previous debate. Let me just reiterate in this context our conviction that moving to enhanced cooperation on the FTT does not mean that the debate on the FTT as an element of a new own-resources mix is closed. On the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking to the future, this European Council was able to define, on the basis of the report prepared by its President, together with the Presidents of the Commission, the European Central Bank and the Euro Group, the direction that further work must take on the creation of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. We all know that this is an undertaking that has to be built step by step over several years. This European Council has now asked for a specific and time-bound road map to be worked out by the end of the year. And it has endorsed this aspiration collectively, even if it is clear that not all Member States will want to be part of the ultimate outcome of the process. A stable euro is in the interest of the Union as a whole. The process must therefore combine the necessary deepening of the euro area and its openness towards the Member States who want to join the euro with the necessary safeguards for those who have an opt-out.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s view, we should start making the genuine EMU a reality as quickly as possible. We must, in particular, explore all that can be done on the basis of the existing treaties as a matter of urgency. In support of this, Heads of State or Government gave a clear commitment to the realisation of what the Commission has been calling a ‘banking union’ and we have done it already in our European Semester communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘banking union’ will be designed to fully address the structural shortcomings in the institutional framework for financial stability. As the aforementioned report puts it, addressing these shortcomings is particularly important for the euro area, given the deep interdependences resulting from the single currency. This must, of course, be done and must preserve the unity and integrity of the single market in the field of financial services, whilst allowing for specific differentiations between euro and non-euro area Member States on those parts of the framework that are preponderantly linked to the functioning of the EMU and the stability of the euro area rather than to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasise that these differentiations cannot go just in one way. Because it is so important, I want to make it crystal clear: they must respect the opt-outs from the euro area but they must also respect the fact that other Member States not yet in the euro will want to join as soon as they meet the conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">During the European Council, I confirmed that the Commission will bring forward proposals under Article 127 regarding the conferral upon the European Central Bank of banking supervision tasks. The strengthening of bank supervision became a central element of the consensus around this agenda. We will work out the detailed approach and its place in the wider architecture as a matter of priority and look forward to discussing it with all stakeholders, including, of course, this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe a banking union is an indispensable step. But a genuine EMU must go further. We need to build a fiscal union, a reinforced economic union, and take steps towards a political union. This is the logical consequence of the need for deeper integration to match our growing interdependence and need for financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">As we recognise that this greater solidarity requires greater responsibility, we also understand that this requires more democratic legitimacy and political accountability. I need not repeat what I said about this matter to you just a month ago. The Community method and the role and tasks of the EU institutions must be the starting point for all further improvements in this respect – and, let us be frank, it would be strange to say the least, when we are discussing the future of our Union, including its democratic and accountability aspects, for the democratic institution that directly represents European citizens, the European Parliament, not to be closely or directly associated with our decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not have been credible to address medium-term and long-term issues and not address the short-term challenges we face. Here, the euro area statement takes great significance. Let me underline the importance of this statement having been endorsed by all 27 Member States. This is a strong message and has been perceived as such by the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">The first measure is to allow for direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM under appropriate conditions once a single supervisory mechanism for the euro area is in place. The Commission’s intention to swiftly adopt a legislative proposal on the basis of Article 127 is also key in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we reached an agreement to waive the seniority of future loans for Spain’s financial sector recapitalisation under the ESM.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we agreed on the possibility of the flexible and effective use of all instruments for all Member States respecting their obligations under the European Semester, that is to say, the country-specific recommendations, the rules under the Stability and Growth Pact and the macro-economic imbalances procedure. These decisions represent the result of the recognition of the need for solidarity with responsibility. The Commission will work without delay on implementing them over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">After this European Council, provided that all Member States stick fully to the commitments that were made, we will be better equipped to face the serious challenges ahead. However, let us recall that all of this is work in progress. There is no quick fix, no magic fix, and there will be no magic solutions. The magnitude of the agenda of the European Council illustrates the magnitude of the work that is still ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Council has pulled together many separate ideas which have been discussed in the past, and I believe the result is greater than the sum of its parts. It does not mean that the crisis is over, far from that, but it does mean that there is now an expression of the political will to move ahead, to respond to pressing short-term issues, as well as to map out a vision of Europe in the longer term. The contributions this House has made to this end have been great and we welcome them. This is why I count on our close and intense cooperation also in the times to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end on this. While there was progress in recognition that there is a need for a stronger Europe, there was also very significant resistance to further steps forward, but there is a resistance precisely because there is movement. I want to reiterate my confidence that together, we will be able to make the European Union emerge stronger from the crisis and be able to better respond to the aspirations of its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joseph Daul, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the thirtieth European Council dedicated to the crisis. Although, in comparison to previous meetings, we are closer to reaching the desired solution, the road map towards European political integration is still not forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this time, substantial progress has been achieved. Following the country-specific economic recommendations proposed by the Commission, the document presented by Mr Van Rompuy is a step in the right direction, as it finally refers to political Europe as the ultimate aim. He mentions a preparation period spread over 10 years. Yet, each of us knows that Europe will not survive between now and 2022 without budgetary, fiscal and social integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I often wonder what political development the Twenty-Seven will judge sufficiently serious in order to consent to shared sovereignty. I wonder what graver problems are necessary, other than unemployment, the difficulties experienced by our companies, the prohibitive interest rates that our Member States must pay, in order to prove that a single currency must include a common economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is satisfied with the advances contained in the Growth and Employment Pact, even though this contains some of the long-standing proposals already put forward by this Parliament and the Commission. In this respect, I would like to say to you, Mr Barroso, that you must continue, together with Parliament, to put whatever is needed on the table, because when the Heads of State or Government come together, they are unable to find a solution. For each of them, it is a question of survival in their own countries. Therefore, we need Parliament, together with the Commission and Mr Van Rompuy, to come forward with, and put on the table, concrete proposals so that when governments find themselves strangled by the markets and suchlike, they may have a solution, as was the case with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the system of banking supervision, the proposal for a European guarantee and the European banking union project. Our fellow citizens must know that their savings are protected at all levels and that the instruments used to guarantee them are going in the right direction. Here too, we must strengthen protection. We need to guarantee the savings deposits of people who have worked all their lives, and you know we have problems with this issue at the moment. What now remains is the implementation of the instruments. That is why I again call upon the Commission, the Guardian of the Treaties, to ensure this happens.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE Group also supports the EUR 10 billion increase in capital from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Indeed, we must ensure that the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can finance their projects, keep their employees, in the first instance and, above all, be able to hire new staff. Although the provisions on the single market remain insufficient, project bonds, which were decided upon last Friday, are a step in the right direction. I welcome this move, insofar as it does not consist of supplementary funds that no longer exist, but rather better use of existing European funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight here that last month, the Latvian Prime Minister once again came to speak to our group in order to tell us that, faced with the imperative of budgetary cuts that were being forced upon him, he has only been able to restart his country’s economy thanks to European funds. This is an example that must be repeated. The Latvian Prime Minister did it and he informed his citizens. Thanks to European solidarity, combined with the courage of its leaders, this country has restored growth and employment. Just because it is a small country does not mean that we cannot emulate this example. We do not talk enough about these amazing examples for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we see that the solution to the majority of our problems lies in having more Europe. It is for that reason that my group places so much importance on the next multiannual financial framework, which is presently under discussion, as it will allow us to continue to finance our common policies. These funds constitute the base of European solidarity and are an essential instrument for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 1950s, European integration was necessary to guarantee peace and security in our continent. Today, this same integration is essential in order to protect our European social model which we have patiently constructed. It is essential in order to defend our common interests in international trade. It is essential for the promotion of our values and our humanist ideals, human rights, human dignity, transparency and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I repeat my call for a politically integrated Europe, not an intergovernmental Europe, as was supported by the Council in the Schengen case, or again last week concerning the issue of patents. For as long as the Community method is not our governance rule, nor that of the Council, Europe will lose ground. I know you have a difficult job, Mr Van Rompuy, but fear not! Make proposals with us, with Parliament and the Commission, to these Heads of State or Government who, as I said, do not have the capacity for reflection as they are obligated to manage their very difficult issues on a daily basis in each of their respective countries. We need a much more integrated Europe. We must compare what works, the countries that cope – because there are some – and apply their example to those that work less well.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have what I want us to put on the table, Mr Barroso, during the next two months. We will reflect further on this during the holidays and then we will make proposals in September, if the markets allow us to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A lot of things were decided that could take us forward in a positive way, if they are now also approved by the Heads of Government which decided them – and I will come back to that – and if the Commission and this Parliament now also turn the specific proposals into legislation, for example, on the banking union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are saying goodbye, goodbye to Merkozy, goodbye to a structure in which two parties – let me correct that: one party – believed they could decide what would and would not happen in Europe. I am very grateful to President Hollande for having strengthened the voice of social democracy. I am likewise very grateful to Mario Monti, who has shown though the same persistence as Chancellor Merkel, that things cannot continue as before. I would also like to thank Mr Rajoy, because Mr Rajoy has also commented that there need to be changes in Europe if we are not to end up with a fatal crisis of the euro area and of Europe as a whole. We can now see light at the end of the tunnel, although people are right to say that we have not yet come through the tunnel. Nonetheless, we can see light. It is now a matter of moving towards that light.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two possible economic cycles that we must decide between. One is austerity, which reduces growth and investment and increases the deficit. That is the cycle we are in. The other cycle is growth and investment, which reduces the deficit and improves budgetary equilibrium and thus, in turn, growth and employment. The figures today show that we have the highest unemployment rate in the euro area, so it is high time that we implemented what we decided at the summit and do even more besides. We must promise the unemployed that we really will implement these things, because they deserve it.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean abandoning reforms. Would anyone say that Mr Monti is not carrying out reforms in Italy? If so, they should come out and say it here. Would anyone say that Mr Rajoy is not carrying out reforms in Spain? If so, they should say it here. What use are reforms, however, if there is no growth to support the reforms? What was decided at the summit is actually the only chance we have of enabling the reforms to succeed at all, which is why it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be quite clear, however, in saying that there are two prime ministers – as I understand it – who have already backed down from what was decided at the summit, who have said that they will not be able to support it. I have some questions for the prime ministers of the Netherlands and Finland. Were you asleep? It was late at night, so perhaps you were. Did you not understand what it was about? Or do you want to say something different at home to what you say in Brussels? Whichever way, it is scandalous. Mr Van Rompuy, I ask you to call on the two prime ministers to acknowledge the outcome of the summit.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commission to now submit swift proposals for the banking union and much more. The Commission and the European Parliament indicated as far back as two years ago how important it was to have real European banking supervision. Back then, the Council and its members said it was all much too much, we have to shoulder the responsibility – not knowing or not wanting to know how the financial systems are linked together and networked and that we need this European supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">We could have had all this already. All of which leads me onto another essential point, Mr Van Rompuy, and that is the relationship of the Council and some prime ministers or ministers with the European Parliament. Let me start with Schengen. What was done is scandalous. We have made this quite clear to the Council Presidency. It is not acceptable. I am very grateful to you, President Barroso, that today you reiterated quite clearly your support for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European patent: exactly when, Mr Van Rompuy, did the European Council start making legislation at midnight? That is not the Council’s job. The Council is mandated to make legislation with the European Parliament, but not on its own. Most prime ministers, and I do not blame them for this, do not even know in detail what you took out of the regulation. Is it really such a great solution – I am still waiting for an answer from Mr Callanan on this – for the United Kingdom to now propose three seats? Perhaps the UK would also like to have an additional seat of the European Parliament in London – that is quite possible too, before or after the referendum. I do not know what Mr Cameron has in mind.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I very much appreciate what the President of the Commission said on this. As I have already said, we could have had the banking union long ago. I still do not understand – perhaps that is not your fault, Mr Van Rompuy – why the President of Parliament was not invited to the deliberations. We are not talking about detailed legislation here; we are talking about the future of Europe. You are debating the future of Europe without a representative of the only directly elected body in the European Union. I consider that scandalous. It is an attitude that I find unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Discuss with us, invite us! As the example of the banking union shows, nearly all the groups of this House come up with good ideas – we just think of them earlier than the Council. It might not be a bad thing for the Council to come up with these ideas earlier for once, too, through discussions with the European Parliament. Listen to the European Parliament a bit more and invite the President of Parliament to attend your deliberations.</p>

First of all, I think we should welcome the growth package that has finally been decided and the necessary provision for tightening the budget in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the decision on a single banking supervisor. I should say: finally a decision. You will remember that two years ago, the Member States and the Council refused to go in that direction, as Parliament requested at that time. The Commission advised caution and said that we could do it later. Well, it is later now and I think it is a good decision. The only thing we should ask is that, if we create this new agency, we do not split it across three Member States. It has to be a real single supervisor with powers to close down banks in any Member State, and with no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy, I will not discuss the third decision: more flexibility for the EFSF and the ESM. Apparently, a number of Member States today have another opinion – mainly Finland. My question to you is what has been really decided now? Is Finland’s opinion and statement the right one? Is it necessary to have unanimity or not?</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is a key question. Why is it a key question? Because already today, if you look at the markets, you can see the effect of this attitude. The Spanish spreads had gone up again to 491 by mid-morning – that is almost 500 basic points – so we are not out of this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The main thing that we did in this European Council was to successfully borrow time again. How much I do not know. Is it days, is it weeks, is it months? But we must use this time in a good way. Why? Not like previous occasions, not like in December 2011, for example, when the European Central Bank performed two operations and injected EUR 1 trillion into the banking system. Some of us thought that the crisis was behind us, that the crisis was over. Well I think that we wasted time at the beginning of this year. Apart from the Fiscal Compact, no structural solution was found to the crisis at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">So my message today is that we should not waste time again. Is it really necessary to wait for an interim report in October and then for a final report by the end of the year? This is not an interim crisis. We need fundamental action now. I think it is better not to wait until October and then wait until the end of the year to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to use the positive spillover from Friday’s decisions to launch directly the economic and political union we desperately need so we can show the outside world – our friends in the G8 and the G20 and the markets – that we have learned our lesson. So action is needed and, Mr Barroso, action means concrete legislation. My plea to you is very clear. We now have a window of opportunity only of a few weeks, not more than that – and if Finland continues in this way, it will even be destroyed within a few hours.</p>
<p class="contents">We must come forward, before September, with a concrete legislative package. I agree with Mr Daul that we have until September to do that and to put a legislative package on the table with three elements: firstly, a real banking union – not only supervision but also a deposit guarantee scheme and a joint resolution fund; secondly, a real integrated budgetary framework, including eurobills and a redemption fund – this crisis is not over if there is not at least the beginning of a redemption fund and a partial mutualisation of the debt; and, finally, democratic transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr Barroso, use your right of initiative. Do not wait until the end of the year. Put this legislative package on the table for the Council and for Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I also have to tell you that I find all these jabs based on football analogies quite repellent in these times of crisis, because all we know politically at this point in time is that if we do not manage to come together as a European team, then we will fail.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I did find comfort in some of the things that have been communicated from the Council corridors. Indeed, one might get the impression that the Council has actually learnt something from these difficult recent sessions. I got the impression that it has at last understood that we are not dealing with a sovereign debt crisis, but with a crisis of our common currency, because the euro can only function as a common currency if, in fact, we also have a common fiscal policy. This recent recognition that it will also only work if we construct common supervision of the banking sector and a common banking union is something that I found a comfort, because in the final event, whether or not the Council has learnt these fundamental things is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thought it very good that it seems increasingly to be grasping the fact that the euro can only work if the countries in the euro area are prepared to take on debts and risks within this common currency area. I was pleased to see that this realisation has grown, even though in the days leading up to the summit, Chancellor Merkel made it a matter of life and death. In this connection, it was also very important that, as regards Spain and Italy, it was decided that it was essential to separate bank risk from sovereign risk, and that in fact, we must not allow countries to be dragged deeper and deeper into the abyss because they have to try to provide guarantees for bankrupt banks. Unfortunately, these insights that I have described, and which gave me some comfort as I observed the Council, were not then sufficiently incorporated into the decisions. What was decided in respect of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is highly conditional, just as before.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to support what the previous speaker, Mr Verhofstadt, said. If you wait until the end of the year, then I would venture to say to anyone living outside our continent who has always wanted to come here: visit Europe while it still exists! If you and the Commission do not put proposals on the table for September concerning how we can now construct the banking union as quickly as possible; how we want to work in a fiscal union with eurobills, a debt redemption fund and then the prospect of eurobonds; if you do not make it clear how we actually want to communitarise all the crisis instruments, including the ESM and EFSF; if you do not present a convincing pact for lasting economic recovery and development; if you do not make it clear how you wish to develop and implement the financial transaction tax; if you do not put forward a really convincing programme to combat youth unemployment – then we will not get far with restoring confidence in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, it is you who, together with the European Parliament, must exert pressure to ensure that the next decisions are genuinely ready for debate in September. Mr Van Rompuy, I realise that you and I are different kinds of people, but the sedate way that you notify us of the Council’s inadequate decisions time and time again is something that is simply beyond my comprehension.</p>

After all, the debts for which we are jointly liable today are the taxes of tomorrow. No taxation without representation. That is a very important point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second, very specific, question is as follows. You said that bank risk should be separated from sovereign risk, and that we have now succeeded in this. However, the European Stability Mechanism, which is currently recapitalising the banks, is borne by sovereign states. In other words, sovereign risk is being distributed differently, but it is still there. What is your assessment of this? I take a very critical view of it, and where the conclusion of the Euro Group is concerned, I am decidedly sceptical as regards how vague it has been kept and what impact it will have in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that we have not moved forward in both these areas simultaneously has had a devastating effect on the situation in Europe and has heightened the European crisis; instead, we have concentrated solely on budgetary solidity – particularly because of Germany’s attitude – while at the same time demanding of countries that they take on significant risks. I believe that, with the fiscal pact, we have laid the basis for us now to increase efforts in respect of the instrument of solidarity.</p>

Clearly, Germany is not the most competitive European country at everything. Of course at least, it allows Spain to boast of some success from the Euros – well they are certainly more successful than France were at the games, anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look under the surface of last week’s summit, we find that, in reality, the decisions taken were, of course, just another set of short-term stopgaps. Perhaps they relieve the immediate pressure points but it was hardly the game-changer that the Irish Prime Minister claimed. Using the bank recapitalisation and buying bonds may give Spain and Italy some breathing space. However, I find it slightly ironic that the same people in this House who want to bash the bankers and propose a financial transaction tax – to punish the bankers at every opportunity – are the same people that are perfectly happy for the risks and profligacy of those same bankers to be transferred on to the backs of taxpayers through these bailout funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, the markets responded positively on Friday – finally perhaps they had seen some signs of life from EU leaders. However, as is usual in these things, already the deal seems to be unravelling. Countries like Finland and the Netherlands are challenging the new roles for the bailout funds that they seemed to have agreed to in the summit on Thursday night. When the dust has settled, the small print is read and the details are finally discussed, I fear that the outcome of this summit could be far less seismic than many in this House want to believe.</p>
<p class="contents">That is because, yet again, the fundamental questions have not been answered. The lack of competitiveness of many countries has not been addressed. The possible mutualisation of debts has yet again been avoided. Relying on the ESM and the EFSF is no long-term solution to this crisis because they are not bottomless pits of money with the power to grant our every wish. If they are being committed to bank bailouts and used for secondary bond purchases, will there, in fact, be anything left over for the sovereign bailouts for which, let us remember, they were originally, intended?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not pretend that even this relatively small shift in German policy was arrived at with great harmony. Even for these few small concessions, it seems that Italy had to hold the proverbial gun to Germany’s head. In reality, what we saw in the Council highlighted that, even for countries in the euro, the mentality is still one of maximising national interests. Now do not get me wrong, I fully support national governments fighting their corner, but let us also be clear that the euro was never a tool aimed at helping countries to defend their national interests. As Margaret Thatcher remarked in 1990, the single currency is about the politics of Europe. It is about a federal Europe by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">The great irony of it is that this very tool that was intended to unify the peoples of Europe is, in fact, now driving them further apart, because it was always inevitable that permanent fiscal transfers would be required from the north to the south, with Germany acting as the paymaster of less competitive countries. It was also inevitable that we would see the supranationalisation of economic policy, effectively rendering national democracy defunct within the eurozone. In the future, will there, in fact, be much point in holding elections in many eurozone countries if their budgets and fiscal policies are going to be rewritten by Brussels every time? This is not a small point that should be brushed under the carpet; it is a fundamental issue of accountability of government to the peoples in their own democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we face an impasse: Germany wants to supplant economic policy at EU level; the Mediterranean countries want Germany to underwrite their debts. I am reminded of the story of the two politicians. One says to the other, ‘OK, let’s be honest with each other’; the other one says, ‘all right, but you first’. Inevitably, someone has to move first – but let us never forget that there is an alternative. It is for the eurozone to reduce in size so that some countries have the ability to devalue their way back to relative competitiveness. That would be a political disaster for the euro’s cheerleaders, but for some countries, it remains the least worst option and a possible way out of this crisis.</p>

There is one reason why I am pleased that Germany did not get to the final, because if you continue with this analogy, it suggests that whoever becomes European champions becomes one of the most indebted countries – Greece in 2004, Spain in 2008 and 2012. I do not know what would have happened in Germany, but I am glad we have been spared that fate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy, at the end of the G20 summit, you stated that the economic union should exist by the end of the year. These were empty words, however, which have not been fulfilled even now after the summit. I therefore have to agree with those who say we should stop rushing from one summit to the next, and that we should ensure, once and for all, that together – and that means the people of the European Union and their directly elected representatives in the European Parliament, the national parliaments and the other European institutions – we talk about what should actually follow and where the journey will lead us. It can only be a joint debate, and it must start now. We need concrete ideas now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Head of Government’s statement kept talking of a breakthrough. I doubt that it is really a breakthrough. Influenced by election campaigns and elections in Greece and France, those in power have, in fact, decided more or less hesitantly, half-heartedly, or even inconsistently, on greater stability and security, and on the configuration of the European Union. They have not passed the regulatory measures that have been recognised as being needed, however.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I would say that the EU, the Member States and also the euro area remain in crisis because there has been no change in their priorities and because there has been no shift away from the path of global competitiveness, neoliberal deregulation and the privatisation of public services and social security systems. Admittedly, there has been some relaxation of the strict line of German austerity policy, in that access to aid funds from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is being eased without the countries affected having to submit additional reform programmes. In this connection, I should like to say that we should be grateful to the Greek population and to the Syriza party and Alexis Tsipras for having drawn attention to precisely this sore point, and we should now renegotiate with the Greek Government in the interests of the Greek population.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the fully announced pact for growth and jobs is still not specific enough and lacks the necessary goals. The revenues required to finance such a programme are limited to the money created by the European Central Bank and to European Investment Bank credit. It is likely that we will have to wait some time before the financial transaction tax becomes effective, too. The other sums included in the EUR 120 billion package seem to have been counted twice. They were already available anyway, and essentially it has now simply been confirmed that these funds will be made available swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to the important question of which investments and spending programmes are to receive these funds promptly remains relatively vague. The idea put forward by the French to use 1% of GNI for such a growth and employment programme does not sound bad in itself, but what is dubious is what Chancellor Merkel highlighted at the press conference, which is that it is to be used mainly to promote public private partnerships. In other words, what we are selling as an employment programme is ultimately also a programme to maximise the profits of private companies and corporations. In the final event, that will only make it more difficult to introduce concrete regulation of the financial sphere. In doing this, we are putting the next stumbling block in place for ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Rolling Stones might say, the 19th nervous breakdown, and that is reflected I think by the funereal mood in this Chamber this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, on that Friday morning ‘breakthrough’ was cried, and indeed Mr Van Rompuy parroted the word this morning: ‘breakthrough’. Nobody believes you. The wheels are coming off.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Stability Mechanism, your new bailout vehicle, is doomed before it starts. We have legal challenges in Ireland and in Germany. We have the Estonian Justice Minister saying it will not fit their constitution but – most fun of all – the Finns and the Dutch seem to have broken the agreement that was made in the middle of the night. Perhaps they were excluded from this, perhaps the little countries do not have a say in Europe at all any more. It is not credible. The euro crisis now looks to me to be frankly insoluble.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a massive crisis of leadership. It is lovely to see you, Mr Van Rompuy. You have not been here for many months; it is delightful to have you back. Last time you were here, you told us we had turned the corner, that the worst of the crisis was over. With every one of your predictions, it goes on getting worse. I am sorry, sir: you do not have the presence, the credibility or the standing for the international markets to believe that you can provide a solution. And Mr Barroso here: at the G20, he stood up at the press conference and said that we do not need any lessons in democracy – said the unelected President of the European Commission. I mean, he went on to say that the eurozone’s problems had been caused by unorthodox practices in North America.</p>
<p class="contents">You have made yourselves an international laughing stock. You do not have any credibility. But one piece of helpful advice from me: do not this summer go on any billionaires’ yachts on extended holidays, because the markets guarantee we will all be back here in August. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The state of affairs surrounding the ESM Treaty is obviously unacceptable and undemocratic. I will explain to you why that is the case, Mr Van Rompuy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has approved two major amendments to the ESM Treaty. Under the first amendment, support will, from now on, be granted directly to banks and will no longer have to go to Member States. The second amendment is that, from now on, loans from the ESM will no longer enjoy preferential status.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Council has thus proposed such a crucial amendment of the text of the treaty that the treaty must be ratified again. The Netherlands is required to contribute EUR 40 billion to this. We are talking about a substantial amount here, namely, more than EUR 5 000 per Dutch household. It goes without saying that such a treaty, with such financial implications, requires a careful ratification process.</p>
<p class="contents">Our democracy requires that, Mr Van Rompuy. Parliament is currently in the final stages of ratifying the ESM. However, our members have wrongly assumed that no direct bank support was possible. Even the Dutch Prime Minister Rutte has said that it would be undesirable for the ESM to provide direct support to banks. And now, all of a sudden, it seems that that will take place nonetheless. This means that Parliament has been misinformed or Mr Swoboda is perhaps right in saying that Prime Minister Rutte is saying one thing in Brussels to you, Mr Van Rompuy, and another at home. I would like clarification on that, Mr Van Rompuy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wim Voermans, who is Professor of Constitutional and Administrative Law at the University of Leiden, has also investigated the legal implications of this. Quote: ‘Direct payment to banks is not possible under the current treaty. The treaty would have to be changed and re-ratified’. Unquote. Article 12 of the ESM is crystal clear: ESM stability support may only be provided to ESM Members and, therefore, not to banks.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment, too, which means that the ESM loans to Spain no longer have preferential status, represents a crucial change in the conditions of the treaty. Parliament has been put on the right track. To conclude, Mr President: the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is of the opinion that this approach is undemocratic, unlawful and unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Euro 2012 ended with a clear result: Spain won. The European Council ended but the results are not clear, because if we read the papers in the various Member States, each country is claiming a different result, and each prime minister of the participating Member States is claiming a different result.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy, can you tell us what you agreed on? Do you think that 500 million European citizens have the right to know what you agreed on? Please tell us, President of the Council, but think carefully, because how the markets open tomorrow, too, depends on what you say. Think carefully, because the survival of my country’s government depends on what you say. For a long time, the survival of our countries’ governments has depended on what you say.</p>
<p class="contents">I think also that 60 million Italians who, via the Prodi and Berlusconi governments, have made budgetary adjustments amounting to EUR 145 billion, and who, via the Monti government, are making sacrifices amounting to several billions of euro, have the dignity and the right to be given precise answers. We therefore want to know, in specific detail, what was agreed in the Council and what obligations there are for the Member State governments, which are today bombarding us with contradictory statements.

<p class="contents">The issue of growth is no longer taboo and the discussion about the broad economic guidelines is now under way. The European Union will not be able to emerge from the rut of the crisis without breaking the vicious circle of austerity, which could condemn Member States to an endless recession. I am delighted that this sound political sense can at last be found in the conclusions and I am glad that France and its President, Mr Hollande, have contributed to this political rebalancing and are committed, out of solidarity, to the path of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">However, although hope is essential, full implementation is what will restore confidence permanently. With EUR 120 billion having been mobilised within the framework of the Growth and Employment Pact, and EUR 10 billion of recapitalisation from the European Investment Bank (EIB), these will allow bonds to be issued for the purpose of financing projects. The European Parliament must be heard concerning a coherent financial framework and own resources. The mobilisation of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the launch of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which we would have liked to see granted a banking licence, is the most urgent matter for Spain and Italy, without forgetting the Greek citizens who have been hit hard by the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The quick implementation of a banking supervisor for the euro area is only the first step towards banking union, which Parliament strongly advocates. Moreover, we cannot content ourselves with a limited tax on financial transactions, even if its implementation within the framework of enhanced cooperation could constitute a first step. In this way, we expect a lot from the next European Council, where the group of four – four Presidents, of course – will have to propose an ambitious road map in order to advance economic and monetary union and to enable the definitive resolution of the sovereign debt crisis and the instability of the euro area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is something that we have often called for here and we thank you for this. There are both vital measures concerning the banks and the spreads, and the vision that you have displayed. Point duly noted, thank you. However, there are two tragic contradictions. The first has just been mentioned, in particular, by Mr Mauro: we must be serious with respect to the markets. Whatever you have decided, find an agreement from the outset on its communication. I have a request for you, Mr Van Rompuy, silence them. Silence them! Speak in the name of the European Council. Let us stop this shameless cacophony. What company, human group, family, even, would tolerate the fact that after a meeting, each person goes and talks about who knows what. What is at stake here is the destiny of southern Europe. Mr Van Rompuy. Silence them!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, concerning democratic legitimacy, the last point, but a very important one, regarding your paper: I observe, nonetheless, an enormous discrepancy between the goodwill shown on paper and what happens in reality. The only point on which you have made progress concerning banking union is with regard to supervision. That affects an area in which this Parliament has fought together with the Commission against the Council, which was dragging its feet, in order to have European supervision. Perhaps it is a good thing that the European Central Bank (ECB) takes charge of this, I have nothing against the idea, but, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, this must be debated in a democratic forum. You cannot withdraw competences that were granted to Parliament, and concerning something that we have worked on together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that a growth pact has now been decided on by this Council. However, much of it is built on sand. Of the EUR 120 billion, EUR 55 billion is supposed to come from Structural Fund monies. I do not yet understand how this is supposed to be mobilised in the short term without the Member States making additional short-term payments into the EU budget. I would like to hear you state exactly and categorically whether these payments exist – what commitments were made there to allow this EUR 55 billion to actually now flow into sustainable growth?</p>
<p class="contents">The second question that I would like to ask relates to the banking union. You have proposed that we proceed on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). That means unanimity in the Council and thus also a right of veto for the United Kingdom and other opponents. I can only urge you to make this banking union, but to make it on the basis of the Community method, and that means on the same basis as has already been negotiated here for common banking supervision. The democratic rights of the European Parliament must not be eroded here. I would ask you to proceed on this basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The latest European summit was appalling. What we saw was, as the German press wrote, a brutal act of blackmail. Apparently, European integration is all about money while prostituting the word ‘solidarity’. What we perceived was Mr Monti acting as a mob leader to get at easy money. Blackmailing Germany is not difficult. Just refer to the past and their knees will weaken.</p>
<p class="contents">The ESM Treaty was changed, although many national parliaments had ratified it. So what is now applicable law? We simply do not know. The ESM Treaty is not a treaty, but is it a piece of paper, perhaps waiting for the shredder, or is it, Mr Van Rompuy, a piece of scrap paper? Are you the scrap-paper President?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Monti made a fatal mistake. He galvanised the sentiment of resentment in northern Europe. People feel fooled, robbed and they will resist. Look at Finland and Holland. In Mediterranean Europe, we spread the feeling that there is access to more money, so the pressure for reform will drop and people will ask: why should we suffer if fresh money is on the way? There is only one solution and it is regaining competitiveness. There is no substitute for it and no short cut to a transfer union. The more you push for a transfer union, the sooner the euro will break up.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, where are our colleagues from the German Christian Democrats? I see hardly anyone from the CDU/CSU. Mr Pöttering has already disappeared. Where are they? They should defend their country, but they are absent. The German press will know. They will write about it so that everybody knows in Germany. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The wrong European monetary policy produces a crisis, and the 19th crisis Council then decides that the solution to the crisis is more Europe. That means that an incorrect policy is now, so to speak, to be further institutionalised by a fiscal union, an economic union, a political union, a kind of remodelled EUSSR. All of this is down to the paper from this gang of four which is preparing a cold coup and wants to be a crisis profiteer, namely, a political profiteer from the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Tell me what solidarity is supposed to mean in the European currency area. Solidarity means transferring prosperity from the countries with a positive balance to those countries that cannot manage to balance their budgets. Tell that to the people, and then we will see what the people say about it. If you want democratic legitimisation, these people will tell you that they reject it, because they are not prepared to accept the liability for banks and their speculative activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The pact for growth and employment is a mishmash of slogans – slogans and catchphrases that have been heard from summits plenty of times before. Neither I, nor other people in Europe, therefore have any confidence that you will solve this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This morning you, Mr Van Rompuy – and you more than Mr Barroso, in fact – have dashed those hopes and have cast doubt on a solution that had been touted in the papers and all the statements as a turning point, a new approach and a chance for Europe to rebuild and restore real confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Barroso that it is a very important basic principle to make it clear in the various statements and in the final document that monetary stability in a modern economy can only lead to financial stability. Someone called it an historic statement; I see it as a basic premise to start from.</p>
<p class="contents">If the state bailout fund gives the virtuous countries that have access to the fund the chance to recapitalise, then there is a real prospect, a real possibility. The term ‘possible’ dominates the final document; of course I join those who are laying a huge responsibility on your shoulders right now. In your reply, you must explain effectively and decisively whether the Member States can really put plans into action and be confident that it is not merely a general, abstract reversal of a trend that is not going well and is not enough for the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is said to be making do because we need to reach the end of the tunnel. I believe we are a very long way from the end of the tunnel and so, as regards putting plans into action, we had imagined that all the uncertainty of the previous year in Europe might be swept away by a real, effective decision to be reached at the Brussels Summit. Should we feel disappointed on this point? Should we wonder why it has not come true? Please tell us, Mr Van Rompuy, so we can avoid all these misunderstandings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament had already made this change of course a few months ago, and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament had made it a couple of years ago. We therefore welcome this new course.</p>
<p class="contents">This Council is seeing, and will see, in my view, the decline of the high-handedness of the two leaders’ pact and of the dogmatic high-handedness of those who have simply proposed tough measures and punishments and have not in any way taken into account their social consequences. This decline of high-handedness does, in fact, represent a return to reality. The reality is that, without growth, there will be no jobs, and we now know that unemployment is at the highest level the European Union has ever seen.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that, without growth and jobs, the social crisis will explode and the legitimacy of the European project will collapse. Let us therefore ensure that the signs that the Council is showing become a reality in the coming months, let us support the countries making real sacrifices, such as Italy and Spain, and let us put pressure on those countries which, having made a decision, are now throwing up obstacles: Finland and the Netherlands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The summit was scarcely any different from earlier summits, with one exception: seldom have the negotiating tactics – which sometimes bordered on blackmail – and the differences between the negotiating partners been played out so clearly to the outside world as this time. In the end, agreement was reached on Friday morning.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it turns out that, when it comes down to it, the consensus reached was only a formal compromise, which was then called into question again just 72 hours after being reached. The Dutch and the Finns have already announced that they do not support the buying of government bonds on the secondary market. The markets, which had, until then, reacted positively, are now also beginning to question and smear the result.</p>
<p class="contents">I expressly welcome the fact that it was decided at the summit to get serious about creating a real banking union. If we have a common economic area and currency area, then we also need a genuine functioning internal market for financial services. Naturally, that includes bank supervision, but it also includes a banking resolution and rescue fund, and ultimately it also includes a deposit guarantee system.</p>
<p class="contents">All that will take time, and I hope that the European Parliament will be adequately taken into consideration at least in the first step, the construction of supervision at the European Central Bank, and things will not continue as they have done recently.</p>
<p class="contents">This summit was definitely not the great breakthrough. It was not a great act of liberation. The citizens are just as uncertain as before, and I fear that we will continue to muddle along. I can only hope that we have enough time in which to find the ultimate solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I doubt whether talk of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) and the review of the Savings Tax Directive is the way to overcome the crisis. The European doctrine for overcoming the crisis should be built on three pillars: firstly, the promotion of production and adequate consumption; secondly, savings not at the expense of public revenue but bureaucratic state apparatus and state banking sector spending; thirdly, effective use of European Union funds, also for critical social reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Direct aid from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to the banks can only take place once a European banking supervisor has been set up. That is also a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, Mr Van Rompuy, let us not be naïve. Some crucial issues remain unresolved. We will still need a good many more EU summits in order to try to provide the answers of economic and monetary integration in the euro area, put simply, political integration. For we cannot guarantee a growth model that is based on public spending without the consolidation and cleaning up of public finances. There cannot be financial solidarity without budgetary, fiscal, and social harmonisation. The premise is simple: we do not pay off debt by creating more debt. We know that by pooling the debts of countries that do not have the same economic and budgetary policies, we will endanger some Member States by committing them to guaranteeing debts that they do not control.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I hope that France will very quickly ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which was signed last January and could not, of course, be renegotiated. However, Mr Monti has operated very well. However, it should strengthen the bonds of trust between Member States, since it is not desirable to provoke them, nor is it desirable to strongly oppose Germany. It serves no purpose. The Franco-German psychodrama is not in anyone’s interest and this is not the best way to address Europe’s future at this difficult time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Mr Van Rompuy, the Member States have not yet dared to make the leap. Indeed, it is a major breakthrough to say that we want to make the European Stability Mechanism more active. That is only right and proper. If we do not, we will not really be able to halt the crisis. However, it is also entirely clear to me why the first Member States are already backing off again, why the first heroes of their troops are already disappearing back into the bushes. Why? It is because they forgot to clarify how the stability mechanism would be financed so as to be able to afford this.</p>
<p class="contents">That takes us to the problem at the heart of this debate. Europe faces a challenge. We will only overcome the crisis if we are able to make a great qualitative leap: more Europe, better ways of working and more joint action. However, we cannot make a run-up to this great leap while at the same time slamming on the brakes. That is what is constantly demonstrated by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also say, as regards the second topic, that it is right to say that we want to create a programme for growth. The growth programme is essential. You have opportunities to do so, Mr Van Rompuy, as does Mr Barroso. Simply show us the figures, however, for how much this growth programme can generate. Will it be 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.6% of gross national income? What will it cost to implement the rules of the fiscal pact, which are still too rigid? Perhaps 1%, 1.5%? What is the bill?

In many ways, we could say that last week’s decision paves the way for a positive development in which those countries with economic problems will have time to adjust. That is all very well. At the same time, the meeting left a number of open questions that have also been discussed here in the Chamber today, and it is clear that there are those who choose to interpret the meeting’s decision in a way that will come across as opportune to their home public.</p>
<p class="contents">This is understandable for political reasons, but it is regrettable all the same. For example, it has been implied that an agreement has been reached to the effect that the rescue fund is later to operate on the so-called secondary bond market. As far as I understand, this is not the case. If it were the case, it would certainly be stated very clearly in the minutes of the meeting, and it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">With an eye to the future, I believe that it is wise to stick to what we have actually agreed and not make a whole lot of digressions and interpretations, as this will only lead to those countries that are already standing there with their purses open distancing themselves even more from the decisions, and that is not desirable in a situation in which we are making joint sacrifices in order to get ourselves out of this difficult economic situation.</p>

The move towards banking union is to be welcomed, and the road map for genuine monetary union is a good starting point. However, closer integration should preserve the unity and integrity of the Union of 27 and its single market. Agreed initial measures – some would say half-measures – should evolve into full measures of banking, fiscal and political union. Measures addressed to the EU of 17 only – some would say half-union solutions – should evolve and be open for all members, at least those which are willing.</p>
<p class="contents">We should avoid being satisfied with half measures for a half Union. We should not accept the logic of differentiation and a two-speed integration of the EU. Eurozone ‘ins’ and future ‘ins’ are, and should remain, in the same boat. Only those who opt out should practise derogations. Advanced integration of 17 at the expense of the disintegration of 27 is not an acceptable solution. We need an inclusive, not exclusive, format. We should preserve and cherish a single institutional framework and avoid having 17 restricted institutions in parallel, separate for ‘ins’ and ‘pre-ins’, resulting in interinstitutional cleavages. We should avoid dual-level solidarity, two parallel budgets and double macro-economic standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Collateral political damage done to the European project by half-Europe anti-crisis measures would be great. There is huge potential for growth in the EU maintaining integral economic and political unity. Unravelling this unity will not bring us closer to winning the battle with the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Van Rompuy, if you had gone into a national parliament in any country in Europe and made the speech that you made here today, I think people throughout Europe would have understood precisely the opposite of what they had read in the newspapers three days ago, that you had made Europe take a giant step forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is essential to come here to this House not only to tell us what happened at the summit, but also to say what the Council intends to do after this summit. If you do not tell us that, you will be throwing away the chance to tell the European public that we are working towards a united Europe and to getting a step closer to rescuing the countries in difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">In your reply, Mr Van Rompuy, I would also like you to tell us exactly what you think of the position taken by the Dutch and Finnish Governments. It is your duty to say what your thoughts are on that, because otherwise we will have the impression that the Council ended with a statement that does not correspond to any genuine political will. You should be very careful about this, as I hope not too many journalists heard it, because you know how much influence the media has these days on the fate of countries and the evolution of their spreads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The feeling of powerlessness was such that Europe was forced to react, and it did so for the good of everyone, because the big winner of this summit was the euro. This triumph has revived the hope that Europe is emerging from its paralysis, moving from thought towards action. Ladies and gentlemen, it was essential to adopt short-term measures at this summit, in order to guarantee financial stability, along with long-term measures, in order to solve the Union’s shortcomings. In this case, immediate action was essential in order to continue working towards what is important. The imperative result was to send a message that the euro is a joint, irrevocable and irreversible project.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome such important decisions as giving the European Stability Mechanism the facility to recapitalise banks directly, which will break the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; incidentally, the current Spanish Government has always advocated this theory. It will also help in terms of intervening in markets to support the public debt of the countries that are fulfilling their public deficit and reform commitments. These decisions were necessary in order to guarantee financial stability, which must be the European Union’s highest priority in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the time for some countries to resort to nationalist maxims and throw up obstacles. As I have already said, it is the time to support Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is providing and implementing, in record time, the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of Spanish democracy, which includes major employment reforms. It is also carrying out a financial reform, based on complete transparency, all of which demonstrates its commitment to fiscal consolidation and hitting its deficit targets.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the decision to launch a process for greater economic integration, using four building blocks: banking union, fiscal union, a common economic policy framework and enhanced democratic legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the history of first the Community and then of the European Union has always shown that, not only do we overcome crises, but also we emerge from them stronger. I am delighted that, once again, we have achieved this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the first place, it is good that it is finally being recognised that budgetary discipline is only effective if it is accompanied – not followed, accompanied – by growth and employment. However, the growth and employment initiative will only yield results if it is able to correct the internal imbalances within the EU, which are the cause of the crisis. It will only be effective if it opens up employment and business opportunities, in particular, for economies that have repeatedly lost out with the functioning of the internal market and the single currency, and if it contributes to emerging from the crisis, above all, for those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, it is good that breaking the spiral of contagion between Member States’ debt and that of the banks is now central to the agenda. While there are new proposals, it is not politically acceptable for banks in crisis to end up benefiting from greater European assistance and less stringent restrictions than those imposed on the Member States. Banks and Member States can hardly compete for access to the same public funds, especially if such funds are clearly inadequate, as is the case with the European Stability Mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">If a bank fails, it should not be the case that the taxpayers pay more than shareholders, nor that bank resolution funds come predominantly from the public purse, rather than from the banks themselves. Finally, depositors should not have their savings in euro put in jeopardy by the crisis. It is vital to ensure that this is all made impossible as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">One last thing, before I finish, Mr President: the key thing is missing, namely, ensuring that the Member States do not meet their ends at the hands of the markets. The proposals that Parliament has tabled in the so-called ‘two-pack’ on protecting sovereign debt are absolutely crucial to the survival of Europe at this time. I hope that the Commission and the Council will respond favourably to Parliament’s proposal on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, about the report on the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union. We will be coming up with a report on this in October and December. It is my intention to talk in October mainly about what can be implemented from the existing treaties. In that sense, it is not really an interim report. It is interim because it is a stepping stone to possible treaty changes. However, it is important in itself because what we can do within the framework of existing treaties can, in itself, be valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to discuss with the President of Parliament how we can organise cooperation between Parliament and those who are responsible for drawing up the report, that is, the Presidents of the four European institutions. We will be getting in touch with them about that soon. It goes without saying that I am ready, as we have done in the past – I am talking about the report on the task force – to cooperate intensively with Parliament on that.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have talked about there being a breakthrough, I did so in <span class="italic">one</span> specific sense, and I usually express what I want to say quite carefully, even if I am quoted wrongly afterwards. That does not mean, though, that I am going to correct every wrong quote; I am not going to take up my time with that. If I spoke of a breakthrough, what I was referring to was the fact that we can agree on single banking supervision, that we have decided that we can agree on single banking supervision in the context of the recapitalisation of banks in a direct way through the European Stability Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I consider such a breakthrough towards a single watchdog as one of the Council’s main achievements last Thursday and Friday. At the same time, this is the first stage of implementation, if I may say so, of the report that the President of the Commission, I and two other colleagues have put forward in connection with the deepening of economic and monetary union. Thus, we can talk of a breakthrough in that specific sense.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the decisions made by the Council and the summit about the euro area, well, these decisions are always taken unanimously. There can be no decisions other than unanimous ones. That is, unfortunately, the kind of decision making we have – some find that a pity, others a good thing. We have taken decisions unanimously. I assume that these decisions, too, will be respected. These are times of responsibility. We are going through a very deep crisis that has dragged on for a long time and that we are trying to overcome step by step. Everyone, each member of the Council, each country must take its responsibility, especially when it comes to the implementation of decisions taken unanimously. Fortunately, on one specific point, the new emergency fund, the ESM, provides, in such a decision-making procedure, that no single country or, in some cases, even a group of countries, can alone block decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I would like to thank you for the debate we have had in the sense that we have, unlike on other occasions, effectively said on a number of points that we have made progress. The major work remains still to be done when it comes to the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union. However, I understand that a very strong agreement is possible on the big picture, the building blocks, at least between those who have written the report and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">You know, however, that we live in a Community, in a Union of 27. We must all reach agreement on this. That requires effort and also implies that a step-by-step approach is the only possible way to get ahead, whether we like it or not. As I have said, though, I consider the most recent Council meeting last Thursday and Friday as a step forward in the right direction. I wish to thank all of you who have confirmed that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider it only right that you are telling us that you want to work closely with the European Parliament on the follow-up of the proposal that you, as President, submitted to the four institutions. On behalf of this House, however, I have to remind you of two things.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it was a mistake that you did not invite the European Parliament from the outset. Secondly, the European Parliament has greater legitimacy than the European Central Bank to speak for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore assume that the President of the European Parliament will be invited to participate equally in such work in the future. We can decide among ourselves how we work at working level, but I would say to you – not personally, but on behalf of this House – that it is not acceptable for there to be two different types of European institution: those that meet together there, and us. We are the deciding European institution and I therefore demand, on behalf of this House, that you invite me to participate in this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle of control and liability was maintained in the short-, medium- and long-term measures, which take us in the right direction to solve the crisis, to control the crisis, and which also sent out a clear political signal that this European Union still stands together and will not allow itself to be driven apart by the crisis. That is the most important message.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider it a good thing that now, for example, we are creating a banking union, and I assume that the Commission will table a legislative proposal for this swiftly and that this will also be associated with more flexible use of the European Stability Mechanism. These two things, however, belong in a particular context. We have to make it clear that this is not merely a sovereign debt crisis, but a financial crisis that has driven the sovereign states into debt. This must also become clear while giving particular consideration to the financial sector and its regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am of the opinion that on matters of institutional development, in particular, the paper that Mr Van Rompuy submitted along with Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker and Mr Draghi takes us in the right direction in the medium and long term, and from Parliament’s point of view, I would like to thank Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso in particular, as well as Mr Juncker, for their helpful work.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be clear that the crucial thing in the future remains the Community method, with the full involvement of the Community institutions. It must be made clear that we cannot allow the crisis to result in an institutional split in the European Union between the 17 on one side and the rest on the other. It has to be clear that, in this, the European Parliament is the parliamentary assembly at European level and that the national parliaments and the European Parliament are constantly strengthened at their respective levels. I would also like to thank you for the fact that it was expressly pointed out that cooperation takes place between the national parliaments and the European Parliament based on Protocol 1 to the Treaty of Lisbon. That is the appropriate line, and this provides a good basis for it. I would like to express once again my warm thanks for the cooperation on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not an easy task; if it is to succeed, the EU and its Member States must start conducting a more balanced economic policy – single-minded austerity is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must also seriously attack the problem that, for decades, we have set aside insufficient resources for growth-enhancing investments. Therefore, I am very happy with the broad support for my report on project bonds, to be issued tomorrow. I am also happy about the European Council conclusions on the Compact for Growth and Jobs and the detailed guidelines for the Union’s own actions and budget in this context. EUR 55 billion will be devoted to growth-enhancing measures in the current period.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still a question mark: to have concrete effects on the ground, the EU budget will need payments. These EUR 120 billion, with very concrete proposals for EUR 55 billion, must lead to concrete projects with rapid effects on jobs and growth, particularly in the most vulnerable regions in Europe. But for that to happen, the Council and the Member States must change their rigid position on the payments level in the European Union budget, because otherwise – unfortunately – this will be another round of empty promises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, its success depends on its implementation. No concessions must be made during the process of implementing the specific recommendations for each Member State. Member States must implement the single market legislation urgently. The procedures for approving the redeployment of the Structural Funds must be implemented as quickly as possible to achieve a rapid result. On the other hand, the notion of a two-speed Europe must not be supported in any form. All Member States must apply, in one way or other, the measures on economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the conclusions from the European Council on the MFF are not satisfactory. The Danish Presidency did not make the expected progress on a matter which is of paramount importance to the EU’s future. There is not even a forecast for the size of the European budget. The negotiation boxes do not include what the European Council should have proposed, but references to the very important aspects of the horizontal policies which come under the codecision procedure. Such an approach, which can only lead to Parliament deciding against the MFF 2014-2020, is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the Cypriot Presidency to amend this approach and urgently initiate discussions with Parliament. Parliament has already made its position very clear in the report from the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges, which the Council must take into account. If we look at the conclusions, there is a huge discrepancy between the conclusions on economic growth and jobs and those on the MFF.

<p class="contents">I wish to raise two points: the first concerns the financial transaction tax. The European Parliament would obviously prefer a decision to be taken at EU27 level. However, as that appears to be impossible, we feel that the conditions and requirements should be put in place as quickly as possible for those who can and want to move forward, via enhanced cooperation, while respecting the basic characteristics of the tax, which should apply to as many financial institutions as possible and cover as broad a range of financial transactions as possible. The European Parliament supports the financial transaction tax, not stamp duty.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the decision taken by the European Council, and not a moment too soon, to break the vicious cycle between the banking sector and the debt crisis. This is a good beginning that should apply to everyone, regardless of why the banking sector has been recapitalised in each country.</p>
<p class="contents">May I ask you, Mr Barroso, to assure us today that this principle of equality and justice will apply and that every country which is in a programme and is demonstrably applying it can expect such equal treatment in this matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We could and should have gone much further, but the fact is that, for the first time, I believe that steps have been taken in the right direction, in a clear way.

In spite of everything, as the Commission itself is behind this road map, a road map for greater integration, I have some hope – that is why I used the word ‘hope’ – that some of the proposals made by the President of the Commission and some of those that he made in conjunction with the Presidents of other institutions might be followed and might finally put us on the path to greater stability and security for the times ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a political failure, however, that contrary to the spirit of the founding fathers, it is not offered to all EU citizens. This is how it could transpire that on Monday, the Hungarian Prime Minister recounted the summit to the Hungarian Parliament as follows: Hungary has won, and the EU has bowed to Hungarian economic policy. It is disappointing that while Gyula Horn, who will be turning 80 years old tomorrow, had the strength to cut through the Iron Curtain while standing in the shadow of two world orders, you are silently assisting in the erection of a new Iron Curtain. It is disappointing that you, the leaders of the major powers that came out as the winners of the greatest political and economic transformation since World War II, are unwilling to recognise the consequences. If the dream of a united Europe is replaced by another bipolar world order, the consequences could be tragic and unpredictable. Our political responsibility to preserve and further enhance peace is universal and indivisible. This is what I would like to remind you of after the summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, if we consider the essence, there can be no doubt that the decisions taken are positive decisions, especially the agreement on growth and job creation, which suffices in order to focus on specific ways and means of stimulating growth so as to achieve the results we had with the Lisbon guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions on the debt crisis and the recapitalisation of the banks, which appear to be of interest mainly to Italy and Spain, are also important decisions. However, these decisions should concern every country applying the programme agreed on equal terms, such as Greece, given that it would relieve my country from a very hefty EUR 50 billion burden, and would be fair and correct towards the new government that will be called upon to apply the agreed programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial transaction tax is also important in addressing the problem, as is the use of enhanced cooperation, as there are some countries that do not want it. However, this is the wish of the European Parliament, which has repeatedly said as much, and it is massively important, given that it could be linked to the European Union’s own resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And it will cost only EUR 120 billion. Of this, half will come from the European Investment Bank and we will find the other half in the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">What does it matter that some countries will not receive anything from the first half. For example Ireland, despite ongoing reforms, will not be able to apply for funds from the European Investment Bank, as its rating and the rating of Irish banks do not meet the conditions to qualify for a loan. And there are perhaps other examples as well.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is worse is that all the funds intended to boost growth are earmarked for cofinancing projects. That is to say, they count on the financial support of the Member States and/or private investors, such as banks. It is because of this that the Member States and the banking sector now have the biggest problem with funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I would therefore ask you to confirm once again that the better future of the European Union is already in sight. Because if not, then the whole pact for growth is only a symbolic gesture, and I believe that the accountable European politicians should not make gestures, but should instead seek realistic solutions to the problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to congratulate the President of the European Council, as well as the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank, for the position paper on the Economic and Monetary Union which they prepared together for this summit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is excellent that the position paper makes a choice for a fully-fledged banking union, a budgetary union and economic union because it shows that you are working together for a sustainable solution. That is the only way to eliminate the centrifugal force that has been putting our system under major stress for years.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would also like to congratulate the President of the Council – though somebody will have to pass this message on to him – on the specific results that came out of the summit. Thanks to them, this summit really was one where we won back ambition, ambition which can form the basis for winning back trust in Europe. The country-specific recommendations, the Compact for Growth and Jobs and, above all, a single supervisory framework and the decision to break the vicious circle between banking problems and national budgets give hope. Hope, Mr President, that we can now work on a road map with just as much ambition, conviction and dynamism towards genuine economic and monetary union and a strong European Union, because we need both.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it has struck me – as some Members have already observed – that the President of the Council is particularly interested in democratic legitimacy. I would like to thank you, Mr Van Rompuy, for the comments you have made on this score and I have nothing further to add to that. Mr Van Rompuy will now surely recognise that he has a loyal partner and a solid ally in us in order to move towards a strong Europe, sticking together, responsible inwardly and strong outwardly in order to defend our values globally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that we should ask any Member State to carry an undue burden and, where there is responsibility, there must be solidarity. I want to thank Anna Záborská for what she said in support of Ireland and the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome also what was said by President Van Rompuy when he spoke about mastering this step by step. This is not easy when you need unanimity, but this makes the case for more Europe, not more intergovernmentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need right now are the skills of a fisherman, not of a publicist. When you have got a fish on the line, you need the right breaking strength. If you try to land the fish too soon, the line breaks and the fish gets away. If you let the line loose, the fish gets off and the fish gets away. This requires the skills of an angler, not the skills of a publicist. So far, we have done very well in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to see, please, more emphasis on growth, jobs and hope. I welcome the change in emphasis that has come about in that regard.</p>

The Berlin Wall came down and we incorporated those Member States into the Union. We did not repeat what happened in the first half of the last century when 60 million people died. The biggest financial crisis came our way and we dealt with it.</p>

The EMS is composed of taxpayers’ money. That is true. When states borrow from the EMS to capitalise their banks, their taxpayers shoulder the debt in turn. When the banks can borrow directly from the EMS, the banks owe to the EMS; the moral hazard is far less. Decoupling sovereign debt from the recapitalisation of the banks ends the spiral of excessive debt and increased mistrust from markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the growth stimulus package is fine, but we are not reinventing the policies on growth. What is the scoreboard of Member States’ compliance on the Europe 2020 strategy? How far have Member States gone in implementing proposed policies on the Single Market? What about the Services Directive, for instance? Why do we create illusions and false dilemmas for public opinion? ‘Stability and Growth’ is the name of the pact that has existed for years: these are the two faces of the same coin.

Certain decisions were taken on banking sector supervision and bank consolidation, something that we discussed a few years ago. To be truthful, even at that time, it was widely known that the banking sector’s activities do not at all comply with any state policies in either the economic or financial field and these decisions are therefore very important. Secondly, Europe today is experiencing not just financial problems, but a problem of solidarity. Today, the European Union is only understood as a means of obtaining additional money and greater benefits for one’s country, and we see that from the actions of certain specific states if we are talking about the legitimisation of the Fiscal Treaty, if we are talking about the financial transaction tax and many other areas, and I therefore wish that the European Union becomes much more cohesive in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, if we really analyse what has been proposed, we cannot reach any conclusion other than that this has been not a bang but a whimper. If we compare both the content and the total amount, we are talking about EUR 120 billion. We note that if we compare this with the assistance that has been given to the banks and bank recapitalisation, we are talking about a risible package. I would very much like the public to get an explanation as to why the amounts for banks are higher, and why there is greater support with far fewer conditions, and why far less is asked for in return. Why is this not being explained to the public? Why is there no explanation as to why, when we talk about assistance, it is the public that is going to pay again? These issues needed to be clarified, because we are tired of austerity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is extremely important that we finally come to specific solutions following on from discussions and statements, because only these are currently moving us further.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, regarding the questions put to the Commission, let me just clarify some of the points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the assessment we made of this European Council was a balanced one. It represented real progress, but much still has to be done. We should be under no illusions: the crisis is far from over and we need to continue our work. In fact, this European Council addressed, at the same time, short-term measures and a vision for the future, and tried to combine the need for stability with growth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is false to say that the conclusions are only one-way. In fact, there was also strong emphasis on the need for reform for competitiveness. At the same time, there was recognition of the need for solidarity. It is in this context that we should analyse the results of this European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding growth, as the Commission has been stating, we need to combine structural reforms at national and European level with investment, and a package for investment was thus approved. This was the maximum the Member States could agree on at this stage. Regarding the Structural Funds relocation, let me state that EUR 20 billion has already been reprogrammed, and a further EUR 55 billion will be devoted to growth enhancing measures in the current financial period.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to some of the questions, I would like to say that it is now critically important that all the governments stick to the agreements once they have been made, and ensure that they are fully and swiftly implemented. We will strongly emphasise the need to respect agreements and to implement them. I would like to reassure this Parliament by telling you that the Commission is determined to come up with proposals very soon. But let me remind you that a number of very important proposals are already on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">These include proposals on key elements of the banking union, deposit guarantees and resolution mechanisms for example. We now hope that, with the stronger consensus we saw in the European Council, we can even go further and reinforce those proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the issues of the Commission proposals, let us be clear; I have to disappoint some of you. The simple fact that the Commission makes proposals does not, in itself, lead to quick agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe this is because there are too many political forces which say one thing in Strasbourg and something else in the capitals of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So, when we are concerned, as some of you expressed the concern today that governments go to Brussels and say one thing, then go back to their capitals and say something different, it is also very important that political parties do not say one thing in Strasbourg and then say a different thing in their capitals.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">One important and interesting point was made by the British Conservatives today, and some kind of satisfaction was expressed with the situation in the euro area. I would like to tell the Conservatives that it is puzzling that you seem to delight in the difficulties of the euro area. This is in stark contrast to the position taken by your leader, Prime Minister Cameron.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It would be good in terms of accountability to your public for you to say the same thing here that you say in London. The reality is that there is now a consensus, that includes those states outside the euro area, on the need to strengthen the euro area. It would be a mistake, a complete mistake, to try to divide the euro area from the rest of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very puzzled at the ease with which some of you recommend that some Member States should leave the euro. Once again, this is in complete contrast to the position taken by the British Prime Minister, who explicitly said at the G8 summit in Camp David, for instance, that it was in his national interest that Greece stays in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is very important that we agree on a common approach for the European Union, including countries both inside and outside the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you are suggesting that Europe’s current economic problems are the result of the euro area, and that, for instance, you disapprove of the big bailout programmes in the banking sector in the euro area. Let me just put the facts straight.</p>
<p class="contents">The country that has spent the most money by far on its banking sector is Britain, more than any other country in the European Union. Let me give you the figures. Since 2008, the United Kingdom has committed EUR 82.9 billion – equivalent to almost 4.9% of GDP – in recapitalisation measures. In asset relief interventions alone, it has committed EUR 40.41 billion – equivalent to 2.38% of GDP – and EUR 158 billion in guarantees, more than 9% of British GDP. So the country in the European Union that has committed by far the most taxpayers’ money to save its financial sector has been Britain. This is not a specific euro area problem; this is a problem that affects the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And then I come to my final point: we either solve this together, and we win together, or we will all be defeated together. My final point is this: I did not at all like the atmosphere following the last European Council when I saw some claiming victory over the others.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the way to do things in Europe: either we win together or we will be defeated together. What we need is a strong European team. It is true that there are in Europe different financial cultures, different perceptions and different sensitivities. But let us be honest; sometimes, this is not a matter of differences between the North and the South – sometimes you find these differences in the very same country.</p>
<p class="contents">But I am worried when I see some people speaking about the North and the South, making some kind of easy generalisations, because those of us who know European history know how negative a role was played by prejudice and the superiority complex of one part of Europe over the other.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">All the countries of Europe – and some of us have been countries for many, many centuries – have had the greatest moments of glory and very dark moments in our history. We should be humble when we speak about history. And we should not forget that the European project was made precisely to avoid the divisions of the past and the demons that existed in European history.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I do not like it when I see Heads of Government coming out of a European Council and saying that they won against the others. This is exactly the wrong message. This is precisely the road to defeat. The message that we together – the European institutions, the Commission and the European Parliament – have to send is that we are in this together, and together we will be able to overcome this crisis.</p>

Yet the EU continues to pour billions into the banks that are still operating largely unregulated and are gathering billions in personal wealth, storing it far from the reach of the public purse. The failed policy of austerity and bank bailouts to financial vampires who sucked the life blood from our economies needs to end.

This is nothing short of a major step towards a European banking union. It is unfortunate that the situation in the euro area is such that many economists consider this substantial step necessary. I have three questions for the Council with regard to the outcome of the summit. Firstly, does direct European support to banks not weaken to too great an extent the incentive to the weak euro countries to put their affairs in order, both in the banking sector and in public finances? Secondly, the ESM Treaty. The German Chancellor and the Commission argue that direct support may be provided under Article 19 of the ESM Treaty without renewed ratification by national parliaments of any amendments to ESM. Does the Council take the view that direct support to banks does not require renewed ratification? Finally, to what extent is it realistic to assume that Europe will have an effective system of banking supervision as early as six months from now? That is a prerequisite for responsible spending of money from the emergency fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most efficient way we can respond to this is by the direct election of the President of the European Commission. That would be a major step forward. Because Europeans from Stockholm to Nicosia would be able to choose the President of Europe themselves. Let us choose this course of action, preferably as early as 2014.

The so-called European Semester has closed, endorsing the ‘country-specific recommendations which Member States will translate into their forthcoming national decisions on budgets, structural reforms and employment policies’. If we look at these ‘recommendations’, which the Commission has published and now wishes to implement, we can see the purpose and goals of this European Semester. With regard to Portugal, the Commission advocates lowering wages and reducing the duration of unemployment benefit. This is in a country that has among the lowest wages in the EU, where unemployment has hit historic levels, and where long-term unemployment is on the increase because of the policies imposed by the EU and the IMF.

The package amounting to EUR 120 billion launched by the Council is not only a victory for the Italian Government, which had been pushing for this for some time, but is also an important step for the European economy towards growth and recovery. While not forgetting that out of the total EUR 120 billion, only EUR 14.5 billion is new resources (the remainder consists of reallocations of funds already budgeted), it is significant that the European Union has gone back to using language in line with the expectations of European businesses. Without underestimating the importance of the measures adopted to tackle the financial crisis (such as direct access by banks to State rescue funds as a means to control the spread), the adoption of the growth package must signal a turning point in European policy which complements economic rigour with prospects for growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Heads of State or Government finally showed willingness to act and decided on a range of long overdue steps that the European Parliament and, in particular, the Socialists have been urging ever since the eruption of the crisis. These include recognition of the fact that consolidation of the treasury must be accompanied by an economic policy conducive to growth and investment. It is also welcome that quite a number of Member States voted for the European-level taxation of financial transactions and, indirectly, the promotion of investments aimed at revitalising the economy. The tightened economic, financial and political integration decided on by the euro area Member States must not lead to the European Union splitting in two. It is the national interest of Hungary to have a part in the decision-making process that lays the new foundations of the EU. The Heads of State or Government have finally brought themselves to engage in crisis management. Just as important as the preservation of the common currency is the protection of the fundamental values of the EU. Tighter political integration must be accompanied by an extension of the competence of Community institutions, and not just in economic and financial matters, but also in respect of the functioning of democratic institutions and the enforcement of human rights and the rule of law. The European Parliament, as the only directly elected institution of the EU, cannot be left out of this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, only determination in implementing what was decided will demonstrate the Council’s significance in terms of strengthening the euro area. The Member States supported the proposal to establish a single banking supervisor for the euro area. This is a very ambitious challenge, considering both the deadline set – the end of October 2012 – and the protracted process of negotiations on supervisory requirements for the banking sector under the CRD4/CRR legislative package. The arrangements made about the requirements for granting financial assistance to Member States are another important matter. Among other things, it was decided that Italian bonds will be bought using European rescue funds, but without the application of rigorous monitoring programmes. Furthermore, a guarantee was agreed that loans made to Spain from the fund will not be classified as unsubordinated debt, which should increase confidence and demand from private investors in the debt market. The spectacular nature of the declarations formulated at this Council has brought an enthusiastic reaction from the financial markets, despite the fact that the level of rescue capital has not been changed. I think establishing a single banking supervisor and a bank recapitalisation fund will increase financial stability in the euro area. Since we are in a crisis, the new institutions could follow the example of the American federal institutions in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and carry out immediate recapitalisation of financial institutions in order to prevent a knock-on effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a fateful connection between acute crisis management and longer-term measures: neither will work without the other, and both are needed. The decisions served to establish a development in the right direction towards a comprehensive banking union within the EU. It is now time to sever the link between national debt and the debts accrued by banks. It is one that has proven extremely toxic and has encouraged the crisis to escalate. This can be achieved by means of the remedies decided upon by the Council last week. An integrated financial framework and the establishment of a common, robust European Banking Authority both have this particular aim in mind. Such a development does not mean that there should be no limit to the injection of cash made available to the banks in addition to over-indebted countries. On the contrary, this is specifically about the fact that, in future, taxpayers will no longer have to foot the bill for errors or abuse on the part of any one bank, but, instead, the parties liable will be those who incurred the costs in the first place – the banks themselves. It is important that the process starts to be built now, in a logical order and as a workable whole. An essential part of this process must be a banking authority with strong powers that has the wherewithal to restructure banks that have got into difficulties, as well as a Common European Fund, which could be a way to guarantee the protection of deposits and to minimise costs to EU citizens as a result of any possible collapse of the banks. The Commission should comply with Parliament’s demands and propose a legislative package covering the Council’s decisions by the autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Journalists often exaggerate when evaluating a meeting. It is a crucial point that as a result of this summit, the financial pact is now supplemented with a growth agreement, even if the sum concerned is modest and the manner of its utilisation still requires clarification. Over the next few months, we will need to address issues that were not covered at the summit, such as the introduction of eurobonds. A decision should finally be taken on the EU-wide introduction of a financial transaction tax. This step would provide the EU budget with essential resources and would, at the same time, ensure the regular functioning of the financial markets. Either we are capable of creating a completely new European Union or Europe will forever be marginalised in global competition. In the course of implementing the necessary reforms, we must establish a political union in addition to the economic policy union and must set up new democratic institutional and decision-making frameworks. It is crucial that all 27 Member States be involved in the reform; none of them must be allowed to be worse off as a result of the growth pact. We should urgently set up a European Parliament special committee to reflect on issues concerning the future of the European Union. The European Parliament should review our options for strengthening the democratic legitimacy and institutional and decision-making frameworks of the EU. More Europe and an increased spirit of Community can be achieved and consolidated only through completely new democratic legitimacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU and its institutions, the bourgeois governments of the Member States – both centre left and centre right – and the political spokesmen of the plutocracy in the European Parliament have again presented a united front on one thing: the war they have unleashed on the life and rights of the working class and grassroots classes in all the EU Member States. The stand taken by all the political forces of capital and of the European one-way street was a declaration of subjugation of the workers to the anti-grassroots policy being implemented by the EU and national governments to save the profitability of the monopoly groups. They are calling for a policy ‘mix’ with the ‘architecture of competitiveness’, meaning the profitability of the euro-unifying monopolies, as its common denominator. Everyone remained deathly quiet on the decisions by the summit to step up imperialist intervention in Syria and Iran, committed as they are to their imperialist plans that harbour huge dangers for the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greek people demonstrated with their vote that they trust their allies in the EU and that they are dedicated to the European vision. I urge the Commission to help the new Greek Government, so that the country can regain its political and economic stability. As such, it would be very important, at the next summit, to decide on a road map for Greece that will allow Greek banks to join the new permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These two processes go hand in hand. We cannot be the architects of the future Europe as long as we are struggling in the clutches of the crisis, and we cannot emerge from the crisis if we do not clearly set out the path along which we want to progress. We will be able to really assess the importance of the decisions adopted at the last European summit only at the end of this year, after the meetings involving Europe’s decision makers in October and December. In October, we will have the interim report on the implementation of the measures agreed last week, while in December, the Heads of State or Government will adopt, based on the final report, the specific timetable with deadlines set for stabilising EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the least productive response is for us to look for winners or losers from last week’s summit and to analyse a hypothetical French-Spanish-Italian victory over the much denigrated German inflexibility. I believe that European solidarity must go hand in hand with responsibility from all EU Member States. The way to reduce the democratic deficit is to apply the Community method to counter perpetual intergovernmental rivalry, with Parliament being the institution which needs to take the leading role in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
