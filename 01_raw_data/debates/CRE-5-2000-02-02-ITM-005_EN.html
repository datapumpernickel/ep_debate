<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.</p>
<p class="contents">The precautionary principle is not a new concept. It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht. It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The essence of the precautionary principle is clear. It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action. However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years. Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary. In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic aim of the communication is twofold. To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.</p>
<p class="contents">We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health. Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear. As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics. The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society. It is therefore political by nature. However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection – that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut. They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin. And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken. For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved. Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof. All these elements have to apply cumulatively.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on. Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use. By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have three short questions, the first being as follows. We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice. Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market? I am sure that your answer to this will be “yes” but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?</p>
<p class="contents">My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation? In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission. This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today. It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission. So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example. And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle. We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas. It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health. So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power. We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for? </p>
<p class="contents">The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists. I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority? How would you describe this? What establishes a recognised minority?</p>
<p class="contents">If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision? The Commission? The Council? And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up? </p>

There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management. They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case. However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle. It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete. That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base. We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future. You have to see this as a tool for risk management. You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available. You have to assess all that and evaluate the science. Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not. So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about brominated flame retardants. It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment. There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are. </p>
<p class="contents">Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants. I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one. It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done. We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do. Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban. There may be a series of different measures which can be taken. It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban. Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken. </p>
<p class="contents">This issue is extremely topical. The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall try to be very brief indeed. The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle. As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood. Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis? In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first. </p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the burden of proof. I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee. At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof. In other words, a product’s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous. I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them. No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals. When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness. It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis. </p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof. It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases. I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this. There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern. Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this. It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance. Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould. This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests. Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example. So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis? The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this. In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case. </p>
<p class="contents">The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations’ health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that. Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided. Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure. I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between. In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result. </p>
<p class="contents">I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression <span class="italic">cost-effective</span> was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa. At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients. They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources. I believe we can learn something from this. We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help. </p>
<p class="contents">As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis. Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people’s health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest. Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do. I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union. I have good reason for asking this. As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence. How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes? How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you? That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This constitutes a good example, therefore. We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.
