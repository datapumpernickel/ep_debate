There, I was able to acquire up-to-date information and to witness the bravery and conviction of the people there and the extent of their resistance. They have resisted 24 years of Indonesia’s violent occupation; they have suffered and died for wanting to be themselves. They have never given up the struggle nor bowed their heads. As the international community finally woke up to Indonesia’s oppression, the idea that freedom was on its way grew in their minds. They registered in droves and 98.6% turned out to vote. They did so in a disciplined way, visibly happy, trusting the international community’s guarantees, thinking that they would be able to freely express their will and that this would be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The demonstration of the people’s desire for independence was clear, broad and unequivocal. The following day was not the peaceful day that it should have been. Indonesia did not want to fulfil the formal commitment it gave in New York to guarantee security. This is why thousands of deaths were recorded, hundreds of thousands of refugees left without protection, starving, many of them wounded or ill. Twelve days of genocide is too long to wait for the international community to reciprocate the trust placed in it by the Timorese – and also in us, Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Timor have the right to expect that the aggression to which they have been subjected, just because they legitimately demonstrated their will, should stop immediately. They have the right to expect that those responsible for these crimes, both morally and physically, are charged and brought before an international court. Not even the churches and those who sought refuge in them were spared, and it became clear that the militias, rather than just created by the Indonesian armed forces, have been inspired, trained, armed and even joined by them. I saw all this with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian aid must be guaranteed, and the European Union must play a leading role in this. The European Union must support reconstruction and participate, in joint action with the Commission, in the development process of the new independent state, which must be recognised immediately. What all of this entails, of course, is the immediate dispatch of an international peacekeeping force to Timor, and the withdrawal of Indonesian soldiers when this force arrives. Time is at a premium, as rumours abound to the effect that every day, boats are leaving Timor full of passengers and arriving at their destinations without them. Why should there be mass graves? We share responsibility for what has happened, for what is taking place and for what will happen in East Timor.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Soares (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating my colleague Mr Costa Neves on the intervention he has just made, which I endorse wholeheartedly. There really has been a spirit of co-operation and total unanimity on the part of the Portuguese MEPs here on matters relating to East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very familiar with this problem, as everyone knows. In unison with what is happening in our country, where the people have taken to the streets en masse, in order to demonstrate and to show their complete repudiation of what could be called Indonesia’s betrayal and of the atrocities experienced by the long-suffering people of Timor, (there has been a unanimous reaction in my country, and fortunately in many other countries too), we are working here, in our various political groups in order to draft a document which this Parliament can approve with a huge majority, if not unanimously. What we are doing follows on from this expression of popular feeling.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should add that an agreement was signed under the auspices of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in May of this year, precisely in order to conduct a serious consultation with the people of Timor. The United Nations sent a mission there, and these people were followed by international observers and hordes of journalists. The referendum was carried out, and was unequivocal, given that, as my colleague pointed out, not only did 98% of registered voters participate, but 78% showed that they were in favour of independence. This was completely unequivocal.</p>
<p class="contents">After this, Indonesia was bound, by the agreement made under the auspices of the United Nations, to maintain order and to guarantee the transition to democracy. Not only did it fail to do this, it turned Timor into a veritable hell, by means of the militias and the Indonesian armed forces who make use of them, and they subjected the population to the situation we see now which has become extremely critical.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now had a statement from the Security Council of the United Nations which condemns what has taken place in Timor, recognises the rights of its people, and orders the dispatch of a peacekeeping force. In addition to this peacekeeping force, help for the population, many of whom are sheltering in the mountains and are starving, must get there as quickly as possible, via humanitarian corridors. Children are dying, women are dying, priests have been singled out – because unfortunately, the repression has also had a religious angle – and they are the chosen victims of the Indonesian torturers acting freely in Timor. </p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the fact that President Habibie himself has admitted that Indonesia was not capable of maintaining order, and that he invited a United Nations peacekeeping team to go into Timor, for various reasons after this, the arrival of this team has been delayed. And therefore, the whole international community, and therefore the European Parliament too, must demand that these two things be done; that the peace corps go as quickly as possible in order to re-establish peace in East Timor, and so that humanitarian aid should get there.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, it is essential that journalists, who are the world’s eyes in terms of what is taking place there, should be allowed to return to Timor, since they were forced to leave, as were the international observers. I hope that the European Parliament can match up to its responsibilities and is able to condemn what has happened in East Timor and to come to the rapid and efficient aid of its people.</p>

It underlined the urgency and importance of what is happening in East Timor, where militias continue their endeavours to smother the struggle for independence in blood. We received information only the other day, both from Human Rights Watch and from Oxfam, and of course we have been able to see it with our own eyes on television. As we speak, it is evening in East Timor. It is precisely when it is dark, when night falls, that the civilian population is most afraid. Therefore, as a Parliament, the least we can do here is to express our support for that civilian population and for their legitimate aspirations. And that is why we support the idea of an international tribunal for calling the guilty to account, and why we will take action to protect the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to join our parliamentary delegation of observers which was sent out on the initiative of the President of our Parliament and under the excellent leadership of the Vice-President of our Parliament, Mr José Pacheco Pereira. The Finnish Presidency is deserving of praise here too, for it initiated the idea of sending a delegation on behalf of the European Union. Whereas up until recently Portugal was practically the only country to carry this torch, now all the countries of the European Union are rallying behind the East Timorese struggle for independence. But, ladies and gentlemen, involvement of this kind comes at a price.</p>
<p class="contents">We went to East Timor to reassure the population that they could vote in safety, and overwhelmingly large numbers of people have done so. But after we left, these same people were again put to the sword by the pro-Indonesian militias. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot stand by and let this happen. If we were to do so, it would mean that our delegation had been nothing more than a pointless exercise in referendum tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to developments in East Timor in the longer term. There has been an immediate and generous response from the European Union in terms of humanitarian emergency aid, but once the country has gained its independence it will be necessary to provide support for economic development and it will be at least as important to give our support to the establishment of democratic institutions. There is absolutely nothing of that kind in East Timor. No political parties, no system for the administration of justice, not a single functioning institution apart from the Church. I believe that a programme along the lines of the one we undertook in South Africa would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the campaign for the referendum was the most one-sided campaign I have ever experienced. Every attempt to pursue the campaign for independence met with violence. Yet still the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in favour of this independence. The protection that the Indonesian authorities were unable or unwilling to provide must now be immediately provided, without prior conditions, by an international peacekeeping force. We owe that to the people of East Timor, we owe that to UNAMET, which has carried out such excellent work, and we owe it to ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the people of Indonesia are themselves, or at least we hope this is the case, on the road to democracy, and have more than enough problems to come, even without East Timor. In future, we must turn our attention to these problems too. Nevertheless, it was right to suspend the bilateral aid for Indonesia for the time being, as we have learnt from recent experiences that pressure must be kept up until the whole process reaches a satisfactory conclusion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself was able to be part of the presidential delegation, which I greatly appreciate.</p>
<p class="contents">In May, we discussed here what sort of international presence was needed in East Timor. Some of us considered whether something other than a regular police force was perhaps needed there, or whether peacekeeping forces were required. It would appear that the biggest mistake was that the whole international operation was aimed only at allowing people to vote. That was the great challenge, as people were being intimidated and, since April, the terror had been really appalling. People went to vote; it was a sunny day, and I will certainly never forget how many people came to thank us, the international observers, for having come there. The joy, however, was short-lived. Already the following day, paramilitary forces began to rampage through the streets and villages, and we received news that, in particular, local people in the service of the UN were being persecuted and killed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I wish to add three demands to the list already presented. Firstly, we must demand that the commanders of the army, who are known to have taken part in this outrage, withdraw immediately. Secondly, we must send, through the ECHO programme, humanitarian aid as soon as possible and, obviously, the aim should be in the long-term for a programme of development. Thirdly, as the paramilitaries are still terrorising the people, international human rights monitors must inevitably be sent there </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is well known that East Timor has been illegally occupied by Indonesia for around 24 years, which has resulted in successive resolutions by the UN demanding Indonesia’s withdrawal and restating the people of East Timor’s right to self-determination. </p>
<p class="contents">Even here, in this Parliament, similar positions have been taken on a number of occasions. The truth is that throughout this period, the Indonesian occupying forces were claiming hundreds of thousands of victims, inflicting immense suffering on the people of East Timor, who have never wavered in their heroic struggle for freedom and independence, a struggle which we acclaim.</p>
<p class="contents">But with the signing of the New York Agreement between Portugal and Indonesia, under the auspices of the United Nations, it was thought that the way was finally clear for the resolution of all these problems. The turnout of 98.6% on 30 August, in the referendum which was held with the overwhelming majority of the people of East Timor, with over 78% coming out in favour of independence, showed clearly that its struggle deserved to be recognised by the whole world. </p>
<p class="contents">The truth is though, that later, both the UN, and international observers and the Indonesian authorities themselves, who thought that the elections had been held in a free and fair way, in spite of the pressure and the campaign of intimidation carried out by the pro-Djakarta militias, the truth – as I was saying – is that when the results were made public, terror was once again given free rein in East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the people were, and still are, threatened with genocide. It is therefore essential that we urgently and immediately put a stop to this situation, and that the people of East Timor are helped, using all possible humanitarian aid. It is essential that the militias, the police, and the Indonesian army stop sowing terror in the area. We must also recognise that Indonesia did not fulfil the commitments it accepted in the New York Agreement, which required the intervention of the UN Security Council through the dispatch of a peacekeeping force, with a clear mandate and a defined time-scale, to guarantee security and peace in the territory and to prevent further genocide. It was a long time before this decision was actually taken. Finally, it was taken, and the UN Security Council eventually decided to intervene, but incidents are still occurring, and it is crucial that they do not continue, that this intervention is not delayed any further.</p>
<p class="contents">The people in East Timor – but also those who have fled to other parts of Indonesia – need this support. Something else which should also be done urgently is to ensure their safe return (of the refugees and displaced people) and that non-governmental organisations, international observers and journalists can enter East Timor as quickly as possible. As we stated in our motion…</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Portas (UEN).</span></span>   –<span class="italic"> (PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on Timor has come two weeks after the terror began, in this new phase of the territory’s history. This is what must be noted first of all. The speed of the genocide has not been matched by the delay in international decision-making. Where Timor is concerned, we must be aware of the fact that East Timor has suffered two genocides in twenty-five years: that of the occupation, and the one which was planned down to the last detail for the referendum. It has been abandoned twice in twenty-five years: once by Portugal in 1974 and, until now, by the international community which has been unable to honour the commitments it made to the Timorese people. It has known two diasporas in twenty-five years: firstly the exile of those who did not accept the invading force and now, the exodus of those who have fled the terror. There is, therefore, no time to lose. The terror in Timor is widespread, and these people, as far as we Portuguese are concerned, deserve the particular consideration of those who see them dying, praying and suffering in Portuguese.</p>
<p class="contents">At the first opportunity, the Timorese had to set themselves free, they came down from the mountains, they came out of their houses, they went to the churches and sought out the ballot boxes in order to regain, peacefully, their freedom. This is an extraordinary lesson, which should calm and relieve the Western World: a nation which still believes in the ballot box as a liberating force.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened after the referendum deserves greater condemnation. This is because Indonesia carried out a plan for genocide which can leave no doubt as to its true nature: demographic genocide, because it caused hundreds of thousands of Timorese to flee; and cultural genocide, because from the first day of the terror, the main target in terms of institutions, was the Catholic Church. Churches, bishops’ residences, priests, nuns and churchgoers, were all targeted. In short, the whole traditional institution in which the Timorese placed their trust. The full extent of the extermination carried out in this genocide has not yet been discovered because, as everyone knows, both the remaining international observers and journalists were forced to leave.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel therefore, that there are two clear conclusions to be drawn. The first is that this Parliament must also understand that Portuguese colonisation never did to the Timorese what Indonesia has done to them. This is why Portugal’s flag in Timor is much loved. This is why it will take a very long time for Indonesia’s flag to be respected again. On the other hand, although de-colonisation under the auspices of Portugal was a rushed affair, this self-determination, without making provision for the consequences and under the auspices of the international community, has not prevented deaths and bloodshed either. These people have suffered twice and this suffering was caused entirely by others. Just because they wanted to be free.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be said then about the conduct of the international community in the days following the terror? Let me put a question to your conscience. Would the international community have taken such a long time to help the Timorese if they had been English- or German-speaking? If it were not necessary to ask the Security Council’s permission where Kosovo was concerned, nor to wait for Milosevic to allow us in, why is it that when it comes to East Timor, we have to wait for the Security Council to give their authorisation, and for Mr Habibie to give his consent?</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Would governments have been so slow to provide aid if the Timorese were a politically correct minority?</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy of the Timorese, the tragedy in which they have been caught is that there are few of them, that they are poor and Catholic… and that they have oil, which is too serious a matter in the eyes of some international powers to be left to the Timorese to decide on.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are two more questions for your consciences. Look at the list of countries which supported Indonesia in the United Nations: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Sudan. A coalition of dictatorships formed straight away to protect the freedom of tyrants! How long did it take to form a coalition of democracies? One other thing: the European Union has just declared an embargo on supplying military equipment to the Indonesians. What are four months after twenty-four years of the compulsive arming of Indonesia in full knowledge of the genocide which has been taking place in Timor for the last twenty-four years?</p>
<p class="contents">I have four requests to put to you, friends and colleagues, on behalf of the whole of my group: for international peacekeepers to be sent quickly and in force to Timor; for humanitarian aid; for a court of law to try the criminals, and for economic and financial sanctions. </p>

We have the courage of various reporters to thank for the fact that the world is adequately informed of what is going on.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for the current great suffering of the East Timorese people is clear: pro-Indonesian militias are endeavouring to smother in blood the desire expressed by the vast majority of people for political independence, and take careful note, this is a downright denial of the outcome of the referendum which took place on 30 August 1999. The army units present on the spot, as well as the official local police forces, are direct accessories to this orgy of violence. Nor, however, have the Indonesian military leadership nor the Indonesian government kept their hands clean in this respect. In fact, the latter bear full responsibility for what, according to reports, are thousands of dead, hundreds of thousands of refugees and hundreds of thousands of East Timorese deported to West Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, in a civilised country politics presides over guns, the former instructs the latter. The next obvious step is to prosecute those responsible for the crimes recently committed in East Timor, indeed President Habibie’s pledges support this. Therefore, the task that needs to be attended to by Djakarta as a matter of urgency, in anticipation of the arrival of a UN peacekeeping mission to East Timor, is to call an immediate halt to the wrath of the militias. Only action of this kind would bear witness to an intention to truly serve the interests of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely at a time like this, when Indonesian national pride is so openly at issue and stirring up phoney feelings over the country’s sovereignty, that restoring the constitutional state in the Molucca Islands is entirely appropriate in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Following heavy international pressure, President Habibie has at last said that he will accept military intervention in East Timor. Now then, the great need of the indigenous population cannot brook any further diplomatic procrastination on the part of the UN Security Council. What is more, Djakarta has made official the fact that it does not intend to impose preconditions on a mission of this kind. In other words, the peace mission can begin its task in East Timor without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the lawlessness that now prevails in East Timor, only a powerful military mandate can offer political prospects to the East Timorese, who have long been terrorised, in which case, the financial aid that the European Union has already undertaken to provide, will be every bit as worthwhile.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the ineffectiveness of the United Nations which, unfortunately, is nothing new.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the inhibition and passivity of the international community, which initially did not want to complicate its relations with other regional powers which – clearly – have little respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">And the result has been that the entire world has had to remain impassive in the face of “plan B” which was not much different from the “operation horseshoe” led by Milosevic. And today, the genocide of the Christians of Timor is beginning to be as well recorded as that of the Muslims in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the European Union, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we cannot and must not – and it has been said here – have double standards with regard to humanitarian intervention. Human rights and the right to life cannot be preached with regard to one region, one country or one continent, but rather they are of a global or universal nature.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore welcome the brave approach of Portugal and other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia.</p>
<p class="contents">And this is the time to act. It is late, too late, but, on a Community level, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must ensure that the humanitarian aid, mentioned this morning by the Minister, of EUR 8 million, and the aid to follow, arrive at their destination immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union must support the arrival, as soon as possible, of the international force which can guarantee the life and rights of this tortured and martyred population of Timor and finally put an end to this nightmare.</p>

This has been said several times here. A crime, because Indonesian colonial occupation has lasted for 24 years. On-going human rights violations, terror inflicted on a people that is peace-loving, unhappy and defenceless have become widespread, but have existed there for 24 years, as I myself have seen.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN organised a referendum: there was 98% participation, with more than 78% in favour of independence. This was a perfectly transparent democratic vote. Well, far from finding peace again, the Timorese are now suffering a real tragedy. We are witnessing serious violation of East Timorese sovereignty by a state of siege imposed by Indonesia. In international law, from the point when the Timorese people chose independence, it became effectively sovereign on its own territory. It becomes sovereign in law as soon as it sets up representative institutions which it has chosen. There is only one sovereign authority today in East Timor, and that is the people of East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware of the facts which flout this law: the deportation of more than 80,000 people to West Timor, where they are held in pens, starved, beaten and held hostage by the Indonesian army. Mass terror everywhere else. The people responsible have been identified: the militia, the army and the civil authority of Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that Mr Habibie’s government is the prisoner of the army in Djakarta, that the Army High Command no longer has any control over the troops of East Timor and that the militia are getting out of hand everywhere. But I ask you, friends, who then is responsible? If it is not the civil government, then we should denounce a bloodless coup in Indonesia. If it is not the army, we should denounce the disappearance of any representative institution in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear what action must be taken. The UN must intervene under Chapter 7. The UN must define the composition of the intervention force. The Indonesian army must withdraw from East Timor. The militia must be disarmed. And the Indonesian State must be held clearly responsible for its present prevarication. An international commission must be set up to look into the acts of violence in East Timor and the people responsible for these crimes must be brought before the International Criminal Court. All trade with Indonesia must be conditional upon the definitive restoration of peace in Timor. The Timorese must be given the means to establish themselves as an independent state and to be recognised. In this tragedy, Mr President, there is no question as to our right to interfere. It is a matter of respect for international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the Indonesian invasion in 1976 the UN did not recognise the Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. Let us get that straight for a start. Only the Australians recognised it and even they, after a while, decided that they were wrong, so legally we did not have to ask permission to send in an international peacekeeping force. However, we did. And now, at long last, they have agreed. But when will it go in? Hopefully, by this weekend. Who will head it? Hopefully it will not be the Indonesians. I heard on the television this morning that one faction within the Indonesian army was actually saying that it wanted to lead the multinational peacekeeping force! Fortunately the foreign minister had other ideas, but obviously there is warfare between them all at the moment. But whoever leads it, it must go in now, immediately, before we see any more atrocities.</p>
<p class="contents">They are happening on a daily basis. Churches and schools are burnt. People are hacked to death. Yesterday I heard of a nun who was told she was being rescued and she should not look at the church. She tried to see it and saw blood seeping in front of the church door, the blood of women, children and priests. What had they done? Nothing. And that was not an isolated incident. UN workers were attacked when they tried to move food and the army just stood by. If food and shelter cannot get through, there is going to be a humanitarian catastrophe, not just in East Timor, but in West Timor as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest story is that refugees were put on to ships and told they were being rescued. The ships then came back a short time later with nobody on board. That is genocide in anybody’s terms.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And that is why we have to have a war crimes tribunal: to bring these people to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">What else can be done? A military embargo yes, but it should have been done sooner. The Hawk jets from Britain should have been cancelled sooner. I am glad they have been cancelled now but it is a bit too late. The peace-keeping force must go in now. Humanitarian aid and human rights monitors for West Timor and East Timor must go in now but more importantly the Indonesian Government must be held to account.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We share some of the relief felt by many when the Clinton Administration, in an apparent turnaround, finally criticized the Jakarta Government and let the United Nations take control of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Anybody in this House who is not familiar with Washington’s role in the tragedies in Indonesia and Timor, from 1966 to the latest genocide unleashed by the military on 30 August, should read the analysis published today by the Washington Post and the Herald Tribune under the banner headline ‘Pentagon defends Indonesian military contacts as useful’. We are reminded of the close personal friendship between the Chairman of the United States Chief of Staff, General Henry Shelton, and the butcher from Jakarta, General Wiranto. The top military man in the United States aiding and abetting the violence in East Timor and last Monday ordering his Indonesian pal to accept an international peace force. Mrs Halonen stated this morning that the terror unleashed on 30 August took the Council by surprise. It should not have. May we suggest that in order to avoid future surprises, the Council and Parliament monitor very closely the peacekeeping mission of the United Nations, the humanitarian aid plan by Europe, the integrity of any present or future programme designed to put an end to the suffering of the Timorese to guarantee their full independence and sovereignty free of any threat, interference or pressure by the Indonesian military and their American mentors.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But what form should this support take? As Europeans, we cannot behave like schoolmasters in a conflict in South-East Asia. In so doing, we will not engender any trust on the part of those people in Asia who would be important partners as regards the democratisation of this country. Above all, the disintegration and balkanisation of South-East Asia can surely not be Europe’s goal. The question was therefore asked in the leader in today‘s issue of the Herald Tribune: “Who are these Western crusaders to be lecturing the Asians?” – a question that may be a bitter pill for us to swallow. Our responsibility, as Europeans, is to support democratic development, which will also result in an improvement in the living conditions of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps, we will first have to learn as Europeans how to support a people in a foreign land in their fight for independence, as well as along their path to a democratic form of society.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost all the buildings used by the European Parliament’s delegation in Timor – the houses we slept in, the places where we ate or held meetings – have now been destroyed. Maybe this will give some idea of the scale of events in East Timor. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, from the political point of view, there are various decisive factors in determining our action as an international community. For the international community is not an abstract concept, it consists of us ourselves. The first factor is understanding that what is happening in Timor is not a civil war. Indonesia tried to take us along that path, and only failed because of the presence of international journalists and observers. There is no civil war in Timor. There is a conflict between the Indonesian army and its cohorts – the militias – and the majority of Timor’s population.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is that the Indonesian army has no problems keeping the peace and security situation in Timor under control and never has. We could see that the Indonesian army could quite easily have kept the peace and security situation under control if it had wanted to. The truth is that the army simply did not want to, as it was itself part of the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, – and this is the important thing for the future – the Timor question is not over just because the Security Council has decided to send in peacekeeping forces. We must be aware – and I speak as someone who knows the area – that these forces are going to face opposition, and will probably encounter a much more serious conflict situation than the one encountered by forces in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why there must be strong political will to support the international community’s next moves to ensure that Indonesia does not impose any conditions on the intervention by these forces and that, however serious the conflict in the region may be, the peace and security of the Timorese should be guaranteed, as well as the humanitarian aid and the development that Timor so desperately needs. This factor of political will is decisive because unfortunately, we will be hearing about Timor for much longer than we would probably like to.</p>

But they must also apply to East Timor which has now become a moral test for the whole world community. We are talking about humanity and human rights, politics and international law, but also about economics and credibility. If we do not contribute to solving the tragedy in East Timor, the message to East Timor’s people and to others is this: democracy is synonymous with death. Democratic efforts supported by other countries in the world and by the United Nations are synonymous with massive, unchecked massacres. Countries’ credibility is therefore at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic point of view, we in the Socialist Group demanded early on that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund should stop supporting the regime in Djakarta. I am not talking about humanitarian support and support to democrats. Normally, political considerations are not taken into account in financial dealings. Even in the Emperor Vespasian’s time, when he introduced tax on toilets, it was said that money had no smell. But billions of dollars in support of the regime in Djakarta stinks and must be stopped. This has actually happened now. The lessons of the tragedy in East Timor are that politics and economics are interconnected and that compassion and credibility demand that countries intervene on humanitarian grounds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people of East Timor were encouraged by the UN to go out and use their democratic right to vote and they are being persecuted for doing so. The international community was warned well in advance. What has it been doing for the last 14 days? It has sat and twiddled its thumbs, waiting for an invitation from Indonesia, the country that has been illegally occupying East Timor for the last 25 years, whose Foreign Minister has stuck his fingers up at the UN General Assembly when the issue was raised.</p>
<p class="contents">One-third of the population has been massacred and here we are waiting for an invitation from Indonesia. President Clinton’s hypocrisy, which has already been highlighted today, is unacceptable. Tony Blair’s wonderful new government, with its ethical foreign policy, has continued sending its arms to Indonesia. These are the hypocrites, the so-called moral police forces of the world who put profit before people. It is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want to see now is a complete arms embargo on Indonesia and also an economic embargo. We want an international peacekeeping force. We want to see independence for the people of East Timor, which is their democratic right. We want an end to the tyranny that has been perpetrated on the people of East Timor for the last 25 years with the help of EU countries, America and all these hypocritical people who want to sell arms to tyrants in Indonesia and other countries around the world. It has to stop. The hypocrisy of the European Union’s arms industry has to end and this is the best example we have had so far of what the end result is.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, irreparable damage has already been done. The disaster was not unexpected. The Timorese resistance had given the alarm signal, demanding that the United Nations oversee the safety of the ballot on self-determination. The crime was that of failure to assist a people in danger. The East Timorese are paying a high price for earlier compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">The Indonesian army, the body chiefly responsible for the current massacres, was set up, trained and equipped by the major powers of the West in 1965 in order to massacre the Indonesian population itself, in order to eradicate a Communist Party whose influence was troublesome.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, there is unanimous outrage, but there is great hypocrisy. Who is going to be made to believe that the United States, but also France, which signed a military co-operation agreement with Djakarta, did not have the means to exert sufficient pressure to stay the arm of the killers?

Let us not try and kid ourselves. Even if UN troops move in at the weekend, perhaps without the co-operation of the Indonesian army and the national authorities, we will not be able to bring about peace at the drop of a hat. For the marauding gangs, which are still roaming through East Timor and the army, which still has a presence there, cannot be kept in check by a six or eight thousand strong UN force.</p>
<p class="contents">The East Timorese who have fled, and who are now in West Timor, must be able to return home. They must be protected in West Timor where they are now staying. Therefore, we must give a clear signal to those parties who have responsibility in Indonesia. I am no longer sure whether the government still has responsibility and control. Perhaps this now rests with the army. We must say to all those parties who have responsibility: if Indonesia’s policy does not change, and quickly, then we, and I am addressing the Council and the Commission here, will have to seriously threaten them with all the economic means at our disposal and force those who have the power in Indonesia to co-operate. Otherwise, what we will see is that although our troops are stationed there, people will continue to be murdered and driven out.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we have to send out a clear signal. Indonesia still has the opportunity to maintain good relations with us over the coming years. But if it does not change its policy, then it will no longer have partners in Europe for as long as those responsible for the current situation are still in power, whether they be in the army, the parliament or the government. Therefore, we are also appealing to the Council, along with the Member States, to send clear signals to those responsible in Indonesia in the next few days. They must co-operate, otherwise a UN peacekeeping force will be defenceless.

<p class="contents">I must tell you that we did our duty, and added to this Parliament’s good name because we visited, I believe, more of the area than any other delegation (we went 200 kilometres to the East), and checked more polling stations than anyone else. It was useful for us to be able to bring you this news which we expected to describe in quite different terms when we left Timor and which was of interest to the Timorese, who, at least at that time, felt supported and who still are being supported.</p>
<p class="contents">This referendum was an impressive sight, really quite impressive! An entire people – for nobody was to be seen in the streets – an entire people turned out to vote, expressing their national feeling, their bravery, their sense of democracy and their love of freedom. Anyone who prides himself or herself on being a defender of democracy would have found it inspiring to witness that scene.</p>
<p class="contents">The Timorese created a flower, a castle of hope which, in one outburst of violence, was brought down and destroyed in blood, violence and death. Once again, it is not politicians but the Timorese themselves, with their cries and their pain who have drawn attention to their just cause. I think that this time, Timor will not be forgotten again and I think that the ever growing support for the long-suffering and heroic people of Timor will remain strong until they are free and until Timor is a happy nation – one that is moving forwards.</p>

It is perhaps appropriate that I should now begin my parliamentary duties with reference to Indonesia and another State that is in creation – East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">It is over two weeks since the referendum took place in East Timor. The outcome of the referendum and the terrible consequences were very predictable. Yet the international community, with certain exceptions, seems to have been taken by surprise by the way in which this tragedy has unfolded. Quite clearly international pressure had to be put on Indonesia and many of us have called for the early suspension of World Bank and IMF financial assistance and the suspension of arms exports and military cooperation. We therefore welcome the albeit belated common position adopted by the General Affairs Council. If resolute action had been taken earlier, then maybe the Indonesian authorities would have responded differently.</p>
<p class="contents">The immediate need now is for the rapid deployment of a peacekeeping force and the delivery of humanitarian aid. I do not necessarily think it is appropriate for the Europeans to react militarily to crises in areas far from their borders. But the crisis in East Timor has highlighted the difficulties for Europeans in responding to yet another peacekeeping task. The fact is that there is little scope for this, even if it was desirable. Capabilities are limited. EU Member States do not spend enough on their armed forces and what they spend is often not spent well. Over the years the United Kingdom has developed a highly effective military capability and yet the United Kingdom armed forces are now desperately overstretched and most Member States of the European Union spend a smaller proportion of their GDP on defence than the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The most useful European Union contribution in a situation such as East Timor is more likely to be civil rather than military. That is the right sort of focus for us in this situation. We heard from Mrs Halonen that the Commission has been asked to prepare a socio-economic programme for institution building in East Timor. This is most welcome but the programme will require early implementation once the security situation permits, coordination with contributions from other institutions and countries and very careful management to ensure effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is yet another aspect of this tragedy which we must not forget. Over the past few weeks the most horrific crimes have been committed against Timorese and others, and those responsible must be brought to justice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone knows that in Indonesia, the real power lies with a broad military leadership of complex composition, topped by what purport to be political parties. And everyone knows that the Indonesian military had no intention whatsoever of stopping the militias, indeed it has itself been actively involved in orchestrating the operations that have taken place in recent days. Notwithstanding all this, the world has allowed itself to discuss the situation in formally legal terms, in the expectation that Indonesia would do the right thing. Such naivety is almost tantamount to provocation and ought, in the fullness of time, to be a lesson to us in other situations. That is my first comment.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is as follows: it is my fervent wish that when this House discusses the question of Indonesia, it draws a clear distinction between the military regime of Indonesia, the referendum that has taken place and which reflects a longstanding and deep transformation process that has only just begun in an enormous empire, of which East Timor is only a very small part, and the enormous suffering endured by the Indonesian people.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as we must give unequivocal support to East Timor, and I support the sanctions and give my signature to and support the resolution, so we must also stand by the people of Indonesia as a whole. We must deliver humanitarian aid to them, but also other forms of aid too, for building up society for example. It would be a mistake of historic importance if we were to neglect the Indonesian people in so many other areas of the Indonesian archipelago. In my view, the best way to support East Timor is to support the Indonesian people as well. Both need democracy and an international system of law, and as a European Parliament we must render our services to both.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we speak, the UN Security Council has passed a resolution under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter to allow a peacekeeping force under Australian command into East Timor. It is two weeks too late. The UK, US, New Zealand, Canada, Philippines and Thailand have now committed manpower and material to the peacekeeping force. They are too late. China, Russia, South Korea and Malaysia have indicated their commitment to help. They too are too late. The international community has woken up at last. As usual it is, and always will be, giving too little too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the East Timor referendum, up to 10 000 people have been slaughtered for voting for independence. 300 000, including children, out of a total population of 800 000 have been displaced and made homeless, hiding without shelter, food and sanitation in the jungle. What surprises me is that the international community and the United Nations never manages to learn, to anticipate from the experiences of Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, and now East Timor. What is wrong with us? The international community, time and time again, is called upon to clean up the mess left by brutal tyrants, so-called ethnic cleansers and the genocide of dictators. Under the Montevideo Convention, we are compelled by international law to recognise these brutal regimes as sovereign independent states. Perhaps we should now reconsider this definition and encourage an international debate on whether democracy such as ours should give equal recognition, treatment and respectability to regimes throughout the world which refute democracy and the rule of law, human rights and good governance. Surely the time has come now to differentiate, to redefine, to tighten up the criteria as we do now in giving aid. If good governance is a fundamental prerequisite for development aid, why should good governance not also be a fundamental criterion for international recognition, bilateral relations and trade development? The IMF has recognised this recently in Indonesia and it is time that the European Union’s Member States also recognised it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were told that we supplied observers that were crucial to the success of the referendum when the East Timorese said a very loud and very large “yes” to independence. We were told by the Council that the Commission is preparing social and economic assistance for a newly independent East Timor, all of which of course we welcome. But we are also told by Mrs Halunen that she was surprised at the terror that took place after the referendum. I am surprised that she was surprised. I was in Jakarta in August, as a special representative of the UNDP working with the Indonesian Parliament, the DPRK, on new rules for that parliament. It was clear to me then and more importantly to everybody else in Jakarta that firstly there would be a resounding yes in a referendum and secondly that the army, or at least large sections of the army, would try to subvert that process by engaging in and encouraging terror. We have seen that happen, but why we are surprised I do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the peacekeeping force. I welcome the humanitarian aid that is going to go in to help the 200,00 to 400,000 refugees. I welcome the fact that we were told that EUR 8 million would be available for that humanitarian aid. But it must be delivered quickly. I accept that in the interim it may be delivered by air. We are told it is going to be dropped in by helicopters from 1,500 metres. If you remember the aid we saw being airlifted in and dropped to some of the Kurdish refugees from the air, it was not very successful. If I recall correctly, some of the refugees were actually killed. As soon as possible that aid needs to be delivered on the ground. We need to make sure that it happens within days rather than weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept the need for the ban on arms. We need to stop arms sales to Indonesia and I welcome the four-month ban. It may be that it needs to be continued but at the same time we also need to be helping the Indonesians by providing them with assistance to ensure that very fragile democracy elected in the last general election is able to establish itself. Unless we do that in November or December we will be having a similar debate about Indonesia, telling each other how we knew it was all going to end in tears.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After more than twenty years of violence and repression, the people there were able at last to choose their own future; yet, the choice they made in freedom, to go down the road of independence, was punished with a brutality of which history has scarce seen the like. Murdering, setting fire to things and deporting people as they went, the pro-Indonesian militias left the country in a state of chaos, plundered and burnt to the ground. The images have been there for all to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The Indonesian army failed to take action to protect the population. The UN, the NGOs, the observers were all powerless to do anything. There have been instances of death and wounding in these quarters too. I count myself as one of those that know Indonesia well. I hesitate a little to address Indonesia in harsh terms, representing as I do, a country that held sway as a colonial power there for 300 years. But these events transform any hesitation on my part into outright criticism and severe reprimands directed at the Indonesian government and the Indonesian army.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened in East Timor is serious and requires us to impose sanctions and take international action with all haste. Sanctions have now been approved, also by the EU, and I welcome this with open arms. I regret that France and the Netherlands tried again in Council to prevent the weapons embargo from going ahead, and admire the Finnish Presidency for pushing it through nonetheless.</p>
<p class="contents">The second step that must now be taken is to send an international peacekeeping force, preferably from within the region, so that the people can be protected and the independence of East Timor can be implemented</p>
<p class="contents">The third step is to set up a tribunal for the purpose of punishing those who have committed such cruel acts, so that law is upheld and justice is done.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth thing that needs to happen is the delivery of aid to the region. Once independence has been implemented, which is undoubtedly going to happen now, East Timor will need an enormous amount of help. And we must be generous in providing this help too.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, the violence meted out by the militias in Indonesia has not been confined to Timor alone. They murder and plunder in the Moluccas, in Aceh and in Irian Jaya too. Hundreds of people, especially Christians, have already died in the Moluccas in particular. Last week, Dutch citizens of Moluccan extraction demonstrated in Brussels in a dignified manner. We believe that attention should also be given to what is happening there. If the murder does not stop in those other regions too, and if the Indonesian government doesn’t offer protection, then, in our view, the United Nations should also take action in those other regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, human rights and democracy are at stake in Indonesia. Let us deal with the situation as an international community.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The holocaust which led to the death of 250,000 people in East Timor is already history, with the last ten thousand killed over recent weeks. Regarding this holocaust, I do not think that our institution or any European citizen can afford to feel astonished: we do not have the right to, we have definitively lost our innocence. For a long time, the international community has allowed the so-called development dictatorships to survive, from Indonesia to the Chile of the <span class="italic">Chicago</span> <span class="italic">Boys</span>, to China and Korea, those countries where, for the sake of macro-economics, we have tolerated market interests prevailing over the interests of human rights. We have tolerated intolerance and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that our guilt will not now be added to the international community’s guilt. I am happy that the Council has decided on a common position, a symbolic four-month embargo on arms, ammunition and military equipment. I hope that this embargo will be extended to supplies now being prepared so that we can avoid feeling even more remorse in the future. I want to point out that at this time, my indignation has nothing to do with the language that the inhabitants of East Timor speak. My problem is that for twenty-five years, the population of East Timor has not had a voice.</p>

We have now added to that list the ongoing humanitarian plight of thousands of displaced East Timorese as a result of the well-planned and systematic policy of killings, destruction of property, and intimidation carried out by the militia and elements of the Indonesian security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">In most of these situations it must be said that timely action by the international community based upon assessments and early warnings of situations could undoubtedly have saved many lives and greatly reduced human suffering and misery. I do not believe that anyone in this Chamber would deny that recent events in East Timor were totally predictable and therefore to some extent preventable. The international community, in particular the United Nations, has to ask itself some searching and probing questions. I also believe that we in the European Union must put our house in order.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have just approved the new Commission and in the light of recent events in East Timor, Kosovo and elsewhere I would like to address my remarks to the new Commissioner responsible for the common foreign and security policy. I would like to ask would he assure this Parliament that the establishment of a policy planning and early warning unit as envisaged under the Amsterdam Treaty will be given top priority? In addition, will he guarantee that this unit will provide the appropriate parliamentary committees with all the relevant information including analyses, recommendations and strategies on any potential crisis which should be monitored by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of such information would greatly enhance Parliament’s contribution to the development of a more effective and cohesive EU foreign policy, which is long overdue.

Before the referendum, more than two hundred thousand Timorese were killed, whilst the international community did nothing, taking the view that the people of East Timor were expendable. We feel that no nation is expendable, and this is why we are speaking out now. Speaking out in order to save lives and to ensure that the free will of the people of East Timor is respected. This is why we feel that the European Union – and we are appealing directly to the Council and the Commission – must take the decision to move forward with an initiative which will ensure that this process towards independence for the people of East Timor is respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The most urgent matter though, is to save lives, because in East Timor, it is not just bullets that kill; hunger also kills. It is therefore necessary that we arrange for emergency humanitarian aid and an international peacekeeping force. We must also cease negotiations with Indonesia. We must do this so that the international community understands once and for all that Indonesia is not part of the solution in East Timor. Indonesia is part of the problem in East Timor. The Council and the Commission must extend the suspension of support in terms of economic and military co-operation because the human rights argument makes no impression on Indonesia, Mr President. The arguments that really affect them are those of economic sanctions and military concerns.</p>

Instead, I would like to ask a question about it – ‘build peace without opportunism’ – what does that mean? In short, after 24 years of this tragedy, and after 24 years of the international community avoiding imposing economic sanctions, what does ‘make every effort’ now mean? </p>
<p class="contents">On this, I add my voice to the request already made in this House and by the Senate of the Republic of my country, asking for European governments and the UN to recognise, as soon as possible, the sovereign state of East Timor, and the fact that it is no longer an issue dealt with exclusively in this House does credit to my Portuguese colleagues and colleagues from certain other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add another consideration to this. In addition to the debt we have owed to East Timor for 24 years, there is the fact that, while there have been demonstrations about East Timor, we are not taking into account the political hypothesis that we must in any case once again beg the United States for the favour of possible military intervention. This forces us to re-examine the subject of common defence.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point. It is still possible for us to do what is right for East Timor, to do it immediately and with determination.

For many years Mr Tom Hyland, an Irishman who has made this the cause of his life, has led international demands for action on East Timor. In Ireland we care very deeply about East Timor and we have been extremely active; as the President-in-Office noted this morning, our Foreign Minister, Mr David Andrews, was the special EU Overseer of the recent elections in East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">But in the context of the current disaster there, Indonesia has become a symbol of the lengths to which a brutal, weak and unscrupulous regime will go to further its power and control over those it perceives as challenging its authority. Unfortunately this government has had many friends in this Parliament over the years and many EU governments have put the profits of their arms industries above those of the basic human rights of the unfortunate people of East Timor. Events of the past month have graphically illustrated what many have sought to highlight over the years about the reality of life in East Timor. The President-in-Office spoke very passionately this morning about her concerns but, as Mr De Rossa has rightly pointed out, these concerns were no surprise to a great many of us. Perhaps it is because East Timor is very far away and a very small country, that the crucial issues at stake in this dreadful catastrophe engulfing the country at the moment have been of little concern either to ourselves within the EU or, of course, to the United States. What we have seen is a brutal regime taking a terrible revenge on a small country that dared to say it wanted to be independent and we must support it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The <span class="italic">província esquecida</span>, or forgotten province of Portugal, as it was then known, conjured up a picture of a beautiful, remote Pacific island, an exotic mix of East and West producing a unique Catholic cultural heritage. Sadly, I have never been there but I feel passionately for the Timorese people suffering since Indonesia’s annexation in 1975 with almost one third being killed - an even greater proportion of deaths than in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN recognises the right of the Timorese people to self-determination and Portugal’s sovereignty in its territory. In the West we did not seek a UN resolution to bomb the former Yugoslavia over Kosovo which still remains part of Yugoslavia, and yet we have felt willing, for whatever reason, to avoid any military intervention on behalf of the Timorese in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always believed that foreign military intervention should only take place in the national interests of the nation-states concerned, yet the serious deterioration and spiralling violence in the region demand action and meet the test of the new ethical foreign policy of which Portugal is a full Member State. As a Briton, I am happy to support Portugal in its attempts to secure a just outcome, not only because Portugal is Britain’s oldest ally, but also because Portugal should be given the opportunity to grant independence to all its colonies, including its last colony now, other than Macao, namely East Timor. We in Britain had that opportunity. We granted self-determination to all our colonies where it was legally possible to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights, if they are to be considered a <span class="italic">casus belli</span> as over Kosovo, must be universally and consistently applied. Therefore I fully support and welcome the UN Security Council resolution for the establishment of an international peacemaking force involving willing and principally neighbouring countries such as Australia and New Zealand. This will enable the 78% of East Timorese who voted on 30 August to establish their own independent sovereign state and to look forward to a peaceful and prosperous future within their own homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, but not least, I salute the courage of the East Timorese people.</p>

When Mr Cook was appointed Foreign Secretary he launched an ethical foreign policy containing amongst other things a commitment to a stringent code of conduct on arms export controls. Nevertheless he has allowed Hawk ground attack aircraft to be exported to the Indonesian military in breach of his own ethical foreign policy and arms export guidelines. Because the contract had been signed by the previous Conservative Government, Mr Cook claimed it could not be broken. He even gave repeated assurances that contractual clauses ensured that jets would not be used for aggressive purposes against the people of East Timor. Now, in the face of spiralling atrocities in that country and hard evidence that the aircraft in question have been used in attacks on the East Timorese, Mr Cook has performed an amazing U-turn: last Saturday he finally cancelled the contract and introduced a temporary arms ban. We will never know how many East Timorese died as a result of his refusal to cancel this contract at an earlier stage.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has a right to an explanation from Mr Cook of how something which the UK Government insisted could not happen suddenly became possible. We should also ask Mr Cook why British taxpayers’ money was used to fund this scandalous episode and indeed, why the UK Ministry of Defence specifically intervened to ensure an invitation was extended to the Indonesian military to attend a major arms fair in Britain next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, only after international pressure has Mr Cook been forced to withdraw this invitation. We should insist that Mr Cook is brought before this House to provide us with an explanation on his extraordinary collaboration with the oppressive Indonesian regime.</p>

If we were unable to intervene and intervene promptly and properly in Kosovo, on our own doorstep, without weeks and months of prevarication and legal consultation to see what we could or could not do, how could we really expect the EU to respond as we would wish and the citizens of Europe would wish to the tragedy in East Timor?</p>
<p class="contents">What is it about the institutions of Europe – about the European Parliament, about the European Union collectively – that makes us unable to respond to the crises in the world as our people, our voters, our citizens would want us to do? We need urgently to examine why our response is always – as I said yesterday and others said today – too little, too late. We are a multi-billion pound, multi-billion dollar talking-shop, as far as the citizens of Europe and the world are concerned. We are never there when it counts. We always respond several months too late, we spend hours debating crises in this House and in other institutions, but we are not there, when it counts, as quickly as we should be. Why? Maybe the answer will come from the next two speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it always too little, too late? Why was it a surprise that there was genocide since the referendum two weeks ago? Why was the UN Council taken by surprise? We had guaranteed these people that if they exercised their democratic rights and voted we would protect them and see it out to the end. We failed, and failed miserably. The international community should hang its head and the European Union along with it.</p>
<p class="contents">What is wrong? What needs to be done to enable us to respond as we should? That is the only question that needs to be answered because we are too late now. Others have taken up our cudgels. Let us not be caught in this position again.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that, with all of us working together, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we can participate, with maximum effectiveness, in a solution to the crisis in East Timor and the arrangements that will need to be made afterwards. The resolutions approved on Monday by the Council are an indication that we feel a special sense of responsibility towards finding a solution to the issue of East Timor that will benefit its people.</p>
<p class="contents">One key principle of international law is the right to self-determination of nations. This issue is about establishing that right. Another principle is insistence on compliance with agreements. That we are demanding unconditionally from Indonesia. Indonesia must respect and comply with essential commitments to human rights, and, above all, the UN agreement made in New York on 5 May on the question of East Timor. This being the case, the Union will continue its forceful action in the United Nations, the Security Council and in Djakarta. An international presence is the only immediate way of improving security and safeguarding it besides, so allowing sufficient humanitarian aid to be delivered to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">A decision was taken this morning by the Security Council to send an international peacekeeping force and an advanced guard to East Timor immediately. The meeting at which the decision was approved was a long one: it began yesterday at 18.00. local time and ended today at 02.00. We can feel satisfied that the mandate that has been given is a so-called strong mandate. We expect the first troops to arrive in the region before the weekend. The Australians have announced that they are on twenty-four hour alert. We consider it important and positive that no preconditions were imposed in the decision to become involved. The primary criterion – the best and fastest way of restoring security – is an important one. In the long-term, we must allow other Asian countries, and especially those in ASEAN, to participate fully. In addition, the Member States of the Union have been asked to participate, and we know that many countries are now doing so. We also know that France, Great Britain and Portugal have announced their readiness to send troops.</p>
<p class="contents">The new problem that appears to be emerging now is the situation of the East Timorese in West Timor. The region is a part of Indonesia, and we trust that Indonesia will guarantee the safety of all those in the region, and I also hope it will. At the same time, we have to unconditionally ensure that the international humanitarian organisations and, above all the UNHCR, have safe access to the area. To show that the international community is in earnest in this matter, we are recommending a visit to West Timor in the next view days by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Ogata.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian action is urgently needed and its main priorities are the protection of refugees in West Timor, access to the area by the UNHCR, and the commencement of airdrops of food and other supplies to take place as soon as possible. Regarding the airdrops, we can state that apparently they can start on Thursday through action on the part of the World Food Aid Programme and UNICEF. For this we must ensure there are sufficient supplies, and we will use Union relief funds to purchase these supplies. I believe humanitarian action will be in capable hands with the UNHCR, the UNDP and the ICRC. The Union and its Member States will also have a considerable part to play in the operation in the future. Furthermore, ECHO has all the while been involved in assessing the size of the aid package needed and co-ordinating Union aid so that it gets to where it is needed most right now.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of sanctions has been raised here, and I would now like to say that the ban on the export of weapons approved in the Council on Monday will come into force immediately. This decision will mean we will stop the export of arms to Indonesia by any Member State, and the ban will be in force for the next four months, after which it will be up for review. The legal aspects of the decision are to be finalised by the relevant bodies, and I shall not go into further detail as far as that is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Much emphasis has been put in our discussions here on the fact that human rights are being violated. We strongly condemn a state of affairs in which these violations have been carried out on such a large scale and so flagrantly. It has been said here that no one could have failed to predict that things would turn out as they have. It is absolutely true that we knew beforehand that there would be problems in the region after the referendum. However, I believe that the extent and intensity of the terror carried out came as a surprise to all the observers. The Union and the whole international community had had an assurance from the Indonesian government that they would be capable of keeping order and maintaining security in the region. They had also legally committed to this in the New York Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Halonen said, it is probable that people in the region are also guilty of crimes that violate international human rights. For this reason, the Council has decided to give its support to the organisation of a special convention of the Commission on Human Rights and the appointment of an investigatory delegation to be sent to the region. It is also very important that we discover who is responsible for criminal acts in this crisis.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
