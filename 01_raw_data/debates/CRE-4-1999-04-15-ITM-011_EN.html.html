Instead, I want to talk about political responsibility, because that concerns all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a tenfold increase in traffic through the road tunnels under the Alps over the last fifteen years. That traffic is good business. The operating companies have made a fortune out of it without necessarily investing in safety, or even in elementary staff training. The local authorities and finance ministers have encouraged that tendency, only too happy to collect extra takings on the cheap. Of course, there were alternative solutions, such as the Lyons‐Turin piggyback project, which was one of the Delors plan"s infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="contents">That stated priority which we are rediscovering today was never a real priority at top level. More spectacular, more symbolic projects, near here, were preferred. But most of all, the road lobby was on the alert, even opposing the safety measures the French Minister for Transport has taken recently, because they would have lost articulated lorries precious hours on the London‐Milan or Amsterdam‐Milan route, and we all know time is money. Safety has no price. Yes, it has a price, but obviously it is too high – until tragedy strikes.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Querbes </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I want to express our horror at the extent of the disaster in the Mont Blanc tunnel which has taken the lives of 41 people. I want to send our condolences to the victims and their families and pay tribute to the courage of the rescue services.</p>
<p class="contents">But in a parliament, we have to do more than bear witness to disaster. We must help find answers. How could it have happened? How might such a tragedy have been prevented? The figures are revealing. In the last thirty years, the heavy goods traffic through the Mont Blanc tunnel has grown eight times as fast as private car traffic. One sixth of Italian exports go through that tunnel. And there is a Commission report which predicts that the traffic between Italy and France will double in the next ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Has anyone really thought about the safety consequences of this staggering increase? Is safety one of the Commission"s priorities when it puts pressure on countries like Switzerland to dismantle their road transport restrictions, or when it imposes competition and liberalisation to the detriment of rail transport, even though it is safer and more environmentally friendly?</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, in my view, the tragedy in the Mont Blanc tunnel calls for two types of measures. Safety diagnostic equipment must be installed in all tunnels immediately, safety measures must be introduced and the level of HGV traffic limited while waiting for the conclusions of the inquiry. But in the medium and long term, will the Commission propose firm measures to increase safety by acting on the conditions and modes of transport of goods, as proposed in the joint resolution?</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond that resolution, I want to stress four points. The first is the maintenance of restrictions on HGV traffic and their harmonisation on the basis of the most widespread current restrictions. The second is the more vigorous action to reduce working and driving time for HGV drivers. Thirdly, we must give priority to freight transport by rail in mountain areas and high‐risk areas, and fourthly, we need determined action for cooperation between rail companies to harmonise standards, materials and staff training.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are right to express our sorrow today, but it must lead to specific regulations for greater transport safety.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Leperre‐Verrier </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, it has taken forty deaths in the Mont Blanc tunnel in horrific circumstances for the European authorities to recognise the consequences of the uncontrolled development of road transport in mountain areas. That has not been for lack of pointing them out though, including in this House, but sometimes it is hard for reason to prevail where Alpine transit is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">A rapid and effective response is needed immediately to compensate the families of the victims and give them moral and material support. Moreover, the flow of traffic now converging on the Fréjus tunnel as a result of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel must be channelled. The issue must also be looked at as a whole. Obviously, the results of the inquiry will clarify the circumstances of the tragedy and the French Government deserves to be congratulated for having acted promptly and made the initial results of the inquiry public. All the same, it is essential to identify responsibilities and strengthen safety measures in all road tunnels, not just the Fréjus tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must go further because, whether we like it or not, sending columns of forty‐tonners up to heights of over 1 200 metres is an aberration. Piggyback is the obvious answer to the unavoidable need to cross the Alps. It is clearly an expensive answer, but it is justified by its human and environmental benefits. Local representatives and associations for the protection of the area and its inhabitants did not wait for disaster to strike to promote cross‐border cooperation and sound the alarm. We should have listened to them sooner. Many victims would have been spared.</p>

We firmly believe that this is not the time to draw conclusions, given that investigations are under way, but there are certainly a number of points which can be made.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that the tunnel did not have a lateral safety tunnel and therefore did not meet the necessary safety standards for people travelling through it.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also say that the rescue systems were not adequate, and warnings to that effect had already been given, at the beginning of this year, by the Haute‐Savoie fire service.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that, in the context of the original decision to build the tunnel to guarantee transit through the Alps, the huge increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles using the tunnel means that the structure does not have sufficient capacity. Consequently, we have to point out once again that the priority for European Union transport policy has to be to move the bulk of heavy goods from road to rail. Only in that context will it be appropriate to identify safety criteria, for both road and rail tunnels.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen that rail tunnels have safety problems too. The Channel Tunnel has on several occasions run into great difficulty, despite being extremely modern. I believe that general policy on long tunnels has to be reviewed. Our whole approach to safety needs to be reviewed. It has to be a priority of the European Union to invest adequately to guarantee road safety. In that context, we believe that policy on tunnels must be properly reviewed.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Florio </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, my group fully concurs with this document drawn up in conjunction with honourable Members from all political groups. I wish to stress that, amongst other things, the document calls on the Commission to draw up European legislation – currently sadly lacking – to guarantee high safety standards in road and rail tunnels, and on the Council to adopt without further delay a directive on the control of commercial vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">It also worth pointing out that the resolution further calls for closer cross‐border cooperation between the civil protection units; points to cooperation with the Swiss authorities as the best way of tackling, in the short term, the problems caused by the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel; and calls upon all the Member States to assess the need to equip with a safety tunnel, allowing rapid evacuation in the event of an accident, those tunnels which currently do not have one, as was tragically the case in this incident.</p>
<p class="contents">But I wish also to stress, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission needs to make available a programme of aid for the Italian and French people who are bound to suffer greatly as a result of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel, both as a result of excessive traffic on other roads which are really going to be overloaded and as a result of a decline in traffic and tourism as a result of the tunnel's closure.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it important that Commissioner Kinnock should carry out an on‐the‐spot inspection, both at Mont Blanc and in Fréjus, to see for himself the gravity of the situation. It is in any event crucial that, provided safety conditions have been met, the tunnel should reopen as soon as possible.</p>

However, I have to say that I was extremely saddened by what the previous two speakers said. Everyone is calling for us to get traffic off the roads and onto the railways, and what happens? Nothing. Italy and Austria in particular are creating nothing but obstacles and have not lifted a finger to do any of the work that needs to be done. This means that far too many heavy‐goods lorries are having to go by road and through the tunnels. Now we are asking Switzerland to help. It has already started work on the Lutschberg project and the Gotthard tunnel, and now we are going to have to accept its charity. But we should have started the work ourselves. You cannot say that we have to get the traffic off the roads and then simply do nothing, opposing any new infrastructure and any liberalisation of the railways. This is no way for the Greens to go into the elections.</p>

I want then to make a point which complements what Mr Florio has already said, and is again at the centre of the concerns of the local institutions and economic operators in the regions of Savoie and Valle d'Aosta. In particular, the Valle d'Aosta is experiencing a huge rise in the number of hotel bookings cancelled since the closure of the tunnel, and so there is also an economic factor, linked to the tourism which is extremely important for the region and which needs to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect representatives of the affected regions to meet in the coming weeks to assess, not least in the light of our debate, what new measures can be taken both to bring traffic back on to the roads and as regards the issue of tourism. I should like to ask the Commission to consider, in relation to those aspects which fall within its jurisdiction of course, the issues linked to tourism which is vital to the region.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Union came into being on the basis of the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital. The free movement of goods must, specifically because it is <span class="italic">free</span> movement, also and above all be safe. We therefore have to take all necessary, useful and appropriate measures, and we deplore that this was not done.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, we so often speak of transfrontier areas, we have programmes for frontier zones and we are concerned to create a Europe of the regions. Plainly, we cannot tolerate accidents of this kind, which are totally incompatible with the approach being taken by the European Union. By liberalising the movement of persons, the European Union has allowed them to move more frequently; the European Union must implement and secure the implementation of programmes to ensure that movement is both free and, I repeat, safe.</p>

<p class="contents">The publication of an initial expert report on the tragedy of the Mont Blanc tunnel has added an element of farce to a tragedy which has cost more than 40 people their lives – and more bodies may yet be recovered – and which has inflamed the debate on the responsibilities that the French and Italian authorities are trying to offload on one another, making absurd and pretentious excuses.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, no one has been able to tell us what has happened to the video cassettes which record movement through the tunnel and which have yet to be found. No one has been able to tell us whether it is true that the lorry that entered the tunnel from the French side was already on fire as it entered the tunnel, and we waste time trying to establish a tiny difference of a minute or two between the time it took the French and Italians to intervene. We read that the Italian authorities had calculated that the wind was that day blowing from Italy in the direction of France and therefore prevented cold air intake. We read that the French authorities are condemning the dearth of Italian rescue services at the entry to the tunnel and the fact that, in the event of an accident, the rescue services actually had to come from Aosta.</p>
<p class="contents">We say, enough is enough!. We repeat that safety in the transport sector has to be a priority of European transport policy and we are therefore asking, as in a question put to the Commission, that the Commission itself should soon – indeed as a matter of urgency – provide for a directive on compulsory safety systems for road tunnels. We would further stress that it is similarly important to have a directive laying down roadside procedures and inspections of roadworthiness for commercial vehicles circulating on Europe's roads.</p>

I know that councillors in the Chamonix valley have repeatedly spoken out against the thousands of lorries that travel through that narrow valley and that tunnel, which evidently was not built for such heavy traffic.</p>

But we need to look to the future, and I have two, or in fact three proposals to put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">My first proposal calls for the application of the rules on the transport of hazardous goods, the subject of debate on more than one occasion during the life of this parliament, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. My second proposal is to further encourage the shift of hazardous goods from road to rail – hackneyed words, but this approach has never been adequately implemented – and therefore to provide new incentives for combined transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Switzerland has been mentioned. We all agree that we should ask Switzerland for a provisional agreement to try to resolve these problems of the Alpine passes, but we must also bear in mind the characteristics of the Swiss road system, a veritable Gruyère with the 17 kilometre long St Gotthard pass which is three metres narrower than the Mont Blanc tunnel. We hope that this solution too will secure adequate safety conditions.</p>

I would also like to salute the courage and commitment of the rescue services who had to work in particularly difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The accident of 24 March was a cruel reminder of the problem of transport safety. The issue is one of the European Union"s priorities, and we must welcome that fact. But in light of the conclusions of the inquiry the French authorities have initiated, we will have to implement certain specific measures, particularly those measures involving the safety of major transport equipment and transport infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are asking the Commission to draw up a report based on the committee of inquiry"s conclusions, together with proposals aimed, in particular, at harmonising safety equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">This tragedy is another illustration, if one were needed, of the vital need to control the flow of road traffic – especially heavy goods vehicles – promote rail transport and establish operating rules to ensure maximum safety within a properly diversified European transport market.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Mr President, I too should like to begin by offering my sincere sympathies to the families of the victims of this terrible accident and expressing my admiration and praise for the courage shown by the emergency services afterwards. They too lost colleagues in the fire. Until we know exactly what happened and what the causes of the accident were, there would appear to be little point in talking about how we can prevent such a disaster from happening again in the future. The Commission therefore intends to wait for the results of the investigation and then to consider what measures could be taken at European level to improve safety in tunnels.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to take this opportunity to bring the European Parliament up to date on what the Commission is currently doing to help to limit hazards in tunnels more generally. As part of its programme of legislation on EU type‐approval for motor vehicles, the Commission has launched extensive legislation on vehicle standards, including minimum requirements for vehicle flammability.</p>
<p class="contents">The directorate‐general for transport, DG VII, is also currently cofunding a study with the OECD on the risks of transporting dangerous substances by road through tunnels. We had already decided to organise research into tunnel safety under the fifth framework programme of research and development, and we had specifically planned to fund improvements to the Mont Blanc tunnel as part of the trans‐European networks. The project, totalling EUR 3.7 million, was to improve the accident signalling equipment in the Mont Blanc tunnel and the control room.</p>
<p class="contents">The closure of this important artery will naturally cause a certain amount of disruption and congestion, but the impact will not be the same for car drivers and lorry drivers, since lorry drivers are bound to be more seriously affected. Around 700 000 lorries passed through the Mont Blanc tunnel every year, and alternative routes or alternative forms of transport are now going to have to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">The natural alternative to the Mont Blanc tunnel is the Fréjus tunnel to the south. Despite new restrictions to increase safety, the Commission expects the Fréjus tunnel to be able to take most of the freight traffic from the Mont Blanc tunnel. Lorries can also use the border crossings between France and Italy which are situated further south, while lorries under 28 tonnes have unlimited possibilities for travelling through Switzerland. Those are the road alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Another alternative would be to use a different form of transport for freight. Rail and combined transport must use the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel as an opportunity to show what they are made of. Rail transport must now show what it can do with its existing rolling stock and infrastructure. At the moment, it is not clear what extra freight capacity the railways can offer on the Alpine routes, but the Commission expects them to take advantage of the commercial opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission acknowledges that lessons must be learnt from this disaster in order to minimise the risks of anything similar happening in future. However, we will not be bounced into taking hasty decisions which are supposed to make transport safer. As far as the effects of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel are concerned, we will do everything it is in our limited power to do to try to ensure that traffic is not too severely disrupted. We feel it is too early to start predicting traffic chaos, and we would urge everyone to keep calm and to monitor the situation to see whether road and rail transport cannot solve the problems themselves.</p>

The state of Indonesia is about to become one huge battlefield. The forthcoming elections in June/July are of vital importance, and I think that if they are organised properly, they could form the basis for a different sort of federal Indonesia, all being well. This is why I think the European Union and, of course, the United Nations must do everything they can to help in the only way they can, to ensure that the elections are indeed democratic. All it will cost is a little money and effort. For goodness" sake, do not let this huge country, the ‘emerald belt" as we call it in Dutch, become just a patch of rust in the Pacific.</p>

Although the problems are concentrated in the Moluccan Archipelago and East Timor, there is also unrest in other regions like Irian Jaya, Kalimantan and North Sumatra. The Indonesian Government"s approach in recent years of distributing the inhabitants of Java over the whole of Indonesia as a sort of dominant group now appears to be having disastrous effects. The Javanese people are not to blame for this, of course, but they have become pawns in a project with a dual agenda: combating poverty among the Javanese and weakening the identity of certain island groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In the midst of all this, there are also the enormous problems in Timor, which are getting worse again and have even led to massacres in Liquiça. This is extremely disappointing, because agreements had been reached on improving the situation there. We call on the Commission to bring pressure to bear on Indonesia to ensure that the situation does improve, and we would strongly urge the Commission to help to ensure that the elections there run smoothly and that the minority groups on the smaller islands are also treated fairly in those elections. Indonesia deserves this. As Mr Bertens said, it is a huge and beautiful country, and it would indeed be a shame if it fell apart completely and if human rights and democracy came to be discredited once and for all there.</p>

As the elections set for 7 June draw nearer, and as we move towards a critical stage in the negotiations on the future of East Timor being held between the governments of Indonesia and Portugal under the aegis of the United Nations, we are seeing attacks on supporters of the Nobel Peace Prize winner D. Ximenes Belo, and on civilians praying in a church. We are witnessing attacks on the entire population, which is experiencing an enormous wave of panic because of a proliferation of military brigades doing nothing to defend them and instead attacking them. All this is happening at a time when Xanana Gusmão has still not been given complete freedom, which this House has repeatedly demanded. For all these reasons, we urge the European Parliament to approve a resolution drawing the attention of the Indonesian authorities to the need to restore legality, to the need to halt these massacres, to the need for the armed forces to defend rather than attack the public, to the need to free Xanana Gusmão, and to the need for the United Nations to continue to support Portugal"s efforts to restore peace in East Timor and throughout Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a pivotal area for world stability and I therefore believe that we should vote in favour of a resolution which once again sends a message of support from the European Parliament to the people of East Timor, who have suffered so much from genocide.</p>

I would not go so far as to say, like Mr Bertens, that the country is threatening to fall apart, but the risk is there. The situation appears to be calm on Java, while on Aceh the government and the army have restored order and, importantly, have punished those responsible. Unfortunately, there are still occasional confrontations between the people there.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent developments on Timor are extremely regrettable, but there is perhaps also some evidence of progress, with attempts now being made to set up a commission involving all of Timor"s leaders – even Xanana Gusmão has been invited. Of course, the militias on the island must be made to hand over their weapons and the negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia must continue. There must also be an investigation into the massacre. Forty‐eight political parties are now preparing for the elections, and most of them include political tendencies with the following characteristics: Islamic, nationalist, liberal, supporters of central planning, maintainers of the status quo. It is an extremely complicated country where simple black‐and‐white solutions do not work. Fortunately, if my information is correct, the electoral commission has adopted an independent position. I know that the Commission and the Council have already earmarked a great deal of money to support the elections, but I am amazed that, although Parliament has been calling year in year out for democracy in Indonesia and the opposition groups there are now asking for Parliament to send observers, the Bureau has decided against doing so. Mr President, would you urge Parliament and the Bureau to reverse this decision? I think it is incomprehensible, and it undermines the credibility of this debate here in the House.</p>

We too signed up to this resolution because we think that at this particular point, we need to remind people of the importance of negotiation as a way of finding a solution to the problems in East Timor. With the increasing bloodshed there, the negotiations are threatening to be swept away by a tide of military and paramilitary violence. The Indonesian Government must be urged to end support for the paramilitary organisations, to limit the military presence, to restore the rule of law and to bring those responsible to justice and ensure that they are punished.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that Indonesia is right to be proud of its self‐determination, but in view of the diversity of the people living in this archipelago, we should also expect the same respect to be afforded to all those living in and around Indonesia and in particular to East Timor, which Indonesia has always unlawfully occupied. I would specifically like to support Mrs van Bladel"s request that we should send observers. We have often seen violence increase before elections, and we have also seen that the presence of foreign observers can help to calm the situation. It is not too late for us to do something about it.</p>

There are plenty of other places in Indonesia where fighting has flared up and irregularities have occurred, often or almost always along ethnic or religious divides, unfortunately. Last week, I happened to talk to someone who had just come back from Ambon. The story he told was sadly all too familiar: systematic human rights violations, terrible murders and large numbers of displaced people. And precisely because this is a worldwide phenomenon as we reach the end of the 20th century, with small‐scale, interethnic, interreligious conflicts in Europe, Asia and Africa, we need to keep on putting this subject on our agenda here in the European Parliament, however frustrating, however often it may be and however little it may help in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately the European Union can do more, and here I would like to add my voice to those of Mrs van Bladel and Mrs Maes. I understood that the EU had made money available to send some 60 observers to the Indonesian elections. What I would like to know is what kind of observers they will be and whether the Indonesian Government has already agreed to have them, since it has already shown that it does not think much of observers, wherever they are from. If not, what does the European Union plan to do to ensure that these observers, who I would stress are extremely important, are there for the elections in June?</p>

On 6 and 7 April, 25 civilian victims of the armed militia known as the ‘Meraputi" were killed with the active connivance of the mobile brigade of Indonesia"s elite police squad.</p>
<p class="contents">We are demanding an international inquiry. We are demanding that those responsible for these criminal acts should be held to account.

The UN cannot turn its back, it must have a force on the ground to guarantee peace and to ensure that these discussions take place. We denounce the cynicism of the Indonesian regime, which while pledging that it is defending human rights is simultaneously arming the militias which are slaughtering the people. We are accordingly sending a message of solidarity to Xanana Gusmão, the man who in 1992 was sentenced to 20 years" imprisonment. Although he is at present under house arrest, he is being threatened with a return to prison, to total incarceration, simply because he called on the people of East Timor to defend themselves.

<p class="contents">Personally, I agree with the joint resolution on the whole, and I shall vote for it. But there is no point in pretending that a resolution from our Parliament, however forceful and well‐intentioned, is going to improve the fate of the Timorese. This small Catholic people is the target of an actual attempt at genocide by the Indonesian Government. Tragically, the massacre of 25 worshippers in a Liquiça church is only a drop in the ocean of blood from the atrocities committed. Over 24 years, 200 000 Timorese, or a third of the population, have already been exterminated. Jakarta seems to want to wipe this small, courageous Catholic people off the map for resisting being engulfed by an Indonesia of 150 million Muslims.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Turkish Government in Cyprus, the Indonesian Government is also trying to replace the Catholics with a Muslim population by sending in tens of thousands of colonists. Just as in other countries where a government asserts that it is Islamic – Sudan, Turkey, Syrian‐occupied Lebanon – Christians are persecuted, marginalised, treated as second‐class citizens, or even massacred.</p>
<p class="contents">But the fact is, East Timor holds no interest, beyond good intentions, for the powers that govern us from Washington and Brussels. Indonesia can violate the sovereignty of Portugal and the right of peoples to self‐determination, and perpetuate a kind of genocide, yet apparently all that arouses is purely verbal indignation. Disregarding the principle of sovereignty, and at the risk of starting a third world war, the powers that be prefer to bomb the Serbs, who are trying to save their national and religious identity in their own province of Kosovo, the cradle of their nation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clearly a question of double standards. We are indignant at this so‐called new world order imposing the law of the jungle: weak towards the powerful and ruthless towards the weak.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Mr President, the Commission agrees with the honourable Member that the situation in Indonesia has certainly deteriorated in terms of the interethnic and interreligious conflicts that were mentioned. In its statement of 7 April on the subject, the Council added that the Indonesian Government has taken a number of clearly very welcome steps to do with the elections, new laws on the political parties and certain economic measures that have been announced to stabilise the economic situation. A number of social programmes have also been set up to deal with the current crisis, and announcements have been made about improving the human rights situation in Indonesia. All of this is set out in the Council"s statement of 7 April.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission also decided on 31 March that it should make available EUR 7 million for the forthcoming elections in Indonesia. Of that sum, EUR 5 million are to be spent through the NGOs on election training and information, and EUR 2 million on sending 60 observers from the Member States for two weeks as part of a broader election observation programme organised by the United Nations. The United Nations itself is to send 30 observers for a longer period of two months, and Indonesia has already agreed that they should be present.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to East Timor, the Commission shares the House"s concern at the recent increase in violence and we support the statement of 12 April by the presidency. We also support the Member States" initiative to set up a peace and reconciliation committee to help to restore calm on East Timor. We feel that the recent series of incidents clearly calls for a United Nations presence in the area, and we would therefore strongly urge that the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations should be given free access to East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the Indonesian Government"s new policy of recognising that direct elections need to be held on Timor in order to determine how far the conditions for independence currently being discussed in New York are acceptable. We would point out that the efforts of the United Nations Secretary‐General to find a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution must also be given international support.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reiterates that, needless to say, it supports the current discussions on East Timor, which we also feel offer the only opportunity of finding a peaceful, just and lasting solution that takes account of the East Timorese people"s right to self‐determination and the interests of all the parties concerned.</p>

Their refusal to grant an entry visa to Michael Aris, the terminally ill husband of Aung San Suu Kyi, showed their lack of respect, and the completely unnecessary suffering that this caused Aung San is typical of the way the government behaves. If it carries on like this, there is no prospect of an end to Burma"s isolation – on the contrary, it can only get worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we are once again having to call on the Burmese Government to respect the basic rights of the Burmese people in general, and we are again having to condemn the forced displacement of whole villages and the use of forced labour. No crisis gives any government the right to violate the rights of its people, and the Burmese Government must understand that its leaders will be held personally responsible for the suffering that they cause.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community does not forget, and at some point Burma"s present leaders are going to have to stand trial for the crimes they are currently committing. The application of international criminal law in practice will ensure that everyone"s basic rights are protected.</p>

This time it has hit the headlines by refusing to allow Aung San Suu Kyi"s husband, who was seriously ill, to come to Burma. It goes without saying that Aung San Suu Kyi herself could not go to England, because she would not then have been allowed to return. But it is disgraceful that a couple who have been married for 25 years should be refused the chance to be together at a time when one of them is dying.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Karen villages along the border are once again coming under attack. I was in Thailand last year to visit some of the refugee camps, and now I hear that large numbers of people are again coming over the border to these camps, which are already overflowing.</p>
<p class="contents">Some positive steps are also being taken. A group of 285 MPs has been formed which hopes to convene the Burmese Parliament itself. Would it not be a good idea for the European Union to lend its support, so that the parliament, which is currently dissolved, is able to work through different channels on a constitution that could finally bring about a fundamental change in Burma"s situation?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a situation that we have been forced to sit and watch for years now. It is one of the most badly governed countries in the world. The European Union needs to adopt a much harder line than it does at present, and I would urge the Commission to do so.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Vecchi </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, in recent weeks, the Burmese regime has committed yet another appalling act: the Sakharov laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been denied freedom of movement, was not even able to see her own husband before his death. She and the whole of her country have for many years now been deprived of every fundamental freedom, respect for the most basic of human rights and any glimpse of democracy. We also know that any opposition is severely repressed and that repression is particularly severe in relation to the ethnic minorities. Forced labour and indeed slavery are widespread in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that the military clique in power has so far been unmoved by and insensitive to any internal or international pressure. I have to say that, if we talk of defence and promotion of human rights as a fundamental element in the European identity and its international image, then Burma today is certainly one of the key litmus tests, and I believe that one of the best ways in which we can extend our sincere condolences to Aung San Suu Kyi is principally by adding to the initiatives we are taking against the Burmese regime, increasing its international isolation at both a political and diplomatic and an economic and commercial level.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, so long as human rights are not guaranteed and the democratic process that the majority of the Burmese people want is not resumed, it will be impossible to have normal or indeed any kind of relations with that country.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I believe that, in relation to Burma, we shall have to establish, alongside the measures to isolate it, a political strategy, a strategy to promote change, the kind of change the Burmese people also long for. We must therefore move beyond fine words and adopt a specific strategy that is shared and applied by all the countries of the Union.</p>

<p class="contents">The Union has held a very clear position on Burma, with the Commission – especially Commissioner Marín – the Council, rather exceptionally, and obviously our Parliament, all in agreement. So I think what we need to discuss is the question raised by Mr Vecchi. Is Burma really isolated? I do not think so, because if it really were isolated, the sanctions we have put in place would have had some effect. The truth is that Burma is getting very strong backing. In particular – and I am sorry Commissioner Brittan is not here – Burma is strongly supported by China, on both an economic and a military level, and that is why it is able to continue with the repression and prevent any democratic development.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must do the same for Burma as for North Korea, another country which finds favour with Commissioner Brittan, by putting pressure on China to urge the Burmese and North Korean Governments to bring about change at last. Further support for Burma comes from our worldwide prohibitionist approach to drugs. We know that Burma is one of the major producers of drugs and it has the resources to be able to do without the support of Western countries because it has money – plenty of money – from the drugs trade.</p>

All we can really do is repeat ourselves. Regrettably, an already grim situation has been made even worse by the sad news of the death of Dr Michael Aris, the husband of Aung San Suu Kyi. The couple were forced to live apart, because she was unable to visit him and he was not permitted to visit her. I believe their private grief is a microcosmic illustration of the repression and cruelty practised by the Burmese regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We must encourage the Commission to use its influence, particularly with Burma's neighbours, to isolate Burma with a view to securing the resignation of the present government and halting the maltreatment of villagers, who are taken away for forced labour or whose entire villages are resettled. We must encourage and exhort the Council to discontinue any cooperation with the ASEAN states in which Burma is involved, not to integrate Burma into any cooperative ventures in the region and to prevail upon Germany, as the holder of the Council presidency, not to issue any entry visas. We have imposed a ban here, and all the Member States of the Union should enforce it.</p>

For this reason, I should like to focus your attention more sharply on the ethnic cleansing that is taking place in Burma. The fact that we have adopted a resolution on Kosovo this very day lends special significance to this point, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution we are especially critical of conditions in the Karen villages this time. But at the same time we must not overlook the fact that this is all part of a larger plan, as Amnesty International, for example, exposed very graphically in London last year. We showed how, in the previous two years, some 300 000 members of the Shan people had been forcibly resettled and how the Mon, Akha and Lahu peoples were being driven out into neighbouring countries. In the light of this fact, it is only right and proper for us to rethink our policy on visas, as proposed in paragraph 9, and to ban Burma from attending EU‐ASEAN and ASEM meetings until genuine improvements are observed in the human rights situation.</p>

As King Sihanouk told me, ‘<span class="italic">mon peuple est toujours très malade</span> ". The tragedy continues, 20 years on, because there has been no investigation or trial whatsoever. The Cambodian Government could not carry out such an investigation or trial even if it wanted to. In August 1998, work was still being done on drawing up a civil code and a penal code, and the American and European experts were still arguing with each other and amongst themselves in an attempt to impose their views on these various forms of law. There is a complete absence of any judicial apparatus in Cambodia, and this is why my group wants an international UN tribunal to investigate the genocide and punish those responsible. We want the European Union to help Cambodia to become a constitutional state.</p>

It is sad to see that a quarter of a century later they are only just beginning to try to obtain justice for the victims, and even this is threatening to fail because the present political leaders want to hide their involvement in the genocide. I myself would prefer to see the country taking its own responsibility for sorting out its terrible past, but now that it seems that the facts are about to be swept under the carpet, my group feels that an ad hoc tribunal on the genocide in Cambodia would offer a better guarantee of justice for the Cambodians.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Harrison </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the failure to prosecute Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok before an independent international tribunal is extremely worrying but also instructive. Worrying, because a domestic trial in Cambodia is unlikely to bring out the full facts of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge in the years of the killing fields in the late 1970s. Worrying too, lest Hun Sen unwarrantedly uses international aid for domestic treason law to move against some of his current political opponents. Instructive, however, in clarifying the need for the international community to set up a permanent international criminal tribunal which can deal with the all‐too‐frequent acts of genocide which besmirch us all. But a tribunal which will also act as an inhibition to practitioners of evil, whether they manifest themselves in Indo‐China or in former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">The rule of law is a paramount strut of a civil society. Sadly, in nearby Malaysia the jailing this week of Anwar Ibrahim illustrates how far we still have to go to ensure that the law is used to enshrine and support the concept of human rights. Anwar Ibrahim's black eye on arrest is a reproach to the rule of law in Malaysia and to all of us who cherish the primacy of human rights in the conduct of human affairs. Anwar Ibrahim should be released immediately if Mahathir's failing Malaysia is to be restored to health and prosperity in the eyes of the watching world community.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I call upon you to issue a note of protest to Dr Mahathir concerning the flawed political trial practised on Anwar Ibrahim, a note of protest in accordance with the many critical resolutions passed by this Parliament concerning Malaysia. I hope you are able to do that on behalf of this Parliament.</p>

The massacre in Cambodia must not be consigned to history, and its perpetrators must be called to account. That is why it is right to set up an international ad hoc tribunal here. It is right because Cambodia itself is apparently unable to set up a tribunal, since the Cambodian State does not possess the necessary structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of a framework of civil law is a challenge to the Commission to show how it can help. We have issued that challenge on several occasions, and I believe Europe has a considerable amount of assistance to lend. That also applies in the context of our work with all the nations of ASEAN. It also applies to Malaysia. The previous speaker dealt in some detail with the case of Anwar Ibrahim. We cannot tolerate unlawful detention in that case either, and we call on the Commission and the Council to make the appropriate approaches in Malaysia. Otherwise we should have to take measures to freeze our diplomatic relations.</p>

<p class="contents">Secondly, the tribunal must be international, not just because at one time, before he rejected the idea, Mr Hun Sen demanded that, but because we cannot allow the Khmer Rouge trial to become entangled in political and legal score‐settling in a country where democracy is still being established.</p>

Nor is there any sign even of an investigation into it all. I am seriously concerned about the impasse that has been reached here. The present Cambodian Government must not allow the Khmer Rouge leaders to go unpunished for whatever reasons it may have – patriotism, perhaps. I also think that an international Cambodia tribunal might still be able to bring some influence to bear and could send a signal to the government in Burma and other governments in South‐East Asia.</p>

We would be deluding ourselves if we were to think that a Cambodian court could give an unprejudiced ruling on the crimes he committed against humanity or, more generally, the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p class="contents">It is desirable that an ad hoc tribunal should be set up, but there will always be the suspicion that this is a special court that has already predetermined, so to speak, the tenor of its judgment and has not given the accused the guarantees that even a defendant like Ta Mok deserves. Consequently, there is only one solution: a permanent international court, a natural court with jurisdiction to try all crimes against humanity, regardless of who commits them, or where and when they are committed.</p>

Here we have yet another coup, yet another failure to observe the principles of the constitutional state, the assumption by a military junta of legislative and executive authority with no popular support, against a background made worse by the recent annulment by the Constitutional Court of the results of administrative elections which should in theory have completed the process of a return to democracy and were, strange to say, won by the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore be resolute in its response.

Now yet another president who had come to power through a coup d"état has been assassinated, murdered by his own military bodyguard who then himself seized power. The parliament has been dissolved and the army has seized almost total power for itself. Naturally, we need to keep a very close eye on this situation, which was why I mentioned the events of five years ago in Rwanda. Yet again a country which already had enormous problems has been thrown into turmoil. In these circumstances, it would be irresponsible to enter into any form of cooperation with those in power. If we want to provide humanitarian aid, we must send it through reliable NGOs and hope that our intentions are carried out.</p>

Niger is now in a very tense situation in the wake of the <span class="italic">coup d"état</span> and the murder of its President on 9 April. The results of the recently held local and regional elections have been declared invalid and, following the dissolution of the National Assembly, the military have taken over legislative and executive authority. Let us trust that this is not the end of the process of evolution towards more democracy. Some hope still remains, since the opposition has stated that it will allow the military nine months to hand back power to a civilian government.</p>
<p class="contents">All we as Members of the European Parliament can do is to call upon the Commission to cease cooperation under the Lomé Convention and to implore Niger"s self‐appointed leadership to abide by the constitution, return power to a civilian government, and respect human rights and civil liberties. That is the one and only road to freedom and stability in the country.</p>

<p class="contents">Admittedly, the system of countries such as Niger is barely compatible with the fragile processes of democratisation, and this has been demonstrated in recent months with the annulment of the regional, provincial and local elections in which the opposition held the day. The military cliques which have perpetrated the coup and are wielding power arbitrarily must be stopped. What now has to be done is to restore the institutions and set in train a genuine process to bring democracy to the country and, to that end, we too agree that official cooperation under the Lomé Convention must be blocked until the process of establishing democracy has been resumed. But this situation also shows that there has to be a qualitative improvement in the policy adopted towards the African countries, so that the promotion of human rights, democratisation and conflict prevention – the only conditions that will ensure development – become essential elements of cooperation.</p>

<p class="contents">I want to echo the concerns of many people in Ireland and the international community about the circumstances surrounding this murder. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the International Commission of Jurists and, last night, US Congressmen have all expressed their worries over the case.</p>
<p class="contents">If we in the European Union are to be taken seriously in promoting high standards of human rights in the world, we must make sure that our own house is in order. We have to ensure that lawyers, who are an essential part of any effective and credible system of justice, are allowed to conduct their professional duties without any hindrances or fear of intimidation or worse. The murder of Rosemary Nelson, and the earlier killing of Patrick Finucane, provide clear evidence that this minimum requirement for justice is not guaranteed in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw your attention in particular to recitals D and F of the resolution – which time does not allow me to read out – and I would ask you to read them carefully. In these circumstances I think an investigation by the RUC would lack credibility. Indeed, the RUC has more or less admitted so much by asking British and American police officials to supervise the investigation. It would be better all round if the investigations were to be conducted in a completely independent manner so that it could be seen to be objective and impartial by all sections of the community.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Members to support the resolution and our call for a full, independent, international judicial inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding this case.</p>

The only merciful thing was that neither her husband nor her children were in the car when it blew up savagely within sight and sound of her own home and the school where her little daughter was playing in the playground.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, in many parts of the world, but also in Northern Ireland, the lawyers and judges have found themselves in the front line where the trouble is most intense and the murder of Rosemary Nelson brings home to us once again the danger that many of these professionals put themselves into when defending one of their clients' most basic human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for an independent inquiry circles around the fact that there is considerable belief that an inquiry by the RUC into the death of Mrs Nelson will not be as rigorous as it should be because of the evidence that suggested that she feared very much for her life and for quite a long time believed that her life was in serious danger. Tragically, she was proved right. I hope that colleagues will support this resolution and vote with us on it.</p>

First of all we are shocked by the cold‐blooded murder of a woman who was personally and professionally devoted to the defence of human rights, and secondly we are shocked by the fact that particular elements, not in a distant part of the world but in the heart of a country of the European Union, are using terrorist violence to undermine an emergent peace process. But our task here is not only to express our shock but also to state our unequivocal demands. Firstly, we demand an enquiry by the prosecuting authorities into the background to this murder. In addition, like those who have spoken before me, I call for an international enquiry by the competent staff of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

Like many Members of this House I also witnessed the scenes of the wreckage of her car and of her family at the funeral. I can assure you that we utterly condemn the acts of violence that brought about those scenes and no effort will be spared in bringing the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe there is an effective and credible investigation taking place. Mr Port who is in charge of the investigation has been given a total and unlimited remit and the freedom to add resources or change resources as he so desires. Mr Port has worked with the UN in Yugoslavia and in Rwanda as an investigation coordinator and Director of Investigations in the UN Tribunal for Rwanda. If he so desires he may use independent investigators.</p>
<p class="contents">The FBI Legal Attaché has said that in their professional judgment the best chance of detecting those responsible lies in RUC involvement in the investigation because of its knowledge on the ground and local intelligence. Without the involvement of the RUC any investigation would be severely hampered. It is necessary for us to cooperate in order to identify and prosecute those responsible for this crime.</p>
<p class="contents">As the ongoing investigation into Mrs Nelson is still under way it would be unhelpful to prejudice that investigation by calling at this stage for any new inquiry. I hope colleagues in Parliament today will appreciate the delicate and sensitive nature of this investigation and the fact that the ongoing peace process must not be jeopardised. Let the investigation finish its work before looking to additional or further inquiries which at this stage can only complicate matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The signal that has to go out from this Chamber, however, is that no matter what political colour you are you cannot get away with these acts of violence.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cushnahan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, the murder of Rosemary Nelson was a brutal and cowardly deed. It was an attack on the justice system, it was an attack on democracy and it was a deliberate attempt to undermine the Good Friday Agreement. It is regrettable, but it must be said that there are legitimate concerns about the role of the security forces. Those that enforce the rule of law must always operate within the law.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me say this: this resolution should not be misconstrued as a blanket condemnation of the RUC. The people of Northern Ireland have a lot to thank the RUC for. They have given their lives to buy time for politicians to solve the political problems of Northern Ireland. They have been at the coalface of terrorism from both Loyalist and Republican thugs. The overwhelming majority of its members are fine men trying to impartially enforce the rule of law. When we condemn this particular action we should remember that there are Loyalist and Republican thugs who are deliberately attempting to undermine an agreement which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Ireland, both north and south, and we will not let them do that.</p>

A decision will probably be taken to extend the existing measures against Burma, including visa restrictions, for a further six months. As you know, the initial decision on this was taken a year ago; it was extended six months ago and is now to be extended again, for the simple reason that the situation has not improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, discussions are currently taking place in the United Nations Human Rights Commission on drawing up a new resolution against Burma. Thirdly, I would point out that, in addition to the fact that the Council regularly devotes attention to the Burma problem, the EU‐ASEAN conference in Berlin which was scheduled for a month or six weeks ago had to be cancelled, because agreement could not be reached on whether Burma should participate and because ASEAN rejected the special arrangement proposed by the Council in order to be able to discuss the human rights issue with the Burmese.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to see how we can continue to demonstrate our rejection of the human rights situation in Burma and help to bring about improvements there, without allowing the situation to blight our entire relationship with ASEAN.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on briefly to Cambodia, the EU troika has made diplomatic approaches to the prime minister, who has said that he personally accepts the basic principle that the Khmer Rouge leaders must take genuine responsibility for the crimes they committed. The Commission therefore welcomed the recent statement by Prime Minister Hun Sen in which he agreed to allow foreign judges and prosecutors to play a central role in the trial of the imprisoned Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok in Cambodia in order to guarantee that the trial meets international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Niger, it goes without saying that we strongly condemn the recent coup d"état there, and the Commission is pressing the military authorities to restore the rule of law as quickly as possible. The Commission is currently considering what measures to take following recent events, as the House suggested, and one possibility is that we will propose to the Council that development cooperation should be partially suspended in accordance with Article 366a of the Lomé Convention, with which you are familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">At this early stage, the Commission still intends to suspend all new projects and programmes that are currently in preparation, together with existing projects, until the country is returned to lawful rule. Humanitarian aid and measures to help the poorest sections of the population are naturally not included here.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, like this House, the Commission was horrified to learn of the cowardly murder of Rosemary Nelson. On behalf of the Commission, I should like to take this opportunity to express our deepest sympathies to her family. We feel that the most important thing we can do is to honour her memory, to continue to support the peace process and to refuse to allow terrorism to gain the upper hand in Northern Ireland. We also hope that those guilty of this cowardly murder will be tracked down and brought to justice.</p>
