<p class="contents">In its answer of 2 October 2003 (<a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2003-2694_EN.html">P-2694/03</a>) the Commission confirms reports of discrimination in Germany against firms from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Federal German Government has postponed the introduction of the motorway toll indefinitely. In the light of this new development, can the Commission state whether the working party in its current form (comprising representatives of the Commission, the Federal German Government, the road haulage sector and Toll Collect) will continue its work, so that, should a new date be set for the introduction of the toll, a comprehensive report on the difficulties affecting the operation of the system and opinions on a possible breach of the Treaty can be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the working party not be allowed to fulfil its remit, will the Commission, on the basis of the facts as they stand, then open infringement proceedings against Germany with a view to requiring the Federal German Government or the operating firm to demonstrate that all remaining discriminatory aspects of the system have been eliminated? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 6 March, Germany notified the Commission of its intention to introduce a system of reimbursement of tolls – reimbursement, partial at least, or payment – based on special charges, which could allow payment of up to a sum of 15 cents on average.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must assess whether the notified measure is compatible with the common market and conforms to the applicable Community legislation. Given the doubts raised by this measure, on 23 July 2003, the Commission decided to begin a formal investigation, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, so that Germany and other interested parties could make their observations. On 27 August 2003 the text was published in the Official Journal of the European Union and the Commission is scheduled to make the final decision by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the system of tolls could be discriminatory if certain technical problems are not resolved before it is introduced. The Commission and the German Government, therefore, created a working group intended to examine the technical problems raised by the introduction of the system of tolls, and this group is demonstrating that it works well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the Commission has asked the German Government to ensure that the installation of tolls hinders the free movement of traffic in Europe as little as possible and that, if problems arise once it is in operation, the Commission would take the appropriate measures. In any event, however, I would like to say that we in the Commission have acted in defence of the Treaties, and that, since the end of August and the beginning of September, we have established channels of cooperation with the German Government which are operating in a more than satisfactory way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My concerns merely lie in the fact that the toll has been postponed indefinitely and that this working group, which you have already put in place, has also helped us to show that shortcomings have arisen and that this has also led to discrimination between various Member States. My question is, therefore, whether the working group will be able to continue its work in this transitional phase. If it will not, will the Commission open infringement proceedings? I think that it is clear that the toll system in principle is not being called into question, rather that, amongst other things, the control apparatus, which will be used to collect this toll for Germany, is a system that, firstly, has shown technical shortcomings and, secondly, will not be available to all businesses. That is enough, as far as I am concerned, to continue this investigation, that is to say, the monitoring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The German Transport Minister, Mr Stolpe, has repeatedly assured me – and the facts bear him out – that this system will not become operational until it is operating normally, with no problems and with no discrimination.

<p class="contents">The problem is that we believe that this Directive is not sufficiently clear or complete and, for example, does not provide for the possibility of cross-funding of alternative infrastructures, an issue which appears to be essential if we are to establish adequate infrastructures within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore made a proposal on a legal basis, the legal basis for transport, which is approved by a majority and does not require unanimity. It is true that the current Eurovignette Directive has a different legal basis, the fiscal legal basis; it is therefore considered a tax, while in the proposal we are now making, what we are proposing is a payment for the costs incurred as a result of the use of an infrastructure. Furthermore, we can maintain that legal basis, which is the one for transport, because we are talking about a payment for the use of an infrastructure, provided that the money received in this way does not enter the State’s accounts, because if it enters the public accounts, the administrative budgets, whether of the State, of the Autonomous Community or of a region, we would automatically be returning to the fiscal legal basis and it would therefore require unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Rübig, I believe it is essential that we preserve what is laid out in this proposal: to link that income to the use of the infrastructure, to the maintenance of infrastructures and the transport sector, and not to link this income to public income, the income of administrations, because in that case, I would repeat, we would have to opt for a different legal basis and we would have to approve it unanimously, and I do not know if that would be the best approach if we really want to achieve a modification in the Eurovignette Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Travel through the Republic of Bulgaria by EU citizens</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following my questions to the Commission concerning travel through Bulgaria and the information I sent regarding events in September 2001, I myself travelled along the main transit routes in Bulgaria and Serbia and Montenegro from 6 to 8 September, where I was able to confirm that the complaints passed on to me were well-founded.</p>
<p class="contents">I learnt from transit travellers that foreigners are often asked to pay EUR 5 to customs officials. When travellers do not comply with this demand, officials threaten to keep their vehicles waiting at the border for a long time. I was able to see for myself how police and customs officials imposed arbitrary and unjustified fines and charges of between EUR 70 and 200 per vehicle after carrying out unnecessary checks. This behaviour is in stark contravention of the rules and procedures which the EU expects applicant countries to observe.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission clarify this situation and say what action it has taken to address the problem? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are events that, I am sorry to say, we are not just aware of in Bulgaria but also in many other countries in this world, and I think that you know as well as I do why these events occur. Nevertheless, we must remember that the behaviour of police and customs officials, as described in your question, is illegal; it also constitutes a criminal offence according to Bulgarian law and must be punished. The Commission has had regular and in-depth discussions with the Bulgarian Government about these issues and has pressed for measures aimed at resolving them.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, mention that the Commission is not in any way able to open investigations in individual cases and in any case this is the responsibility of the national authorities. In my view, the problem of corruption at a border crossing or in transit is a question that, as well as being considered in terms of the rule of law, must also be considered in terms of fighting corruption. In its cooperation with Bulgaria, the Commission gave particular priority to both of these questions. What I would like to say is that I believe that the whole criminal justice system in Bulgaria needs to be radically reformed and this belief is shared by the Bulgarian Government. It was difficult to achieve this and it has not yet been fully achieved because to do so required a change in the constitution, which has been blocked for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">During a visit to Bulgaria this summer I intervened in a very unconventional way to try to overcome this blockade. My attempt was successful, and the constitutional change has now been adopted so that all obstacles to the necessary judicial reform have been removed, and the Commission is holding further talks with the Bulgarian authorities on widespread support for it. Furthermore, in cooperation with the Commission, the Bulgarian Government has drawn up an action plan to fight corruption, which will now be gradually implemented. This involves radical reform of toll and police management and tighter control measures. The Bulgarian Government has pledged to ensure that all citizens have access to an efficient complaints procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures that were implemented last year have, in the meantime, led to 218 disciplinary procedures against customs officials and 212 actions against police officials. To date forty customs officials and forty-seven police officers have been sacked. The Commission will continue to follow future development in this area and make full use of the instruments that we have available in order to make sure Bulgaria adheres to international standards and to help Bulgaria to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Illegal trade in pharmaceutical products on the Internet without a prescription</span></p>
<p class="contents">The development of electronic commerce has boosted the advertising and sale of pharmaceutical products on the Internet without a doctor's prescription, often endangering the lives of people who obtain the products (as in the case of a 24-year-old man in Britain).</p>
<p class="contents">Even though it is well known that the approval, advertising and sale of pharmaceutical items is controlled by strict regulations in the European Union, the international nature of the Internet makes it possible to circumvent those regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission have any information concerning the extent of the legal electronic sale of pharmaceutical products in the European Union? Does it have any information on the total supply of pharmaceutical products through the Internet with and without an electronic prescription, within and outside the EU? Will it study the phenomenon in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, the World Health Organisation and the FDA so that measures can be put forward aimed at averting the danger to health and preventing fraud against the public? Will it conduct a European campaign to raise awareness and inform consumers of the risks posed by the sale of pharmaceutical products on the Internet? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applies to their advertising. Nevertheless, the supply of medicines to private individuals, in other words the sale to the public by a pharmacist, is not regulated at Community level under pharmaceutical legislation. As a result, the sale of medicines to private individuals through the Internet is not covered by European pharmaceutical legislation. Sales of this nature fall under national provisions, which must be seen in the context of the ‘general principles’ of the Treaty, in other words, Articles 28 to 30 on the free movement of goods. The Commission does not, therefore, have accurate figures on the scale of legal electronic sales of medicines in the European Union. Nor does it have figures for the total quantity of medicines supplied through the Internet within the European Union and beyond its borders, with or without an electronic prescription.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue could also be considered in light of the Directive on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts, which lays down that, in order to guarantee a higher level of consumer protection, Member States can adopt or uphold stricter provisions, providing that these are compatible with the Treaty. These provisions include, should this prove necessary, banning the marketing on their territory, by means of a remote contract, of certain goods or services, in particular medicines, in compliance with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the compatibility of national measures with the Treaty, in other words Articles 28 to 30, is currently the subject of the DocMorris NV and Jacques Waterval case, which is pending in the Court of Justice. The issue mainly concerns looking at the proportionality of national measures of this nature and the justification for them, in order to protect human health and life.</p>
<p class="contents">The sale of medicines through the Internet raises issues of health protection and legal issues and improving the information available to patients is precisely one of the key elements of the recent Commission communication entitled ‘A Stronger European-based Pharmaceutical Industry for the Benefit of the Patient – A Call for Action’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has committed itself to looking into setting up a realistic and practical framework for informing patients about prescription medicines. By the way, the Commission intends to set up a European health portal which could address these issues. It should, however, be noted that it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States to inform consumers about the dangers of buying over the Internet and to monitor these activities. The Commission can, therefore, only act in a very limited set of circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me, therefore, to tell you that the turnover from the electronic trade in pharmaceutical products exceeds EUR 5 billion, while we do not know who is selling the pharmaceutical products. Inquiries conducted into the matter have shown that they are people engaged in criminal activities. Similarly, we do not know the place of origin of the pharmaceutical products, because they often do not come from places such as the USA or Canada, but from India or Brazil, with the result that the composition and content of the pharmaceutical product are very harmful and bear no relation to the indications. There is also a circuit of counterfeit, fictitious medical opinions, which result in a threat to the life of the person accepting the pharmaceutical product. This too has been observed in Great Britain. Unfortunately, in 2003 alone, more than 600 British subjects purchased pharmaceutical products over the Internet. Do we really have to allow this advertising, especially when it concerns young ages? The pharmaceutical products which have the greatest market penetration via the Internet are for the overweight. So they concern very young ages. I think that, irrespective of national legislation, we absolutely must take steps at Community level also. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue was debated during sitting of 1 July 2003, so it is now an opportunity to inform the House about the present state of play.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to say a few words on the background to this issue. As you know, the Irish and UK authorities have revealed fraudulent practices designed to artificially increase the weight of poultry-meat by adding water and protein to other ingredients. The process is used to retain a large quantity of water, up to 40% or indeed, even as high as 50%. That is the reason why I have asked my services to do all they can in order to improve this unfortunate situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the proposal made by the UK authorities, my services have been working on a Commission directive in order to highlight, on the label, the presence of added water in such products.</p>
<p class="contents">A draft has been discussed with experts from Member States and stakeholders. It provides a requirement to include 'with added water', and the percentage of water added, in the name of the product itself.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I remain of the opinion that labelling products to which water has been added is only the second best solution if water has been added only to increase artificially the weight and therefore to mislead the consumer. The practice of adding water to food in order to cheat the consumer is despicable. I have therefore again asked my services to examine whether there is any possibility of banning this practice under current Community law, and that work is being undertaken at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can you offer any prospect of a total ban on this practice?

I do not, therefore, have any ambition to put in place an upper limit for the inclusion of water which, even at 20%, has the effect of misleading the consumer.</p>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 38 by Frédérique Ries (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0568_EN.html">H-0568/03</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Cardboard sheaths concealing health warnings on cigarette packs</span></p>
<p class="contents">A new trend has swept through discotheques, bookshops and night shops in Belgium over the last few months: cardboard sheaths have appeared, into which cigarette packs may be slotted, thus concealing the health warnings on such packs. Directive 2001/37/EC<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> stipulates that, as from 30 September 2003, health warnings must cover 30% of the front of cigarette packs and not less than 40% of the back.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of those who designed this product is quite clear: they wish to conceal the health warnings with colour sheaths and, eventually, with commercial advertisements.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission been informed of this practice? Does it also realise that this is a booming market affecting twelve of the fifteen Member States? Does it intend to take action, together with the Member States, in order to put a stop to a trade which is in blatant contravention of the spirit of Directive 2001/37/EC? Or will it, at the very least, undertake to consider possible legal action? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although it has been able to develop robust tobacco legislation, it faces challenges every day, ranging from litigation to the incorrect implementation of provisions of this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member asks whether cardboard covers into which cigarette packets are put in order to hide the health warning, are against the 'spirit of the directive'. This issue is bound to be considered in the context of implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive. Article 5 of this directive requires that the content of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields should be printed on the cigarette packet and each unit packet of cigarettes must carry general and additional health warnings covering at least 30% of the front and 40% of the back surface, aimed at informing the consumer about the risks of tobacco use.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main purposes of the Tobacco Products Directive is to alert consumers to the health effects of tobacco use through clear and visible health warnings. In this respect, the directive provides that these texts must in no way be hidden, obscured or interrupted by other written or pictorial matter or by the opening of the packet.</p>
<p class="contents">If the cigarette packet and the cardboard cover are sold separately, it could be argued that this is not in direct contradiction with the provisions of the directive which concerns the sale of tobacco and not the sale of cardboard. If the cardboard cover is purchased voluntarily by the consumer, this then is an individual decision made by the consumer who has no doubt noticed the texts and the health warnings and, presumably, does not like to see them. So, in this context the purpose of the directive of informing the consumer about the health effects of tobacco use has been met.</p>
<p class="contents">However, where the cardboard is promoted directly or indirectly by the cigarette manufactures themselves and, for example, is given free of charge in tobacco shops, even where it is proposed or sold separately, this might affect the sale of tobacco which falls within the scope of the directive and jeopardise its useful effect. It could then be seen, as the honourable Member suggests, as going against the spirit of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware, for instance, that in some cases these cardboard covers are on sale at government-licensed tobacco shops, and brochures advertising them are sent to the tobacco shops by the same distribution companies that bring the tobacco. It is up to the Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure the correct implementation of the directive. The Commission urges the national authorities in charge of its implementation to be vigilant in that respect. The Community has a powerful legal instrument which needs to be implemented correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will analyse all practical issues emerging from the implementation of the directive and will report to Parliament before the end of 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe – I am not speaking in my personal capacity but on behalf of several Members, who have waged this fight side by side with the Commissioner throughout the work carried out on this proactive and important directive – that we are talking here about vital issues, and this is something that needs to be said! Our position is therefore to say that we find it extremely hard to accept this sort of legal fatalism. Not all being legal specialists but not, equally, being naive, we are fully aware that a legal solution – and we hope that one exists – will be extremely difficult to find. It is nevertheless also very hard to accept that these small objects, which some people see merely as items of fun but which are completely unacceptable, and which affect and even defeat the object of our directive, are sold in quantity today: 50 000 per day and that is only one brand, Commissioner!</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fashionable item more or less everywhere in the Member States. In my question I refer to twelve States, but the problem certainly occurs in all the Member States and the candidate countries. I therefore believe that some serious legal work needs to be done. We must find a solution, all the more because the Commission proposes, and we support it in this battle, to go further by including photographs. These will make the fashion more appealing and will further speed up the process of selling the products and the desire to cover up the reality. What can we do if that happens?</p>
<p class="contents">As to the second aspect, are the manufacturers themselves including this packaging? In most cases, they are not, but in some, it is the manufacturers of lighters that offer these products, which is not far off. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I indicated earlier, there seems to be some evidence that government-sponsored tobacco shops may be engaged in this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">The extent to which these products may be sold or given free of charge in conjunction with the sale of tobacco is an issue that must be addressed and resolved, particularly in the context of the implementation of the legislation which comes within the powers of the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if there were two completely separate and distinct transactions, one the purchase of cigarettes and the other, in a different shop in another area, the purchase of a package such as this, where an individual is free to do as he wishes with his packet of cigarettes, it seems to me that in such cases, we are reaching the point where regulation becomes more difficult. But, as I said earlier, the fact remains that the purchaser of the cigarette package will have been aware, and it will have been brought to his notice, that this information is contained on the packet of cigarettes. The photographs you refer to may also be included, if the Member State in question chooses to print them on the packet of cigarettes, though it is not compulsory to do so, and to that extent information is imparted to the consumer in the way intended by this legislation. So to that extent the legislation is not circumvented.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are issues involved here. One is to ensure the proper implementation of the legislation and the other is to ensure that we do not intrude upon the freedom of the individual to do whatever he wishes with his own property, even in circumstances where we would not approve of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission will be aware that in 2001, the European Parliament voted for a maximum overall limit of eight hours or 500 km to be placed on the transport of animals to slaughter or further fattening. The Commission's Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare concluded that ‘welfare tends to become poorer as journey length increases … hence journeys should be as short as possible’. In light of the above, will the Commission, despite not having included a maximum overall journey limit in its proposed Regulation, now support such a limit if Parliament again calls for a maximum overall limit when adopting its Opinion on the proposed Regulation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This amounts to a radical overhaul of the European rules on animal transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that Parliament and some Member States had called for a limitation on journeys of eight hours or 500 kilometres. However it should be crystal clear from the relevant scientific advice that the Scientific Committee did not recommend specific time limitations for the transport of animals as a tool to improve their welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal takes full account of the opinion of the Scientific Committee and a full range of consultations that took place with stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission decided that the best means to give effect to the outcome of this process was to propose travel times that would coincide with the travel and rest rules applicable to drivers. Consequently, one of my principal aims – the effective enforcement of enhanced animal protection rules – could be achieved in a much more straightforward way. Tachograph evidence would be used to verify compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to Parliament’s views on our proposal, as well as speedy progress in the Council.

<p class="contents">The Commission's scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare concluded that levels of animal welfare drop as journey times increase. As you mentioned, Commissioner, Parliament's position was eight hours. With a journey time of nine hours, a rest period of twelve hours, another nine hours of travelling and another twelve hours as a rest period you could just keep on going: you would have a situation where animals could be transported right around the globe and back again. This may continue until the animals are dead. This is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that we are supposed to be striving to create an incentive where the animals will be slaughtered as close as possible to their place of origin. We must get rid of these excessively long journeys, particularly where animals are being transported to places as far away as the Middle East. I would hope that the Commission will look again at what it is proposing and come forward with a maximum journey time, rather than this situation where animals can continue to travel long distances with periods of rest. That is not sufficient to ensure the animals' welfare and the scientists have actually pointed this out. I would hope that the Commission will take this on board.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term, we must consider the welfare of the animals and create incentives to reduce the need for long-distance transport. You will not do that, Commissioner, by creating a situation in which it can continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Common alcohol policy</span></p>
<p class="contents">In June 2001, on an initiative by Sweden, the Member States' Health Ministers decided to call on the Commission to draw up a Community strategy to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol. At the present time, we are witnessing increasing regular consumption of alcohol and an increasing amount of 'binge-drinking' among young people in certain Member States. The links between starting young and heavy alcohol consumption, drug abuse and crime are an established fact. Alcohol-related problems are also severe in several of the accession countries. What progress has the Commission made in drafting a global Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related damage and in setting a timetable for the various measures? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alcohol is one of the most important health determinants in the Community. I should like to assure you that the Commission, in further developing the Community public health strategy, will also focus on reducing alcohol-related harm.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community adopted two important documents on alcohol policy during the Swedish presidency in June 2001. The Council conclusions of 5 June 2001 on a Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm, referred to by the honourable Member, and the Council recommendation on the drinking of alcohol by young people, in particular children and adolescents (2001/458/EC). One major step in preparing these documents was the Stockholm Conference on Alcohol and Young People in February 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be emphasised that, besides being an important health policy issue, alcohol is also a controversial and politically sensitive issue both at the Community level and in the Member States. A Community strategy must be carefully planned in co-operation with the Member States. It must also be evidence based. Hence we have to assess the different measures as well as the different situations in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the new public health programme has provided the Commission with an efficient instrument in preparing the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">First, a report on alcohol is going to be completed by the end of 2004 under the health information part of the new programme. This report will deal with the economic and social costs of alcohol, including issues of promotion of alcohol, protection of children and young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, hopefully from the beginning of next year, we will create a network of expert organisations to support the implementation of the Council recommendation on the drinking of alcohol by young people, and to develop further a Community strategy on alcohol foreseen in the Council conclusion referred to by the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has recently created a working party on alcohol and health, where the Member States' representatives discuss different aspects of alcohol policy in the Community and, specifically, how the Member States are implementing the Council recommendation on alcohol and young people. The working party will also allow us to monitor the situation in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">A Commission report on the implementation of the Council recommendation on alcohol and young people is due to be presented at the end of 2005. This report will consider the extent to which the proposed measures are working effectively and the need for revision or further action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also exploring with the WHO euro-region and the Member States the possibility of holding a conference on alcohol and health in 2005 as a follow up to the Stockholm Conference in 2001. The results of this conference, together with the report on the application of the Council recommendation on young people and alcohol, will allow us to define the strategy, which will reflect the situation of the larger European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In making progress at Community level, we should not forget the central role of our Member States in tackling these phenomena. An integrated approach to combating alcohol-related issues needs concerted action by all stakeholders, including families, schools, employers, industry, advertisers and national regulators. Effective enforcement of existing national legislation on issues ranging from drink-driving to age limits could make a significant difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I interpret this as indicating that this work will now be entering a more intensive phase and that it will result in a good many practical measures. So far, we have unfortunately seen the Commission more readily adopting measures to increase, rather than reduce, consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest example was seen as recently as last Monday. In a so-called justified opinion, the Commission demanded that Sweden repeal its ban on the private import of alcoholic drinks via independent intermediaries, that is to say without the purchaser having to go via the state retailing monopoly. Through this measure, the ability to monitor the age of purchasers would all but disappear, and it would become considerably more difficult to deduct the correct alcohol tax.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, I should like to put a further question to the Commissioner: if we are to formulate a strategy on this important public health problem, would it not be appropriate for different parts of the Commission to work towards the same objective? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This phenomenon exists in a number of Member States, not all Member States. It is, however, an issue for the Member States themselves. It is a national competence issue and it would be wrong to look to the policies of the European Union either to encourage or discourage alcohol consumption. We can only act in the light of the competences that are available to us at European Union level: this issue is the primary responsibility of each individual Member State, and some Member States have a bigger problem than others. Those Member States that have a bigger problem should ensure that they put in place policies at national level to try to resolve this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The honourable Member currently refers in her question to the report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare concerning welfare aspects of the production of foie gras in ducks and geese. This report was adopted in December 1998 and covers a wide range of issues including : the origins and distribution of foie gras production; the practice of rearing and force-feeding: the behaviour of ducks and geese; the consequences of force-feeding, in particular welfare indicators; socio-economic aspects of improving the welfare of animals used in the foie gras industry; and research.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientists did not look at the issue of force-feeding in isolation, but as part of the full range of factors involved in producing foie gras. Nevertheless, in recognising that force-feeding of birds, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds, the Scientific Committee went on to make a number of recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the recommendations is to improve production practices so that avoidable suffering can be mitigated. Thus, according to the scientists, the objectives would be, in order of priority: to reduce mortality and morbidity rates; to decrease the amounts of pain and distress that all endure in the process; and to allow the animals to engage in normal behavioural activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes clear that it is very important for the further development of foie gras production to introduce alternative techniques that do not require force-feeding in an intensive way.</p>
<p class="contents">My services have drawn the attention of the industry to this report. As a consequence, the industry is studying and researching better production techniques that are more welfare-friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to draw to the honourable Member’s attention the two recommendations in the framework of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes. They concern specifically the protection of ducks and geese kept for the production of foie gras. I am pleased to say that the Commission actively participated in the adoption of the recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">These recommendations provide for welfare considerations for the breeding of ducks and geese and, in particular, for the phasing out of small individual cages for ducks. The recommendations reflect the necessity to reduce the most intensive form of farming, as recommended in the report of the Scientific Committee to which I have already referred.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community, all Member States, and most of the acceding countries are party to this Convention and, as such, are expected to give effect to the recommendations. In particular, parties to the Convention will have to report the status of the implementation of these particular recommendations to the Council of Europe after 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will closely follow the implementation of these recommendations, which provide for significant welfare improvements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I am sure you know, this is an issue of great concern to a lot of people across the European Union, and they will want to know that we are tackling it with a great degree of urgency. I would like to bring to your attention Council Directive 98/58/EC – the general farm animal welfare directive – which states that 'no animal shall be provided with food or liquid in a manner (...) which may cause unnecessary suffering or injury'. Given that the mechanical force-feeding of ducks and geese does exactly that, will the Commission please state whether it is satisfied with the application of Directive 98/58/EC in France and Belgium in particular?</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 98/58/EC also allows for Community measures to ensure the uniform application of Council of Europe recommendations.

<p class="contents">It is important to emphasise that there is no scientific advice available to us to the effect that the force-feeding itself, as distinct from the conditions under which the animals are kept, is contrary to animal welfare.

If you stick a funnel down a goose's throat and force-feed it with maize, there is no way that you are not causing suffering or injury. It is ludicrous to suggest that it is not causing injury.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Israeli supreme court has actually ruled that force-feeding is illegal – and that in a country where they had quite a large production of <span class="italic">foie gras</span> through force-feeding. Other countries too have ruled that it is illegal. The European Union should do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">You are denying the reality of the situation if you say that force-feeding does not cause unnecessary suffering or injury.

At present there is no decision and no agreement. There is therefore nothing to abrogate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an American law which requires airlines flying to or from the United States to provide access to their passenger name records. Most airlines are complying with this. That is understandable in view of the fact that there may be negative consequences for these airlines and for their passengers if they do not supply the data to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">February's joint statement brought with it a US commitment to work with the Commission towards achieving a so-called adequacy finding regarding the level of data protection provided by the United States. The honourable Member is right, the Commission does not consider that the American arrangements amount to adequate protection. That in itself is not yet a reason to stop the process. Instead, the Commission is energetically pursuing the process with the aim of persuading the United States to improve its arrangements so that an adequacy finding can be made and a proper legal framework for passenger name record transfers can be provided.</p>

I was in Washington early last week, and during my stay I had discussions with Mr Tom Ridge who is the Secretary for the Homeland Security Department, in other words the man in charge of seeing to it that the United States is a secure and safe country.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation of the United States requires all passengers going to the United States to have their personal data sent on before their arrival. Quite apart from what the Commission thinks, airlines and, where necessary, computerised reservation systems, supply that data. That is not strictly in compliance with European law and, therefore, the situation is not good.</p>
<p class="contents">European law is laid down in the Data Protection Directive which, incidentally, has not yet been transposed into the national legislations of a number of Member States. Anyway, it is a directive and should be policed by Member States, not by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, this is not a good situation. We need to decide whether there is adequate protection of the data in the United States, that is the so-called 'adequacy finding'.</p>
<p class="contents">As I told the relevant parliamentary committee in the first half of September, I cannot as yet conclude that there is adequacy on the other side of the ocean. Therefore the legally precarious situation continues to exist. Once again that is not good. The honourable Member said that there was a secret arrangement. There is nothing secret about anything at all. The situation is of doubtful legality, but the Commission is in discussions with the American Government to try and rectify. On my last visit to Washington I managed to achieve some limited progress towards an agreed solution, but we are still very far apart.</p>
<p class="contents">I said to Parliament that I set a deadline of Christmas to resolve this situation. What will happen I do not know. Hopefully, we shall reach an adequacy finding later on during the near because our negotiations continue. If that is not the case, I shall tell Parliament that there is no adequacy and, therefore, propose that we engage in a bilateral negotiation with the United States. That would, of necessity, amount to a derogation from the data protection directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another legal instrument in the form of the computerised reservation system regulation. That is a regulation and, therefore, the policing of that regulation is in the hands of the Commission. My colleague Mrs De Palacio is more specifically responsible for that. Articles 6 and 11 of the regulation say that the Commission may be required to stop data flow if that data flow is not compatible with the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">But may I draw the attention of honourable Members to the fact that stopping the data flow, as I said earlier, may have dire consequences for the airlines involved. It may mean that all passengers have to queue up for three or four hours in Washington, New York or wherever in order to give the data required by the Americans, or that airlines are fined so many dollars per passenger or their landing rights actually suspended. These are no mean consequences, and I would remind the honourable Member of the possible consequences that stopping of the data flow would have.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that I understand Parliament's concerns. They are my concerns because I am interested in upholding the law. We are working to that end. I was in Washington last week. We shall continue and I shall report to Parliament as soon as I have something more substantial than at this moment on how far our American partners are prepared to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Relabelling of parallel-imported pharmaceuticals</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to national legal practice in some Member States it is illegal to relabel parallel-imported pharmaceuticals so that they bear the name used by the trademark holder in the importing country, if the pharmaceutical concerned can be sold in the importing country under the same name as it was marketed under in the exporting country. This rule applies regardless of whether the parallel importer can show that, when the product is not renamed, the importer is deprived of 25% of the market owing to rules on the substitution of pharmaceuticals and doctors' prescription habits.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, is it consistent with the provisions of the Treaty on the free movement of goods and with Court of Justice case law concerning parallel imports of pharmaceuticals for national courts to justify their ruling that the above practice is illegal on the grounds, for example, that the lack of access to the market is solely a commercial obstacle which importers must seek to overcome by means of (in principle unrestricted) marketing which targets prescribing doctors (despite the fact that parallel importers do not have access to Drug Master Files or equivalent scientific/technical data, and regardless of whether the price of the pharmaceutical is regulated by rules on the dispensing of medicines)? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also subject to the derogations regarding the protection of human health and life and also the protection of industrial and commercial property, provided by Article 30 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Justice has ruled that the derogation to the free movement of goods, justified on the grounds of protection of industrial and commercial property, is only admissible for the purpose of safeguarding rights that constitute the specific subject matter of the property.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific point of a trademark is, in particular, to guarantee to the owner that he has the exclusive right to use that trademark for the purpose of putting a product on the market for the first time. Accordingly, Member State legislation protecting industrial and commercial property rights may not be used to oppose the importation of a product that has already been lawfully placed on the market in another Member State by, or with the consent of, the proprietor of that right. In certain circumstances parallel importers are forced to relabel parallel imported medicinal products in order to have effective access to the market of the importing Member State, especially when the use of different trademarks by the proprietor contributes to the artificial partitioning of the markets between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Partitioning of the markets would still exist if the importer were only able to sell the product in parts of his market. The court has ruled that repackaging and relabelling is not necessary if the parallel importer merely wishes to secure a commercial advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the jurisprudence of the court, relabelling is considered justified if it is objectively necessary. In any case, this is to be assessed on the basis of circumstances such as those mentioned in the question – circumstances prevailing at the time of the marketing of the parallel imported medicinal product in the importing Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for the national courts to determine in each specific case whether it is objectively necessary for the parallel importer to use the trademark used in the Member State of import to enable the imported products to have effective access to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the national measures mentioned in the question, should more information on the specific circumstances become available to the Commission, these special circumstances will be assessed in the light of the jurisprudence of the court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission is currently examining the question of whether the Spanish National Hydrological Plan is compatible with Community law.

<p class="contents">The Commission therefore takes the view that the provisions of the public service contract directives are applicable to this entity when it awards a contract falling within the scope of these directives and that the environmental impact assessment contract referred to by the honourable Member should have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In a letter to me dated 19 June 2003 Mr Martinez Fernandez, State Secretary for Coastline and Waterways in the Spanish Environment Ministry, acknowledges that this analysis of the Commission is correct. And in the same letter he gives the undertaking that from now on the company Trasagua will apply the relevant provisions of the EC directives in full whenever it awards contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that the Trasagua case must be placed in the broader context of the compatibility of the Spanish provisions for the implementation of the community concept of public law body. The Spanish Act under which the public service contract directives are implemented does after all exclude private entities from its scope, even if they conform to the definition of public law body within the meaning of the community directives.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Commission has on various occasions taken action under Article 226 for failure to fulfil obligations. The Court of Justice for example recently found Spain guilty of the incorrect application of the directive on working on the construction of a prison. Another case relating to the more general problem of the incorrect implementation of the personnel scope of the directives concerning the coordination of the procedures for the award of public works contracts and of public supply contracts has still to come before the Court.

I am also pleased with the reply he has given, namely that the Commission has declared Spain to be in default by reason of inadequate compliance with the directive on government spending. This is of such importance because this is not the first problem in the case of the Spanish Hydrological Plan, the <span class="italic">Plan</span> <span class="italic">Hydrologíca Nacional, </span>and it will not be the last. The fact is that this plan is enormous and requires a great deal of government funds, also government funds from the Commission, for which an application has been submitted but which, fortunately, has not yet been granted. I should like to urge the Commissioner to continue to act with the severity he has shown in this specific case, because it is important, in my view, for Spain to realise that it must comply with European legislation in every particular, not only as regards environmental impact assessments, but also where government tendering is concerned, particularly in this case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Parliament's requirements for the forthcoming Commission proposal for a directive on the capital adequacy of banks (Basel II)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Basel Committee will reach a decision on the new 'Basel II' own-capital provisions before the end of this year. Independently of the outcome of the Basel negotiations, I wish to ask which of the European Parliament's eight requirements the Commission will incorporate into the proposal for a directive, and how soon the proposal for a directive can be expected. The requirements laid down in the own-initiative report are: (1) annual adjustments to the EUR 1 million retail ceiling for inflation; (2) deletion of the 0.2% granularity criterion; (3) recognition of the specific financial situation of firms on start-up or in the event of takeover; (4) incorporation of the results of the impact study on SMEs; (5) monitoring of trends in costs and administrative expenditure incurred, in particular by smaller banks, as a result of Basel II; (6) recognition of physical collateral under the standardised approach and reduced risk weightings for mortgage bonds; (7) clear transparency of rating criteria; (8) positive assessment of research activities and investment expenditure in the fixing of ratings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission services are preparing a proposal for a directive on the capital adequacy of banks and investment firms. As Parliament will be aware, the Basel Committee has announced a short delay in its timetable in reaching agreement on the new Basel Accord. The accord should now be finalised by the middle of 2004 at the latest. The Commission's proposal should be made very shortly thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation at the end of 2006 remains a challenging but achievable task. The Commission services remain firmly on track in the development of a proposal for an EU directive. That draft proposal is broadly consistent with the work done by the Basel Committee, but appropriately differentiated, where necessary, to take account of the specificities of the EU context as supported by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Karas' fourth question, let me confirm that the results of the study on the consequences of the new framework on the European economy – especially SMEs – will be available in due time to inform the EU legislature. The technical details of the draft directive are still subject to reflection and consultation within the Commission, but I am pleased to provide you now with the following elements in response to the questions raised by Mr Karas.</p>
<p class="contents">First, with regard to his question on retail loans, the draft directive should indeed allow a wide use of comitology procedures to make necessary changes in the light of market developments, including inflation adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to his second question, the Commission services' third consultative paper – the so-called CP3 of 1 July 2003 – no longer refers to a specific granularity criterion to distinguish retail from corporate loan portfolios.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to questions 3, 7 and 8 on banks' internal rating systems, the draft proposals do not spell out how banks should develop their rating systems and which risk factors they should take into account. As is currently the case, banks are only required to take into account all relevant available information when they assess the credit quality of their borrowers, including any investments and research activities a potential borrower has undertaken or plans to make. This is not new and should be expected of any bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of that, the Commission services have started a project to examine ways of promoting the use of rating systems that include technology risk assessments – in other words, technology ratings – to enable potential investors to appraise the specific risks and rewards associated with investments in technology-based SMEs. But, if a bank wants to use its internal ratings for regulatory capital purposes, its supervisor will need in future to check the reliability of the bank's rating system. That will improve the quality of the systems and ratings and is in the interest of all parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">On question 5 it is important for the Commission that the new rules are appropriate for all types and sizes of institutions, especially small banks. Work in Basel and Brussels reflects this in numerous areas, for example by allowing a partial use of methodologies to avoid unnecessary burdens for small credit institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on question 6, a broader range of collateral is already recognised in connection with significant improvements for loans to SMEs. At this stage, both the Commission and the Member States' supervisory authorities believe that a further recognition of collateral and the destandardised approach would not be justified on prudential grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission services are pursuing a solution for covered bonds which appropriately reflects the risk of these instruments. I apologise for having been so detailed, Mr President, but the questions were also detailed and I wanted to reply in a similar vein. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to ask you, therefore, what consequences will result from postponing the timetable for the Basel Committee to make a decision? You say that you will submit your draft directive immediately afterwards; in that case, it is likely to be autumn 2004 and that leaves a relatively tight timeframe for debates in Parliament and with the Council and a very tight timeframe for a preparatory phase for businesses before it enters into force at the end of 2006. What are the consequences of the new agreement in the Basel Committee and the fact that the timetable has been put back by almost a year because of the Committee’s hesitancy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission does its best to keep pace with the developments in Basel.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Implementation of Community law: system for public contracts and the award of studies for public works in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">The system for awarding public contracts, studies and construction projects in Greece has often been described as being open to abuse, and the irregularities detected lead to delays in the completion of projects, construction faults, the submission of complaints to the Commission on the grounds of infringements of Community law (Thessaloniki metro, Ilarionas hydroelectric power station, etc), as well as the waste of Community resources. With specific regard to concession contracts, there is no legal framework in Greece operating alongside the rules laid down by Community law. On the contrary, such contracts are governed by ad hoc rules adopted for each individual case, which frequently leads to complaints being lodged with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To what extent are practices relating to the award of public works contracts in Greece compatible with Community law? Can the Commission confirm the reports which have been published according to which the Commission has called for the suspension of payments relating to the award of studies for public works in Greece and a review of the legislative framework governing public contracts and the award of studies on the grounds of an infringement of Community law? Have any complaints been lodged in relation to concession contracts, and if so, what action will the Commission take to ensure that Community law is complied with? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the fact that the relevant EU rules seem to have been correctly transposed, the Commission examines specific cases of potential irregularities in the award of public works and work concessions, which are brought to its attention and evaluates on a case-by-case basis whether or not Community law has been breached.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the specific question of certain public works studies, the Commission can confirm that, in the course of a regularly scheduled on-the-spot control mission concerning the Egnatia project, which is co-financed by the EU, in particular through the Trans-European Network – TEN-T – and the Structural Funds, some issues have been identified which show that the practices in Greece for the award of study contracts may not be compatible with public procurement rules and thus require further clarification. The Commission is in close contact with the Greek authorities in order to assess these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst awaiting the outcome of the compatibility assessment under the public procurement rules, and in application of the 'precautionary principle', some of the payments, namely those linked to the TEN-T budget line, have been suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the competent Greek authorities not provide sufficient evidence of the compatibility of national rules or practices with the Community legislation on public procurement, the Commission will have to open an infringement procedure and thus all the EU funds concerned will have to be suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the last question, the Commission is not currently examining any case related to the concession of public works, nor have there been any complaints on this specific issue to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
