There is no doubt that the damage to the Fukushima nuclear power plant is a disaster, but the final death toll will not be counted in thousands or hundreds, and perhaps not even in tens.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the world’s most severe earthquake recorded in that area, there will be an estimated 30 000 to 40 000 deaths due to destroyed roads, bridges, railway lines and buildings. Should we demolish all similar structures in the EU, just in case? That is my question.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear technology is not at fault in Japan; the location is. A panic reaction in Europe is therefore not only ridiculous but it could also damage the environment because there is no credible supply of a low carbon alternative to nuclear energy, and fossil fuels will prosper.

I remember the time when the Estonia sank: some were of the opinion that all ships should be banned, because they are dangerous. Well, individuals can have such thoughts. Now, though, we need to remember that just one out of 54 nuclear power plants did not get through the test to which the tsunami and earthquake subjected them.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, however, we now need to examine things calmly and remember that you cannot generalise on the basis of an individual case. In fact, 300 000 Europeans die each year from the effects of fossil fuel emissions, and that is something we should look into first. It is very important to ensure that nuclear technology is safe, and I know that in Europe, we will also construct plants safely in the future, and attention needs to be paid to this.

Human rights are one key area; they must be exported to the Middle East. We really need to present a concept and understanding of what human rights mean.

However, if we are being honest about this, then there is one detail that must be mentioned. We cannot tell people and ethnic groups in other countries to rename their language because other countries do not like what they call it. That is laid down in international law, and as Europeans we must be sure that we remain honest about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I was consequently very annoyed that unfortunately, one amendment was passed that I voted against, which stated that Macedonian should not be allowed to be called Macedonian. Macedonia is a country with great prospects in Europe mainly because it also has great economic prospects in the Balkans, a region that has genuine difficulties, is prospering economically, and is conducting the negotiations with élan – which is very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this positive attitude, I would like to thank all the Members who voted for this resolution, as well as all those who worked with the parliament there as part of the European Parliament delegation. We should make these prospects clear to the people there who want to be part of Europe. Let us work together to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bloody battles have led to the deaths of several hundred people living in the country. Over a million inhabitants of Côte d’Ivoire have had to leave their homes, and many refugees are still seeking shelter in neighbouring countries. Everything should be done to bring those guilty of crimes to justice. Above all, it should be investigated whether genocide and crimes against humanity did take place. It is also becoming absolutely vital to ensure order and the safety of citizens by bringing all forms of violence to an end. Intimidation of the local population and of foreign observers cannot be allowed to happen. The results of democratic elections must be complied with in full.

Support for initiatives such as Bielsat have a not inconsiderable significance for the independence of the media in Belarus, at the same time as withdrawing assistance for the state-controlled media. I would call for active support to be given to local democratic authorities in these countries through partnership programmes. Association agreements remain an important tool in stimulating reform, and the more funding and technical support they can provide, the better their results. Widening the intellectual base through scholarship programmes also requires additional funds. I appeal for an increase in funding to support human rights and the development of civil societies.

Although there is no record of any human being infected, it is vital to recognise this disease and seek to implement measures that will eradicate it. At EU level, this disease was first seen in the south, and then in the centre and north of Europe. Thanks to successive vaccination campaigns cofinanced by the EU, the use of certain vaccines may not eradicate the disease, but allow it to continue to circulate. A type of vaccine was therefore developed that ensures the control and prevention of this disease in the EU, but the use of which is restricted under current rules. A change to the current directive is therefore needed. Given that this proposal for an amendment to the Parliament and Council Directive 2000/75/EC complies with the Animal Health strategy (2007-2013) and points towards a more flexible approach in the vaccination system, thereby contributing to improved control of major animal diseases, I am voting in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic damage and the losses resulting from the trade coming to a standstill are hitting the farming sector hard. In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers have found their livelihoods threatened. It is now important to implement supporting measures and revise the old regulation before the next epidemic breaks out. The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers. I welcome the rapid action at EU level and advocate the fast implementation of the new directive. As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle. Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of those that keep animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the early 2000s, it has caused significant losses of animals affected by the disease. Europe intervened with Council Directive 2000/75/EC to deal with the problem through provisions regulating the use of ‘attenuated vaccines’, in order to effectively combat the consequences of the phenomenon. The vaccines used hitherto, which were those to which the aforementioned directive applied, led to the risk of transmission of the virus to unvaccinated animals, which is the reason why vaccination was only allowed in specially designated zones. Unlike the ones on the market at the time Council Directive 2000/75/EC was introduced, the new vaccines available are ‘inactivated vaccines’, and do not pose this kind of risk. I voted in favour of this report because the new provisions will allow Member States to control the phenomenon, thus reducing the negative impact of this disease on a large number of European livestock farmers.

An illness has also been observed in goats, but the course of the disease is far less dramatic in these than in the case of other species.

The new law ushers in the use of a new bluetongue vaccine for the first time, which takes advantage of developments in science since the previous rules came into force. The new vaccine will be an ‘inactivated’ jab and will allay farmers’ fears over the traditional ‘live’ vaccines. The EPLP is delighted that the EU has brought in this new law, which has real benefits for farmers in the UK. It reassures farmers who are concerned by the deadly disease and the existing vaccination as the bluetongue season approaches with the warmer weather. Farmers will now have a new and safer vaccine available and will be given greater powers over their own vaccination programmes. Until now, farmers would have lost the right to vaccinate their animals if the UK was declared entirely free from bluetongue.

The first lesson that the EU has drawn from the Japanese catastrophe has been to take prompt action to tighten safety checks at nuclear power installations by means of stress tests. Every nuclear power installation, whether inside or outside Europe, has the potential to be a weapon of destruction. I believe that none of us would wish to relive the Chernobyl disaster of 26 April 1986.</p>
<p class="contents">The second lesson is that science and technology may make giant leaps forward in all areas, but they always have to take into account a major constraint, which is nature and its unpredictability. It is precisely because of events outside the control of humans that we should diversify our energy sources, including by leveraging the renewable energy sources available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if nuclear power were to be chosen as a source of energy, people should first be informed about the costs, benefits and consequences of such a choice.

We have immediately cleared the way for a thorough investigation under European supervision. It is crucial that 1. the stress tests are carried out by independent experts and that 2. the results of those tests are acted on rigorously. That means that nuclear installations which do not conform to the standards, which continue to fail to make the grade, should be closed down. Obviously, power plants elsewhere in Europe, outside of the EU, should be subject to the same independent testing, under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Any state which refuses to participate in this will be making itself an international pariah, even in terms of international trade. Nuclear power has been, and remains, a transitional technology, a technology which we will, unfortunately, have to hang onto for decades to come. We will even have to make new investments in order to meet our energy needs and, at the same time, consolidate our climate ambitions. During that time, we must do everything possible to reduce the risk of accidents to a level that borders on zero. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These events led to a wave of reaction in Europe, with Commissioner Oettinger requesting the convocation of an extraordinary meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the German Chancellor deciding to suspend the decision to extend the lifetime of nuclear plants in her country by three months, and the Austrian Minister for the Environment, Mr Berlakivich, demanding that tests be carried out on European plants. It is vital that all possible lessons are learned from the Fukushima disaster, particularly with regard to the safety rules imposed on EU nuclear power plants, in order to ensure their safety and, ultimately, that of the European public.

It is therefore imperative that the EU promotes a programme to check security in its nuclear power plants, especially by carrying out so-called ‘stress tests’. These assessments should be based on a model of rigorous and harmonised evaluation, covering all the types of possible risks in a realistic scenario at European level, and they should be conducted by the end of this year, in an independent and coordinated way, encompassing all the existing and planned nuclear facilities in the EU. At present, nuclear energy is vital for ensuring the supply of energy with low carbon emissions in Europe. However, we must move towards greater energy efficiency and an increase in renewable energy.

The leaders of the country have described the destructive earthquake, combined with the giant tsunami waves and the subsequent nuclear threat, as the worst crisis since the US military dropped the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nature has wrought enormous and irreplaceable losses, especially in terms of human life and property. However, the situation in the Fukushima nuclear plant remains a threat. In an attempt to avert similar threats in the future, it would be right to consider implementing so-called stress tests of nuclear plants in EU Member States. These should show the extent to which the power plants are capable of withstanding similar disasters. A similar situation to the one in Japan could happen anywhere in Europe. It is therefore also desirable to have more stringent monitoring of safety systems at nuclear power plants, strengthening their weak aspects and eliminating any deficiencies. It is in the interest of individual countries, and also within their capabilities, to look for a solution to the nuclear issue – whether through safety improvements, or complete decommissioning. Cooperation at the European level, however, is essential. Although Europe is not threatened by giant tsunami waves, there is the threat in the 21st century of, for example, terrorist attacks, attacks by computer hackers on nuclear power plant systems and so on. From a security perspective, the extent to which power plants can counter such potential threats is very much open to question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, it does not indicate any way out of a completely new situation for energy policy as a whole. For example, points 19, 20 and 21 could have introduced new ideas and orientations in terms of integrated thinking about energy efficiency, especially efficiency with regard to energy from primary sources, of which we have the greatest reserves, especially fossil fuels. Thirdly, the radical suggestions it contains require a national referendum, which, in my country, is to take place at the initiative of the left-wing parties. Maybe such a referendum ought to be carried out at EU level. Fourthly, my country, as a result of the EU’s misguided regulations to date, has been forced to halt essential investments in coal power stations, and now the same lobby is saying that we need to halt investments in nuclear technology. So what is left? The resolution points only to energy from renewable sources. In my country, the total capacity of these resources would cover 13%, to a maximum of 20%, of essential needs. Maybe in Sweden the situation is different, as it has large reserves of hydropower, but not in Poland.

There is no such thing as zero risk in life full stop. We must do all we can to minimise that risk. For the moment, however, we do not have any credible alternatives.

Furthermore, like everyone else in the French socialist delegation, I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phasing-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. That phasing-out of nuclear power will have to go hand in hand with increased investment in research and innovation, in order to reduce our energy dependence and increase the number of renewable forms of energy in the energy mix of the EU Member States. I did, however, vote against the motion as a whole, because it was merely a juxtaposition of viewpoints forming an inconsistent motion.

Following the nuclear accident in Japan, thousands of people died and disappeared without trace. Significant material damage has also been done and the consequences will have long-term implications for people’s health. Even now, we still feel the consequences of Chernobyl, and therefore today, we must reassess our approach to nuclear safety in the EU and the rest of the world. As for improving nuclear projects, in Belarus and Kaliningrad, there are huge problems surrounding nuclear safety standards, and compliance with the appropriate obligations in international conventions, because these problems are not just a matter for the Member States that share borders with these regions, but for the whole of Europe, and EU entities and the European Commission must act together, under the subsidiarity principle. The resolution on the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the role of macro-regions in the future cohesion policy states that given the planned development of nuclear energy in the Baltic Sea region, the EU Member States must comply with the most stringent standards of safety and environmental protection, and the European Commission must monitor and check whether neighbouring countries on the EU’s external borders follow the same approach and international conventions. Nuclear power plants under construction near the EU’s external borders must comply with international nuclear safety and environmental protection standards. Today, energy efficiency and energy saving, renewable and sustainable energy, and the introduction of Europe-wide electrical energy networks, have become particularly important. Moreover, it is important to have a smart power grid able to operate by obtaining energy from decentralised energy generators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following on from warnings from the International Atomic Energy Agency on the state of now obsolete nuclear power installations, it would seem necessary to identify measures able to assess safety levels at installations. Collaboration and coordination between Member States are crucial, as crises of this type have repercussions not only for the countries in which they are built, but also on a more widespread level. The events that have taken place show that, in order to prevent disasters on this scale, Europe has to implement a series of very stringent measures in order to assess existing safety levels. The development of new nuclear power installations in Belarus and Russia requires the Commission to take action by opening up a dialogue with these countries in order to ensure the safety not only of their neighbouring countries, but of Europe as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I voted against this resolution, because apart from the bans and the moratorium on nuclear power development and the suggestion of a gradual withdrawal from nuclear energy (which is unrealistic), it does not add anything positive, and neither does it provide any solutions for the future of the energy industry in general. The situation after the tragedy in Fukushima has completely changed the philosophy of the approach to the future of energy production in Europe and Poland. In our country, the power industry, 95% of which is based on coal, has already suffered as a result of the adoption of the Climate and Energy Package. Investments undertaken in order to build two nuclear power plants have also been stopped. The resolution only stresses the importance of energy generated from renewable sources, which in Poland represents only 13%, and at most 20%, of our needs. Moreover, a referendum on the nuclear power industry, which is being suggested by the Left, is still to be held in Poland, and therefore, the conclusions drawn from this very resolution are premature.

Fukushima, in particular, has demonstrated that. It is sad that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe continue to believe in their nuclear dreams, even if, as has now been made clear by Japan and Chernobyl, they will ultimately end in nightmares.

This is why I voted against all the amendments aimed at removing nuclear energy from Europe’s energy mix. Although I did not vote for imposing a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear reactors, I felt that, if such a moratorium were imposed, it ought to be limited only to the period of the ‘stress test’ which nuclear reactors in the EU will be undergoing. This would allow the construction of new reactors to benefit from the conclusions of the stress tests, ensuring that nuclear safety will increase.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, nuclear energy accounts for 30% of Europe’s energy mix. The European Union depends, to a large extent, on Member States’ energy mix to fulfil its ‘20-20-20’ target. We cannot decide to get rid of nuclear energy without establishing what sustainable energy sources will be available which can meet the EU’s energy demand in the years ahead, at prices which citizens can afford. The EU must invest in energy efficiency measures, particularly in buildings and transport, as well as in the use of renewable energy sources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nuclear energy is now demonised and there is growing pressure demanding a complete switch from nuclear to so-called alternative sources of energy. But this school of thought is bordering on outright superstition. The nuclear reactor of Fukushima was hit by an unprecedented combination of catastrophes. This proves that nature is unpredictable and that tsunamis cannot be banned, but it does not prove that nuclear energy is at fault. Nuclear energy has a much safer record than any other source of energy. While oil arguably generates exploitation, dependence, wars and dictatorships, nuclear energy is historically much safer. Our main concern with nuclear energy should indeed be risk assessment and unitary safety procedures at a European level. With these criteria fulfilled and observed, nuclear energy could put an end or severely limit the politics of energy dependence. And while natural disasters cannot be prevented, nuclear energy is not a serious risk per se. The real danger does not come from well serviced nuclear reactors, but from nuclear reactors under the wrong political control. In other words, look at Iran, not Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nuclear power is a vital source of energy across Europe, with some Member States getting as much as 75% of their electricity from nuclear power, and a review of the safety of nuclear power plants should be a priority, including stress tests on existing plants. This should not, however, lead to closures of existing power plants where there are no safety concerns or prevent the opening of new nuclear installations to replace out-of-date plants. We need a grown-up debate on these issues to ensure that there is a balanced mix of renewable and other low carbon sources of energy to ensure that the lights stay on across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the close ties between Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as the religious tensions between the Sunnis and Alawites in Syria, should make us exercise caution because there is a huge risk that the escalation in violence will also push Syria towards civil war, with outside interference. The Hama massacre in 1982, which included 20 000 Syrians among its victims, is a tragic warning in this regard, just as are the failures in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq in terms of the way in which the West must act in a region whose very distinctive features cannot be ignored. I believe that we need more diplomacy and less armed force, more concern for defending human rights and the protection of civilians and less concern for the electoral potential of external intervention, as well as greater attention on the poverty and corruption which these societies are faced with, especially in Yemen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Syria, protests in several cities have been brutally put down despite EU calls for rights of freedom of expression and association to be respected. Finally, in Yemen, the situation is deeply worrying and has already been condemned by the EU because of the repression of demonstrators, to which we cannot be indifferent. I therefore agree with the measures proposed in this resolution, not least the condemnation of those responsible for massacres in these countries, and hope that they have an effect in as short a time as possible so that the humiliation of their people can stop.

The political background in Syria and Yemen has been, for a long time, authoritarian or outright dictatorial. Yet this is not making the opposition a fully democratic alternative. Especially in Yemen, a lawless, fragmented polity, the forces gathering under the opposition umbrella are hosting or could give way to terrorist or radical anti-democratic forces. In the past, ‘stability’ in the foreign policy for the Middle East was a substitute for inaction or the status quo. It was certainly an overrated concept. Now it could become underrated. The European and largely the democratic interest would be better served by a rational, non-emotional approach. The need for democracy in countries with a long record of political oppression should not become the undoing of future democratic process. This does not mean that the Assad or Saleh regimes should be propped up, but it means that the solution should be a negotiated exit strategy rather than a violent and uncontrolled regime change. Caution and clear headed policies are much more appropriate in countries and regions that could turn from one system of oppression to another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I thought that that was really the intention of the European institutions, it would have my full support. The key element of this resolution is the call for ‘the suspension of further negotiations over the signing of the still pending Association Agreement between the EU and Syria’ and the fact that ‘the conclusion of such an agreement should depend on the capacity of the Syrian authorities to carry out the expected democratic reforms in tangible form’. Point duly noted. However, I have to point out, and the resolution itself admits it, that ‘the signing of this Agreement has been delayed at Syria’s request since October 2009’. One can only wonder, then, what impact this declaration will really have. I therefore abstained on this text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Admittedly, the situation is different in each of the countries, but ultimately, these popular movements are the expression of an unshakeable desire for democracy, freedom and justice. The European Union must not allow people’s legitimate and peacefully expressed demands to be repressed through the use of violence, which unfortunately appears to be the only response of regimes with their backs against the wall. Europe must express itself firmly, in particular, through the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, so as to confirm its support for the public demonstrations, which are calling for the fundamental values that are promoted and defended by the Union to be respected in those countries. Our Parliament, which is regarded as a temple of democracy, must reiterate its solidarity with these peoples and must support them in their democratic transition process. It is therefore essential for us to review our relations with the countries of North Africa, the Near East and the Middle East so that, together, we can successfully build an area of stability, peace and prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although notable progress has been recorded in some countries and regions, the goal of halving the level of poverty in the world is still far from being achieved. Eleven million children still die every year from treatable diseases, the greater part of them before the age of five; one person in four has no access to drinking water; 114 million children still have no access to primary education; approximately 600 million women are still illiterate; and just as many people have no access to progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure to achieve the goals established in 2001 will not discourage the industrialised nations, which, on the contrary, will continue to ensure that countries that need aid are at the top of the international agenda, promoting the supply of new targeted sources of finance and the creation of cooperation programmes.

I would therefore congratulate the Cape Verdean people, their government and their parties on this, as they have been able to take action in a responsible and respectable manner: this Portuguese-speaking country is today an example to be followed by the LDCs. Despite limitations on trade and problems with training and access to information, to resources and to units of production, it cannot be emphasised enough that the underdevelopment of the LDCs results mainly from their decision makers’ lack of skill and their institutions’ inefficiency, as their people are so capable in other respects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the EU’s attempt to participate actively at the top-level UN conference, and I expect concrete commitments from this. During the past 10 years, the poorest countries have recorded greater progress than in the previous decade. Despite this, however, many problems persist: increasing dependence on imported goods, poverty, the low level of human capital and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. These problems must be resolved from all sides, but two points are particularly important. First, these countries have to get investment flowing into the productive sectors of the economy. Secondly, it is necessary to help build democratic structures in these countries, enabling them to decide independently on strategic priorities without foreign interference. Commodity market fluctuations and the consequences arising from these are a specific issue that must be resolved. From the long-term perspective, the answer is to diversify the economy. From the short-term and medium-term perspective, it is important to control price shocks, especially in the area of foodstuffs. With regard to the position of the EU, it is important to focus on coherent external policies. The Commission document of 16 February is exhaustive, but it must take a more critical approach. We need to acknowledge that not all EU activities in the area of trade or direct foreign investments are in line with development policy. In my opinion, they should be subordinated to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The category of LDC was created by the UN General Assembly in the early 1970s, which was more than 40 years ago. Since then, the number of LDCs has increased twofold, and only three (Botswana, Maldives and Cape Verde) have been able to graduate from the group. This shows that poverty is spreading, and the effectiveness of activities undertaken so far is barely perceptible. The critical situation has been exacerbated further by the economic crisis. Its effects have affected LDCs to a large extent and caused a further deepening of the problems occurring there. These arise, in particular, from debt, high food and fuel prices and climate change. I therefore supported the resolution on the Fourth United Nations conference on LDCs with full conviction and awareness of its importance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for a deep, comprehensive analysis and diagnosis of the situation of LDCs and concrete proposals for solutions aimed at improving the living conditions of the citizens of these countries in the short term, and at leaving the group in the long term. As a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would like to draw particular attention to the lack of control mechanisms for work which has been undertaken.

An inexorable gap is opening up between the least developed countries and the world economy, creating a vicious circle in which the victims are the populations. We are all responsible for the delays in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which makes coordinated action by the EU and the UN a matter of urgency. The priority areas are well known: food security, access to water and healthcare, and literacy. The solutions are also well known, but I regret that the statements of good intentions are rarely translated into action. And yet it is by working towards a better distribution of wealth, supporting LDCs on the path to growth and democracy, and combating the frenzied speculation on commodity prices, that these extremely vulnerable countries will be able to escape the vicious circle of poverty.

<p class="contents">First of all, Iceland has a long tradition of democracy. The protection of human rights and cooperation with leading international organisations are top-priority items on Iceland’s political agenda. On the economic front, the authorities have already devised a pre-accession strategy to ensure the diversification of their business sectors and their exit from the recession. I think that Iceland is capable of assuming the obligations which derive from being an EU Member State. I should mention that at present, the conditions have been met for 10 negotiating chapters.

In the rush to enlargement, I fear that this Parliament and the EU institutions are ignoring issues of strategic importance to Member States. It is very regrettable that, yet again, Iceland and the Faroe Islands have massively inflated their proposed catches of mackerel in 2011, endangering the stock and endangering the viability of our pelagic fishing industry. This outrageous behaviour exposes the lie that Iceland is at the forefront of sustainable fisheries management. Last summer, in response to Iceland’s intransigent stance on this matter, we were told that the Commission was considering suspending negotiations about Iceland’s accession to the EU, yet little seems to have happened on this front. Iceland’s membership of the ‘EU Club’ cannot and must not be taken forward while Iceland blatantly ignores the rules of that club.

A lack of dialogue between the government and opposition parties in the country is preventing an agreement on the implementation of structural reforms from being reached.

Good neighbourly relations are essential during the process of transition to EU Member State status. This is why the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece must find a solution to the issue about what to call the state. So far, Greece has proved itself to be a trustworthy discussion partner with regard to the other chapters.

The process of EU enlargement is a powerful tool for peace, stability and reconciliation in this region. I am particularly concerned about the persistently high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people, a problem that is shared by many countries in the region. I would like to call upon the government to rapidly implement more effective measures to improve public investment focused on employment policies and the use of the workforce in good quality, stable and decent jobs. I am, however, pleased with the recent adoption of the Energy Act, which is aimed at liberalising the country’s electricity market and is in accordance with the relevant European directives. I welcome the adoption of the national strategy for sustainable development, but more efforts need to be made towards enforcing legislation in the environmental field, and there needs to be adequate funding set aside for this purpose. I would like to call for closer cooperation on transnational environmental issues based on EU standards, particularly in the area of water quality, waste management and the protection of nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2008, the principles, priorities and conditions for accession were set out, and these are being monitored by the Commission.

The current political situation, which includes the boycott of the national parliament by opposition parties, may adversely affect the country’s priorities with regard to the EU. The interested parties have to resolve bilateral issues in a spirit of good neighbourliness.

Bilateral issues need to be resolved by the parties concerned in a good neighbourly spirit and taking overall EU interests into account. All the key players and parties concerned should step up their efforts and demonstrate responsibility and determination to solve all outstanding issues which are not only hindering the accession process of the candidate country, and the EU’s own policy in the region, but could also have repercussions on inter-ethnic relations, regional stability and economic development. The document urges the authorities responsible to strengthen the independence and freedom of the media, applying equal standards to all of them and improving the transparency of their ownership.

Macedonia has made significant progress in the democratisation of the state, due directly to the political will to become a full member of the family of European nations. The European Commission has evaluated this progress and, for the second year running now, has called upon the European Council to open accession negotiations with Macedonia. Also for the second year running, the Council has not taken this decision. This gives rise to the impression that one of the unfounded obstacles to the opening of these negotiations are mutual bones of contention, including relations with Greece. These disputes must not block the accession process for Macedonia, all the more so since continuing the accession process would promote stability and strengthen yet further the dialogue between the ethnic communities in Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Macedonia has a great deal to do yet in order to reform governmental and judicial institutions, successfully combat organised crime and corruption, and develop democratic dialogues in society. Of course, the acceptance of any new Member State, Macedonia included, into the EU will only take place when all the requirements have been satisfied, and only with the unambiguous agreement of the EU institutions and EU Member States. That is precisely why it is important to begin the accession negotiation process, which, I am convinced, will encourage positive changes in Macedonia and the region as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The status of reforms since 2001 can be judged positively in many respects. Where the judiciary is concerned, legal provisions have been passed to ensure both independence from political pressure and efficiency. The improvements to the transparency of the court system, particularly as regards dealing with the backlog of cases in most courts, are also to be welcomed. The country can already be seen to be making progress towards the transition to a functioning market economy, although there is still a long way to go. Only the dispute with Greece over its name is blocking Macedonia’s accession to the EU, and it is to be hoped that this can be resolved in the near future. However, I abstained from voting because some aspects of the report are very unbalanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This must be traced back, primarily, to a series of problems within the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in particular, as regards the opposition parties’ boycott of the national parliament. This and other problems, such as the presence of free and independent media, deemed necessary for the development of a stable democracy, must be cleared up as soon as possible so that both parties can set out once more on the road to enlargement of the EU to the East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to UN sources, hundreds of lives have been lost in Côte d’Ivoire since December 2010 and the actual number of casualties is likely to be much higher, as the violence taking place in the interior of the country is not always reported in the press. Attacks are being intentionally directed against UN peacekeepers and institutions. I agree with the need for swift international political action to address the humanitarian situation in Côte d’Ivoire and prevent a new migration crisis in the region. The Commission and the Member States must coordinate their efforts with other international donors in order to respond to the urgent needs of the population of Côte d’Ivoire and its neighbouring countries. I support the sanctions, comprising a visa ban and an asset freeze, imposed by the United Nations Security Council, the African Union and the Council of the European Union on all persons and entities that oppose the legitimate President’s authority, and the fact that these sanctions are to remain in place until the return of legitimate authorities to power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has adopted several resolutions on the political situation in this country, especially on 16 December 2010. Other EU and international institutions, such as the UN Security Council and the Authority of Heads of States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), have condemned the violation of human rights in this country following the non-acceptance of the election results, which were certified by the UN, by the deposed President, Mr Gbagbo, which has led to a wave of violence in the country, resulting in hundreds of deaths and about a million refugees.

All diplomatic efforts to devise a peaceful solution to the post-election political deadlock, including those of the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States and the President of South Africa, have been unsuccessful. Since mid-February, fighting has intensified both in the capital and in the west of the country, with alarming reports indicating the increasing use of heavy artillery against civilians. Atrocities have been committed in Côte d’Ivoire, including cases of sexual violence, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions and the excessive and indiscriminate use of force against civilians, which amount to crimes against humanity. Parliament therefore calls on President Ouattara to facilitate peace and national reconciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ending the conflict by diplomatic means would have been preferable, but the level of violence reached in Abidjan and the hard-line, self-destructive attitude of the deposed President demanded UN intervention in order to protect the civilians and to help the legitimate President, Alassane Ouattara, assume power. This resolution therefore supports the intervention of French forces under UN control, which helps to enforce the law and the election result, and to protect the lives of civilians and European nationals. When the rule of law has been re-established, the legitimate Ivorian authorities, with the support of the international community, will have to ensure that the losing candidate in Côte d’Ivoire’s recent presidential elections, Laurent Gbagbo, together with all the officials suspected of human rights violations, are tried for their actions. Lastly, I believe the EU must continue to honour its commitment to provide long-term support to Côte d’Ivoire in order to aid national reconciliation and to help rebuild and stabilise the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Besides what I have already said about the resolution on the Southern Dimension, for which I was the rapporteur, I would like to stress the need for both ENP dimensions to favour a ‘bottom-up’ approach in the future, and to emphasise that only greater involvement by local communities and civil society will ensure maximum effectiveness in the implementation of the ENP by the EU. I also hope that the EU will not favour short-term stability at the expense of the best interests and constant defence of the public, and their individual and collective freedom, with a particular focus on women’s rights, as I stated in my speech. Although I am immensely pleased with the results obtained in these two reports, I do rather regret the fact that Parliament and the Commission have not made the most of this opportunity, for once, to differentiate the countries of the ENP to the east from the countries that will potentially become our EU southern ENP partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Eastern Partnership has been launched as a political framework for the advancement of the Eastern Dimension of the ENP, which seeks to deepen and strengthen the relations between the EU and its eastern neighbours, furthering political association, economic integration and legislative approximation, while supporting political and socio-economic reforms in the partner countries. I would like to stress that economic reforms must go hand in hand with political reforms and that good governance can only be achieved through an open and transparent decision-making process based on democratic institutions.

I think that significant administrative capacity is required to be able to tackle such diverse problems. Apart from the demographic challenges, climate change, economic competitiveness and quality of life, the regions which share borders with non-Member States have to deal with a series of consequences resulting from problems which are not being resolved properly. This is the case with the way in which natural disasters are managed, for instance. Interventions in emergency situations are extremely difficult if the neighbouring countries do not have the capacity to respond, and no region can respond to the whole situation on its own. This is why I have proposed that the regions located at the EU border, which have borders with at least two non-EU states, should be regarded as ‘platform’ regions and supported accordingly. The neighbourhood policy needs to take into account the capacity of the regions located within the EU, but which have external borders, to tackle the problems which are much more complex. Commensurate financial support must be provided for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The partnership with our Eastern neighbours represents a political framework of great importance for Europe’s wellbeing, and its work platform is focused on four themes: democracy, good governance, economic integration and convergence with European policies. Unfortunately, at this time, the conflicts that have arisen in these countries are seriously undermining their economic, social and political development, and constitute a serious obstacle to cooperation and regional security, as shown by the recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.

These events have demonstrated the inadequacy of the existing EU involvement in the neighbourhood. The paradigm shift proposed by the European Parliament from ‘stability first’ to ‘democratisation and human rights first’ in EU policy is necessary. There should be no more pretending that the political status quo, i.e. maintaining authoritarian regimes, is better for Europe and its security. The time has come for solidarity with our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the differences, most countries in the neighbourhood share common characteristics: limited freedom, or no freedom at all, and a lack of success in modernisation. The allocation of additional, generous funds in order to build a stable EU neighbourhood seems unavoidable. The ENP should therefore continue to be founded on the principle of conditionality, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and should be extended by the pursuit of institutional integration, liberalisation of the visa regime, opening up the European market and support for civil society. It is worth recalling again the position of Poland, the advocate of the EU’s successive enlargements, which urged the Member States two years ago, in partnership with Sweden, to strengthen the Eastern Dimension of the ENP in the form of the Eastern Partnership initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of current events, Poland’s role takes on a symbolic meaning. Poland, which has historical experience in transformation of its political-economic system, may serve as a good guide and model for both eastern and southern EU neighbours in the current policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s goals are very broad and are based on an extension to neighbouring countries in order to create a large area for the free movement of people and goods. In these circumstances, the EU’s European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has a vital role in its strategy for development and growth. Several instruments and resolutions have been adopted to this end, particularly the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the crucial choices of the common foreign and security policy. However, the review of the ENP now has a greater importance in the context of the events in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. The EU should draw lessons from the events in the south, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt, and revise its democracy and human rights support policy so as to create an implementation mechanism for the human rights clauses in all agreements with third countries. The revision of the ENP should give priority to criteria relating to the independence of the judiciary, respect for basic freedoms, pluralism and freedom of the press, and the fight against corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe’s new strategy must be based on a redefinition of the resources available for the Mediterranean, provide for an increase in financial commitments to facilitate political, economic and social reform in the countries of the region, and press for resources relating to immigration. Moreover, as regards the radical changes affecting our southern neighbours, I believe that the moment has come to adopt a new European approach with the aim not only of defending democracy but also of taking concrete measures to alleviate migratory pressures and to guarantee the security of energy supply. In this context, it is essential to lay the foundations, as soon as possible, for a new and strengthened partnership with our neighbouring countries to the south: a partnership aimed at promoting the stability, economic development and democratic transition of the area.

Several options are already open to us when it comes to providing long-term support for the democratic transition, economic development and regional integration of our southern neighbours. The EU has two tools at its disposal: the Union for the Mediterranean and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. Both have shown their weaknesses, but a genuine political commitment could rectify our mistakes. I therefore support this resolution, which provides a clear framework and specific objectives for the next European Neighbourhood Policy. I would, however, draw my fellow Members’ attention to the cross-border dimension of this policy. Accounting as it does for a mere 5% of the ENPI’s total budget, it is overlooked by central government and its programming is subject to alarming delays. However, this dimension may act as a catalyst for many structural initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean. Establishing a genuine EU-Mediterranean partnership means not only taking the aspirations of the peoples into greater account, but also providing real investment in concrete projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The creation of an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness based on EU values should continue to be the basis for relations with ENP partner countries – in this particular case, with the Mediterranean countries. In the first place, I believe that it is essential to review the indicative programmes for 2011-2013, taking into account the most urgent needs and, at the same time, making the financial instruments, in particular, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the European initiative for democracy and human rights (EIDHR), more flexible in order to provide direct support to civil society organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to call for the Union for the Mediterranean to be strengthened both in terms of funding and in terms of commitment by the Member States, as a favoured forum for the exchange of best practice, where a clear Mediterranean policy should be established, based on partnership policy, the principle of ‘ownership’ and conditionality. Lastly, I believe that solutions urgently need to be found to bring an end to the war in Libya, and also to prepare a package of measures for rebuilding the country after the conflict has ended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I stressed the need to review the European Neighbourhood Policy in the light of the events in the Arab world, by stepping up dialogue with civil society, encouraging the exchange of good practice, guaranteeing respect for human rights in our association agreements and supporting the democratic transition process in those countries. The ENP offers us a wonderful opportunity to promote our values and to strengthen our relations with the countries on Europe’s doorstep. For that reason, I hope that our partnership with our neighbours in the Southern Mediterranean will become a priority of our foreign policy.

<p class="contents">It goes further than that, however: no one has the right to violate the dignity of women merely because they have the courage to demand the right to express their thoughts, actively participating in the construction of a peaceful and democratic world and demanding, above all, the right to gender equality. Inflicting inhumane and degrading treatment, such as electric shocks, ‘virginity tests’, physical and psychological violence, rape and slavery, is an unacceptable practice to which we must say ‘Enough’.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the events in these North African countries are concerned, it is only right that the people responsible for these serious violations be punished, as in any other conflict in the world, because we are dealing here not just with civilians but, what is more reprehensible still, also with soldiers.

In view of this, the use of sexual violence in any conflict has given rise to the strongest renunciation and condemnation by these organisations. Indeed, many resolutions have been adopted by Parliament denouncing violence against women. This joint motion for a resolution focuses on this violence, in particular, sexual violence, perpetrated against women in North Africa and the Middle East. The reports of violence in the context of war and repression that have reached us are utterly gruesome and have caused great disgust and indignation. The perpetrators of such behaviour cannot go unpunished, even when protected by dictators or under the pretext of backward mentalities. I am therefore voting in favour of this report, which condemns any kind of violence against women in any region, calls for severe penalties for the perpetrators, and establishes EU support for the process of empowering women as a priority, especially those who have had the courage to participate in the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, and encouraging their full participation in civic life in the countries where they live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has long been known that rape and torture are frequent occurrences. The situation is no different in Libya and Egypt, according to reports from foreign journalists concerned. In Egypt, female demonstrators were arrested and subjected to virginity tests, which were also documented. In Libya, soldiers carried out rapes and torture. A further aggravating factor is that the women who told their stories must now expect severe reprisals, such as being accused of defamation. Once again, a severe abuse of human rights is taking place here about which something should be done, including by the Western powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted in favour of the resolution because the EU must not close its eyes to these atrocities either and it is only right to demand of the governments in Egypt and Libya that these cases are investigated without exception and the perpetrators held accountable, in order that the countries may continue along the path towards democracy and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the regimes in power in Libya and Egypt have resorted as ever to sexual assault as a weapon with which to target women. We must denounce the use of sexual violence as an instrument for intimidating and humiliating women, without forgetting that the power vacuum that has now emerged could lead to a deterioration in their rights. One significant case is that of a Libyan woman who, in March, told some journalists in a Tripoli hotel that she had been a victim of gang rape by soldiers. Today, that young woman has been sued for defamation by the same men who raped her. We must act by strongly denouncing the disproportionate impact of armed conflicts on women and enhancing their peace building role.

Mass sexual violence against women is a permanent part of armed conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) gives, among others, the example of Kenya, a relatively stable country, in which pre-election riots led to a doubling of the number of victims of sexual violence in a matter of days.</p>
<p class="contents">Sexual violence is becoming an epidemic. In fact, it has become one of the tactics of war. The European Union must not remain neutral on this issue. It is therefore essential to include gender mainstreaming in the mainstream of European Neighbourhood Policy and in the centre of our efforts towards creating an effective and structured approach to gender equality in the countries covered by the policy. Human rights, an inseparable element of which is the equality of men and women, should constitute an essential element of democratic processes in third countries. It is shocking that despite the prevalence of sexual violence in Africa, governments do not include fighting it among their priorities, as we can see, for example, in the case of South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should focus its efforts specifically on women. The proposals included in the resolution for the enhanced social integration of women, the promotion of their employment, the fight against illiteracy among women and traditional harmful practices are very important. Education for women and girls must include knowledge of the rights to which they are entitled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women played a leading, silent, underestimated even, role in the liberation movements, and I think it was essential to pay tribute to it in this text.

The European Investment Bank plays a critical role in supporting SMEs, particularly during this financial crisis and economic downturn. Given the huge importance of SMEs to the European economy, it was agreed that from 2008 to 2011, SMEs should receive loans totalling over EUR 30 billion. The European Progress Microfinance Facility was set up in March 2010 with some EUR 200 million in funding from the Commission and the Bank. However, SMEs still face difficulties trying to obtain credit. As stated in the Bank Watch report, SMEs, particularly those in Central and Eastern European Member States, are unable to take advantage of the assistance intended for them. The EIB must lay down clear financing conditions and more strict lending effectiveness criteria for its financial intermediaries providing loans. National financial intermediaries were given a period of two years to provide loans, but as the report states, some financial intermediaries granted only a small portion of the loans or did not grant any at all, although the financial resources were in their accounts. Furthermore, the EIB’s website still lacks publicly available data regarding the use and beneficiaries of allocated funding. I believe that the EIB must enhance transparency in its lending through financial intermediaries and report annually on its lending to SMEs, including an evaluation of the accessibility and effectiveness of this and lists of loan beneficiaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe that the commitment to the idea of project bonds, which is aimed at enhancing the credit rating of bonds issued by companies themselves, and where these bonds are used to finance European transport, energy and IT infrastructures, is a positive step. At this point, it is desirable that both the Commission and the EIB should submit concrete proposals for project bonds. It is also worth highlighting the important work that the EIB may carry out under the EU 2020 strategy, by simplifying procedures and maximising multiplier factors in order to attract public and private sector investors. With regard to EIB financing outside the EU, I believe that a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the EIB, the EBRD and the Commission is desirable, so as to strengthen cooperation in all the countries where they operate, with the dual aim of making their lending policies both consistent with one another and consistent with the EU’s political objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The submitted report takes a positive view of the fact that the EIB acted correctly in supporting SMEs in the EU during the crisis. It is true that the bank formally committed EUR 30 billion over a four-year period to supporting SMEs. However, the problem is that not all of the money even reached the SMEs. In specific terms, only about half of the funds committed reached SMEs in the V4 region in the first period. The EIB gave banks an inexplicably long period of two years to distribute the funds, and also failed to stipulate any sanctions against banks in the event that this deadline was not met. The banks of Central Europe, hard hit by the crisis, were only too pleased to ‘hold on to’ these funds. What was billed as support for SMEs therefore became, in reality, support for the Central European branches of foreign banks. There is reason enough to think that this was not by accident, but by design.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude briefly – the EIB is also having problems in the area of development. It needs to take on more employees specialised in development. The EIB is currently under-staffed, despite its impact on so-called developing countries. I also agree with the rapporteur that the EIB must make strict changes to its funding via intermediaries, as this may end up in tax havens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EIB is playing a decisive role in fighting the crisis. For me, however, the issues of transparency and measurable results remain doubtful. The EIB’s activity focuses on the three areas where the crisis hit hardest: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), convergence regions and climate action. SMEs play a key role in the recovery of the European economy and the fight against unemployment, and therefore it would be expedient to make it easier for them to access the capital required for developments. In this respect, it would be useful if we could see an assessment of the accessibility and effectiveness of the loans in question every year, which would ensure the transparency of the final purpose of the loans and improve the administrative process. Also in this respect, I believe it is vitally important that the EIB updates and tightens its policy on offshore financial centres.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB plays a very important role in enhancing the European Union’s convergence, and due to the technical aid and cofinancing offered by it, the regions under the convergence objectives are able to use an ever larger proportion of the funds available to them. For this reason, I believe that further increasing this role is practical and to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I suggest that the proposal that transparent regulatory supervision should be introduced in the interests of the quality of the EIB’s financial situation, the precise measurement of its results, and compliance with effective and successful business practice, deserves consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It recommends considering the suggestion that prudential regulatory supervision should be introduced concerning the quality of the EIB’s financial situation, the precise measurement of its results and compliance with the rules of sound business practice. It also welcomes the idea of project bonds, aimed at enhancing the credit rating of bonds issued by companies themselves within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy and which are used to finance European transport, energy and IT infrastructures and the greening of the economy. Such project bond issuance would impact positively on the availability of capital for growth- and job-enhancing sustainable investments complementing national and Cohesion Fund investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
